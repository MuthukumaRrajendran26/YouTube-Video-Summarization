we're looking at sites across the state

to find existing facilities that could

expeditiously be turned into health care

facilities and again when I said the

federal response is very welcome I want

to thank the president he said that he

would bring the Army Corps of Engineers

here they came here the next day I spoke

to him last night to follow up on the

meeting so this is going forward

aggressively we're also going to take a

bold action but a necessary action that

offering 90-day relief on mortgage

payments waiving mortgage payments based

on financial hardship meaning if you are

not working if you're working on in

part-time we're going to have the banks

and financial institutions waive

mortgage payments for 90 days that will

be a real life economic benefit there

will also be a stress reliever for many

families waiving these payments will not

have a negative effect on your credit

report there'll be a grace period for

loan modification we're not exempting

people from the mortgage payments we're

just adjusting the mortgage to include

those payments on the back end no late

fees or online payment fees postponing

or suspending any foreclosures during

this period of time and waiving fees for

overdrafts ATM credit cards this is a

real life benefit people are on the

tremendous economic pressure making a

mortgage payment can be one of the

number-one stressors eliminating that

stressor for 90 days I think will go a

long way again we'll reassess as the

situation goes on if that should be

extended or not number of positive cases

total positive 4000 number of new

positive 1769

you see additional counties that are

being added to counties that have cases

the spread mirrors what's happening in

the country just as the spread has gone

through all states the spread is going

through our counties was downstate first

it's now moving upstate New York now has

2,000 cases

Washington State 1,100 cases Washington

State had cases earlier because it went

through a nursing home if you remember

but New York State has more cases than

Washington State more more cases than

any state in the nation and I've made

that point to the federal government and

the president he understands that if

there's a state that needs help

the state by the number of cases is New

York in terms of testing we have tested

now 22,000 we tested 7500 people last

night why are you seeing the numbers go

up because you are taking more tests

people see those numbers go up they get

nervous they panic or look at how many

more people have the virus

that's not how many more people have the

virus you're just taking more tests so

you're finding more positives there are

thousands and thousands of people who

have the virus who we're not testing

there are thousands and thousands of

people who had the virus before we

started testing

there are thousands and thousands of

people who had the virus and who

resolved and never knew they had the

virus we're still testing because you

want to find those positive cases so you

can track them down isolate people and

stop the spread but you can't watch

these numbers like the stock market and

say well that's the indicator of of

anything other than the indicator of how

many tests were taking it is good news

that we're now up to 7500

tests we were at one time doing 200

tests per day just to put that 7,500 in

focus so that's a tremendous increase in

the number of tests and you want to see

the numbers go up the hospitalization

rate is very relevant because remember

this is all about the flow into the

healthcare system so 777 out of 4152

perspective perspective perspective we

know the virus we know what it does we

know who it hurts we know who defects

Johns Hopkins since day one has tracked

this virus through China 222 thousand

cases 9,000 deaths eighty four thousand

recoveries 129,000 pending one last

point we talk about this as a government

response the federal government's doing

this state government is doing this

government government government this

this manifests on a number of levels and

the government response is obviously

very important but the impact I think is

greater greater and probably greatest as

a social phenomenon and on people and on

families this is tremendously disruptive

on all sorts of levels it came out of

the blue for me in New York it reminds

me of 9/11 where one moment which was

inconceivable just changed everything

changed your perspective on the world

change your perspective on safety

children who were young at that time but

of school age watched on TV they didn't

know if their parents were coming home I

think it changed their whole outlook on

life after 9/11 this is a situation like

that

it's obviously totally different

magnitude but it's like that it's a

moment that just changes your whole life

yesterday you were going to work and you

were gonna go to the office party today

you're at home and the kids are at home

and you're worried about health and you

worried about your job and you're

worried about economics and you're

dealing with personal issues and you're

dealing with family issues and it's all

happening at once and then you turn on

the TV and there's all this different

information and nobody can tell you if

this is gonna be 30 days or 60 days or

four months or five months or nine

months the stress the emotion is just

incredible and rightfully so it is a

situation that is one of the most

disruptive that I have seen and it will

change almost everything going forward

it will that is a fact it's not your

perception it's not just you it's all of

us and it's true and it's real nobody

can tell you when this is going to end

nobody can tell you I talked to all the

experts nobody can say two months four

months nine months nobody it's hard

living your life with that big a

question mark out there nobody can tell

you when you go back to work people can

tell you that it's not just you

economically it's everyone take comfort

in that federal government is actually

acting on an economic package but it's

true

having your family all together is a

beautiful thing it's also different for

a lot of people especially for a

prolonged period of time so these are

major shifts in

life and in the most emotional stressful

conditions that you can imagine and I

think my own personal advice is

understand that for what it is and that

it's not just you it has changed

everything and it will for the for the

foreseeable future and think through how

you're going to deal with it and what it

means and even try to find a positive in

it right it's a very negative

circumstance but you're going to have

time on your hands you're gonna have

time with your family you're gonna have

time at home in this busy hurry up world

all of a sudden somebody said okay you

have a couple of months where you're

gonna be home with the family no work

you work from home but it's a totally

different situation how do you use that

how do you adjust it's not gonna be done

overnight but it is something that

everybody has to think through
