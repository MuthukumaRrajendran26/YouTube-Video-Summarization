in a close race every riding counts

that's why Andrew Scheer went to twirl

Riviere he feels they have a shot at a

seat once held by the Conservatives in

the Mulrooney government we are going to

win seats that we haven't held in a long

time Justin Trudeau has also been here

already his dad was the last liberal to

win Quadra Pierre overall liberals tend

to win government when they win Quebec

one weekend the two leading parties are

locked in what looks like a long ground

war where every competitive riding

matters with little movement in the

polls far different from the roller

coaster polling in the last campaign in

2015 we saw a tremendous amount of

movement this time around it seems like

you've got a couple of you know pickup

trucks in a mud puddle spinning their

tires kicking mud at each other and not

going anywhere the dead heat nationally

isn't quite what it seems in a nation

divided if so shows the Conservatives

with the best poll numbers in the four

western provinces the Liberals lead in

the East though narrowly in Atlantic

Canada but there are more than twice as

many seats east of Manitoba than west of

Ontario in fact Ontario has 121 more

than the 104 seats among the four

western provinces combined so Ontario is

crucial it's no coincidence that Justin

Trudeau and Andrew Shearer and even jug

meat sing each went to Mississauga in

the first five days the seats around

Toronto are numerous and competitive

we're going to be all over the province

of Ontario somebody's either gonna have

to break out now Ontario and especially

the commuting belt around the City of

Toronto is going to be critically

important to the outcome of this

election in a country with 338 ridings

too vast for the leaders to go

everywhere some regions and some ridings

can still expect a lot of attention
