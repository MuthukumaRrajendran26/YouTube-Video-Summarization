[Applause]

good morning everyone merci beaucoup

death Khaleesi thank you very much for

joining me here this morning we are only

two days away from Canadians finally

having their say on Justin Trudeau's

last four years as Prime Minister

don't signal visual they cut in the

input hall all thanks to potency so they

danyetta thrown these names widow come

creaminess four years of higher taxes of

broken promises of failed policies of

ethical scandals four years of failure

after failure after failure now I've

spent the last 38 days traveling this

great country making the case for a

conservative majority government a

government with a plan that will help

you get ahead we're going to scrap the

Trudeau carbon tax which will lower the

cost of everyday essentials like gas

groceries and home heating we're gonna

take the GST off home heating costs

we're going to introduce the universal

tax cut saving a family with average

salaries 850 dollars we're going to

introduce tax credits for parents who

put their children in sports math

language or arts programs take public

transit or invest in green renovations

for their home we're going to make

maternity benefits tax-free putting up

to $4,000 back in the pockets of new

parents we're going to increase the Aged

credit helping a senior couple save an

extra three hundred dollars per year and

boost the government matching

contribution to our ESPs by 50 percent

to help more parents save for their kids

education now to do it I will put an end

to taxpayer handouts to rich

corporations and stop sending foreign

aid to wealthy countries that don't need

it or hostile regimes that don't deserve

it over the last week I've outlined my

100 day action plan the steps a new

conservative governor

we'll take right away to put more money

in the pockets of Canadians

I will task former BC Finance Minister

Kevin Falcon and former Via Rail CEO

Yves deja de Siciliano with identifying

1.5 billion dollars in corporate welfare

savings so we can put that money back in

your pockets within 45 days of forming

government my finance minister will

table the get ahead fiscal update which

will lower taxes for Canadians before

the end of the year I'll also convene a

meeting of Canada's premiers and on in

Ottawa on January 6 2020 to begin

breaking down interprovincial trade

barriers to usher in a new era of

national unity and cooperation I'll also

bring in stiff new penalties for up to

$20,000 for politicians who violate the

conflict of interests act as Justin

Trudeau has done twice and I will repeal

Justin Trudeau's carbon tax take the GST

off home heating bills starting January

eliminate aps to the chauffeur's versus

achievable its responsible and most

importantly we'll start working on it

right away

now compare that to Justin Trudeau who

is openly talking

about forming a coalition government

with the NDP instead of getting down to

work and instead of making your life

more affordable Trudeau would spend his

first 100 days in backroom negotiations

with the NDP dealing away your

hard-earned tax dollars so he can remain

Prime Minister now let me be blunt a

Trudeau led government with the NDP

calling the shots would be the worst

possible outcome for Canadians it would

be a costly coalition that Canadians

cannot afford and to see what Canada

might look like under a Trudeau NDP

coalition we need only to look at the

last time we had a Trudeau NDP coalition

between 1972 and 1974 when Pierre

Elliott Trudeau and the NDP cut a deal

deficits climbed income taxes soared 40%

and other taxes and fees by more than 60

percent by the end of the 1970s the

Trudeau NDP coalition Canada's economy

was spiraling down and debt and deficits

were out of control

Canadians cannot afford another Trudeau

NDP coalition not now out of time when

everything is already getting more and

more expensive and when so many

Canadians are barely making it to the

end of the month without the money

running out now we already know that a

Justin Trudeau led government with the

NDP calling the shots would run a forty

billion dollar deficit in year one I

don't just take my word for it that's

right out of their platforms and it's

all right there for Canadians to see

it's a costly coalition Canadians cannot

afford Justin Trudeau has made it clear

he will pay any price to stay in power

and he will use your money to pay it

today until oh I declare give up a name

port Capri por este opa VAR a in value

to these a vataj all pull a TV and so

the choice is clear an NDP government

wearing a Justin Trudeau mask that will

raise taxes kill jobs damage our economy

and take more money out of your pockets

or a conservative majority government

that will live within its means and put

more money in your pockets so you can

get ahead the schwa DeVoe naked in da

Eclair and give it a Monday the end

payday keep Orton masks did you think

eliminate these unemployed new year al

economy it pronto blue - wrong the

- oh and go tomorrow government

conservative majority give Aviva salon

semi-metal plea - John Donvan fash for

coop we see a on a warpless they might

now four years ago Justin Trudeau made a

lot of promises to get elected

he promised to balance the budget and

then buried our children and

grandchildren under billions of new debt

he promised to fight for the middle

class but then increased taxes on 80

percent of us he promised to do politics

differently but now he's prepared to

sell Keynes out in a coalition with the

NDP time and time again Trudeau has

proven that he is simply not as

advertised and here in the GTA more and

more people are coming to that

conclusion it's the same conclusion that

Leona Alice lab came to a little more

than a year ago in 2015 Leona ran for

Justin Trudeau as a liberal she believed

him when he said he would be different

that he would stand up for the middle

class that he would balance the budget

like he said he would and that he would

be open and transparent like he said he

would and like many liberals here in the

gthe one but as it turned out Justin

Trudeau wasn't who he claimed to be like

every liberal here in the GTA

Leona had a front row seat to watch

Trudeau break his word break the bank

and break the law but unlike every other

GTA liberal Leona took a stand she

refused to stand by behind it Justin

Trudeau and she saw in the Conservative

Party a real voice for her constituents

in Aurora Oak Ridges Richmond Hill who

work hard who care for their families

who are fighting to get ahead and who

just want the government to get out of

their way and so she joined our team and

on Monday we are going to elect a whole

bunch of new Conservative MPs from the

GTA to join her in a new Conservative

government and so as this campaign draws

to a close and as Canadians make their

final decision I say this rendezvous at

a million the kennedy and asia they say

they devote a conservator paschal vote

for mayor future corn peony ooh

Oakland ambition Oakland objectiveness

on all deporte

it'll converge any impossibly a fairly

they join the millions of Canadians who

are already voting conservative because

they're voting for a brighter future

a closer more united country where no

ambition is to bold where no goal is out

of reach and no project too big we're

Canadians from every province and

territory and first nation can take part

in and contribute to our shared

prosperity and where the government gets

out of your way so the only thing

standing between you and the life you

want is the desire to make it a reality

so let's turn the page on a prime

minister that long ago lost the moral

authority to govern and a Trudeau NDP

coalition you can't afford and let's

choose a conservative majority

government let's elect MPs like Daniel

Lee right here in Willowdale MPs that

will work to lower taxes and put more

money back into your pockets that will

work as a part of our conservative team

to make your life more affordable to

reduce your commute times to fight

climate change by lowering global

emissions while not making you pay more

to heat your home or drive to work we

have a real plan to help you get ahead

it's a plan that will work but first we

need to elect a strong conservative

majority government and I'm asking for

your vote on October 21st thank you very

much merci beaucoup

[Applause]

good morning Mr Shearer it's quite

interesting that you should bring up the

1972 election because as you know a lot

of people compared you to Robert

Stanfield and one of the things that was

cited as the downfall of Roberts Anfield

is he was an ardent champion of the

rights of Quebec and in the caucus at

the time that didn't go over so well

think of his support for the official

languages Act in this election even

making a lot of very specific promises

to Quebec again if we go back to the

1990s your predecessor Brian Mulroney

and his promises to Quebec were what led

to the alienation of the West and the

rise of the reform movement do you not

see yourself putting that that back and

play we know that Alberta is so angry

these days but you've net you've been

there only once this campaign I've

actually been to Alberta more than once

but on that it's quite clear that under

Justin Trudeau region has been pit

against region Justin Trudeau has

divided Canadians he's divided provinces

he's failed to stand up for the types of

big ideas the big projects that can

bring this country together the

commitments I've made to Quebec flow

from a conservative principle of

decentralization we respect the the the

provincial area jurisdictions we respect

federal areas of jurisdictions we are

offering Quebecers a single income tax

return like every other Canadian enjoys

we are offering them specific

infrastructure projects that other

provinces will also be able to that will

also get support for their projects as

well so I reject the notion that in any

way one province is treated differently

under the conservative platform and I

would again point to that my vision of a

national energy quarter will bring this

country together we'll get Western

Canadian energy to Eastern Canadian

markets getting us off of foreign oil

stopping the practice of tanker after

tanker foreign oil coming into our our

markets well the same time giving Quebec

an opportunity to share its

hydroelectricity

with other provinces on a quarterback

set set preemies no news off the news

off roll the Quebec le Quebec where

Quebec was remember shows Kuta is also

Canadian was to say in so appalled a

poor unique

I've really project if you secure a

Quebec Quebec back lament funky voice or

dispo nibbler police auto progress a

jacilla solar back in vision preset very

poor and corridor initiative upper metal

energy to the Western Canada on trade

only March data less the Canada a akiva

IOC parametric cubic topology so either

I want to stay on Alberta for a minute

you've often cited Justin Trudeau's

environmental policies as being behind

the downturn of the oil industry and

Alberta and the economy there but

yesterday there was several thousand

people on the streets of Alberta people

whose livelihoods are presumably

connected to the oil industry in some

capacity and what they were asking for

was more aggressive action on climate

change and so what's your message to

them about your platform well we are the

only party with a real plan for the

environment with a plan that will

actually give Canada a chance to achieve

its Paris targets we're talking about

taking the climate fight global lowering

global emissions doing more of what

Canada can do so well without a lower

rate of emissions it doesn't make any

sense

to shut down Canadian Industries only to

see that production move to countries

with lower environmental standards or

without the same access to clean

technology that we've developed here so

our plan will allow Canada's energy

sector to grow the people of Alberta and

Saskatchewan get back to work all

provinces benefit from that whether it's

the manufacturing sector whether it's a

federal government revenues that are

able to support important services while

at the same time lowering global

emissions we're also going to put more

money back in the pockets of Keynes with

our green home renovation tax credit

which will lead to lower energy bills

lower consumption lower co2 emissions

good morning Christie Kirk up with The

Globe and Mail Warren Kinsella was

apparently hired to do your party's

dirty work in attacking Maxim Bernie a

with the condition that the contract

wouldn't be traced back to the

Conservatives how do you think the

public will perceive this we don't make

comments on vendors that we may or may

not have engaged with so to that end did

your party hire mr. Kinsella to attack

the Liberals as I said we don't make

comments on vendors that our party may

or may not have we just we never make

province sure I you know I I reject the

whatever the term may be I believe that

all provinces are have their unique

challenges their unique issues it's the

role of the Prime Minister to address

all issues that affect all Canadians

that affect all provinces in a way that

brings our country closer together

that's the manner that I will take a

cooperative approach respecting

provincial areas of jurisdiction and and

that is in sharp contrast to Justin

Trudeau who is fighting with provinces

attacking problem premiers during this

campaign in court with other provinces

so Cannes can be quite sure

they'll have a government under my

leadership that helps strengthen

national unity and strengthens our

Confederation good morning mr. schirra

Libya Stefanovic with CBC News have you

and where your party hired war and can

sell is firm to do anything this

election campaign as a rule we don't

make comments on vendors that we may or

may not have have contracts with we

don't offer comments on on contracts

that may or may not exist on vendors

that we may or may not have a

relationship with you just claim that

Trudeau is openly talking about a

coalition which is not true and you you

also repeated in Quebec yesterday this

GST claim which you're saying that the

NDP and Liberals have this plan to

increase the GST e Trudeau and Singh

both said yesterday that's not true

so as Prime Minister how can Canadians

have confidence that you will be

truthful well he is talking about

staying on as prime minister in the

event that he doesn't win the most seats

he's talking about a so-called

progressive government he is failing to

be transparent about which taxes he will

raise to pay for getting the NDP support

when you look at their two platforms we

can see quite clearly that this will be

a coalition that Canadians can't afford

in order to pay for their promises they

will have to raise the GST or raise

personal income taxes or make cuts to

important social services and if Justin

Trudeau truly believes that Canadians

want this costly coalition then he has

the obligation to tell Cannes today

exactly which taxes he will hike to pay

for the NDP support say Claire could

you can't answer that basic question

about whether you hired this company or

not why does the great privacy or

transparent with Canadians about this

as a general rule when it comes to what

it relates to party matters we don't

comment on contracts who may or may not

have with vendors why it's a we don't

offer comments when it comes to internal

party matters when it comes to contracts

that may or may not exist we don't offer

exactly deputy conservator to Quebec ask

that was in live a Creole is a mister

here what would you be prepared to

compromise on to gain the support of

another party in a minority situation I

think at this point in the campaign with

two days left the burden is on Justin

Trudeau to explain exactly which taxes

he is going to hike or which big

projects he will kill to earn the NDP

support in a coalition we've been very

clear with Canadians as to what our

platform contains and I've been out

lying my 100a action plan Justin Trudeau

has not he has not indicated what what

that deal might look like

Jagga need Singh is calling for the

cancellation of the Trans Mountain

project will that be something that will

be a condition for the NDP liberal

coalition in order to pay for their

forty billion dollars worth of deficits

which taxes will go up these are the

questions that Canadians are asking

themselves and asking the Liberals

before they make their vote on Monday

and if Justin Trudeau

really believes that Canadians want an

NDP liberal coalition then he needs to

have the backbone and the courage to

tell Canadians exactly which taxes he's

going to hike to pay for the NDP

promises you're both running to be the

next prime minister why is it incumbent

on him and not uncommon on you to say

what you'd be willing to compromise in

order to form government and minority

well we are asking for a strong mandate

to be able to implement the things that

we're outlining our 100-day action plan

that we've been going over the last few

days

speaks to exactly how we're going to

make life more affordable leave more

money in the pockets of Canadians on the

contrary Justin Trudeau is is is

obviously contemplating what he might

have to do to earn the NDP support we

know that will lead to massive new

deficits and higher taxes to pay for it

this will truly be the coalition that

Canadians can't afford and so

next few days we were asking Canadians

for a strong mandate so we can lower

taxes put money in the pockets of Keene

so that Canadians can get ahead mr.

Schurr is it ethical for a party in the

middle of an election campaign to hire a

skullduggery firm to potentially dig up

dirt on an opponent and if the Liberal

Party did this would you be demanding

transparency from them well we're not

going to make comments on contracts that

may or may not exist that's what the

principle of digging up during your

opponent hiring a firm to do it secretly

and I said we're not gonna make comments

on on contracts I may or may not exist

or with vendors that we may or may not

have Warren Kinsella if it's true your

party hired him was also responsible for

spreading misinformation and encouraging

misinformation around Justin Rose time

at West Point Grey Academy your party

put at a press release basically

encouraging those rumors should people

infer that it's possible that your party

helped spread misinformation and work

with him to do so we have been very open

and clear with Keynes about exactly what

we are going to offer as a government

we're going to lower their taxes we will

lower their taxes we will put more money

in their pocket we will get back to

balanced budgets over a responsible

period of time on the contrary what they

don't have from Justin Trudeau is a

clear explanation of what an NDP liberal

coalition would look like which taxes he

would raise to pay for the NDP's

promises that's what Canadians have a

right to know in the next few days

before the election day Chris Ellie from

the National Post provides all kinds of

supports for businesses and industries

trade tax breaks loans grants that add

up to much more than 1.5 billion dollars

what's your definition of corporate

welfare what we said when we made this

announcement was that we would apply a

lens a filter criteria to corporate

welfare to eliminate government funds

taxpayers funds from going to highly

profitable companies companies that use

that money to invest in other countries

or that use the money to reward

shareholders or CEOs can you provide

some examples of corporate welfare under

the Justin Trudeau government that you

would sure well 12 million dollars to

Loblaws for starters a multi-billion

dollar family a multi-million dollar

operation received twelve million

dollars of taxpayers money

that's a that's an easy one mr. Schurr

Mike litter from global national in your

speech you said that Justin Trudeau is

openly discussing a coalition with the

NDP besides some line that he's saying

about electing a progressive government

other than that what proof do you have

to that claim that he's openly talking

about it because he has not to this

point well he's talking about ensuring

that he stays on as Prime Minister if he

does not win the most seats he's talking

about on a cool he's well it's up to him

to explain exactly how their

relationship might work it's up to him

to explain exactly which taxes might go

up we've indicated to Canadians just to

pay for some of the deficits that they

will rack up the GST would have to go

from 5 to 7.5% they do have other

options they could raise personal income

taxes they could cut important transfers

for social services but one thing

Canadians can be sure of is that the

deficit will be higher and taxes will go

up and this will be the coalition that

Canadians cannot afford so throughout

this campaign you have talked a lot

about Justin Trudeau losing the moral

authority to govern so the last two days

you have put out a lot of assumptions

without any proof and today you're not

answering a question which is very

simple one over whether or not warrant

consult was hired by the Conservatives

what do you see Canadians that you lack

the moral authority since you cannot

answer these basic questions we have

always been open and transparent with

cain's as to what we will do as

government and that's exactly what we're

going to continue to do we're gonna show

Canadians in the next few days exactly

which taxes we are going to lower to

leave more money in their pockets so

they can get ahead and that is in stark

contrast to Justin true who has a none

costed platform who only half of his

platform commitments have PBO costing

behind it and he is refusing to come

clean unto what types of arrangements he

will work under which under with with

the NDP which taxes he will increase or

which projects he would kill in order to

earn NDP support I note again mr. Singh

is talking about canceling the trans

mountain pipeline as a condition a star

Liberal candidate is saying that there

will never be another pipeline built

under a Liberal government he needs to

be open and transparent with Canadians

about that before Monday before

Canadians go to the polls

Oh as a rule we don't make comments on

contracts that may or may not exist her

Avengers that we may or may not have

Katie Simpson CBC News Mr Shearer you're

standing here and you're refusing to

deny that your party hired Warren can

sell it to dig up dirt on your

opponent's at best you're peddling and

misinformation when you attack the

Liberals about planning to legalize hard

drugs and planning to implement a secret

tax on the sale of their houses and

yesterday you completely fabricated a

claim that the Liberals and the NDP

would raise the GST with absolutely zero

proof to back that up on October 22nd

when you wake up or how are you

comfortable are you with the campaign

you have run so first of all of course I

disagree with much of with with your

premise it is quite clear that liberals

will have to raise taxes to pay for

their deficits that is that is as night

follows day taxes go up when deficits

are allowed to balloon and and last for

so long and when you look when you look

at the when you look at the fact that

the Canada Revenue Agency has started to

collect information on the sale of

primary residences and when you look at

the fact that this is something that

senior ranking Liberal MP was advocating

for when you look at the fact this was a

policy item that was suggested it is

reasonable for Keynes to worry about

Justin Trudeau breaking promises or

doing things that he said he wouldn't do

during election campaigns because we saw

that in 2015 and we saw how that turned

out

what I'm saying to Canadians today is

that under an NDP liberal coalition

those deficits will balloon and taxes

will have to go up to pay for it if it's

not the GST it's up to Justin Trudeau to

say which taxes it will be but it is

clear in order to pay for the NDP

promises Justin Trudeau will have to

raise taxes he has the obligation to

tell Canadians which taxes he will raise

are you comfortable with the campaign

you've run every morning we have gotten

up and we have put forward a positive

platform offering hope and opportunity

for Canadians helping to make their life

less expensive more affordable helping

Canadians achieve their goals and

aspirations and I'm very confident that

as we get to work to implement our tax

cuts our policies that will lead to more

jobs greater economic growth a better

quality of life

I will be very excited to implement that

Canadians will be very excited about the

money that will be returned to their

pockets

in contrast Canadians know that an NDP

liberal coalition will balloon that

deficit and raise taxes to pay for it

and again it's up to Justin Trudeau

today to explain exactly which taxes he

is going to raise to pay for the NDP's

promises but just one last follow-up mr.

chair what is the rule that you have

here that you can't you can't say which

contractors you're working with we just

don't we just don't comment on the

contracts that we made it may or may not

we just don't we don't make comments on

contracts that we may or may not have or

vendors that we may or may not have have

engage with Liberal leader Justin

Trudeau had said that would you be would

you accept that answer

it's a we don't we don't make comment on

contracts it may or may not have thanks

very much your own merci beaucoup

[Applause]
