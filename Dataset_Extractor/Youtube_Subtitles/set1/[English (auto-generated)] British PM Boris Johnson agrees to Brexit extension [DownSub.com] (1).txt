he's not kind of a brexit and the people

know that the Prime Minister has failed

in his own words mr. speaker it is time

for the Prime Minister to look for the

nearest ditch our Edmund Shannon is on

perpetual brexit duty Redmond we know

for sure now brexit won't happen October

31st but do we know what happens next

yes Donna well the UK gained an extra

hour this past weekend with the end of

daylight saving for 2019 and the UK

government gained an extra 92 days today

with the EU approving that latest

Brexton extension until January 31st now

Boris Johnson is of course blaming the

opposition for this latest delay to

brexit and well he might it was his

number one campaign promise when he

became leader that brexit would happen

on October 31st but it's not going to

now so this latest extension has been

called a so called a flex tension and

that's because the UK could potentially

leave the EU anytime before January 31st

if and when Boris Johnson can push that

brexit deal through Parliament and

tonight Johnson tried and failed to

trigger an election on December 12th but

Redman I guess that election could still

happen yes indeed we could have an

election a rare election just before

Christmas now Boris Johnson ideally

Donna wants one on December 12th the

ideal scenario for him is to have brexit

Don and then go to the country but some

opposition parties of course would like

to have brakes it's still hanging around

as an issue so expect the parties

tomorrow when they reconvene to haggle

over that date and maybe come to an

agreement on an election date we have a

great new deal and it's time for

the voters have a chance to pronounce on

that deal replace this dysfunctional

Parliament with a new Parliament that

can get brakes it done so the country

can move on the big challenge for Boris

Johnson will be if brexit doesn't happen

by the time an election comes around

will be the threat of Nigel Farage's new

brexit party of course the polls are

saying that Johnson's conservatives have

a healthy lead but a month is a long

time in politics and Donna it is a

lifetime when it comes to brexit it sure

is feels like a lifetime Redman Shannon

we expect to hear from you again

tomorrow Thanks
