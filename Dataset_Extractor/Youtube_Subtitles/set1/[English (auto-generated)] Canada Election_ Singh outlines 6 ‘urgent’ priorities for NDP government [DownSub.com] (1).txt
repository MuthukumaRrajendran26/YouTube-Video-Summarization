that's what these women I never

a shot okay over there and then come up

[Laughter]

[Music]

whatever this one testy

[Music]

thank you very much for joining us I

want to begin by acknowledging that

we're gathered on the unseeded

territories of yo gonquai nation so this

weekend families are going to get

together and spend some time hopefully

for Thanksgiving and during this time

they're gonna be able to chat about the

upcoming election they're gonna chat

about the choice they have to make it's

a pretty serious choice it's a big

choice they're gonna chat about whether

they want to choose a government that

works for them or one that works for the

very powerful and the very rich people

are going through a lot right now

and I've had a great amazing opportunity

to travel across this country and meet

lots of Canadians and hear their stories

and share their stories and what I've

been hearing from people is they're

feeling squeezed they're feeling a

little bit of fear they're feeling

worried about the future they can't find

a home that can afford they're

struggling with the bills

lots of Canadians can't afford

medication they can't get the dental

care that they need young people are

worried about a future where they feel

like they might not have the same

ability to live to maybe even breathe

the air the way their parents have so

young people are worried if you're

unafraid given all of this fear and

worry and uncertainty in the future and

the pressure and the weight that people

are feeling young people who are feeling

either crushing way to student debt with

all these fears and worries they look at

the options and they see mr. Trudeau who

could find 14 billion dollars for the

richest corporations to buy corporate

jets and limousines but couldn't find

the money to actually deliver Universal

Pharma care for all and they see Mr

Shearer talking about tax cuts for the

wealthiest maybe a couple dollars for

everyone else but then massive cuts to

services and neither them are going to

make life better for the families that I

speak to neither them are going to work

for people they're working for the

richest and then I think about

reconciliation and if I had mr. Trudeau

worked hard to keep S&C Loveland out of

court but it's dragging indigenous kids

to court fact that courts decided that

indigenous kids deserve equal funding

and mr. Trudeau and his government said

no well I want you to know that we've

got a number of commitments and one of

our commitments if you elect new

Democrats we're gonna fight for you our

New Deal for people is a historic path

to building your country where we put

people at the heart of everything we do

and that means ensuring that

reconciliation is honest and meaningful

and that means a new democratic

government would not drag indigenous

kids to court we would ensure that

grassy narrows has clean water in fact

we would ensure that all boil water

advisories were ended across Canada and

that indigenous communities get equal

access to services now I know there's

gonna be a tough choice to make in this

election I am running to be prime

minister of this country because I want

to make life better for people I want to

make sure people are at the heart of

what we do but no matter what happens in

this election I want to ensure that

Canadians win no matter what happens

Canadians have to win and that's why I

want to put forward our six priorities

six priorities that New Democrats will

work hard for these are our urgent

priorities these are priorities that we

understand need to happen right away we

cannot wait we have no time to wait

people cannot afford to wait another

four years or longer

we need to act immediately and these are

our six priorities than require urgent

action first off we're going to ensure

that we build and put in place a

national farmer care plan that's public

single-payer and delivers medication for

all with our plan use your health card

not your credit card to get the

medication that you or your loved ones

need we also want to bring in place a

national dental care program our dental

care program is going to lift up over

four million Canadians who don't have

coverage right now with immediate

coverage for their dental services we're

also going to make sure that people can

have a home that they can afford and

that means making sure we've got the

money to build half a million new

affordable homes

but we also tackle the root cause of why

housing is becoming so expensive we're

gonna tackle speculation with a foreign

buyers tax we're gonna make sure we go

after money-laundering with dedicated

resources to tackle money laundering for

young people who graduate with massive

debt

we need to immediately start working to

alleviating that pressure and so our

first step is going to be to ensure that

we waive all interest off a student debt

instead of liberals and mr. Trudeau who

waived six billion dollars in corporate

loans we are going to stand up for

students and say students should not be

profited off of their debt should not be

profited off of for we're gonna work

hard to make sure we have a bold plan on

tackling the climate crisis to those

young people who have fear and despair

in their eyes I'm gonna look them in

their eyes and say we are gonna fight

with everything we have to make sure we

build a plan that is bold there's a

daesh's that is based on science and

targets that are real and meaningful

we're gonna end subsidies immediately on

fossil fuel sectors and we're gonna help

workers transition from fossil fuels and

five we're gonna put in place a super

well tax we're gonna work hard to make

sure that the richest Canadians pay

their fair share with a super well tax a

tax on those who have fortunes of over

twenty million dollars and six to help

out families that are struggling with

the cost of cell phone and Internet we

are going to put in place a price cap on

cell phone and Internet peace now my

friends

there's where in that period of the

election where there's gonna be a lot of

talk of fear that fear talk is gonna

wrap up you're gonna hear mr. Trudeau

again and again repeat this message that

you have to settle for Less did you have

to be afraid of something coming and you

have to vote out of fear when I say to

you when you vote out of fear you don't

get what you want

when you settle for Less you don't get

what you want when you set it for Less

you don't achieve amazing things when

you vote out of fear you don't achieve

things that are meaningful in your life

I want you to vote for hope I want you

to vote because you believe in something

I want you to vote for something don't

vote against something vote for

something you believe in I want you to

know you do not have to settle if you

vote enough you Democrats we are gonna

fight for these things you vote enough

of us we're going to form government but

either way I want to ensure Canadians

know this my goal is to make sure in

this election we cannot wait and no

matter what government you choose

I want Canadians to win if you vote New

Democrat Canadians will win we will

fight for these six things and we will

make them happen

and finding my friends to make sure that

we never are in this position again one

of my commitments to you if you vote new

Democrat we will ensure we truly bring

in electoral reform and that means

proportional representation these are my

commitments to you so that Canadians win

no matter what happens I am here for you

your Democrats work for you we don't

choose the wealthy and the powerful we

choose you thank you my friends and

ready for any of your questions

CBC News we've already said that you

wouldn't support the Conservatives but

if there was a liberal minority are

these the terms under which you're

willing to support another party like

the Liberals I want to make it clear

that no matter what Canadians choose

these are our commitments these are what

we're going to fight for these are the

things that people will know if you vote

new Democrat if you get more new

Democrats in place these are our six

urgent priority so we're gonna fight for

it immediately we also want to make it

clear that we want to ensure that people

aren't in this position again in the

future where they have to worry about

who they vote for and that's why

proportional representation is one of

our our key commitments so people can

know that this will never happen again

if you vote any Democrat yes or no if

there's a liberal minority are these are

terms to support the Liberals these are

terms of what we're gonna fight for

these are our commitments and these are

our priorities so for any government

that is formed

whatever Canadians choose these are the

six things that we're gonna ask them

take

seriously these are the six things are

going to sit down and say we need action

on these six things otherwise we're not

gonna be able to move ahead we're gonna

demand action on these six things so

Canadians know no matter what happens in

this election that they win because with

New Democrats you get these six

commitments that we are going to make

sure we sit down with anyone and ensure

that these are our priorities Joe maybe

finally focus your attack on the bloc

québécois

tonight well I want to make it really

clear we're seeing a lot of excitement a

lot of engagement across Canada our

campaign is gaining amazing momentum I'm

really excited about that in Quebec is

well we've got a strong team that's

working really hard in this election or

this debate tonight I'm gonna make sure

Canadians have a choice and right now

they've got a government that hasn't

chosen them a government that's chosen

the rich and powerful and my focus is

going to be on the government it's going

to be on the government that's been in

government for the past four years which

is mr. Trudeau and the Liberals don't

fully on a bokuden momentum on a tell

but just more specifically in Quebec you

could be losing to the bloc québécois

here we're merging so why not focus on

Yvonne Swapna not yet in tonight's

French debate so I'm gonna be focusing

on and the government's made choices for

the past four years I absolutely make

the contrast that between the block and

I we're the ones that can actually work

with the rest of Canada we can work

together to deliver programs like

universal pharmacare we can work

together with Canada to deliver things

like a national dental care program

these are things that we can do that the

block can't do so that contrast is clear

we're gonna make that contrast clear but

my target is going to be mr. Trudeau for

who's been in power who's made choices

that have made it harder for families

choices that have prioritized the rich

to the detriment and to the pain of

families

hi mr. saying it's Annie Bergeron Oliver

with CTV national news you say you're

running a national campaign but you

still haven't been to Pei Newfoundland

and Alberta and you've only made very

brief appearances in man

Tobi's Saskatchewan New Brunswick and

Nova Scotia what do you say to Canadians

who are questioning why you haven't been

there and haven't been visiting them

well we're a Tippie country and we're

doing our best to get around all the

beautiful parts of this country and it

is large so it's hard to get everywhere

but we're proud of the work we're doing

and no matter where you live whether you

live in PEI or Newfoundland I want folks

to know in Canada with our commitments

it's clear we don't work for the rich or

the powerful we work for you our plan to

take on universal or to take on the big

pharma care or big pharmaceutical and

the big law insurance lobbyist is

because we're ready to take them on and

fight for you whereas we see mr. Trudeau

cave to them meet with pharmaceuticals

875 times so no matter where he goes you

can go everywhere across Canada but he's

still working for the rich you can go

everywhere across the Atlantic and it so

shows that people who want health care

are not gonna get that with mr. Trudeau

who'd rather cave into the

pharmaceuticals or to the insurance

lobbyists rather than deliver Universal

Pharma care he hasn't committed to it

we've committed to it we understand that

means taking on the big pharma in the

big lobbyists we're ready to do that but

if you look at the Conservatives and the

Liberals they've crisscross the country

visiting every province at least twice

if not more and so there are people who

are questioning whether they're a

priority to your government because you

haven't been there what do you say to

them how do you explain why you have not

spent more time in places like Manitoba

for example well I say to them you know

concerns aren't gonna make your life any

better they're gonna talk to you that

you might show up in your province but

they're gonna cut the services that you

depend on and that's exactly what they

do and people know that in Manitoba they

felt the the cuts of Pallister and how

much it hurts they know that they cut

health care and the things that people

need mr. Shaye's gonna do the same thing

so I would say to the people across this

country that consumers might show up but

they're gonna cut your services liberals

might show up but they've chosen to help

out the powerful pharmaceutical

companies and the insurance companies in

the big telecom companies rather than

bringing place Universal Pharma care or

lowering the cost of your cell phone

bills they've chosen the rich we choose

you

good morning mr. Singh I am Charlie

Pinter tuned for my politics think we're

doing this this morning um so you've

outlined some issue areas here but I'm

hoping you can talk more about specific

policies that might

a maker break it for the NDP and joining

a potential coalition are there any

anything that you've talked about today

or anything else that the NDP would walk

away from the table and refuse to form

form a coalition with with another party

well what I want to lay out is what

Canadians can expect from us if they

vote for New Democrats these are things

that we're gonna fight for right away so

these are the things that we're gonna

sit down with anyone say you've got to

take me seriously we need action on

these things otherwise you're not gonna

have our support and so these are the

things that Canadians can count on they

can know that we're gonna fight to bring

in place universal pharmacare a national

dental care program money for housing

tackling speculation and money

laundering they're gonna know that we're

gonna make sure that there's a price cap

on your cell phone bills that we're

gonna take interest off the student debt

right away that we're gonna make sure

that indigenous communities are treated

with respect and that true

reconciliation happens and we're going

to make sure that when it comes to the

climate crisis we've got a real and bold

plan to tackle the crisis these are the

things we're gonna sit down with anyone

and say this is what we need and we need

action on this but on that same note

Elizabeth May has said for example that

she we wouldn't partner with anyone who

doesn't take climate seriously so is

there one area or one specific policy

perhaps that the NDP would insist be

pushed forward for a government that

you're partnered with well that's a

great difference that's a great contrast

for for us we can't choose between one

or the other we believe that having

health care is so important that we

can't negotiate that we're not willing

to compromise that

misny is willing to compromise that

that's really the big difference we're

not gonna compromise that we've got our

six commitments and we know that these

are things that Canadians need urgently

and that's what we're gonna make sure

that people whoever wants to sit down

with us has to take very seriously and

actually deliver action on these things

before us before we can move for

saddening

their hurtful you know that hate is not

something that's limited hate can spread

and once you allow hate to grow it will

consume everything and once someone can

hate someone based on their their

beliefs taking grow to continue to

expand to hate based on someone's color

of skin hate based on someone's

sexuality or gender

we need to denounce all forms I hate

wherever they are and it's pretty clear

I should need to say this but no one

would have no one would be able to have

those type of values and stay member of

my party but the bloc has to make that

decision but for me this is exactly why

we need to denounce hate because heat is

something that is it spreads like fire

but it consumes everything oh hi sorry

Jordan press with the Canadian Press I

wanted to ask you just about the

proportional representation sure that is

that a make or break thing for you we're

in the context of working with other

parties yeah this is something that's a

priority for me it's one of our

commitments and our commitment document

we put this out months ago and for me

it's really about giving power back to

people and making sure that every vote

counts and Canadians should not have to

be in this position where mr. Trudeau is

telling them to vote out of fear to to

settle for Less to say okay we may not

be perfect we might have broken our

commitments on things but vote for us

anyways because you're afraid of another

party I want to end that once and for

all and so I want to say to Canadians

with the new Democrat governments with

more New Democrats in place we can

deliver that just as a follow-up so if

that is a make-or-break thing for you

and working with any party in the next

parliament then how do you go about

doing it at a time when really maybe

this isn't top of mind for voters well

that's why our six commitments are the

urgent things that we need to fix right

away our six commitments were the ones I

listed around housing and health care

and student debt and the cost of living

and making sure we tackle the climate

crisis those are our six commitments to

Canadians just to ensure that this

doesn't happen in the future we believe

that we need to have portion

representation but our six commitments

are the ones we're focused on because

those are the ones that are top of mind

but I also want Canadians to know with

the new democratic government we're

gonna ensure that this doesn't happen

again would you be open to a coalition

government so what I'm laying out today

is not is not that what I'm laying out

today are are our key areas that we want

to work on and that what Canadians

should know if they vote from the

Democrats when they're talking about

this during this talking about who they

vote for during that Thanksgiving

again these are the things that they

should know that if you vote new

democrat you'll get someone who's gonna

fight for these things who's gonna

deliver these things and you're gonna

get these six commitments achieved with

a new democratic MP and a new democratic

government these six priorities there's

a lot of your platform condensed under

this are you saying that you would only

support a party if they would take

action on all six of them or will be one

by one issue by issue what we what will

you do is this we put down we've told

Canadians we're gonna work on all of our

platform commitments those are things

that are important to us but there are

six urgent things that we've heard from

Canadians that need to happen and that

are achievable that we can do right away

and so these six things we want to say

to Canadians if you vote for us we're

gonna sit down with anyone that we know

whatever the government that Canadians

choose and we're gonna say these are our

six things that we need urgent action on

and we need real commitments on we need

you to take these things seriously and

if we don't have urgent action we don't

have real commitments on these things

then we won't be able to move forward

with thank you very much appreciate it

all thank you

Heather aggressor bad
