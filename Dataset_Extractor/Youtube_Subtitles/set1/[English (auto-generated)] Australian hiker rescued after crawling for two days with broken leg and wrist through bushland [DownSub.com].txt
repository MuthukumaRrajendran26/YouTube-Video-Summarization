it took me an hour to get down there

took me about 40 minutes to get to this

waterfall and kind of war many times

before and this time being so dry their

liking on the rock instead of really

sticking sock just slipped in gave way

and I caught myself the first time as I

started to slide but I had too much

momentum and over I went and I was

climbing outside

I started looking down and just started

sliding down the face of the rock and I

slipped that 20 foot cartwheels slams

into the rock and inland then the creek

at the bottom

so straightaway I thought I'm now in a

little trouble because no one knows

where I am

I don't have a plb personal location

beacon no problems to get my phone out

so I got my phone out no range I mean a

really deep rocky gullies so my mobile

phones no good here so I was thinking

anyway I'm going to raise the alarms I'm

gonna have to climb or scramble back out

the rocks to get back out of here so

we're fine in my pocket miss the pocket

and into the drink

now my phone's gone now I have no way of

contacting the outside world

another thinking anyway I'm going to get

rescued his self rescue I've had a lot

of experience I've spent seven years in

the SES and I've done a lot of rescues

for the SES and the chocolates I had

some idea of what they can and can't do

and I knew what I was like hated there

was no way that they were going to be

able to find me

so I chose to go back to the junction

where I had my first break because at

that junction point there's a track

across the bottom that the locals use

for exercise so if you don't got more a

chance of being found if I can make my

way back to there but that was two days

of lifting my leg I had a bandage around

my elbow so I could use my elbow and

it's basically scrambling lifting inch

by inch well it took me 40 minutes to

walk up took me nearly two days to crawl

back down to the junction of the creeks

I'd actually started thinking of I've

missed my junction I kept looking at my

map and my compass and the creek I was

in was running East and the only Creek

on the map is the creek I'm in so I'm

literally in the right area it just

took so much longer the duties and ever

imagine it was just such a slow process

but by having the experience from being

the club and in my bag I had thermals I

had head torch some extra food and

because it was only meant to be a

three-hour trip and it took a handful of

nuts a protein bar and some voids

because I thought I'll be back home by

last time and so that's pretty much what

I've had to eat first couple of days I

saw the police helicopter come over on

Sunday night but I was right down in the

creek bed near the water so could have

access to water and I thought if they

come back tomorrow then everybody get

out of here so I had to crawl again so

we've got an hour to crawl up to the

track where I said I thought people

would use and laid out there with a

emergency busy bag which is a sleeping

bag but it's a space blanket you know

the silver space blankets and so that

was part of what was in my kit keeping

me warm at nights so I just laid out in

the open areas bessel including just

waivers were in helicopter came over and

spotted me and that was it

you
