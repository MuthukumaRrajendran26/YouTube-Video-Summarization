I love you too holy moly

I ripped my my wrap so let me start my

heart is beating fast I want to

acknowledge and I just saw a chief Wayne

Sparrow and grin she said John here I

want to acknowledge the traditional

territory of the Coast Salish peoples

the Musqueam swamis and say with you

and I want to thank each and every one

of you for being here for however long

and for all of you who ran here from

scrutineering and from the pool thank

you and to everybody that waited thank

you so much so I have had the

opportunity to stand in front of crowds

before having been elected as BC treaty

Commissioner having been elected as the

BC regional chief and having been

honored to have been elected previously

as the Member of Parliament for

Vancouver Granville and I am so happy to

be standing here as the newly elected

independent member

[Applause]

this is an incredibly humbling moment

and experience and like all other

experiences that I've had but tonight is

different tonight

we accomplished together something

extraordinary we accomplished showing

Ottawa showing our political process

that independent strong voices matter

and that we can so I had a speech that

I'm not gonna read and I want to make a

number of comments and I haven't seen

what's really been going on television

right now but I want to say something

about the extraordinary former member of

parliament for Markham Stovall

[Applause]

Jane Philpott and don't get me wrong I

want to congratulate every single person

that put their name forward for election

every single person that has been

elected as a member of parliament right

across this country I congratulate each

and every one of you Jane Philpott is an

extraordinary person she was an

extraordinary Member of Parliament for

the people of Markham Stovall and she

was literally the best minister of the

crown that this country has ever seen

I know that Parliament will be lesser

without her presence but I know that dr.

Jane Philpott will go on to continue to

do extraordinary things so I'm sending

love from Vancouver ground bull from me

from our family all the way across the

country to mark and Stovall I also want

to thank and acknowledge the other

candidates that ran in this writing and

it was a bit of a nail-biter yes I want

to say - Zac - Talib - Yvonne - Louise

and - Naomi thank you for putting your

names forward we had spent some time

together at all candidates forums and

again congratulations for doing so and I

would say a special shout out to Yvonne

Hanson I don't know she's watching

she is this incredibly young bright

woman that I know is going to go places

and is going to run somewhere at some

time and I suspect that we're all going

to get out and support her so to

Vancouver ground ball four more years

or however long a minority government

lasts I congratulate the Liberal Party

for their minority governments I do

think that the best laws and the best

policies come from a minority government

situation and I am going to be proud I

am going to be proud and pleased to work

with all the members of Parliament's to

get through legislation to ensure that

we are taking bold and ambitious action

on climate change to ensure to ensure we

truly look at democratic reform

including electoral reform so we can

ensure

[Applause]

we have big issues here in Vancouver

Granville they've existed since before

the last election and before that we

have to dress affordability we need to

look at the health care system at

pharmacare and we truly need to look at

creating the space for true

reconciliation with indigenous people

so I'm just gonna comment a little bit

about our campaign maybe comment a

little bit about the national campaign

our campaign was filled with so many

people that came from far and wide to

volunteer people from across the

so-called political spectrum that

actually believed that we could make a

difference that we could put forward

honesty and integrity and look at

politics and work outside party lines to

address the significant issues that are

facing our time so I think every single

person in this room and the tens of

thousands of people across Canada that

believe in those same things that hold

the same values and know that we

actually can do more if we work together

the national campaign we saw very

divisive politics we saw extreme

hyper-partisanship we saw people talking

about other people and saying I'm not as

bad as that person that is not the type

of politics that we need to address

these issues we need to collaborate we

need to come together we need to again

work across party lines to address these

big issues and I know that we can do it

thank you for Grandville has shown that

we can do politics differently that

integrity matters and if we have

integrity and honesty and do the right

thing in politics you can succeed we can

succeed

so everybody in Magdeburg ramble to the

constituents of Vancouver Granville I

feel bottom of my heart thank you so

much for renewing your trust and support

in me I will continue to work incredibly

hard as I do every day to represent you

in Ottawa

a couple a couple of thank-yous or

acknowledgments I wanted to acknowledge

these people before I forget to do it

again my my mother sandy who's sitting

right here sandy right here

my sister Cory

and cadence and PI on K later somewhere

the club which losing Campbell right now

[Music]

for almost 11 years he has has been with

me and we have done this together and

I'm so glad that he's here tonight so

thank you for acknowledging them but I

want to acknowledge every single person

in this room to all of the volunteers

again who went to the polls as

scrutineers who knocked on doors with me

who made telephone calls people who

donated money everybody that has

contributed to this campaign in such a

significant way this is what we did and

this is what we did together and I could

not anything without all of you
