a little later than we anticipated but

better late than never official verified

caucus results are coming in from the

state of Iowa they're not complete but

results are in from a majority of

precincts and they show our campaign in

first place

we don't know all of the numbers but we

know this much a campaign that started a

year ago with four staff members no name

recognition no money just a big idea a

campaign that some said should have no

business even making this attempt has

taken its place at the front of this

race to replace the current president

with a better vision for the future and

no matter what happens next this much is

undeniable that fact represents an

astonishing victory for this campaign

this candidacy and this vision that you

all have been apart of this validates

the idea that we can have a message this

same message connect in urban and rural

and suburban communities that we can

reach out to Democrats and to

independents and even to some future

former Republicans ready to bring change

to this country

it pollinates the idea that we can

expand a coalition not only unified

around who it is we're against but

around what it is that we're for and it

validates for a kid somewhere in the

community wondering if he belongs or she

belongs where they belong in their own

family then if you believe in yourself

and your country there's a lot backing

up that police we have a powerful

American majority ready to make that

change ready not only to elect a new

president but to back up that new

president in getting these changes

through a Washington that feels like it

can barely even hear us if you are

watching the news right now if you are

watching the Senate it is exhausting I

live and breathe politics and I'm

exhausted watching the political news

right now but we cannot give in to that

exhaustion at a time like this we can't

that's how the cynics would win and so

this is our opportunity to remember that

while the Senate might be the jury today

we are the jury tomorrow and we get the

final verdict on the presidency on the

rule of law and on the direction of this

it's beginning
