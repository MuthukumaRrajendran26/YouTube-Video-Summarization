want to put forward a solution to that

we know that BC is also profits that

also feels neglected being on the west

coast a lot of times people feel like

they're ignored and I want to make sure

people in BC know that I've got their

back and I'm in it for them and I want

to make sure that they know with me as

as leader and as me as Prime Minister

I'll make sure that the environment is

protected the coast is protected and

things like the ferry system to get the

financing in the investments that it

needs don't care on general economy with

we're running a national campaign I'm

looking forward to being at every part

of Canada I have the honor of being a

national leader and it's my job to

represent all of Canada and I want to do

that there's there's places where we've

got lots of lots of people and lots of

target ridings but most importantly

people that they need a lot of help and

BC we know the specific issues that are

impacting the coastline they're

impacting the people that are are

worried about money laundering there's

very specific issues that we want to

tackle we know that in helping those

issues here in BC it'll help people

across Canada spending time in BC and

Ontario also I think ties in the fact

that I was an MPP and in Ontario so I

know those issues really well and I've

got a lot of deep roots there and now

being an MP representing BC I've got

some strong ties to BC as well so that's

part of why I really care deeply about

these two provinces but I care about all

of Canada and you'll see us in every

province

why it's so important to do right right

yeah yes so a one-way a one-way ride on

the ferry from Victoria to the mainland

for a family is 90 dollars for two

people and a car it's quite costly and

four people on the island

the fairies aren't just the ferry

they're really they're really like a

highway they're there how people connect

with one another and some people live in

remote communities and this is their way

to get to the big city for services this

is the way to get to communities where

they need access to the things they need

in their lives so it's costly and the BC

government has done some really strong

and taking some strong measures to make

it more affordable but there is an

accord there's an agreement already from

1977 between Canada and BC and that

hasn't been renegotiated in a long time

and so we want to increase funding to

make sure we keep up with the times and

be sure that people have BC that they're

getting the supports they need

okay

yeah

jag me could you come over here hey

little help fight thing and we need to

put some weight on this again can we

just hold it

Freeman port on the asset connection

well I mean Canadians expect to have

someone who's going to stand up to to

mr. Trump and for a long time we haven't

seen that you know we've had a trade

agreement where we lost protections for

workers employments Labor Standards and

environmental protections were not

enforceable we lost a crucial crucial

protections in the supply management

which was hurt dairy farmers the cost of

medication is going to go up because of

this new newly negotiated agreement and

there was legal steel tariffs and

aluminium tariffs that continued to be

imposed but were not removed

I mean Canadians don't want someone

who's just gonna cave in to the demands

of mr. Trump who's gonna back down from

a bully I believe the only way to stand

up to the bullies to be strong and I'm

willing to be strong and willing to

stand up because Canadians depend on me

to make sure that their best interests

are being served and I won't cave in to

that Canadian jobs are being protected
