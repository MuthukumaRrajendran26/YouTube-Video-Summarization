by accident that's for sure my friends

everything we've achieved over the past

year is Rishabh NGO community Jerusalem

[Applause]

community has been more help for our

hard-working middle-class families

it needs more help for new moms like Jim

who uses repetitive childhood to debate

the diverse many books and analysis at a

single mom of two who was called with

the CCP unlighted statement real change

building new rental department is super

host right across the field

[Applause]

and a lot

the truth is we're just getting started

[Applause]

we have more work to do but expressly

when I say we will

[Applause]

[Applause]

and the last four years and against the

big nicotine and sneak they voted

against the Canada's childhood against

the middle class against so many people

[Music]

thankfully Canadians aren't mine because

we see this conservative movie before in

opposition

it is sooner to stand in the way of good

policies and how people then they

campaign on fear and empty promises and

as soon as it hit into power they cut

taxes for the world views and services

for everybody else

[Applause]

just like

thank you and your family for life

and who shares platform

no wonder he's been hiding it for so

long no wonder he's gonna bury it

sum up this pure platform in three words

look for cuts and said bull bug here

billion dollars for the bus

[Music]

and the shoes that will be four times

larger than downpours

us out there this year more than double

the child and about what we spent last

year alone on benefits for seniors old

25 what we spent student a make up a big

big number and what he would

easy for conservative politicians but I

got a cord and this year the only

services that matter no sister the

wealthy for everybody else if

- infrastructure well I think we want to

be late enough this from these

conservative and so the Detroit could be

clear do you want to invest this into

the class or do you want to cut for I

fear that none of course

[Music]

do you want to make education more

affordable

[Applause]

[Music]

do you monetize see literally you can

send a clear message to the Conservative

Party on October 21st

[Applause]

my friends Edgar shear FLOTUS you to

gamble with your family's future and

double down on a conservative

politicians but if Canadians know that

they deserve better his time to the saw

concern

and the NDP

can't stop Andrew here the only way to

solve concern

[Applause]

Oh

[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

as Canadian tangibles

here's obedient riveted if you want

progressive action you need an

oppressive government not a progressive

opposition and branches and I mean

really build a better future

voting conservatives won't get us there

in 2015 we close the book on the Harper

decade we can't afford to go back the

very first thing we did we formed

government which is kind of taxes for

the middle class by raising them on the

wealthiest 1% and if we win this

election

our very first acted in Parliament will

be to cut taxes for the middle class and

again with nothing for the 1%

[Applause]

cheers for both passengers under new

Conservative government a person making

four hundred K in here will have been

more into the person making for dating

that's not an answer Shearer would

create a tax shelter for millionaires

that would let them save as much in

taxes and the average Canadian herbs in

a year that's not life
