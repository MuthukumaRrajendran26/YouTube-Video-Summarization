[Applause]

or in the water mr. Jeremy Corbyn Thank

You mr. speaker

I welcome today's vote Parliament has

clearly spoken or dare or apologist the

Prime Minister was heard yes he was

don't argue the toss with the chair I'm

telling you what the situation is and

everybody could detect the Prime

Minister was heard and the leader of the

Opposition will be heard it is a simple

and unarguable as that Jeremy Corbyn

give Mr Speaker I welcome today's vote

it's an emphatic decision by this house

that has declined to back the Prime

Minister's deal today

and clearly voted to stop a No Deal

crash out from the European Union the

Prime Minister must now comply with the

law he can no longer use the threat of

an Odile crash out to blackmail members

to support his sellout deal labour is

not prepared to sell out the communities

that we represent we're not prepared to

sell out their future

and we believe that ultimately the

people must have the final say on brexit

which actually only the Labour Party is

offering today is a historic day for

Parliament because it said it will not

be blackmailed by a prime minister who

is apparently prepared once again to

defy a law passed by this Parliament I

invite him to think very carefully about

the remarks he just made about refusing

apparently to apply for the extension

which the EU number-two act requires him

to do
