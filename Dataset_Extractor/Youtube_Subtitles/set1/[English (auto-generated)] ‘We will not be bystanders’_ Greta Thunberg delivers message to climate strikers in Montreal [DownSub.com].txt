Bonjour mommy al

[Applause]

sweet trailer Twitter web always debt

receive or Canada

okay back

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

so at least 500,000 here today you

should be very proud of yourselves and

because this we have done together and I

cannot thank you enough for being here

[Applause]

so around the world today millions of

people are marching right now and it's

just incredible to be united in such a

way for a common cause and it just feels

great doesn't it

[Applause]

but it feels great to be in Canada it's

a bit like coming home I mean you are

very similar to Sweden where I'm from

you have moose and we have moose you

have cold winters and lots of snow and

pine trees we have cold winters and lots

of snow and pine trees you have the

caribou we have the reindeer you play

ice hockey we play ice hockey you have

maple syrup and we have well forget

about that one

[Applause]

you're a nation that is allegedly a

climate leader

and Sweden is also a nation that is

allegedly a climate leader and in both

cases it means absolutely nothing

[Applause]

because in both cases it's just empty

words

and the politics needed are still

nowhere in sight

so we are basically the same last week

well over four million people in over

170 countries stripes for the climate we

marched for a living planets and a safe

future for everyone we spoke the science

and demanded that the people in power

would listen to and act on the science

but our political leaders didn't listen

this week

world leaders all around the world from

all around the world gathered in New

York for the UN climate action summit

they disappointed us once again with

their empty words and insufficient plans

we told them to unite behind the science

but they didn't listen

[Music]

so today we are millions around the

world striking and marching again and we

will keep on doing it until they listen

if the people in power won't take their

responsibility then we will it should

not be up to us but somebody needs to do

it they say we shouldn't worry that we

should look forward to a bright future

but they forget that if they would have

done their job we wouldn't need to worry

if they started acting in time then this

crisis wouldn't be the crisis it is

today

and we promise once they start taking

the responsibility and do their job

we will stop worrying and go back to

school go back to work at once again we

are not communicating our opinions or

political views the climate in

ecological crisis is beyond party

politics we are communicating in the

current best available science

to some people particularly in the those

who in many ways have caused this crisis

that science is too uncomfortable to

address but we who will have to live

with the consequences and indeed those

who are living with the climate and

ecological crisis already we don't have

a choice

to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius and

give us the chance to avoid the risk of

setting off irreversible chain reactions

beyond human control to do that we must

speak clearly and tell it like it is

tell the truth

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

in the IPCC's sr 1.5 reports that came

out last year it says on page 108 in

chapter 2 that to have a 67 percent

chance of staying below a 1.5 degrees of

global temperature rise the best odds

given by the IPCC the world had 420

gigatons of co2 left to meet back on

January 1st 2018 and today that figure

is already down to less than 350

gigatons with today's emissions levels

that remaining co2 budgets will be

entirely gone within less than eight and

a half years and please note that these

calculations do not include already

locked in warming hidden by toxic air

pollution nonlinear tipping points most

feedback loops or the aspect of equity

climate justice

they are also relying on my generation

your generation sucking one hundreds of

billions of tons co2 out of the air with

technologies that bam exists

and not once not one single time have I

heard any politician journalists or

business leaders even mentioned these

numbers they say let children be

children we agree let us be children do

your part communicate these kinds of

numbers instead of leaving their

responsibilities to us then we can go

back to being children but we are not in

school today you are not I work today

because this is an emergency and we will

not be bystanders

some would say we are wasting lesson

time we say we are changing the world

so that when we are older we will be

able to look our children in the eyes

and say that we did everything we could

back then

because that is our moral duty and we

will never stop doing that we will never

stop fighting for the living planets and

for a safe future for our future

we will do everything in our power to

stop this crisis from getting worse even

if that means skipping school or work

because because this is more important

[Applause]

we have been told so many times that

there is no point in doing this that we

won't have an impact anyway that we

can't have an impact and make a

difference I think we have proven that

to be wrong by now

[Applause]

through history the most important

changes in society have come from the

bottom up from grassroots and the

numbers are still coming in but it looks

like well over six point six million

people have joined the week for future

the strikes on this and last Friday

that is one of the biggest

demonstrations in history the people

have spoken and we will continue to

speak until our leaders listen and act
