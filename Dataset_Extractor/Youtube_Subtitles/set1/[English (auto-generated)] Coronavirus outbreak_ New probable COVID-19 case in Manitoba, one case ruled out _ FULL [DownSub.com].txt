good morning I'm Brent rusyn Manitoba's

chief provincial public health officer

an additional probable case of kovat 19

has been identified the newest probable

positive case is a man in his 50s who

lives in Winnipeg at this time the

public health investigation indicates

that this case is related to travel in

addition another case initially

described as probable has been ruled out

and will be removed from the from the

list this means our total lab confirmed

positive and profitable and probable

positive cases in Manitoba remains at 20

at this time today I'm strongly advising

all Manitobans including healthcare

providers to cancel or postpone any

non-essential travel outside of Manitoba

this travel advice is - regarding

international travel as well as travel

within Canada in keeping with our social

distancing strategies now is not the

time for essential travel in addition

effective today and going forward public

health officials are recommending that

anyone who returns from travel including

domestic travel should self isolate and

self monitor for symptoms for 14 days

after their return this recommendation

regarding interprofessional inter

preventional provincial travel does not

include the the commercial

transportation of goods or services

workers including healthcare workers who

may live in neighboring jurisdictions

who travel to or from Manitoba for work

or normal personal travel in border

communities for essential shopping or

visits to the cottages again reiterate

that now is not the time for

non-essential travel outside of Manitoba

if any returning traveler develops

symptoms within the 14-day period

they're advised to call health links for

assessment of the need for testing we

know that the vast majority of cases in

Canada and certainly all of our cases in

Manitoba are related to travel this is

why it's essential that Manitobans who

are returning from any travel

self isolate for 14 days I want to make

it clear that this is not just a

suggestion we have this in place because

the risk to Manitobans is real since all

of our cases so far have been imported

from travel we are appealing to people

Civic Duty's and public health advice to

follow these self-isolation guidelines

however the Public Health Act allows us

to issue orders if we find people are

not following our advice and putting the

risk of Manitobans at at risk my omens

reminded that public health orders

remain in effect at this time the public

health orders apply to public spaces not

to workplaces at this time however

workplaces have been advised to still

implement social distancing strategies

to reduce the impact of Cova 19 or

Matoba so school is out but I need to

remind Manitobans to continue practicing

social distancing this means staying at

home as much as possible do not arrange

in person playdates with other families

practice responsible social distancing

from others this includes not being in

close contact to others even outdoors

going for a walk and around the block is

ok visiting a park is ok but not crowded

venues at even outdoors we need to do

what we can to ensure we're all socially

distancing at this point certainly

socially distancing does not mean social

isolation ensure we're staying connected

with our loved ones especially those at

risk

we want to ensure during these difficult

times we remain connected to the people

we love Manitobans are reminded to

practice the three P's protect yourself

protect our loved ones and protect your

community to protect ourselves washing

our hands frequently avoiding touching

our face cancel or postpone your travel

and certainly don't attend any large

events protecting your loved ones

include coughing into your sleeve

sneezing into your sleeve avoiding large

cry

and disinfecting services regularly how

we can protect our community is to

practice social distancing stay at home

when you're ill stay at home when you

can for the most part cancel events and

use reliable sources of information we

know we are not helpless against this

virus we have many measures put in place

now Manitobans are well aware of the

rules that they can play and many men

and tobin's we see are implementing

these strategies and doing their part to

reduce the impact of kovat 19 on our

province i would note for the media that

we are committed to full and open

disclosure about cases and the

progression of the virus we are moving

to a one-a-day format for our news

bulletins we've heard that the multiple

bulletins released the day causes some

anxiety the schedules of getting the

test results back from the lab don't

always fit with those timelines so we'll

be reporting new cases daily going

forward and thank you at this time of

passive to Lynette thank you so I would

like to begin today by thanking Tim

Horton's who has been delivering coffee

and snacks to our testing sites

throughout Winnipeg for the past several

days this week this morning sorry they

were at Mount Carmel clinic as well as

access Winnipeg West and I understand

they'll be going to other service other

testing sites in the days ahead

we know the staff at the testing sites

across the province have been working

incredibly hard trying to make sure the

wait times are short and social

distancing measures are in effect so we

appreciate the work that they are doing

at the site and also just a special

thank you to Tim Hortons for showing

their appreciation and putting a smile

on the face of these hard workers just a

report on some of the stats from our

operations so healthlinks

received nearly 2,400 calls

yesterday the average wait times

continued to decrease and yesterday was

33 minutes

our online self-assessment tool received

about 35,000 views yesterday and overall

2,400 no wrong 240,000 views since it

launched on Tuesday the French version

has also been very popular and received

nearly 900 views online community sites

436 people visited the community testing

sites across the province yesterday so

that brings our total of 4,100 visits

since they opened on March 12th

additional locations across the province

are expected to open this week including

an inter Lake eastern and southern

health please remember that these are

not walk-in clinics people need to

receive a referral prior to going to

these sites and not everyone who is

screened will need to be tested

Manitobans are asked to call health

links to receive instructions as to

whether they require testing and where

to go

remember only those Manitobans with

respiratory symptoms and travel of

history history of travel need to be

seen at the screening sites as well as

if they've been in large events like

conferences or cruises or flights all

other Manitobans are asked to stay home

if they are ill a few updates for home

care so homecare workers are being asked

to screen clients in advance of home and

community visits so they will be asking

similar screening questions in terms of

if people are feeling ill if they have a

history of travel and this move is part

of our continuing efforts to reduce the

spread of Cova 19 and ensure that both

our providers and our patients remain

safe wherever possible home care workers

will screen the

clients over the phone in advance of any

normal appointments but they may also do

these screening questions in person

prior to entering a client's home

provided that appropriate social

distancing is in place screening will

identify if there's any potential

exposure to covet 19 within the

household it will also identify whether

service can safely be postponed or

offered in another way such as over the

phone or virtually if visits must occur

in person as scheduled home care workers

will be expected to wear their personal

protective equipment and follow proper

hand hygiene protocols I also just

wanted to give you update on our blood

supply in the last week Manitobans have

gone and donated and we are in a much

better position this week than we were

last week so thanks to all of you who

who took the time to donate the one area

where we still could use some more

supply is for those of you who have

owned egative blood if you have

o-negative blood please donate and

finally I just want to tell you a story

that came to my inbox yesterday and I

loved it so at the port Geary testing

site the MPI baizen Drive location over

the weekend there was a woman who had

just returned from traveling

internationally and she stopped in to

get herself tested probably wasn't

feeling well either and along the way

the staff realized that it was her

birthday that day so once they finished

her swab the entire staff broke out in

song and sang happy birthday to her and

although she probably didn't want to be

in the testing site for her birthday I

thought this was a great gesture on the

part of the staff to brighten her day

and and have some team camaraderie so

it's a great reminder that we should

continue to be kind to one another

even in these times of stress and

uncertainty and so thank you to Jillian

and all the people at MPI testing site

so I guess we'll open it up to questions

I don't know where they're coming from

thank you a portion of our greetings

thank you very much to Annette I would

now like to ask to ask one question and

a follow-up question and to please

introduce yourself as we move forward

we'll begin today with Canadian Press

reporter Kelly Malone hi the Canadian

crest so there's a lot of talk across

the country about expanding testing and

removing some of the regulations so that

it's not just connected to international

travel are there any plans in Manitoba

we we do have those those plans

certainly from the the beginning of our

response to this we know that testing is

is very important and so we're looking

at ways to increase our capacity we're

looking at ways to broaden our testing

parameters so right now we are are still

focused on those that are highest risk

those returning from international

travel those with symptoms of aspire to

our illness we've added certain people

who are critically ill will be testing

as well regardless of traveling for

right now those are our testing

guidelines but we are looking and have

plans in place to expand as as our

capacity permits you know we have the

cases in the country that that's just

because we're not testing to the level

that we should be I can speak to the the

concern that we're not testing as we

should be and that there's there's risk

in the community I can tell you from an

acute care perspective when we look at

the emergency visit

volumes when we look at the bed capacity

in medicine and critical care we are at

low volumes right now low occupancy

which tells us that not that we

shouldn't stop we should continue to be

vigilant but it's we're not seeing in

our hospitals at this time so the they

have been certainly prioritizing certain

groups of tests those health care

workers those who are critically ill

those in hospital as well as those from

a long-term care facility and and First

Nations those are being prioritized they

they do have a over the last few days a

backlog which they are moving towards

and were up and hopefully up and running

at full capacity early this week that's

changing by by the you know each run

that they go so I don't I don't know the

specific numbers right at the second

what can we say to allay the fears of

people who are talking about this they

want to know why they're not tested and

there's different reports of not report

but people are saying you know I'm a

nurse I haven't gotten tested

symptoms what is the message to people

who are wrestling with that questions

well so the messages that capacity is

increasing capacity we have been doing a

lot of testing we're over 4,300 tests as

since the beginning of this we've had

days where we're testing over 400 over

500 samples in a given day and that

capacity is coming up back up and so if

we look at is it likely that we have 500

symptomatic return travelers per day in

Manitoba I think that's a quite a high

number so we are testing a lot of

individuals and we're gonna continue to

try to expand that we have plans in

place on what priority groups would

would we expand to next but testing is

not the only method of surveillance we

have like Lynette was discussing we have

syndromic surveillance we have low ICU

demands right now lower demands and

hospital beds lower attendance at ER for

for respiratory illness we follow all of

these as well in addition our social

distancing strategies are are really

part of the the wide strategy testing is

only one component of a strategy testing

alone would not help us against kovat 19

we need all of our strategies working

together and social distancing again

staying home when you're ill if if you

are not tested for kovat 19 but you're

sick stay home until you're better

so we're not going to be spreading

viruses that way either

[Music]

for people that are requiring gaming

systems for care are they considered

essential workers and do they qualify

for child care under the regulations

right now or with doctors and nurses

there are some things that are done in

home care that are not essential

services but the work of the people they

are essential workers so we are looking

at this point in at identifying if we

had to decrease visits because of a

Kovan outbreak or because of a staffing

issue what kind of things would we

absolutely must continue to deliver in

terms of health care services so yes

they would be included but we are

considering still if we do have to

reduce what would those be so and it

would depend on the individual person

and what their needs are kiba's BBQ the

CBC here can you please be more specific

about the nature of the backlog in terms

of is it the PCR machine capacity is it

the ability your stockpile of reagents

isn't your staff technician pool please

go into specifics was what is holding it

up and what needs to be done to get the

maximum capacity out of that Kadim lab

right now the major roadblock is the

reagent and that is worldwide that's in

all jurisdictions having difficulties

obtaining that reagent Kadim lab has

been working at actually being able to

produce their own which is why they're

now getting out of this backlog and

getting back up to full capacity this

week all right

and are you looking at expanding past or

outside of PCR as a method of testing

some other jurisdictions are using other

forms of DNA testing or protein testing

forgive me lack of technical knowledge

what are you looking at beyond EPR right

now PCR is the is a diagnostic method of

choice there are different examples of

testing coming out now but most of them

will be using molecular samples certain

rapid testing as has been approved in in

United States by the FDA but again that

won't be to market for for quite some

time so we're the lab are continuously

looking for appropriate ways to to test

for this looking at ways to expand

testing and so we will leave them on

that to to update us if there's any

emerging ways to test

Patrick are you there let's move Ari

yeah what's on mute

sorry about that I think Foucault

radio-canada alright we've yeah we've

heard a few people telling us that their

their clinics so regular clinics for

everyday medical issues are closing

their doors are you aware of that

situation is that been sort of a trend

in the problem that is not from

direction from this table I would say so

I think it's individual providers if

that's what you're referring to they

would be making the decision for their

office practice there would there be

would there be any solution for these

people if their clinics are closed I

know I know it's I guess it's individual

decisions for for the clinics but if

they're what what can you what can you

tell to these people who are concerned

other clinics are going to be closed

yeah so well I'm not sure about the

clinics we can look more into that in

terms of the community services like

some of the rehab services and the day

activities that were provided by the

system

they were looking at options to do

virtually or at least have maybe smaller

groups so that the social distancing

could happen so that's that's some of

the strategies we've asked them to look

into in terms of the private clinical

provider I don't have those details but

we can maybe see what we can find out in

terms of what services have been

decreased

oh if I could just also say though if

patients aren't sure if they need

services and they're not sure where to

go they should be encouraged to call

health links and we can we can sort out

some of the issues and provide some

direction clarification who is enforcing

the state of emergency rule so who's

gonna be going out into the community

enforcing these

and where do people call if they see

something that they think might not be

following these rules an open and closed

rule right so right now it's the health

inspectors that are largely being

proactive reaching out to those affected

businesses and those affected by the

orders to encourage compliance to assist

with with advice on how they could

comply and so they there will be more

communications out to the public on

which pathway they could connect should

they have any any specific concerns okay

and then large offices that have more

than 50 people working in them so the

the public health order right now

applies to public spaces not to

workplaces so the order itself is not

being applied to workplaces but the the

strong recommendation now well over a

week old is that everyone should be

practicing social distancing so although

there may not be an order right now in

place

we are expecting all Manitobans to to

know their role on how they can help

with social distancing strategies so

employers we mentioned a number of times

ensuring sick workers are able to stay

home without a burden we don't want sick

workers coming to already burdened

health care systems for sick notes we

want to ensure that there's a easy way

that people who have been identified for

the need to self isolate can self

isolate you know otherwise then they'll

be coming to work when they should be

self isolating frequent hand-washing

finding ways to even know there might be

more than 50 people in a workplace

finding ways to encourage social

distancing allow some workers to perhaps

work from home

possible so all of these that's going to

apply differently in different

situations but we are fully expecting

all Manitobans to do their part in

helping us reduce the impact here Thank

You Michele next up is Google Winnipeg's

Monty Blount Global News right so this

is again related to to a response to the

pandemic we want to ensure that we have

adequate supplies of essential

medications we wanted to avoid an

instance where there was you know

hoarding of medications all at once

there is no need for fear panic we want

people to be prepared for that isolation

period if they should self isolate for

two weeks or maybe need to be at home if

they're ill for a couple weeks but

there's no need to to stockpile goods

there's no need to stockpile medications

and so we initiated that to to alleviate

the possibility of a of a shortage of

essential medications so these are all

things that are considered and just with

with many of our orders or

recommendations there are consequences

and in other aspects so right now we

moved that it was important to ensure a

stable supply of these medications but

we're reviewing all of the all of the

effects that it's that it has and will

we're constantly reviewing our policies

and we'll keep that all in mind

thank you money

teacher abuse bang a foxhole hi there

Guyana Bob call from 680 C gob just a

quick question on transit enforcing

social distancing on transit seems a

little bit difficult how is that being

done and how is it being enforced so

right now the public health orders are

for transportation facilities so

stations are the such so they don't

apply specifically to public transit

however having the social distancing

strategies in place now for a while we

see that much of that is taking care of

itself there's less people on the bus

and and we're not seeing that that

crowding there we will if we do see it

continuing to be an issue then then we

would work with our partners at the

municipalities to see how we could

enforce that but most of the strategies

are in place and we're not seeing that

that crowding okay and then on another

note we've been hearing that some people

can kind of have salons maybe in their

home are still open of course that

doesn't think and it's consistent with

the social distancing recommendations

what are what is your reaction to

someone who may be a private hairdresser

at home continuing to operate and would

there be any measures taken you kind of

clamp down on that kind of thing so

we're constantly reviewing our policies

comparing to other regions looking at

the the transmission dynamics in Canada

and other places so we'll be updating

our recommendations frequently with

these these type of issues we haven't

had orders that directly apply in that

circumstance right now that certainly

could change but social distancing

strategies are are multiple and there

are multiple levels so certainly the

recommendations for people in similar

circumstances would be not to attend

anyone who is showing symptoms of

respiratory illness not to attend anyone

who should be self isolating frequent

hand-washing ensuring social separation

between between other patrons and just

ensuring good

hand hygiene are pretty good protective

measures right now but like I say our

our orders are likely to to expand as

the as we see more and more transmission

around us in the nation yes this is a

drew it's Brandon son I know last week

two provinces spend it all non-essential

surgeries but what's the procedure for

non-essential diagnostics like an MRI or

an x-ray yeah that's a really good

question we're actually just working

through that protocol now and I should

be able to give you more details on that

in the next day or two follow-up but

with those is there concern that people

going in or a non-essential diagnose

procedure could be coming in with an

illness or ways to cope with 19 possible

that's a good question people should be

screening at the door that is one option

in the hospitals in the facilities and

then also asking people just to be aware

of have you traveled are you feeling

sick should you be out and about so

maybe talking to your physician or

calling healthlinks for what do you do

if you're feeling this and you're

scheduled for a test well we continually

review this certainly in remote isolated

areas where you know really concern

about higher risk individuals going

there so

who are who are requiring to self

isolates certainly in remote areas were

extra cautious from that but we have no

plans right now to to limit

interprovincial traveler intra

provincial travel right now we've been

working collaboratively with a lot of

First Nation groups and and leaders and

so the the actual testing sites you know

I mentioned is the the testing for kovat

19 is not a new test in any way they're

way to collect it though First Nations

test for influenza every year and so

it's the exact same collection exact

same process of collecting for that and

so they can just submit samples just in

that same manner same materials same

collection technique and just send it to

the lab so we're not necessarily going

to be notified of who does that we'll

just be running the samples should they

arrive at our lab appreciate it

let's head back to the top of the list

now for any follow-up question from

Canadian Press Kelly Malone Kelly are

you still there do you another question

yes I can I actually just get the

updated numbers a bit of clarification

on how many are confirmed and how many

are presumptive the as far as the as the

confirmed goes I believe we are at at 14

confirmed and six probable thank you

that's all my question Thank You Kelly

back to you Larry Cushman the big free

press to go back to what's happening at

Kadim provincial lab often together

number of attempts done I've been tears

account for Sunday could somebody tell

me that comes first Sunday and also

could you also in his layman's languages

you can repeat both you say about what

was holding up so I don't think I

received the the number of tests ran at

on Sunday at Kadim we're trying to

consolidate that testing and reported

out a couple times a week

the as far as what's holding it up is is

just the is the reagent so where they

the swab the material that's collected

on the swab is extracted and put into

this reagent that allows for the

multiplication of the of the genetic

material of the of the of the bug and

and that's the the process and it keeps

replicating it and replicating it until

it's finally detected and so the reagent

is is one of the requirements for for

running that test and so the I don't

know the the exact makeup of that

reagent there's a very technical but

that's what's the essentially worldwide

demand on that and every lab is facing

some demand issues with that and and

Kadim has been able to produce some of

its own which has gotten us this far

supply yeah I I don't know all the

components of the of the reagent alaria

it's the it's the they refer to it as

the reagent so I don't know if it's if

it comes all premade or or or what

exactly is in in that Thank You Larry

probable case is when that tests

positive at Kadim provincial lab but has

not yet been confirmed at the National

microbial

lab thank you thank you Larry the CBC's

Bartlett Evil's Brent dr. Grusin pardon

me Jason Kendra Chuck at the University

Manitoba as conservatively that social

distancing measures will likely be in

place for two to three months

conservatively in their mind

notwithstanding the provincial order how

long do you think some social distancing

measures are going to have to be in

place in Manitoba so it's difficult to

predict but the if we look at other

jurisdictions if we look at previous

evidence on how long these factors have

to be in place to make a substantial

difference and also taking in

consideration it's it's unlikely we're

going to have a pharmaceutical

intervention in in the near future then

we're looking at multiple weeks for sure

you define what you mean by multiple

week 350 no note no one can predict that

anyone who says they know the number is

is guessing so we will need to follow it

follow the dynamics where our thoughts

were to get way out of head of it and

really flatten that curve so that

perhaps there will be ways to to loosen

some of these social distancing

strategies but we we need to think of

multiple multiple weeks for this Thank

You Patrick yes that's right that would

be it's not related to the mode of

transport the only restrictions are

those people who come in to and from

Manitoba for work purposes those who

visit neighboring neighboring

communities for

for leisure for shopping and in certain

essential workers including health care

providers so the method of travel is not

really what's what's at stake there

what's the threshold for expanding in

the community to kind of say now we're

going to start taking more people who

don't have well all the testing issues

or capacity so if we had the capacity

right now then we could we could test as

many people as you want it so we don't

and so we we need to test people who are

highest at risk of this so we are

testing you know over 4,300 tests but

have come back at 20 of those as

probable or confirmed

so even testing the highest risk

individuals we still have a remarkably

low positive ratio proportion of tests

so we're going to continue testing the

highest risk as our capacity grows we

can expand emergencies like if somebody

sees people gathering in a group of more

than 50 or violating any of the

recommendations if it's a health

inspector they call and what's that

number because what police have been

saying is they've been getting called

about lilycove in nineteen so if I

health inspectors that have been been

reaching out and we will be having some

communications going out shortly giving

multiple streams of avenues for people

to to report certain certain issues or

have certain questions so that will be

coming as we enhance our public health

orders then will will be engaging with

other

other municipalities other agencies to

see exactly how how our enforcement

could be could be expanded and again

most times having Public Health orders

in place regular communication

Manitobans knowing what's expected of

them

almost everyone will will follow those

types of things as we as we keep going

forward but we we have to have methods

for enforcement and that's what the

orders allow us and then we will and we

have ways of looking into it and

enforcing as well yeah just a quick

question on a chair are either of you

aware of any daycares that were open

today for essential service workers

standing that 85% of the health care

workers have been able to successfully

find or

have daycare in place and then we have

provided phone numbers for people so

that are and they can also go to their

employer if they're having any

challenges in getting daycare when they

have to go to work then they can contact

their their employer and we will connect

with the Department of families to make

sure that their placement is a priority

okay I mean just a quick second question

I noticed you have switched from the

presumptive probable in terms of

terminology or unconfirmed but suspected

cases is there any reason behind that

the only reason is really keeping in

line with how the public health agency

of Canada is reporting they report as as

probable and confirmed thank you

Thank You Diana I'm the brand and Sundra

me are you still on and you have a

follow-up question I am thank you um

it's just a quick question but um

limit you were saying earlier that there

would be some more testing sites opening

later this week do you have any more

information on where exactly those

testing sites will be I know there will

be some in Interlake eastern and

southern later this week and in

discussion with Prairie mountain they

are looking their volumes are actually

fairly low at the testing sites that

they have available now so they're

looking at the location and the demand

and we'll work on that over the coming

days and I don't anticipate there will

be more within Northern Regional Health

Authority at this time but as was

discussed the testing can be done on the

First Nations community at the nursing

stations as well as the PAS Flin Flon

and Thompson thank you very much are

there any further questions I will open

it up now let's please try not to step

on each other's toes here and yes please

but we keep it sir CBC all right what

are the hospital capacity right now in

this era deucey can you express it in

percentage terms and what's her rate of

beds per thousand people right now how

many people wedding events can you give

us a general state of our preparedness

right now prior to the surgery and the

cases right well I I feel like we are

we've done a lot of work in the past six

weeks getting ready for this so I can

tell you we are very prepared but the

preparations are going to continue to go

on and they're getting more detailed as

we go so yeah so I'm just looking at my

data was that Bartley Bartley so my

records show that at this time there are

a hundred and thirty-one medicine beds

in Winnipeg that are open and the ICU

capacity is just under 80 percent which

is we don't see those numbers very often

so that's that's quite low but

regardless where we're looking for in

terms of preparation looking at our

baseline and making sure we use all our

baseline but also have the ability to

expand beyond that capacity thank you

[Music]

that's correct so the in fact the the

case that we could not link to to travel

or could not linked to any exposure was

in fact the the test that is now

negative not a not a positive result so

that was the the false positive test

that I mentioned earlier I'm just

wondering at some point to but is there

plans in place to use or you have

different sites that would be built or

maybe use the arena per se two to ten a

house you know people patients those

discussions are underway and we are

looking at partners we'll give you

update on that when we get some more

detail I think it's important to know

too that the majority of people who get

Cova 19 don't require hospitalization

but they do require isolation so your

question about should they be in an

arena we do have to look at

places ways to cohort patients who are

infected it doesn't mean they need to be

in the hospital it it means they need to

be in isolation but absolutely for those

who do need to be hospitalized we are

doing everything in our power right now

to look at staffing models supplies

equipment and space so that we can

expand as the need demands thank you

well and in fact that one individual has

now been discharged so we don't have any

of our current cases of hospitalized or

the Kiva's here CBC if dentists or the

construction industry wish to donate

masks that are n95 where could they do

so we have a 1-800 number it's on our

shirt health webpage but I can get that

to you where we are working with

partners and accepting donations for

supplies send that to you Bartley thank

you very much again are we thinking the

number of folks that you're allowing to

gather in groups yes so we're continuing

to to review our social distancing

strategies and and the public health

orders so it's we are having plans in

place to to escalate some of those

orders and one of them will be that to

that number of people allowed together

we were still still reviewing

other jurisdictions still reviewing what

what we think will work here based on

our outbreak so more to come on that I

have to talk just one more Ellie Malone

pretty impressive one more clarification

question you mentioned that any person

that had the false positive test just

trying to update my spreadsheets here

but can you give us a little bit of idea

of who that person was because that date

came out we got a concert people

man-woman age range it it was a female

I don't know offhand the the age range

on that individual it was an individual

that we were unable to link to travel or

to contact to another case and so that

now has been been removed as a as a as a

probable case right so the the test

performed that makes it probable at that

Kadim lab had came back at a very very

low level positive it we were unable to

get a confirmed test at the National

micro lab we then retested the sample at

Kadim it was again negative and then in

fact the delay was that we went out and

tested that individual again and that

retest came back negative at Kadim lab

so based on all of that we've determined

it was a not a positive test the first

time around and they're being told that

even if you have it don't go for attack

and why would that be

because the the symptoms of covet 19 are

they're the same symptoms as the flu or

many other respiratory illnesses so we

are linking the high-risk individuals

who have Kovan 19 with testing so those

who are contact two cases or those who

have returned from international travel

so that's where our capacity is to test

right now the advice is if you're unwell

stay home and so the the issue of

spreading infections even if that's a

different type of viral infection it's

still dealt with and not in that manner

if you're sick stay home if you have

mild symptoms stay home if you have

traveled internationally if your contact

to a case then certainly we want to

attest but even then we're seeing a very

low proportion of our tests in even in

that group of individuals coming back oh

I'm sorry

all the way to get yep so so we had to

because of the capacity due to the

reagent at the lab we had to prioritize

certain groups that I mentioned

healthcare workers people who admitted

to hospital long term care facilities

and such people with mild symptoms that

were tested were those tests might have

been a few days we're hoping that back

moving into this week we're gonna get

that back to the 24 to 48 hours thank

you very much that wraps up our session

today thank you all for participating in

our briefing and we will continue to let

people cope I do care
