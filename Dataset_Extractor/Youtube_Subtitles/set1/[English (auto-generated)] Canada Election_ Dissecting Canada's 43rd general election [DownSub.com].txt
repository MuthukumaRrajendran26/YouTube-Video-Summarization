our chief political correspondent David

akin was with us last night analyzing

the election results for seven hours on

live TV David now that you've had some

time to reflect what happens next how

does this liberal minority government

work and are they already building

bridges to some of the other parties the

leaders are not talking yet among

themselves about how this minority will

work but there is some activity at the

staff level primarily between the NDP

and the Liberals really preliminary

stuff to say what sort of form would

this take would it be a one-off basis on

every confidence boat vote or is there a

deal I think the NDP would be inclined

to try to see if they could work a deal

out to get some stability for this

Parliament it might be in the Liberals

interest to the block leader if Francois

Blanchette he's not interested in any

formal deals and I don't think the

Liberals are either the BQ will just

deal things and would deal with things

in a case by case basis is there any

likelihood do you think of the Liberals

and the Tories working together on

anything well let's think about that

pipeline expansion which we know that

the NDP opposes and the Conservatives

say that's a project in the national

interest I can't see the sheer

conservatives voting against the

pipeline I think they put national

interest ahead of partisanship but if

ever ever came to it now do we know why

last night Justin Trudeau began speaking

before Andrew Shearer was finished

actually they almost he almost took over

and Russia had been up for a couple of

minutes and Trudeau Russian it was a

couple of minutes and it was 35 seconds

and it looked crass it looks good it did

and we've asked the parties about that

today and here's what they're saying you

take it for what it's worth the Liberals

say they were trying to find out what

Shearer was doing trying to contacts

your staff unsuccessfully and that

there's nothing to see here there wasn't

intentional don't read to anything into

it

and that's what the Liberals say the

Conservatives say baloney it was

intentional it doesn't really get the

forty-third Parliament off to a great

start if the 43rd Parliament everybody

has to get along start working together

David akin thanks thanks
