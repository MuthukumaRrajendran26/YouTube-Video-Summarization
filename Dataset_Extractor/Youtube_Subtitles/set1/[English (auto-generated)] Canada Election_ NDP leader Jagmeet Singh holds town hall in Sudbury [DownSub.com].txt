duncanemma CF on spoke to Joe Kaiama

agnesi book

so friends we are here today to talk

about affordability

now affordability means a lot of things

to a lot of people for some people means

being able to afford medication and with

a cost of medication going up and being

so expensive that is a massive question

of affordability for some people it's

being able to go to the dentist and for

millions of Canadians they can't afford

to go to the dentist and it is a massive

question of affordability especially for

families they've got kids and they can't

afford for them to go housing he's a

massive question of affordability you

can't find a home to live in a place to

call home

I mean everything else seems to be

secondary if you can't find a place to

live and if rent is expensive and finds

expensive that's another question of

affordability so I think about why we're

in this position why it's kind of

getting tougher and tougher for people

to make ends meet we look at the economy

and the economy seems to be booming but

I ask you who is it booming for because

it's not blooming for everybody right

there's certain people that are doing

really well at the top there's

corporations making billions and

billions of money dollars at the top

making money at the top but people are

having a harder time to get by and I

think about why that is well you have to

look too far you look to Ottawa and you

look at liberal or conservative

governments and you look at their track

record they've consistently regularly

chosen to make life easier for the very

top for the well-connected insiders it's

easier and easier for them and it's

harder for everyone else and so one

concrete example the cost of medication

well mr. Trudeau said he would lower the

cost of medication in 2015 with one

simple step the board that sets the

prices for medication they asked for a

new set of countries to compare to and

if we had a different set of countries

to compare prices we could lower the

cost of medication by up to 20%

now four years went by and mr. Trudeau

broke the promise it didn't do it and we

wondered why didn't he do it

why didn't he lower the cost of

medication

to be an easy thing to do what who

wouldn't have cost us anything why did

he break that promise well we did a

little research guess how many times the

big pharma lobbyists met with mr.

Trudeau's government well guess how many

times in four years 37 that's a lot of

times even higher even higher than 50

even or than 60 they met with them over

600 times yes the Big Pharma met with

mr. Trudeau's government over 600 times

and guess what happened to that promise

that would have lower the cost of

medication for Canadians down the drain

that's a good line I shouldn't use that

word down the drain the promise went

down the drain because they'd rather

protect the profits of Big Pharma and

now guess what's happening right before

an election yeah well guess what mr.

Trudeau is promising again he says oh

I'm gonna bring down the price of

medication I'm gonna do that thing I

said I'd do four years ago I'm gonna do

it now

how can we believe him now how do we

know that after he promises now to do it

that after he gets elected

big pharma lobbyists come in again and

say hey don't do it it's gonna hurt our

profits

he doesn't cave in again and that's the

thing with liberals and conservatives

you get again and again governments that

don't choose to help people they help

those at the top we have got to change

that and we are going to change that

together

so I'll leave it there there's a lot

that we want to do and I'll get into

that but I wanted to spend more time

hearing your questions so I'll wrap it

up there we're gonna do a lot together

I'm really excited I feel like there's

an energy that's building a lot of folks

want things to happen differently and I

think we can do that I'm confident we

can do it I'm confident we can change

things around so I'll about to come back

up and we'll start ask answering your

questions Beth thank you there I think

Beth is gonna find someone with the mic

because we've got a mic in the crowd and

they're there it is okay and our friend

of the crowd is gonna help with Beth and

coordination they're gonna help find the

people hi by the way is Judy come fine

find the folks hi

just one moment I wrote down my question

sorry about that okay so my name is

Sarah Cutler Pudsey and I have a

six-year-old son who's autistic in light

of the announcement made today that our

service provider which is CCR child and

community resources who is the primary

service provider for autistic youth and

their families in Northern Ontario that

they will no longer be able to offer fee

for service therapies due to layoffs and

job uncertainty which are in direct

correlation with the devastating changes

made by the Ontario Conservative

government to the Ontario autism program

needs are at an all-time high for

families and children youth and adults

on the autism spectrum a federal autism

strategy has never been more important

my question is how can you ensure that

the federal autism strategy which has

been placed on your election platform

will be made a priority and what will

the program look like as well as will

actually autistic people parents of

children with autism and autism

professionals be primary consults in

ensuring a fair and equitable

implementation of the programming thank

you very much for the question

[Music]

so thank you for ringing that up and and

first of all I'm really sorry about

what's going on right now it is really

tough for for families with autistic

kids it's really tough and and this is

just an example of what conservatives do

I mean these are some of the most

vulnerable kids kids that need supports

families that need help and instead of

providing the help that you and your

family need mr. Ford said he was for the

people but he must have got the word

people mixed up he's for the powerful

corporations not for the people and he

cut the services that the kids need and

it's been devastating I've heard

heartbreaking stories I didn't know that

that was just announced today but that

makes it even harder for people in the

North who are already having a hard time

getting services it makes it even harder

so we know we've got to do a lot more

this is just wrong what's happening and

that's what we're gonna step up we're

conservative governments are cutting

services we're gonna stop up and

reinstate those services so what we're

planning to do is we need to work and

your question was will we work with

experts and Families yes

we want to develop a national strategy

that takes into consideration there

might be conservative government's that

come in that slash funding and slash

services we need to have a national

strategy that provides support to

families when they're in need so we'll

work with you work with experts and

we'll develop a national plan so that

families don't get left behind because

we cannot let you get left behind

[Applause]

Hey

so picking up on the health care

question I'm of an age where my family

members and friends are all starting to

use the healthcare system a lot more

they've worked all their lives they've

had a benefit package and they really

believed that they were going to be

taken care of but they get into the

hospital and then they find that the

daily rate is much higher than their

benefit package they find that their

medications aren't even covered when

they're in the hospital I had to go out

and buy tylenol for my sister when she

was in hospital they certainly don't get

any help with mobility devices that they

need so they can stay in their own homes

and there is no place for them in

long-term care the waiting list is just

so long people are getting actually I

believe shunt it off to rehab when

they're nowhere close to rehab but

that's a bad and that's where they're

put and it's completely inappropriate

I had to go out and seek help from the

legions poppy fund to get mobility

devices so my mom could stay in her own

home you know these are things that

should not be happening in our Canada

and I'm wondering what are you going to

do exactly to address those issues thank

you so much for the question so you

touched on a lot of health care concerns

and and these are these are really

troubling trends and the fact that your

sister had to go through that and you

had to go get her medication I mean that

is not what we expect from our health

care system but you're not alone I mean

this is what's happening across Canada

because what's happened over the years

there used to be a 50/50 split between

the federal government and the

provincial governments the federal

government will put up half the funding

and then provincial governments will put

up half but over the years that's eroded

over the years conservative and liberal

governments have chosen to make other

things a priority tax cuts for powerful

corporations last year 14 billion

dollars to corporations that wanted to

buy

Britt jets and limos that became a

priority and they keep on cutting down

on the amount that we invest in health

care so now what used to be 5050 the

folks roughly know what it is now that's

right it's 75 25 you're absolutely right

so 70 so used to be 50/50 now imagine

provinces are having to do with half of

what they used to get from the federal

government effectively actually have a

critic here that can and she's nodding

so I feel okay from shelling us I was a

little nervous and I said the figure I

was uh Ron's gonna correct you buddy

stand up and correct me I'd welcome that

though but yeah it's been a massive cut

and so what that meant is is that you

know the service that used to be there

for families and you expect when you

bring your loved one in they get the

services they need are not there and so

we want to turn that around we need to

invest in our health care system you

know Tommy Douglas had a dream Canadians

had a dream that if you're sick it

shouldn't be your salary or your income

status or your job status shouldn't

determine the care you get it shouldn't

be out of pocket everyone in our country

deserves dignity and respect

so so the first step we're gonna do the

first step immediately what we're gonna

do in one year we're gonna pool our

money together

we're gonna go to each province and say

for the same of money the same amount

that you spend right now on buying

medications for hospitals for the same

amount we're gonna put in an amount

about nine billion dollars and we're

gonna fund you know Universal Pharma

care plan that will mean that if you

need medication in our country you use

your health card not your credit card

everyone deserves coverage and that's

what we're gonna make happen okay hey

how's it going Jake yeah that's great

I'm a union worker here I work

underground and one of the things that

my brothers and sisters are concerned

about our pension faith and some

deferred compensation like health care

plans and we're seeing employers and

provincial governments legislate and

limit our ability to collect a bargain

fairly and really just attack pensioners

have put in 30 years of service and work

their whole lives for those kind of

pensions if we are to elect a federal

@dp what kind of things can you do to

reinstate workers rights and and help

protect some of those deferred earnings

for sure thank you for the question it's

really important what you're describing

is is is horrible if you think about it

you've got people that are working their

whole lives they spend their whole lives

working and contributing to a company

and when that company goes bankrupt the

folks that you know the folks have spent

all their their hard their lives working

hard are they the priority no but all

the wealthy financier xand big banks and

creditors they become the priority I

mean that makes no sense they're already

wealthy and powerful why are we making

their wealth more the priority than

working people so we have

we have a bill that we put forward by

Scott Duvall yeah powerfully needs a

steelworker too so and Scott Duvall put

forward a bill where we could solve this

problem if a company goes bankrupt

workers shouldn't be at the bottom of

the priority workers should be at the

top of the prize and you said something

really important when a company doesn't

pay a worker their pension and creditors

and finance us get the money first

that's pension theft that is stealing

from workers we're gonna end pension

theft so Beth will have someone to come

around in the front it's Beth espana but

whoever you got

you pick him out Beth we got two runners

I'll run around um one day

naqshi - I have two kind of really

important questions about two very

vulnerable parts of society that are

kind of getting stinted one why can't a

disabled person get married without

losing their benefits whether fully or

personal common-law or engagement why

why should those why shouldn't they be

allowed to live with the people they

love mm-hmm like why should they in some

cases be forced to move entire cities

and provinces apart mm-hmm it's not fair

mm-hmm what are you gonna do to prevent

to prevent that stop that from being a

thing because it's ridiculous and in

humanizing mm-hmm thank you very much

thank you for pointing out the right

pronouns as well I appreciate that and I

thank you for having courage to talk

about something that you know it takes

courage to ask a question in front of a

room full of people so thank you for

doing that it takes courage you're right

I mean to put it bluntly you're right

why is it that it's being discriminated

against that folks who are living with

disabilities see that they're being

discouraged in fact from living with a

person they love or choosing to get

married and it's it's really unfair

we've got to find a way to solve it

this is something that happens at the

provincial level and I'm gonna try to

see what I can do with the federal but

but I hear you and it is a problem and

it shouldn't happen that way thank you

I know what James has got someone back

here yes my name is Keith lovely hey

Keith I'm an immigrant Hey that's I seen

Candice since 1945

welcome I've served my country I've been

married for 55 years I'd like you to

raise the the issue of immigration

we need more immigration in this country

it's kind of one of those like hard

touching moments Thank You Keith that's

beautiful oh yeah we do yes yes yes yes

we do you're absolutely right we love it

I love Keith that you said that it's a

powerful message you know Canada's a

beautiful place and we are stronger

because people have come here and built

up this country together and I think

we're all thankful for that that's a

beautiful thing Thank You Keith I can't

add anything more than what you said yes

you're beautiful and thank you for

saying that

[Applause]

my name is Chris and I was the legal

clinic here at Sudbury the they were

quite right about people being forced to

give up their only income if they marry

because if they receive provincial

disability and they get married then the

spouse is expected to support them they

have no further income of their own even

though they're incapable of earning and

nothing has been done about that since

1997 about time there's bits of change

as I say I work at the legal clinic so

serious I see people who are having huge

problems maintaining a roof over their

head trying to get an income or to

maintain an income again with nearly

impossible rules and trying to get legal

help that's enormous cuts to legal aid

try to get an education people are

having to give up their University

because they can't go back because Oh

saps not high enough it oh yeah big one

now all of these things are provincial

issues and we know very well that we're

even with France's best efforts it's

going to be 2022 before we can put Doug

fraud where he belongs

in times past when the federal

government made transfer payments they

specified where the money was to go but

now I can't remember how much I've been

around for some years I don't remember

just how long ago they stopped they

detach the strings and made it just a

lump sum payment you do what you want

with it well an awful lot of provinces

have proved conclusively they can't be

trusted to do what they want with it now

don't get me wrong I would love to see

you as our next prime minister but even

if you are not our next prime minister

if you hold the balance of power what

sort of things are you going to be able

to do to get us the things we need sure

sure and that's a big one yeah I hear

you thank you for the question

I appreciate your your being Frank with

me but if I could be frank as well I

know how much people need someone that's

gonna fight for them the rich have had

someone fighting for them for too long

so I am in this election to run to

become prime minister of this country to

make it

you touch them thank you you touched on

a lot of really good points there's a

lot that we can do though directly and

so I want to touch on some of the things

you mentioned students here is a really

clear contrast something that we can do

directly on day one so we looked at when

students go to university and then they

graduate they graduate with a lot of

debt it's really tough for a lot of

students and what happens on top of that

debt there's interest as charged and

then interest isn't just prime it's

often prime plus two point five prime

plus three yeah prime plus three so

you've got students that have debt and

then they have interest that's PI prime

plus three that's more than banks charge

so effectively liberal and conservative

governments are making money off of

student debt that is outrageous and then

I looked at the track record of our

friend mr. Trudeau last year this is

astonishing last year mr. Trudeau's

government waved six billion dollars in

corporate loans so they said six billion

dollars that corporates had loans that

corporations owned they waved those

loans they said okay they're forgiven

but they charged over four years they

charged students the cumulative amount

of three billion dollars so they charged

three billion dollars from students but

they effectively gave 6 billion to

corporations that is that that is the

exact contrast that we're faced with I

can tell you I'm sure you don't have to

doubt this but I'm tell you they're all

straight up right looking right at you a

first day of a new democratic government

the first thing we'll do on day one is

waive all interest for student debt

right away

and we're gonna make the corporations

pay their loans oh there's no thanks

Beth Laura Schara I've been retired now

for 20 years but I've had some very

hard-earned experience in the field of

workmen's compensation and I have

discovered that in a bad experience it

sounds like that's an Ontario our

Charter of Rights and the Constitution

of Canada is not worth the paper it's

written on

and I can offer you a way to change that

and show the Liberals and conservative

exactly what they're giving us okay and

the simplest way to do that is simply

have your attorney general elected by

the people so they can't control them

thank you okay

thank you for your suggestion Sika

Canada question France a pastor say

cavia beaucoup de Francophonie CA

Sudbury dong Cebu Z with a vindication

of can say on a plate that apart which

is she play a harp on a flossy okay Mona

ping

and on the current review they had a

really hard woman who knew everything

about finance and she tried to get

answers from the government about the

financialization by the banks of

residents in other words you take an

apartment building and you buy it and

then you put a couple of things in it

and then you sell it you know flip it

and sell it and nobody can't afford it

anymore and people are on the street

yeah so she really tried to get answers

she tried to get financial answers from

the government and I forget her name

that it was a really good program and

she said she came away unset unsatisfied

like she didn't get any answers from

government and you walk down the street

and you're seeing people in stairwells

all over the place with no place to go

in the wintertime yeah and if you're in

Toronto they're living on The Grates

yeah now this is Canada for heaven's

sake you mean to tell me if there are

some people who are afflicted with

mental illness that I get but all of

these people are not and I've even fed

people on the street why do we are they

able to do this with housing this and

that was the lead this morning for you

on the news media that you were going to

talk about housing yes let's talk about

it's great question really appreciate

that

thank you I love the passion that's

awesome that's why that's good

thank you to our elders no it is

appalling you're absolutely right and

and that's how we got to think about it

I mean we live in a really wealthy

country and you're absolutely right

there's there's no reason why we can't

build a system where everyone can have a

place to call home like there's no

there's no reason I don't accept any

excuse where we can't do it and so what

we're gonna do is a couple things first

of you taught you touched on this that

there's properties becoming

financialized i like the way you said

that school I'm gonna quote you on that

what's actually happening is you're

absolutely right prices homes are

getting more and more expensive and it's

going at a skyrocketing rate and there's

some things that we can do to stop it so

some of the reasons why that's happening

is people are just dropping their money

into Canada and using housing like a

stock they put their money in a house

knowing the Canada's stable and they see

the house value go up and up or they buy

a condo and the white and see its price

go up and up and what's happening is

it's driving people out of ever being

able to own a place so there's a couple

things we can do this has worked in BC

the BC government's done this they put

in a foreign buyers tax because they saw

a lot of folks that were just using the

Canadian housing market as like a stock

exchange and we don't want that we want

our housing to be used for people to

live in it not as a stock exchange and

so the foreign buyers tax meant that if

you were a permanent resident or a

citizen you can buy a place but if

you're just putting your money here to

to try to keep it in a stock then that's

not allowed we want to put that in place

at the federal level as well so we

didn't pose a federal buyers tax

federal foreign buyers tax that would

stop that the second thing which is a

pretty astounding when you think about

it

BC also found this out then

money-laundering was driving up the cost

of housing significantly and they found

there was about five percent of the

rising cost of housing was because of

money laundering alone that they could

account for and a lot of it they can't

actually figure out a lot of they can't

account for and they said it's actually

even more of an issue as you had east so

it's impacting Ontario and other

provinces prairies Atlantic provinces so

what we want to do to stop that is what

we need to do to ensure that we're

tackling money-laundering is at the

federal level we've got a department

that works on this and I asked the

question in Parliament I said well we've

got a department but we just learned

that they're not actually doing any

cases on money laundering and then mr.

Trudeau's answer I'm sure you can guess

was not to answer but this is a serious

issue we can tackle money-laundering so

that's what we're gonna do we're gonna

make sure we count down on money

laundering on speculation and make sure

we control the price of housing from

going out of control the final thing

though is we need to build more

affordable housing and the federal

government hasn't done that in like 30

years

if you look around communities where

there's co-ops or nonprofit housing

housing that's affordable it was built

in the last it was built in the 90s and

after that there hasn't been any new

bills so we need to build affordable

housing that's cooperative and non

market and nonprofit so there's an

affordable rental option for people

that's not one where they're worried

about ever maybe being kicked out by

landlord but something that's not for

profit that's non market that's

cooperative so that people can have the

confidence of knowing you can find a

place to call home you can live there

the rents don't cost the same as a

mortgage they're affordable and then

people have an option we can change this

country and build more affordable

housing and we're committed to doing it

I fancy excellent leadership no the

/ Seoul Viacom of a regulated problem I

just want to touch on the question real

quick okay I'm gonna touch down that

question real quick in in in English as

well the question was really beautiful

about the problem of the drug epidemic

in Canada and how young people we've got

a beautiful country you have a beautiful

kind of intro around a beautiful country

that we live in but young people are

dealing with this problem of drugs and

and people are being treated with the

criminal justice system when they

actually need rehab and they need

supports and they need healthcare they

need help they don't need to be put in

jail they need to be put in rehab and so

that's what our response is gonna be the

old approach hasn't worked thousands of

Canadians have died because of the

opioid crisis we can't continue doing

the same thing hoping a different result

will happen we want to save lives I

remember my dad he was living with an

addiction and it was pretty horrible he

he lost a lot of weight at the end of

the addiction he couldn't eat anymore

he went from 180 pounds strong guy to

100 pounds

I remember lifting him in my arms and he

felt like a little kid and when your dad

feels like a kid like that it's just

heartbreaking and we didn't have any

access to private insurance my family

and my dad had gone through tough time

lost his job and it was a

publicly-funded rehab center that had a

bed available that took him in and he

got better

it saved his life and it helped our

family it saved our family in a lot of

ways and that's why I believe

passionately that every single person in

our country should have access to the

care they need it should not matter on

their their salary it should not matter

their job they should be able to have

the access to care they need everyone in

our country

I'm gonna mana being a half Kashmiri

first of all I want to thank your for

standing for the rights of my people

while they are being denied the basic

human rights while Trudeau and she

remained silent you took the courage to

speak for the right side I thank you for

that and my question is that being an

international student also international

students are important part of the

Canadian immigration policy they have to

pay three or four times the fee well

they can only work for 20 hours a week

the most of them cannot afford that

tuition fee so consequently they have to

work illegally which leads to the

exploitation and also the evasion of the

text by the employers so I urge you to

make a policy for the to improve the

conditions of the international students

in Canada thank you thank you so much

thank you for the question

and you're absolutely right I mean we we

really value people who choose to come

to Canada

new students that come here are

contributing to the economy they're

there working in our communities they

are spending money in our communities

it's an investment and it's something

that helps us out but a part of the

problem is is the cost of tuition is so

high and that cost of tuition is high

for for young people in general but it's

particularly high for international

students and so we've got to tackle that

and we're gonna make it more affordable

the other thing you touched on is that

you know when students come here they

have to they have a limited number of

hours they work

it's puts a lot of strain on the

students so we've got to find a way a

better way forward we all heard the

story of a student that worked 30 hours

a week and then was getting deported

because of that and and that's pretty

heartbreaking that's a pretty horrible

story so we've got to find a better way

the other thing I think is that if

student comes to Canada and gets

educated here it should count towards

their immigration they've they've

learned the system they've gotten

trained in Canada they should have an

easier path for it so I think that's

something that we should look at as well

but on the tuition fee thing I I didn't

get to touch on this this will help

international students but also you know

students that are here in Canada as well

I touched on day one ending the the

interest on on student loans and that's

important but then students also still

feel the weight of that they still feel

the crush of the cost of tuition and I

remember when I was going through that

tough time I talked about I was able to

make my way out of it because I was able

to go to to law school and for me when I

went to law school it was eight thousand

dollars a year tuition and that same law

it was not too bad actually and I was my

family my dad was you know my mom and

dad had to declare bankruptcy and they

were going through lots of financial

difficulty so I I had to be very careful

about the choices I made so going to law

school for eight thousand a year made

sense but that same law school today

rough guess how much it cost someone

just jump right to the number didn't let

me build up my story but

what that was pretty close it's getting

close to 30,000 buzz I went to ask it so

it's getting close to 30

so just for a degree you're getting

close to $100,000 just to get a degree

and that's not even factoring all of

your costs I can tell you with all

honesty I would have never done it and I

don't think I'm just one person you know

I wouldn't have gone on to to become the

leader of a national party but I think

about all the young people that could

contribute so much not just me I'm just

one person imagine all the young people

that aren't choosing to pursue their

dreams

because it cost too much not because

they don't the passion the drive and I

feel like we're we're missing out on

what they could contribute so not only

do we want to waive tuition interest on

student debt we want to replace loans

with grants we want to go one step

further we want to work towards a

country where from your kindergarten to

your career there's no barriers the kids

can pursue any education

thank you we got time for a more Oh No

is there with someone give us a signal

we have one more okay okay who are you

want to give it to them okay it's I'm

sorry we can't get everybody I'm sorry I

love that there's so many people

interested I just want to speak on

behalf of homeless youth I'm involved

with the Sudbury Action Center for youth

we deal with kids with addictions we

deal with kids who are homeless on the

street and we know for a fact that that

the number of homeless is increasing the

number of shelter beds has gone down and

the numbers waiting has gone up we have

a young girl who is 18 years old with a

two month old baby who's been staying at

one of the shelters in town and is being

pressured every day to get out and when

she was asked where she would go she'd

say well I'll be on the street with my

two month old baby and this is not right

these kids need places to stay they

can't get their their act together if

they don't have some what some place to

go home to

that's so true you know your story is

that's a heartbreaking story I mean that

that's that's how bad things have become

that we've got a young person's opting

to choose between a shelter or the

streets I mean that is a failure of a

policy that's a failure of our of our

country and that's why we want to change

that like we cannot continue down the

same path we have to invest right now in

building housing we have to build our

plan is to make up for those 30 years of

inaction we want to build half a million

new affordable homes across this country

immediately we've got to get to work so

friends thank you so much

thank you Beth thank you I really

appreciate it we're gonna we're I really

appreciate all of you for being here so

much and our amazing candidate Beth Rob

love as well

the media questions Annie Bergeron

Oliver with CTV national news

hi Annie high in Vernor today I spoke to

a few voters and they said they like you

they like your policy they like the NDP

but they also told me they were not

ready to vote for a prime minister who

wears a turban how frustrating is it to

hear these types of racist comments from

voters and what would you say to them

you know I believe in Canada I believe

in Canadians and I believe Canadians are

ready for someone who's gonna put them

first we've seen liberals and

conservatives continue to take people

for granted you know liberals think that

they're gonna get in once and then

consider this think after all we'll just

get in afterwards and they're really

just taking Canadians for granted I'm

not gonna take Aditi's for bad and

granted New Democrats never do that we

fight for people we're in there on their

side in their corner and I'm gonna make

sure people know that if you want

someone's gonna fight for you build the

housing take on the telecom companies

take on the big pharma

I'm gonna do that our team's going to do

that

hi mr. sang Hanna Thibodaux CBC national

news

hi Hanna hi I want to follow up on

Annie's comments there and I heard some

of the similar things unfortunately do

you consider these comments racist

so when I said we see something I think

that you know there's there some

prejudice the existence Society I've

been told a lot in my life I've been

told that because of the way I look that

I couldn't advance in my in my career

I've been told that because of the way I

look I couldn't get ahead but I've met

with a lot of my colleagues who were

told the same thing I met women who've

been told because of their gender they

couldn't advance in their careers I've

met people because of the sexuality who

were told that they couldn't advance in

their careers I met people who couldn't

advance because of the color of their

skin because of their age a lot of

people face barriers because of who they

are I've experienced a little bit of

what that's like

and I want to build a Canada where no

one's left behind where ever

it's just a question on another topic -

for one of my colleagues there is the

Canadian Labour Congress Congress

attending a forum in Syria saying he's

trying to increase pressure to lift

sanctions in that country in Canada has

had sanctions on Syria since 2011

because of Assad's regime the NDP

supports refugees especially Syrian

refugees and the Canadian Canadian

Labour Congress has endorsed the NDP so

how do you square those two do you think

sanctions on Syria should be lifted I

mean it's a very complicated thing we

know that we want to put pressure on a

regime that's that's abusing its people

we have to use diplomacy and one of the

diplomatic measures that we have the

tools we have is to put sanctions on a

country and we always have to look at

the impact that has on the people if

it's hurting the people we've got to

find ways to solve the tensions that

exist we also have to put pressure on

countries that are doing things that are

hurtful and this is one of those really

complex things we have to go to look at

the the details of the situation and

make the best call to advance peace our

goal has to always be how do we build a

better world for everyone where people

aren't being abused where their rights

are being protected and how can we be

the most helpful towards that goal

I'm gonna think about how how I said

that in French and think about how to

say anything I faced it all my life that

people have said things about the way I

look and that's not new and my mom

always taught me that that we've got to

see that connection between us then all

humans are connected that we're all one

and that we share so much in common and

when faced with negativity the only way

to overcome that is not with more

negativity not with name calling but

trying to find that human connection and

saying I care about you I want to build

a better country I want to build that

together but I'm confident that the

desire to build a better country where

we lift each other up where we put in

place things like Universal Pharma care

and dental care coverage and we take

care of housing and we fight climate

crisis we do those things together we

can overcome any diversity adversity any

sort of prejudice I'm confident we can

win over people

I could Gaiman global news mr. Singh you

took a lot of oxygen high you took a lot

of questions tonight that we're on

provincial topics things that you may

not be able to address I'm wondering if

you can speak to your general strategy

in how you let voters know that the

politics are different without

alienating people who are looking for

some answers well one of the things

about federal politics is that it's a

step removed so it's a little bit

complicated but we actually can solve a

lot of the problems that our people are

facing provincially if we had a better

federal partner so housing so housing

for example is truly a provincial matter

yes but a lot of the housing that it's

affordable that people can can actually

afford to live in that was built in

Canada was built because the federal

government invested in that housing so

if we want to tackle the housing crisis

we can do it unless we've got a federal

partner a federal prime minister aka me

who's willing to say no to the powerful

corporations and yes to people and

invest money in building affordable

housing that's what we got to do we're

gonna do it
