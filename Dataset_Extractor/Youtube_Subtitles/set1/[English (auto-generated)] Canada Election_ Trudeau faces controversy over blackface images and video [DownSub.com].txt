all of the different instances that you

recalled have you since been made aware

or remembered of other instances and if

so how many

I think it is obvious that this is

something that was deeply regrettable I

am weary of being definitive about this

because the recent pictures that came

out I had not remembered there is no

escaping this no way to put Justin

Trudeau's racist Aladin costume back in

the bottle and now we know he's worn

Brown or blackface at least two other

times this was in 2001 he was 29 and a

teacher at a private school in Vancouver

this is him in high school in Montreal

he wore black face and saying the Harry

Belafonte song

day-o and Global News has obtained this

video from a source in the Conservative

Party a third instance of him wearing

racist makeup there are other people in

the video too it was shot in the early

90s the location is unclear Trudeau said

today he doesn't remember it and he's

wary of saying definitively if there are

other times he did this for several

decades Trudeau has managed to keep this

quiet all of it another political crisis

he created himself through his own

actions his own poor judgment now he's

been forced to confront it right in the

middle of an election campaign good

evening and thanks for joining us our

chief political correspondent David akin

is traveling with the Trudeau campaign

David people have been fired for this

kind of racist behavior you asked Justin

Trudeau directly today whether he

considered stepping aside

What did he say yeah well he's not

getting fired as the short and simple

answer and well I think a lot of people

watching it may say it's very admirable

for him to denounce his own racist

behavior and as he said take

responsibility for it that is the

question I put to him why not step aside

we didn't get a chance to talk about

important issues here in Manitoba while

he was here it's all about talking about

his issues in his problem so why not

step aside his liberal Leader

there's lots of leadership talent in the

Liberal caucus and let someone else lead

the party I asked him why he thought he

was so indispensable I will continue to

do the work that is necessary to keep us

moving forward in the right way

Canadians have an important choice to

make on October 21st and I trust

Canadians to make that right choice I

certainly hope that they will continue

to support us in the work that we're

doing but they might not and I know that

that is something that all Canadians get

to decide it David you know the word

hypocrite comes to mind because Justin

Trudeau is championed minority rights

he's attacked political rivals for

intolerance that's less egregious than

this what is the political strategy to

try to overcome this we're gonna see I

guess in the next couple of days I mean

really we're in Terra incognito no

political strategist has ever seen this

no political reporter has ever seen a

situation like this it's very unusual

for an event like this to come into a

campaign and completely disrupt the

major brand of a political leader I mean

there's been examples most of them we

can probably point to in the United

States but I think we're in unchartered

waters for mr. Trudeau certainly there

are going to be liberals who say the

Justin Trudeau I've known for the last

four or five years bears no resemblance

to the young immature man 29 year old

man who committed these horrible racist

acts when he was younger and they're

gonna stand stand by him in that front

but also importantly I asked Trudeau if

he was going to change the tenor of his

campaign they've been digging up all

these social media posts that are

embarrassing about their opponents would

that stop or would he continue to attack

and it sounds like there's not gonna be

much of a change we're gonna continue to

make contrasts with our opponents we're

going to continue to put forward strong

pieces of policy that will demonstrate

how we believe that investing in

Canadians is the right path forward

David it will be voters who decide the

price Trudeau pays for this can they

trust a leader who committed a racist

act and kept silent about it for years

does it come down to a matter of trust I

think that may emerge as the ballot

quest you know every election you're

always wondering what is the ballot

and I think this is gonna be one of them

can you trust the Prime Minister that we

didn't know about this unless he got

caught we didn't know about SNC lavell n

unless he got caught we didn't know

about the Agra Consul Eagle vacation

unless it got caught it is going to come

down I think to trust do people really

trust the Prime Minister and people may

do some you know what I call moral math

because I was talking to everyday voters

today of all different backgrounds and

though they're very disappointed with

these pictures they've seen in Trudeau

they also go but that picture sticks in

my mind of our Prime Minister welcoming

Syrian refugees when no other country

would take them there's that Trudeau

that does those sorts of things that are

mired by so many around the world and

then there's this Trudeau when he just

gets caught out so it's going to come

down to trust do you trust that this is

not going to happen again and he could

be counted on to represent Canada in

this country and around the world Donna

all right David akin in Winnipeg tonight

thank you interest in this story is not

confined just to Canada the Canadian

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has

apologized after a fir picture of him in

brown face surface it has made

international headlines the leader once

seen as a champion of progressive ideals

now splashed across the world in brown

and black face our Ottawa bureau chief

Mercedes Stevenson broke the story about

the latest images of Trudeau in

blackface Mercedes what more do we know

about that video well Donna we know that

it is Justin Trudeau because the Liberal

war room has confirmed that to us and

that it was sometime in the early 1990s

beyond that the Liberals have not had

much to say about why he was wearing

that racist makeup in those images

they've explained the other images for

theatrical that one was a play that one

was a themed party but they have refused

to elaborate on what he was doing in

this video as to why he was in full

blackface from head to toe so that's a

big question that remains at this point

we know that the source and the

Conservative Party that brought this to

us said that it was on a whitewater

rafting trip you can see in the

background there is somebody wearing a

life jacket in that image we've asked at

the de Liberal Party about that

specifically as well and they've not

responded to it so still a lot of

questions about what exactly he was

doing here

and questions about why he didn't reveal

it earlier because he said that he found

it embarrassing and didn't disclose it

during the vetting process listen to

what he said to reporters earlier today

I never talked about this quite frankly

I was embarrassed it was not something

that represents the person I've become

the leader I try to be and it was really

embarrassing so there's this question

Donna of how many other times has this

happened and Justin Trudeau didn't seem

able to remember that today he was asked

he would not put a number on how

frequently this had happened that

suggests that perhaps the Liberals are

concerned that there could be more of

these images to come out also he's not

the only person across the Canadian

political spectrum that is facing this

tonight the Conservatives have a

candidate named Tamara Johnson who is

running in Langley BC images of her

apparently from 2016 have surfaced on

social media she's not wearing blackface

in the photos but she is posing with a

number of actors who are in blackface so

this is really a new question for

Canadian politics as parties are gonna

have to look at their candidates and

figure out how many may have something

this embarrassing and this negative in

their past

all right Mercedes Stevenson thank you

some of Trudeau's political opponents

say what he did reflects who he really

is privileged and not as enlightened as

he pretends to be we'll get to the

conservative leader in just a moment but

we begin with NDP leader Judd neat Singh

he is the first person of color to lead

a federal party in Canada and his

reaction is focused on the impact the

images might have on people of color

especially kids

Abigail Beeman is covering the NDP

leaders campaign Abigail what was junk

meetings first reaction to the images

Donna was raw and emotional but also

measured Singh saying he felt compelled

to speak out thinking of all those

affected by racism who can't speak out a

campaign source tells me while they had

a team meeting beforehand what you're

about to hear wasn't rehearsed

no one knew exactly what Singh was going

to say when I was growing up I fought

racists I dealt with them myself and I

fought back but I got a message from a

friend who reminding me that there's a

lot of people out there that couldn't do

that they couldn't bite back they didn't

have the ability to do that

this is very painful for a lot of people

then today a different less emotional

tone but the same message

I asked seeing whether he thought

Trudeau should have owned up to the

video obtained by Global News before the

story broke owned up to all instances

where he wore racist makeup yes I think

Canadians would expect that he would

mention whenever it happened however

this turns out for the Liberals aside

the way Singh handled this very much

feels like a turning point in the third

place NDP campaign

Abigail Beeman Global News West Lorne

Ontario Andrew Shearer in the

conservative campaign our in Quebec

taking direct aim a Justin Trudeau and a

support for the Liberal leader remains

an obstacle for Shearer even after the

bombshell revelations of the last 24

hours

sheers main message at every rally on

this campaign has centered on how

Canadians just can't trust Trudeau

attacking his ethics and personal

judgment as a leader Shearer attacked

Trudeau again today for initially giving

the impression that he had gone racist

makeup twice when it was in fact more

that lapse playing right into the hands

of the Tories as they try to paint

Trudeau as someone who was insincere and

doesn't think the rules apply to him he

indicated that there's only one other

incidents and now we know that there was

at least three so once again we see with

Justin Trudeau a one set of rules for

himself and one set of rules for the

rest of us Shearer isn't asking for

Justin Trudeau to step down as Prime

Minister but he says the Liberal leader

has embarrassed Canada and no longer has

the moral authority to govern this

country

Mike lacouture Global News granby Quebec

well it's voters who decide who to trust

to lead the country and right now it

seems the reaction is mixed some like

the leader of British Columbia's Green

Party are forgiving Andrew Weaver

tweeted let the person who has never

done anything they regret in high school

cast the first stone except Trudeau of

course also use racist makeup at age 29

when he was a teacher here's some other

reaction we gathered it's a video from

2001

we can't judge a person from something

from 18 years ago I mean I really feel

like you shouldn't have done that it's

not something that you expect from a

leader of the cover country

as long as the intention wasn't like

malicious yes I saw that what community

well I don't I don't like it no but I

don't ya know he shouldn't have done it

but he apologized it was racist yet but

he's apologizing but what does do we

expect that we're talking about things

that he did before he was our prime

minister well I think like anything else

a lot of the times the media will blow

things out of proportion well he was

young you know when you're younger you

make mistakes people do make mistakes

right so I mean it's not acceptable kids

or kids and I don't think he's racist

you know everybody was dressed up and I

don't think he thought anything of it

you did do it sir and you should be

paying the price and he should be gone

and he shouldn't even be running he

should be stepping down right now
