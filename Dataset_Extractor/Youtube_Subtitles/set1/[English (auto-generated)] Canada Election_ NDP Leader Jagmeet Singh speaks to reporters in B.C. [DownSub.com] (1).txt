thank you Mary thank you very much folks

today we've heard the Liberals gonna

announce their platform and I just want

to remind Canadians that mr. Trudeau and

the Liberals like to announce a lot of

promises but they've consistently broken

them and not only have they broken them

but they've chosen to help those at the

very top I think I can think of so many

examples they talked about the

importance of fighting climate change

and making it a priority and then they

bought a pipeline for 4.5 billion

dollars they talked about how they would

be there for people and families

middle-class families who needed help

and they gave 14 billion dollars away to

the wealthiest corporations in the last

fall Kannamma k-state's while families

are struggling with the cost of housing

and medication they promised to lower

the cost of medications but instead they

caved to pharmaceutical lobbyists who

they met with over eight hundred and

seventy five times and rather protect

the profits a big pharma then lower the

cost for families again and again mr.

Trudeau and the Liberals choose to help

out the powerful in the wealthy and it

hurts families so they're gonna make

some promises again today but let's look

at their track record again and again

they choose to hurt families they took

three billion dollars away from students

students who were profited off of they

were in student debt and their student

debt was charged massive interest but on

the other side they forgave six billion

dollars in loans to wealthy corporations

that's the contrast that's what the

Liberals do they talk a lot say a lot of

nice promises said a lot of pretty words

but in the end it's empty promises and

they hurt people and as I want folks to

know today

different four years four years if they

wanted to do any of these things they

were in a majority situation with all

the power they did none of these things

in four years what do they do though

let's look at their actual actions

what's the concrete evidence we have in

four years they pick the pockets of

students who are in student debt they

charge them three billion dollars in

interest they profited off the students

three billion dollars but on the

contrast they gave six billion dollars

away in loans and in fact they forgave

six billion dollars in loans to the

wealthiest corporations that's what they

do so they could say although on now

what's their track record the track

record is this they help out the

wealthiest corporations and they heard

students and they'd continue to hurt

students

obviously we would do the same thing

we've been talking about this for years

but I don't understand how this is a

no-cost thing to do

we've been calling for this band for

years why could they have done it over

the past four years when they had a

majority they had a complete majority in

the house they had four years this is

something that is so obvious why wasn't

it done in four years

again this is liberals trotting our

promises trotting out empty promises and

then pretty words during an election

which they could have done four years

ago if they really cared Documenta know

I just want to make it really clear that

I've always wanted to show the contrast

people have an opportunity to make to

vote in this election and I want people

to know that there's a choice

they've got mr. Trudeau he's scaring

people into choosing into voting and to

to not their plan is this they're trying

to scare people and to saying oh this is

worse than us but that is not the way

people should vote they should vote for

what they believe in they should vote

for what they Karen and if you look at

the track record of the Liberals they've

consistently said a lot of nice promises

they said a lot of nice words but

they've made decisions that have hurt

families and I want people to know that

that's not the way they have to go

they're not stuck between bad and worse

they shouldn't be scared and to be

afraid of voting for conservatives and

then end up voting for liberals just

because they're afraid they should vote

for what they believe in and mr. Trudeau

and the Liberals have consistently shown

that they've chosen to protect and help

out the people at the very top and

that's hurt families okg Bellucci mantra

yeah gang violence is certainly a

problem in a lot of urban centers across

Canada a lot of the experts are talking

about how we can make investments

directly in youth we need to help our

young people that's where all the

community organizations I met with all

the experts that I met with have said we

need to invest directly in youth so

we're making a commitment to help out

those families that have lost loved ones

those families that are worried about

the future they want to see some change

they want to see young people have a

brighter future and we want to invest

directly into youth programs a hundred

million dollars to help out with things

like after-school programs with youth

drop-in centers just to help and provide

supports for young people so they have a

brighter future we don't young gone

the first step what we're proposing

today is to invest directly in young

people that's what a lot of experts are

calling for they need help with young

people and young and youth program so

that's our first focus we also know that

organized crime is fueling a lot of gang

violence and one of the ways to tackle

organized crime directly is money

laundering money laundering has been

cited by a lot of extras as fueling the

gang wars and fueling a lot of violence

and so we want to tackle that directly

something that mr. Trudeau has

completely failed to do

mr. Trudeau doesn't understand the

severity of the problem hasn't responded

has neglected Suri Suri feels like

they've been ignored and they need

someone who's on their side so we've got

a plan to tackle money-laundering with

direct investments in the RCMP for an

anti money laundering department

particularly here in BC that's something

that we're gonna invest in and we also

need to make a federal registry to

prevent criminals from using anonymous

numbered companies to hide their money

these are two steps that would help us

these are two steps that help us tackle

the organized crime that is fueling gang

violence

these are our two announcements today

we'll have more announcements around

what we do to help out families and how

about communities that are that are

struggling with this problem

and that would include other measures

but today we're focused on two steps

fighting organized crime and helping

young people would direct you to program

investments we are that on a fee and on

yes we spoke into the experts on the

ground in Surrey many of those

organizations organizations say that

young people don't have a lot of hope

don't have a lot of future they see that

things are really difficult they don't

know the best ways to move ahead a lot

of times families are working really

hard mom and dad are away working hard

saving up money they are doing alright

financially but they're not getting a

lot of supports and a lot of guidance

and mentorship so all the experts have

said one of the things the most

important and powerful way to help out

young people who end up going down the

wrong path is investing in programs

after school so they have someone to

meet with and mentor to guide them to

help them out after school and drop-in

program so that people have positive

associations and positive directions

that are there they're giving advice in

mentorship that way that's what the

experts have said and I want to respond

to that

it's just not been done though the

reality is that we know it's needed we

know people are desperate for this

investment but no one's really stepped

up and done it Liberals have it and

these youth organizations have come to

me saying we've got programs we've got

mentorship programs we've got everything

in place but we don't have the funding

we don't have the core funding and we

need more help

I work in a versus mode

well we think it's the way of the future

and something that we've got to make

sure we're ahead of the curve on so

we'll make some announcements about how

we'll support technology and innovation

and and we've got a climate bank which

is a way to create an opportunity for

entrepreneurs in the in the green sector

in the clean sector to make investments

in their companies and grow them but

right now I want to make it clear we've

got mr. Trudeau out there telling people

they've got to be afraid of where they

vote and making people vote out of fear

I want to say to them mr. Trudeau has

let you down

he has failed people and I know people

have been telling me that he's let them

down and I want peel folks to know they

don't have to choose between bad and

worse there is another option they can

choose someone's going to fight for them

and be in it for them we'll have more to

say on that in the upcoming months or

the upcoming weeks Thanks thank you

see

that's my man

you
