I've done my best I obviously think I

can do the job otherwise I wouldn't have

stood for it and then stood and stood

and stood and presumably my colleagues

thought I could do so because I was

elected and re-elected a total of four

times I served for longer and was

elected more frequently than any other

speaker in the post-war period and there

wasn't a division of the house when I

was reelected so that suggests that the

house was contempt with me but how I

compared with other speakers or what my

rating would be I think it would be

vulgar and inappropriate in the extreme

for me to vote on that matter

I will leave others to vote upon that

matter when I stood for speaker in 2009

I joked that Speaker Grenville had been

elected at 29 and speaker Addington at

32 I was trying to deal with the charge

of I was too young to be speaker and I

said well historically they were very

young speakers indeed both of them went

on subsequently to become prime minister

not a danger in my case in the modern

world that just doesn't happen the

speaker doesn't have to leave the House

of Commons on ceasing to be speaker but

it's generally expected the speaker will

leave the House of Commons on ceasing to

be speaker because the House of Commons

doesn't want a next speaker hanging

around so the speaker wouldn't go on to

be leader of the Opposition in the way

that happens in other countries I'm not

sure that I really want to reflect on

what those difficulties might be but I

can't imagine that happening here and

I've certainly no such aspirations
