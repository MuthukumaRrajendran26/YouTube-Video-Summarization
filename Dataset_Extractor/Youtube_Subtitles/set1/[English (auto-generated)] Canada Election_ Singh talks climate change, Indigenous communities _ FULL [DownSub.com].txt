[Applause]

thank you so much miss CN phin Iman

that's Casey it's a great honor to have

such an incredible team behind me mm-hmm

I want to say Leah thank you for your

powerful words and for your great work

here in Winnipeg Center I know that

these great candidates behind me are

powerful voices for the community so I

want them and Leia to join Daniel and I

in caucus very shortly I also want to

take a moment to acknowledge that we've

got some incredible provincial leaders

here starting with a leader of the

Manitoba new democratic party Wahb canoe

thank you so much for being here and I

know some of your MLA team is here as

well so let's give them some love I

really appreciate today I want to talk

today about the climate crisis yesterday

we heard from Greta thunder a young

woman who spoke to the world who spoke

to leaders around the world and said

very powerfully how dare you how dare

you take no action in the face of

climate crisis how dare you ignore the

millions of young people around the

world who are going to the streets and

demanding begging leaders listen to them

because they are worried about their

future and they're seeing the impacts of

climate crisis right now here in Canada

young people are taking to the streets

because they see the impacts of extreme

weather flooding

forest fires we see it here in Manitoba

this is a crisis of epic proportion and

in the face of this crisis we see mr.

Trudeau who continues to just say pretty

words empty promises but no action don't

call no ballast at his climatic on I am

only below a mere Minister mr. Trudeau

he donned a pail apparel made sounds icy

on concrete certain tri-zone full of

future generation you see Mike stepped

up I want to say to the young people we

hear you we see you we know that you're

worried about the future and I want you

to know that things can be better

we make better choices we make better

decisions if we have better priorities

we will result in taking charge of this

crisis and doing things right moving in

a positive direction I want to thank the

elder for touching on the impact to

indigenous communities and the wisdom of

indigenous communities that cannot be

forgotten and ignored in this crisis so

what's at stake is we've got an election

where mr. Trudeau is gonna continue to

give nice words and and pretty promises

but we know that they're empty we know

that they're not backed with action and

mr. shear is not gonna be any better

he barely believes that there is a

climate crisis so what we need to do now

is come together and commit a real

action and real change future

generations of kids are depending on us

they are begging for action and we are

gonna deliver that we have the courage

to do so while mr. Trudeau is too busy

meeting with the powerful lobbyists from

the energy sector and caving in to their

demands he met with his government met

with the fossil fuel industry lobbyists

over 1,500 times in the past four years

1,500 meetings and that meant he broke a

powerful and commitment to end false

view subsidies but it comes as no

surprise because the problem in Ottawa

is this the government's in Ottawa

whether they're liberal or conservative

are working to make life easier for the

powerful they're meeting with the

powerful corporations the meeting with

the false of fuel sectors and caving to

their demands and it's making life

harder for everyone else it's making

life harder for young people who don't

see a bright future right now but we can

change that together so today I want to

announce what our commitments are first

off well mr. Trudeau caved to the fossil

fuel industry we are committing to

ending fossil fuel subsidies once and

for all

he bought a pipeline for 4.5 billion

dollars what a what a betrayal of our

future instead what we would do is

invest in the future and these are our

three commitments today that I want to

highlight first off we want to electrify

all public transit by 2030 this is a

massive investment in public transit and

we know that transportation is one of

the leading sources of greenhouse gas

emission this is an investment in our

future by electrifying transportation we

create jobs here in Winnipeg with New

Flyer one of the leading companies

building electric buses this will create

jobs and communities this will create

opportunities and this will also fight

the climate crisis secondly we want to

establish a climate bank this climate

bank would create a bold initiative to

support businesses that are fighting the

climate crisis but also create funds so

that we can connect an energy corridor

east-west that is based on electric and

clean energy that's connecting

Manitoba's source of energy with those

provinces that need it that's a way to

connect the clean energy across this

country whether we're talking about

hydro energy in in Quebec or here in

Manitoba with those jurisdictions that

don't have it this is a bold way forward

for us to electrify our country and to

get off our reliance on on burning

carbon this is a commitment that we make

and finally today I want to talk about

our commitment to including indigenous

voices and representation in being a

part of the solution

while indigenous communities face the

hardship of climate change on the ground

on the frontlines their voices are in

completely ignored

so what we're committing to today is

that we would as a new democratic

government ensure that indigenous

communities have a seat at the table as

equal partners in the fight against

climate crisis

we also want to make sure that

indigenous communities have an equal

voice in equal decision-making and

ensuring that there's job creation and

training opportunities we also know that

when we talk about indigenous

communities that they're faced with

horrible conditions when it comes to

basic human rights and that's why as a

part of our moral and legal of

obligation we are committing to

addressing the crises which include

water making sure every community has

the access to clean drinking water

education indigenous child welfare

housing these are commitments that we

would make the deal with the crises as

equal partners working with indigenous

communities to solve these crises nope

another cohosh deal affair my friends we

have the courage to take on those

powerful at the top because we're not in

it for them I don't work with the people

at the top I work for you I work for

Canadians I work for the young people

who are worried about their future and I

want to tell them this together we can

build a brighter future together we're

gonna do it we're in it for you and

we're fighting for you I see

thank you we're gonna take some

questions for the media now actually

forget CBC News the Liberals this

morning are promising to push Canada to

net zero emissions by 2050 does the NDP

plan to get Canada to that net zero

emissions and when let's be really clear

mr. Trudeau and the Liberals are gonna

promise a lot of things now they're

there in the election campaign but we

can just look back to 2015 they made a

lot of commitments then and they failed

they failed a future generation of young

people who are demanding action

they failed young people who are taking

to the streets they failed people who

are saying please do something about

climate crisis because we're afraid of

the future and no one believes that mr.

Trudeau is gonna actually to follow

through on those commitments we believe

that we have to take action now we are

committed to moving away from fossil

fuels we know the future for our country

and for the world is a future we were

not burning any carbon for fuel and

that's our commitment and today we're

talking about three specific commitments

to electrify transportation ending

fossil fuel subsidies ensuring that

indigenous communities are equal

partners in decision-making on the

frontlines and making sure we have a

climate back in place that increases

investments in reducing our emissions

connecting energy that's clean across

Canada these are our commitments today

we know we can achieve them we know we

can reduce emissions in a way that

creates a bright future for young people

what's your target when it comes to

reducing emissions well we want to stay

in line with the IPCC's report and what

Greta thunder was really highlighting we

have to keep global warming to no more

than 1.5 degrees and that means as

significant in massive reduction in

emissions and we're prepared to do that

we don't noticeably say exactly most

de Muniz shown is Amazon de Gaza Felicia

hi mister saying is an e Bertrand Oliver

with CTV national news you talk about

making sure that indigenous communities

are an equal

partner I'm wondering exactly how you

intend on doing that as an NDP

government so what we've seen so far is

that people who are on the frontlines of

this crisis our indigenous communities

their way of life has been impacted

directly through the loss of in

different communities if we talk about

coastal communities the loss of salmon

as a way of life because of climate

crisis and because of impacts on on the

environments of those marine species we

know that a way of life is being

impacted in northern communities with

the loss of the caribou herds we know

there's a direct impact on indigenous

communities but they're not involved in

decision making so what we're saying is

at all at the federal level we would

ensure there's a seat at the table that

indigenous voices matey Inuits at First

Nations all have a seat at the table to

be involved in decision-making that

impacts their communities directly we

want to ensure that indigenous voices

are part of the solution

on a slightly different subject you

mentioned you want all transit to be

electrified by 2030 how realistic do you

think this is and how do you think you

can get provinces onside you said you're

not going to impose projects on them how

are you gonna get the provinces onside

with this major shift to try to end

fossil fuels with the investments we

make we've got a powerful tool which is

the investments we make at the federal

level and we want to invest aggressively

and boldly in public transit we know

that that is the way of the future to

reduce emissions and what we want to do

is we want to focus in on ensuring that

investments are made in zero emissions

public transit we can do that we've got

amazing technology that exists here in

Canada here in Winnipeg we've got

technology across the world that we can

rely on we can make those investments

and we will back that up with massive

investments in public infrastructure to

ensure that we're moving towards a

future where we're not using carbon as a

fuel to get around Nabila do Canada we

Canadian Press mr. Singh previous

governments have talked about an

east-west power grid

do you ever pray

tag for this project because as anyone

who's driven across Northern Ontario

would know it's it's it's a vast

territory with with sparse population

and it's been deemed before a very

expensive project we can't afford not to

act and there's a price on not acting as

well and that price is future

generations who are gonna feel the brunt

of a climate crisis which is going to

threaten everything and so we need to

act now and that's why we are boldly

committing to real action on ensuring

that there is an east-west corridor to

connect the clean energy that we do have

in abundance with those jurisdictions

and those communities that don't have it

we have solutions we have to have the

courage to take the action and I'm

prepared to do that but what's the price

tag and what's the time frame so we want

to work right away we've got a climate

bank we're putting forward 15 billion

dollars in our climate action plan we

know that we need to put even more for

it it's a bold and vicious plan but we

know we need to do everything possible

to fight this this climate crisis so

with the climate bank we're gonna make

sure it's publicly funded will put

enough funds in it to be able to cover

our initiatives and our investments this

is something it's important we'll make

priorities to give you an example of

what we won't do when what we will do

last year alone

mr. Trudeau's government spent 14

billion dollars on corporate tax

giveaways in the fall comic statement

that's 14 billion dollars he gave away

he spent 4.5 billion dollars on a

pipeline he spent he said to

corporations that he would forgive their

loans in one year alone six billion

dollars that's almost twenty five

billion dollars that mr. Shido is spent

on the wealthiest corporations I

wouldn't do that instead I would invest

in fighting the climate crisis I would

invest in people that's the difference

we have joined the Mike I guess yeah

he's gonna he's gonna go ahead right

here and then we'll come to you right

after yeah mr. Singh Bryce Roy with CBC

Manitoba this week you promised to give

provincial governments veto power over a

major pipeline projects correct no no am

I am I getting something wrong here yes

okay well then you can have that I can

clarify that that's that's okay yeah so

I reported that way but it's not what I

said ever I never said that I want to

make you very clear I believe that the

federal government has significant

powers

significant constitutional powers but I

don't think it's effective to impose

pipelines on communities it's not the

way to go ahead and so what I said very

clearly is I would not impose pipelines

what I believe in is working with

provinces working with indigenous

communities in making sure we move

forward in collaboration we can't

continue down the same path it just

doesn't work what happens is of any

project that's imposed particularly when

pipelines are imposed they get

challenged in court they when they

particularly when they override

indigenous community rights again they

get challenged in court it is the wrong

way to do things so I believe the way to

move forward with our federalist system

is to ensure that we work together with

people we have collaboration we have

respect and partnership that's the only

way to move forward just a quick fall

just a quick follow-up on that note then

see there was a major pipeline project

and there was a difference in opinion

between the provincial government and

affected First Nations how would your

government approach a conflict like that

so to be really clear we know we've got

significant powers at the federal level

but I do not believe in imposing

pipelines I just don't believe in that I

don't think that's the right way to go

forward but I do believe in doing is

making sure that we've left three

criteria that are very important to me

when it comes to when it comes to any

project does the project fit within our

plan to reduce emissions we've got young

people that are depending on us

we've got future generations that are

depending on us we owe it to them does

it fit within our environmental plans

our environmental regulations

protections and does it fit within our

plans to reduce emissions secondly does

it respect and most importantly does it

respect indigenous communities rights if

it doesn't introspect indigenous

communities rights then it cannot go

ahead and thirdly does it actually

create jobs for does it actually create

jobs for Canadians if it does these

three things it's a project we can look

at if it doesn't it cannot go ahead mr.

Singh dan let Winnipeg Free Press I'm

wondering following the extraordinary

events that we witnessed last week on

the campaign trail all eyes right now

are obviously on national opinion

polling trying to find out what the

impact of those things are so far and it

may still be early days we don't see a

lot of movement for the NDP out of what

happened last week and I'm just

wondering if you can say are your

expectations that you will see an uptick

in support based on what happened

last week my expectations are the

Canadians will look at the Liberals who

have failed them and look at

conservatives who are gonna cut their

services and look to New Democrats as

their champion and we're gonna form a

new democratic government in Canada this

is a follow up what sort of possible

theory could you offer about the the

fact that you seem to be mired in the

low-teens low to mid teens and support

nationally and I know that Election Day

is the only poll that counts but what

what sort of explanation do you have for

the fact that you have not seen traction

really at all even post SNC Lavin

the NDP has not been able to gain in

support at the expense of the the

Liberals and I'm just wondering why you

think that is it's not at all what I'm

seeing I'm seeing the exact opposite I'm

seeing massive numbers of people coming

out to our events people who are excited

about we have to offer we've got a host

of incredible candidates that are

running for us we've had massive town

halls where people are saying you know

what we see in you people that reflect

what we're going through people are

telling us more and more we are feeling

that the economy is rigged that it's not

working for us people are telling me

that they do feel like they're being

ignored by liberals and by conservatives

people are telling me that they feel

like they're being taken for advantage

taken for granted that people that just

assume that ok liberals will get in and

then eventually conserves will get in

people are saying that they've had

enough with that I'm hearing people on

the streets in communities that I go to

telling me that they want a different

way forward they want governments that

work for them they don't want liberals

and conservatives that continue to work

for those at the very top they want a

government that actually gonna put their

needs first and I'm excited about that

I'm excited because this is a way to

move forward that's actually gonna take

care of the people that need help most

not the billionaires and millionaires

who don't need help I want to make sure

we put in place action and concrete

policies that benefit people mark

Neufeld City News I'm wondering mr. sing

if the NDP are elected how quickly will

that climate bank be made available

great question we're gonna put that

climate bank in place as quick as we can

it's something that's a party for us we

want to we've learned this this concept

for many other jurisdictions where it's

worked effectively to encourage

entrepreneurship in the environmental

space where people are fighting climate

crisis

and fighting to reduce climate or reduce

emissions it's worked in other

jurisdictions so we want to put this

together right away it's a priority for

us how big or small what a business or

individual need to be to access those

funds these are some of the

implementation questions that we will

work on when we're rolling out the

program but what we can say is that this

will be a fund that will be available

publicly delivered it's not going to be

like the infrastructure bank as the

Liberals I kept the mix up with

conservatives for a second I wanted to

put forward which would privatize future

infrastructure our plan is to say we

want publicly funding to support

initiatives to reduce emissions and

we'll get that going right away and make

sure that it's available to as many

people as possible and we'll roll out

the details when we're in the phase of

actually rolling it out these are

commitments these are values Jeff keel

CTV Winnipeg if you could elaborate more

on your your electrifying transit plan

how much would it cost between now and

2030 to do this and how do you envision

the funding rolling out would it be you

know a three-way deal with the province

and cities or would be money directly

for cities like hah how would that work

or would it be you know private to do

the new Flyers of the world accessing

this this climate Ben can you maybe it's

a lob right on that sure sure we know

that we've got a kind of all three what

you suggested there's got to be

initiatives where we and we've talked

about this we've gotten commitments to

work more directly with with cities

municipalities are a stick more and more

to deliver more services with less funds

and it's very difficult so we want to

have a more direct relationship with

municipalities so that's one of our

commitments to work directly with them

particularly when it comes to transit

funding so that's something where we're

prepared to do particularly given

situations like here in Manitoba where

you've got a Conservative government

that wants to cut services and cut

things like public transit and

healthcare and education more than ever

cities need a partner federally who's

willing to invest in cities and invest

in the things that people need so that's

one and then we need to work of course

with provinces we are going to work the

provinces to make sure that the funds

are available but it's going to be a

massive massive investment in public

infrastructure creating jobs we think

it's a job creator it's also going to

reduce emissions it's got also an

improved quality of life it's something

we're committed to doing this you say

there's gonna be an initial 15 billion

in

so how much um what numbers have you

worked out do you think this would cost

the federal government or maybe all

three levels of government to electrify

transit across this country I got to

start by saying this it's not it's

something very important I think we

cannot afford not to do it

like we have to do it it's such an

important thing we'll make the

commitments to make sure it's achievable

we're starting with a 15 billion dollar

investment that's a bold step forward

but we'll do whatever it takes because

it's important it's gonna create jobs

and it's also gonna help us fight

climate crisis and we can't afford not

to act it's so important that I would

putting all my efforts towards making

sure we do this the way that liberals

and conservatives put all their effort

towards giving billions to billionaires

we're gonna put all our efforts towards

actually helping people out and helping

fight the climate crisis yet can you

give us a specific number that you are

budgeting to electrify transit out of

that 15 billion dollars roughly how much

do you expect to spend we're gonna roll

out more details of our plan as the

campaign continues but I can tell you

that this is a priority this is

something we're committed to doing and

we're gonna make sure we put the funds

in place and we achieve this reality

just to follow up when it comes to the

plan for provinces with respect to

pipelines and big infrastructure

projects is the power you'd give to

Quebec different than what you would

give to other provinces Quebec is

different and so we're giving a

different consideration for Quebec

absolutely and I'm proud of that that's

a part of our federalism which

recognizes the unique nation the unique

nature of Quebec but what I'm saying for

every province in every territory across

this country is that a new democratic

government would not impose pipelines

what we would do is when we want to move

forward with projects is work in

collaboration work in support with local

communities and in particular work in

respect and collaboration and

partnership with indigenous communities

but if I can just highlight for a second

the past way of doing things has not

worked projects have not been built

under a system where ideas or projects

are imposed on communities it just does

not work that way so why would we

continue down a path that doesn't work

where courts where there's Court

challenges on decisions it just doesn't

work that way we've got to find a better

way for it and that's what I'm saying

today and earlier I spoken about a way

forward which

cognizes we still have the power to do

so but that using that power is not the

way to get things built hi Carol Sanders

from the Free Press I'm wondering hi the

provincial NDP made a bit of a comeback

and during the the last election do you

see that as having any kind of you know

momentum for the federal candidates who

are running in Manitoba yes okay I had a

follow-up but it's kind of for Leah

about how would she do things

differently and Winnipeg Center like

what how why would she be a better

candidate than Robert Falcon willette

for this writing what could you do

specifically I'm I'm knocking on

thousands of doors throughout this

writing I'm going to places where

there's 20 people living in a house I'm

meeting seniors that cannot afford to

live on their own this is appalling

considering that this current federal

government is spending billions of

dollars as our leader Jake Meads Singh

has indicated 25 billion dollars bailing

out big corporations that money needs to

be invested in the climate crisis and

also the good people of Winnipeg center

the third poorest writing eye in the

country we are offering a plan for

people particularly in the Riding of

Winnipeg center it is critical it is a

critical time I'm the former president

of the social Planning Council Winnipeg

over the past four years things are

getting worse as a person who lives in

the writing as a person who is living by

neighbors who don't even have to have

enough money to pay rent who are

choosing between prescriptions that they

must take for life-saving measures and

food we must change this immediately

yeah yes okay thank you so much thanks

for all the questions friends

can I just ask you to do something for

me it's a it's a tough job to to ask a

lot of questions and to hold democracy

to account so we can just give some love

to the media that do great work for us

thank you all thank you very much thank

you

[Applause]
