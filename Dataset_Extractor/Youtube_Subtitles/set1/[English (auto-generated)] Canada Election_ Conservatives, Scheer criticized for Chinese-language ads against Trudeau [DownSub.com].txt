the Conservative Party is facing

criticism for ads the Liberals call

false they've been running them online

on Facebook ads in Chinese accusing the

Liberals of planning to legalize hard

drugs that something the Liberal Party

says is complete disinformation Facebook

has taken the ads down after determining

them to be in violation of their

advertising policy the conservative

campaign is under fire after the federal

Conservative Party ran Chinese language

ads on Facebook falsely claiming liberal

party plans to legalize hard drugs have

reelected one of the ads was taken down

by Facebook for violating their

advertising policy the Liberal Party

calls the ads disinformation and Liberal

leader Justin Trudeau said the party has

absolutely no plans to legalize hard

drugs the ad appears in Chinese part of

a strategy to target the ethnic

community with a message the

Conservatives believe will resonate

today on the campaign trail Global News

asked sheer why his party made the

allegations and why they continue to

push the narrative in Chinese but not in

English sure didn't as to the language

question but did double down on the

rhetoric this is something that is very

important for Cannes to know about and

and so we are at we were telling them

that these are the types of things that

liberals speculate about before the

election and then implement after the

election Shearer has made progress in

the polls in recent days that he's

hoping to capitalize on last night in

Langley he saw the biggest turnout to

date for his campaign with about 1,500

people showing up but there's been

frustration from conservatives inside

the party the leader has not managed to

capitalize on major political stumbles

by the Liberals like the SNC lavell a

scandal or Justin Trudeau's blackface

images party insiders have been talking

about who could replace here if he loses

before the election is even over I sat

down with mr. Scheer for the West block

to ask him about those internal rumors

and how he feels about campaigning while

the rumbling from conservatives about

his replacement is already underway have

you talked to Peter Mike that I speak to

Peter MacKay often I see him at many

different events my my current schedule

has me and here in British Columbia

today and

debating the other day in Ottawa but I

know Peter is a committed member of our

team Shearer heads back to Ottawa

tonight to take a down day before he

heads back out on the campaign trail to

go across the country hoping to convince

voters that he should be the next prime

minister of Canada but so far there's

still no frontrunner in this campaign
