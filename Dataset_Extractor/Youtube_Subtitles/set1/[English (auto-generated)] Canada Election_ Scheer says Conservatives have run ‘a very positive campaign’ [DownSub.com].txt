mr. Scheer invents reason for refusing

to answer questions and tell the truth

this story shows how corrupt are all

parties are this is the kind of dirty

politics that fuels Canadians cynicism

about politics People's Party of Canada

leader Maxine Bernier responding to

claims in a globin male report that the

Conservative Party hired a consulting

firm to discredit the People's Party of

Canada the controversy coming at the

worst time for the Conservative Party as

we head into the final hours before

polls open and federal Conservative

Party leader Andrew Shearer is joining

us live from Richmond thank you for

joining us this morning mr. Shearer this

has been one of the dirtiest campaigns

in many Canadians memory and with the

latest allegations that your party has

hired Warren Kinsella to attack Maxine

Bernier many are concerned about the

kind of campaign you're running on this

final day how do you feel about the

campaign you've led we've run a very

positive campaign every morning we make

an announcement about how we're going to

make life more affordable for Canadians

how we're going to leave more money in

their pocket and how they're gonna have

a brighter future when we look at the

other parties when I look at Justin

Trudeau calling people who don't believe

in the same things that he believes

it'll hold the same views that he holds

he calls them on Canadian when the

Liberal War Room the liberal campaign

tries to make a link between a

construction worker that I'm shaking

hands with trying to link link that to

racist groups I see a lot of negativity

coming from the liberal campaign but now

in the in the last day here before polls

open the choice really is between a

positive Conservative government that

will make life more affordable and an

NDP liberal coalition that will have to

raise taxes to pay for their billions

and billions and new deficits but Mr

Shearer when asked why you're spreading

false information about your opponents

like among other false statements saying

the Liberals will decriminalize hard

drugs and saying the Liberals and NDP

will raise GST when they say that's a

lie you can't draw conclusions where the

hard facts don't back up what you're

saying so you've explained your

reasoning to Canadians my question to

you this morning is how do you explain

to your five children from toddler to

teenage that it is okay

to lead a dirty campaign based on

information that is not entirely true

and constant attacks on your opponent's

well of course I reject the the premise

of that question we know that like night

follows day tax hikes follow massive

deficits and when you add the NDP and

liberal PAP platforms together you see

the deficit ballooning to forty billion

dollars now taxes will have to go up to

pay for that if it's not the GST it

could be personal taxes but that's up to

Justin Trudeau to have the guts to tell

Canadians today before they go and vote

which taxes he will raise we saw the

same playbook in other governments when

liberals run massive deficits the tax

hikes follow and I believe that

Canadians have a right to know before

they vote what types of deals Justin

Trudeau will make with the NDP what

types of taxes he will have to raise in

order to pay for the NDP platform

currents I believe that is a legitimate

question to put to Justin Trudeau in the

24 hours before polls open it is a

little legitimate question that many are

saying you have chosen to answer

yourself and put in campaign ads

sometimes focus towards minority

communities and there is therein is

where the concern lies well we're

talking about decriminalizing hard drugs

I point to you that liberal members of

parliament on the House of Commons

Health Committee endorsed this idea many

of their candidates are supportive of

this idea Justin Trudeau himself said

that he was not going to do this right

away so there's a lot of uncertainty

about what it is that the Liberal Party

will do on this but we do know a lot of

liberal candidates want to push for this

so we've we've warned Canadians about

this in in in many languages we're gonna

continue to warn Cannes that this is

something that the Liberals are

contemplating on our side contains can

have certainty we will not pursue this

course of action they are unable to say

that because they have so many liberal

candidates that are pushing for for this

type of thing all right Mr Shearer you

and your other party leaders are

choosing to spend this final day in

battleground BC why are you here and how

important is B C's vote in this election

well BC vote is incredibly important it

always is but we know there are going to

be a lot of close races we're very

optimistic about winning back many of

the seats that we've held

the past and our message on cost of

living resonates all over Canada but

perhaps more so here in the Greater

Vancouver region and in other parts of

British Columbia we know housing prices

are putting a big crunch on families we

know that everyday essentials have

gotten more expensive the price of gas

in British Columbia is extremely high

and when Justin Trudeau says that high

gas prices are exactly what he wants a

lot of people get frustrated at that and

that's why our positive message about a

government that gets back to balanced

budgets lowers taxes leaves more money

in their pockets really resonates here

and we're very optimistic for the

results tomorrow in the event of a

possible minority government would you

accept any support from the Bloc

Quebecois or even change your stance on

the trans mountain pipeline expansion

what are you willing to do to prop up

some kind of coalition well those are

first of all we're not going to enter

into any type of formal you know we're

not courting the support of other

parties we're asking Canadians were

we're asking Canadians we're not asking

other parties for their support we're

asking Canadians for their support we're

asking for their vote tomorrow so that

we can get a strong Conservative

government that will get big projects

built again in this country that can

lower taxes I can get back to balanced

budgets so we we have a little less than

24 hours before polls open and the

choice for Canadians is crystal clear

now on the one hand an NDP liberal

coalition that will have to raise taxes

it's not the GST perhaps it's going to

be personal income taxes and on the

other hand we have a Conservative

government that will get back to

balanced budgets lower taxes all along

the way and make life more affordable

all right I'm sure you've heard the

comments from Vancouver mayor and former

NDP MP Kennedy Stewart he had some harsh

words about your leadership what was

your reaction to hearing him say that

your government if elected would be

worse than Stephen Harper's comments

that we seldom hear from municipal

mayors and should Vancouverites be

worried about the city's relationship

with a possible future conservative

federal government well it's not

surprising as you point out former New

Democrat MP is not going to endorse a

conservative party so I wasn't terribly

surprised there I would point out to the

mayor that we've made commitments for

big infrastructure projects that will

help the people in the Greater Vancouver

region specifically we've announced that

we will

support the replacement of the Massey

tunnel in addition we've said that we

will honor all existing infrastructure

agreements and that we will spend the

exact same amount overall over the

course of our of our infrastructure plan

so you know it's vitally important that

all three levels of government get along

and find ways to find common ground to

work together the people of Vancouver

can have confidence in a Conservative

government we'll put their needs first

and it is it's incredibly important as

we head into voting day tomorrow to

realize the choice the choice between an

NDP liberal coalition that will raise

taxes make life less affordable drive

out jobs cancel big projects in this

country and a conservative majority

government they lower taxes get big

things built again and help improve the

quality of life for all Canadians all

right now do want to ask you about

Canada US relations

Donald Trump's impeachment inquiry is

currently underway and DP leader jug

meat Singh has made strong comments

saying he hopes Trump is impeached what

do you think of the u.s. leader and your

future relationship with him if you

become Prime Minister well obviously

this is a decision for US lawmakers now

I'm focused on Canadian politics as it

relates to Canadia at the canada-us

relationship I can tell you that I will

work extremely hard one of my fight my

first priorities will be to undo the

damage that Justin Trudeau did to the

NAFTA deal Trudeau promised to come back

with a better NAFTA instead he gave away

concession after concession after

concession Donald Trump ran the table on

him forced him to accept virtually

everything that he was asking for and in

the end the only thing that Justin

Trudeau could point to his victories

were things that conservatives have had

already fought for under previous trade

agreements so I'm gonna focus on

resetting that relationship identify

making improvements on a one-off basis

on the failures that came back with the

Trudeau deal and try to improve that for

all Canadians Conservative leader Andrew

Shearer joining us this morning on the

final day of the federal election
