outrage continues to ramp up as photos

of Liberal leader Justin Trudeau in

brown face surface from 2001 and a video

obtained by global news shows Trudeau in

blackface it's shocking to see it now

but blackface was a popular form of

entertainment dating back to the days of

the minstrel see a form of 19th and

early 20th century entertainment white

actors would use burnt cork or shoe

polish to paint their face put on

tattered clothing and mock slaves

depicting them as lazy and ignorant the

racist history is often seen as an

American tradition but it was in fact as

popular in Canada Canada had its own

minstrel troupes selling out shows

across the country

in Toronto members of the black

community petitioned annually to

prohibit these racist acts to no avail

the performances continued into the mid

1900s but lost popularity during the

civil rights movement over the decades

though different forms of blackface

continue to surface in the 80s 90s and

early 2000s these things were way more

accepted back then it doesn't mean that

people still weren't upset and offended

it just meant and I should say it's not

even that they were accepted it's that

the racialized other didn't feel that

they could use their voice to speak out

against it I think that's what it is but

it continued after on Canadian

University campuses during Halloween and

other costume parties among Canadian

comedians and athletes there is not a

pivotal moment we can point to in recent

history which shows a shift from black

or brown face being accepted to being

considered what it is racist alia Adam
