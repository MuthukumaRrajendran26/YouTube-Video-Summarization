my name is Leah Taylor Roy and I'm proud

to be the Justin Trudeau's Liberal

candidate before I turn the floor over

to our leader who everyone loves to hear

I want to say three things to you into

the press first this shiner that I'm

sporting it was not a conservative punch

I just want to say that it was because

we were working hard 14 Trudeau and I

was up with two of our amazing

volunteers at 6:15 in the morning

greeting people at the warbly bow

station when in my enthusiasm running

down the station I tripped on a grade

and ended up falling on my face by a

Good Samaritan was there and came by yes

sir right here a Good Samaritan

okay Kate and stayed with me the entire

time until the empty spot there

missed his train and only after did he

know who I was and I found out that our

sign is on his front lawn we have

amazing liberals in our riding we have

amazing cheese and I'll tell you we got

back up and after a 24 hour concussion

walk we were back on the road working

hard and I come from a long line of

formidable agreement my mother Kate is

here today and I have a team that just

won't give up and that is why we are

going to win this riding

okay the second thing I want to tell you

[Music]

the second thing I want to tell you is

that I know this writing and I know that

we voted for a liberal a Trudeau liberal

in 2015

and I know that this Friday wants their

MP to be a loyal liberal not a fickle

floor crosser and we will ensure that we

get a liberal back in this right because

this riding knows that the Liberal Party

is the only party that is home to people

who want to take action on climate

change and who want to build a

prosperous future for our country and

it's one of the reasons I love our

leader because he knows that we can do

both

and lastly I want to say that Justin and

I share something which is we both come

from families where public service and

leadership where we're in our history we

read enough and my father Tom Taylor is

right over here we all know the great

contributions your father used rotten

country justin and many of you know my

father he has served as a local leader

and politician in our great region of

york for 55 years and legacy continues

with my brother John but like justin

trudeau I am doing this because I want

to make a difference not because of my

name

and I know that we will make a

difference we will ensure that the

Liberals under Justin Trudeau will take

action on climate change

I know I know that we will continue to

support the middle class not slash

programs and I know that we will finally

get gun control in place and lastly we

will work hard to ensure that Canada and

our world is inclusive and welcoming to

everyone in welcoming our fathers

[Applause]

what an incredible pleasure to be here

let's hear it again for your candidate

and next time Taylor on thank you to all

of you not just for being here tonight

in the middle of Thanksgiving weekend

but for all the incredible work you've

been doing over the past days weeks and

months Neff see me send me for all your

hard work just a few more days I know

you all know the importance of the

choice Canadians are facing just weeks

from now people are facing a very clear

choice and that's why we are fighting so

hard we are fighting so hard to stop

conservative cuts and

we are gonna start to serve enough cuts

by electing a progressive government not

a progressive opposition because we know

what cuts are waiting for us with a

Conservative government you've seen it

here in Ontario and through shared yet

when he looked at the cuts that end that

Doug Ford put forward and for sheer said

hold my beer for the plan that cuts four

times as much as dark corn ever

education to healthcare cuts to seniors

cuts the kids with autism that comes to

franco-ontarians that's not what we need

over the past four years we showed what

a government that wasn't afraid to

invest in people to deliver we invested

in young people we invested in seniors

he invested in hard-working families we

stood up for Canada around the world we

invested to fight climate change and

what happened not only did we create the

strongest plan to fight climate change

the Canada has ever had but we watched

Canadians create over a million new jobs

as we lifted

[Applause]

and that is the choice facing Canadians

in a week's time do we continue to move

forward or do we go back to the harbor

[Applause]

there will be the chosen is your

TV even the latest easeful evil still

even our politicians and in opposition

like losing you can all see can see look

lucky I before Iowa Tomica mr. Harper

Cuba Libre chymotrypsin to bury my

grandma

for anything he can live it but what

simple sir Kelly give me well Bert's way

that will begin and we are going to keep

fighting to make sure Canada has a

strong progressive government to cut
