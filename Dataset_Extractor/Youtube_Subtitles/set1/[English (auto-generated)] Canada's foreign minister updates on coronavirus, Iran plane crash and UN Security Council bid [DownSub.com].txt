so what I was saying it's my third trip

in in Africa and three months I've been

in Mali I've been in Morocco I've been

to Egypt at the s1 forum so I think it's

important here today we met a number of

African leader at the Mauritius

Madagascar it's important for Canada to

be at the African Union summit we talked

about climate change we thought about

offering a feminist foreign policy talk

about things that matter multilateralism

bringing that positive voice that Canada

can bring to the world as a country

which is part of g7 g20 NATO the

Commonwealth a francophone is so a lot

of good discussion how can we bring the

voice of Africa to the UN Security

Council I also want to provide you an

update I spoke yesterday the group's CEO

of Allen America mr. Cruz we had a

discussion of about 40 minutes I wanted

to make sure that all in America is

doing everything on the diamond princess

which is in the port in Japan we have

255 Canadians

which are currently in quarantine we

have seven Canadians who have tested

positive for the corner virus and I

wanted to make sure that we were all

linked up making sure that we're there

for the families for the people who are

there and before I came to see you I

learned that the plane which is gonna be

packed create the second Canadian plane

has just left Trenton on its way

obviously to Asia as we said we would

bring back Canadians the plane would be

leaving on the 10th of February bringing

back the last group of Canadians in one

wants to be repatriated on the 11 so

happy to take your question obviously in

French or in English well you know every

leader that you speak to as a positive

inclinations towards Canada I think they

sink and that that constructive voice

what I call the transatlantic voice and

they want to make sure that the voice of

Africa is represented and and they think

that Canada embodies a lot of the

weather we talk about governance without

it we talk about you are feminists

foreign policy you know Africa is going

to be where half of the world population

will be in 2050 more than five billion

people so the youth of the world is here

in Africa and the voice of Canada is

inspiring so what we've heard from

leaders is that

certainly did welcome Canada on the

Security Council and obviously we have

been seeking their support but my

inclination or what I saw from them was

this inclination to say yes Canada can

be the voice of Africa on the Security

Council and and embodies some of the

same principle the same values about

climate change multilateralism economic

security that we need you know here in

Africa so far I must say what I've heard

from African leaders is that they

certainly welcome Canada on the Security

Council I think it embodies the type of

leadership they'd like to see more in

the world so what I was saying is that

what I hear from African leader is that

why Canada is because Canada would be

that voice that they want a progressive

country a transatlantic country which

which embodies some of the same values

around values principled governance they

want a country which which understand as

well some of the big challenges and can

speak about it and they certainly want

to see a country the transatlantic

country that I said which they'd like to

see on the Security Council because

Canada embodies that we're a positive

leadership by the Prime Minister and

what really Canadians are around the

world

the Africans want the Canadian oh sorry

okay so I apologize so well I think you

know the UN Security Council is is the

biggest stable you can have around the

world you know that's where Canada made

a difference if you go back in history

that's where we had for example the land

mine treaty where Canada can bring

things to the table because there's a

rotating presidency for those watching

us at home so when you have the

presidency for two weeks it allows you

to bring things to the Security Council

and I think it also favored a lot of

discussion with the permanent members

whether it's China Russia the United

States the United Kingdom or France so

it makes you certainly at the big table

where you can bring your shoes that

matters to the world and matters not

only to African but I would say to

liberal democracies in the world well I

think whenever you speak to people you

bring something forward you know I'm one

who believes fundamentally the dialogue

is the own

way to bring things closer whether you

talk about China with respect to the to

Michaels and and I've been very clear

that what we're dealing with the

coronavirus with with the Chinese

Authority that the foremost priority is

to bring the Michaels back home every

time I have a chance to talk to my

Chinese counterpart every time there's a

dialogue obviously we bring that issue

and I think the more you talk the more

you can certainly try to build a bridge

that is needed in order to strengthen or

to restore relationship when it comes to

Iran you know I judge them by their

action step by step that's what I've

said to the Iranian obviously one of the

issue we have is the black boxes you may

have seen I've have been clear to the

Iranian now it's more than 30 days since

the crash there comes a time where you

need to come to terms and say you know

what I think they've understood from the

different Civil Aviation Authority in

the world that the type of equipment and

expertise you need to read the block's

box cannot be brought to Iran so the

solution in front of all of us whether

it's the world community on the

international response and coordination

group is to send these black boxes

without delay to Paris which has all the

equipment and I've said the the the best

antidote to conspiracy is transparency

and I've said that to my Iranian

counterpart and I will restate that

message when I meet him obviously next

you'd be you'd be surprised you'd be

surprised I think obviously it's it's a

confidential vote but I would say and

just look at what happened I met my

Indian counterpart at the g20 and I

think 20 days after he came on a ballot

or visit to Canada and I must say since

then we had very good contact I think

and II understand that it'd be good for

us to work together on the United

Nations Security Council that that

there's a number of issues which we

would like to progress together and that

we have been talking already what could

we bring to the United States Security

Council the United Nation Security

Council's obviously it's for them to

make a choice but I think that they

understand what Canada can bring to the

table

good well before I left Canada I made

sure that two-thirds of our Canadians

were well you know we're in Trenton and

and well taken care of I made the same

thing I just looked before I came to see

you with the CEO of the logistics

company you know me by now so I know

exactly where the plane is the second

plane to bring the Canadians back home

and before I left yesterday I spoke to

the CEO of Alan America to make sure

that we would provide all the necessary

facilities to the people who are on the

ship in in in Japan so you know in my

job you have to make sure that we

provide all the consular assistance deal

with the emergency but also think about

the long-term so it's managing both the

the long-term strategic interest of

Canada while at the same time ensuring -

obviously whatever crisis is present and

I think we're doing boat at the same

time and I think that's what Canadians

would expect from me let me be I'll be

very clear with you when I spoke last to

my Iranian counterpart there's always

three things on the table when we

started was about consular assistance

there was five things always on the

agenda the first was obviously when we

started consular assistance and the

second thing was the repatriation of

remains these two obviously are now

completed the third thing was obviously

the black box since they won obviously

to read the black box in accordance with

an extra team the second thing is the

fourth thing I would say is the criminal

investigation because we said we want to

bring closer justice transparency the

families the world have a lot of

questions about who has committed that

crime and and we want to understand who

in the chain of command would be

responsible but the fifth and very

important point we had with the families

was compensation both the statutory

compensation from the airlines and I

spoke to the CEO of Ukrainian Airlines

but also the state compensation that

will be due by Iran and in my last

discussion with the Iranian Foreign

Minister they have appointed someone

specifically to start a negotiation with

the international coordination and

response group we want compensation to

go to their family as quickly as

possible and that's something that I

will bring again in our next meeting

well I think whenever you speak to

people you you bring something forward

you know I'm one who believes

fundamentally the dialogue is the only

way to bring things closer whether you

talk about China with respect to the to

Michael

and I've been very clear that what we're

dealing with the coronavirus with with

the Chinese Authority that the foremost

priority is to bring the Michaels back

home every time I have a chance to talk

to my Chinese counterpart every time

there's a dialogue obviously we bring

that issue and I think the more you talk

the more you can certainly try to build

a bridge that is needed in order to

strengthen or to restore relationship

when it comes to Iran you know I judge

them by their action step by step that's

what I've said to the Iranian obviously

one of the issue we have is the black

boxes you may have seen I've been clear

to the Iranian now it's more than 30

days since the crash there comes a time

where you need to come to terms and say

you know what I think they've understood

from the different Civil Aviation

Authority in the world that the type of

equipment and expertise you need to read

the block's box cannot be brought to

Iran so the solution in front of all of

us whether it's the world community on

the international response and

coordination group is to send these

black boxes without delay to Paris which

has all the equipment and I've said the

the the best antidote to conspiracy its

transparency and I've said that to my

Iranian counterpart and I will restate

that message when I meet him obviously

next it's gonna be a pretty full plane

so I don't have the exact number bear

with me because the manifest is being

finalized as we speak so I don't have

the count but it's certainly gonna be

it's gonna be a full plane
