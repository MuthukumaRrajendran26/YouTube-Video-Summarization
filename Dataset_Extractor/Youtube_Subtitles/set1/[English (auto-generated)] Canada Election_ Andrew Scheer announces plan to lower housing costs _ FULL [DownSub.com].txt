the living is so high that it's become

almost impossible to save for a down

payment we appropriate air DeMatha every

difícil a good share is a man

so they come in at a par - okay we're

been able have the good let me see enemy

today fresca impossible economies

especially in communities right here in

the GTA you're working so hard but

you're not able to save money

now many aspiring homeowners are not

even thinking about mortgages and down

payments because the cost of living is

so high the Justin Trudeau isn't helping

in 2015 Trudeau said he would help you

he said he would be different instead

under the trio liberals the dream of

homeownership has gotten even further

out of reach just raise your taxes

imposed a carbon tax he's hurt your

bottom line and made it that much harder

to save for a down payment because of

his stress test it's more difficult to

qualify for a mortgage and because his

latest initiative has so many hoops to

jump through so many terms and

conditions you and almost all the

paintings it's supposed to help don't

even qualify when it comes to making

homeownership more affordable

once again Justin Trudeau is simply not

as advertised now conservatives believe

that when you work hard save and invest

in your future the government should

help you not stand in your way as Prime

Minister I'll

that a new Conservative government helps

you get ahead I'm proud to announce

today a four-point plan to help put

homeownership within the reach the

foreign Canadians first a new

Conservative government will fix the

stress test to make sure first-time

homebuyers can get access to a mortgage

many experts agree that the stress test

has gone too far and has many unintended

negative consequences pricing many

would-be homeowners out of the market

will review it to make sure it isn't a

barrier and because the stress test

doesn't just stand in the way of

first-time homebuyers it will work with

the office of the superintendent of

financial institutions to remove the

stress test from mortgage renewals

second for our first-time homebuyers

will increase maximum amortization

periods on insured mortgages to 30 years

longer amortization periods mean lower

mortgage payments and put more save but

put more money save to be put towards

student debt family monthly bills and

retirement third we'll launch an inquiry

into money loss in a real estate sector

and work with our industry partners to

root out corrupt practices these shady

dealings are inflating prices and

already expensive markets such as here

in the GTA and in Vancouver and they

must come to

and finally we'll make surplus federal

real estate

for housing development we'll review the

federal lands initiative and make sure

priorities align with the needs of the

housing market so extra government

buildings can be developed or renovated

increasing housing supply and lowering

prices Sofia that all sales would be on

young if they saw lately

we understand that housing is not just

important to you personally but also to

the economic well-being of the whole

country will not put our economy at risk

by introducing policies that we've in

the housing market will protect your

home and its value and we will continue

to support first-time homebuyers

by making it easier for them to purchase

a home and afford it in the long term

that is why we also announced that a new

Conservative government will provide

much-needed relief to homeowners or the

green homes tax credit to help you pay

for these renovations we will provide a

20% refundable tax credit for

renovations renovation costs between

1020 thousand that could save you up to

3,800 ollars a year on home renovations

and our universal tax cut which is worth

up to 850 dollars for a couple along

with other affordability measures will

help young Canadians save for a down

payment

just intrude on the Liberals have made

it harder for you to buy a home if he's

given four more years and will only

become more difficult it will continue

to hurt your bottom line his carbon tax

will go up raising the price of gas by

31 cents a litre and adding eleven

hundred and fifty one dollars to your

household expenses including four

hundred and sixty nine dollars a year

for natural gas and is overspending his

debt and never-ending deficits will

force him to raise other taxes even

higher I believe Canada should be a

place where no dream is over breach

where homeownership is within the reach

of all tax paid hardware companions the

four-point plan I've announced it which

includes fixing the mortgage stress-test

increase in the amortization periods on

insured mortgages launching an inquiry

into money laundering in the real estate

sector making surplus federal buildings

available for development will bring

that dream closer to reality for the

millions of Canadians within priced out

of the market adjusted Trudeau's bad

policies and poor judgment Levante in

October Isabella Swan entrepreneur

Minister Keeaumoku de levy may know

about the situation feels yes a met

appropriate dumbest idea or the party a

new vocal among conservative here in

klepto

who's a day who's a that week on October

21st you have a choice between a prime

minister who has increased your cost of

living hurting your bottom line and put

homeownership out of roots

and a new Conservative government that

has a real plan to help you get ahead to

put more money in your pocket and so you

can build the life that you want thank

you see

Kelly Malone the Canadian Press so staff

can reported earlier to this year that

the Canadians are taking on more and

more debt in the form of mortgages

former Conservative government brought

down the amortization period

specifically to address this problem

why are you reversing course well it's

clear that the longer amortization

period for first-time homeowners will

allow more key needs to purchase a home

that is something that first-time

homebuyers have asked for it's something

that we've heard feedback from from so

many different stakeholders it is

important that we have strong

regulations around financial sector to

ensure that the matter housing industry

our mortgage industry is strong a little

bus but we believe that for first-time

homebuyers a 30-year amortization period

is appropriate young first-time

homebuyers often have their highest

earning years ahead of them and so as

they as they get promoted and as their

when the measures were brought in said

it was discussed ability in the market

you mentioned that you would have fake

cards how will you keep the housing

market stable well the key here is that

we're going to fix the stress tests

we're going to ensure that the stress

test does what it's supposed to do

without the unten unintended negative

consequences for example in the last few

years the percentage of Canadians who

are using unregulated private lenders

has gone from 6% to 10% and that means

that they're often paying much higher

interest rates because they're unable to

get mortgages through traditional

banking system so clearly there are some

unintended negative consequences that we

want to address with this review of the

distress test

reporting Mr Shearer JP Tasker CBC News

I noticed in your announcement there's

nothing on a foreign speculator tax or

any sort of measures to curveball buying

by non gain

why have you left foreign speculator tax

off the table the key here is if we're

looking at the types of practices that

have a negative impact on housing prices

our focus here today is on the money

laundering aspect of it this is

something that governments across the

country have contemplated including the

British Columbia government we believe

that this will help get to the bottom of

some of the shady practices that are

going on many of that money does come

from overseas and this national inquiry

will allow us to get to the bottom of it

and to propose the types of changes that

we'll need to address it what about the

Liberals first-time home buyer incentive

will you scrap that we like that policy

is like so many other of just insurance

policies not as advertised

so many Canadians will not be able to

afford it won't have a real impact on on

the ability for a young couples to get

into the housing market and at the end

of the day the government almost part of

your home and benefits from the sale of

that down the room so our policy will

make housing more affordable for kids we

have a real plan and will actually

follow through on it unlike Jessica who

just always breaks the promise and after

the election

I don't understand through the whole

entire offensive circular from a

tradition axis about a new topic on us

and for a powerfully Nouveau Asian

Canadian cash tail Mr Shearer Michael

cutter from global national global news

is found that the former head of the US

neo-nazi group and the former soldier

Bowden member were among those whose

signatures were submitted to Elections

Canada last agency just officially

registered the People's Party of Canada

does this give you another reason to ask

for mr. Bernier to not be in this debate

now of course a absolutely tolerance

have no place in our in our society or

in our public discourse the decision the

criteria was for the debates were

designed by the Liberals without

consultation from the other parties it's

really up to the Liberal government to

explain I'm looking forward to debating

Justin Trudeau that's what my focus on

he ran away from the first debate I'm

hoping he shows up for the for the next

one but I'll be ready for that

opportunity to contrast my real plan to

help Canadians get ahead with his failed

policies of higher taxes and less formal

living

we larger absolute more content a

lay-day personal equally a day with a

tolerance see so the revolver had the XP

explicate led back

Allah will forgive me there's a spare

all due respect my question is about mr.

Baron can you please answer the question

do you think that mr. Bernier should be

removed from the debate

given these revelations again it's

really up to the Liberal government to

explain the criteria they were the ones

that said it

I absolutely condemn groups that promote

hate and intolerance and then spread

these types of hateful ideologies the

Liberal government to set the criteria

the Liberal government established this

this debates commission it's really up

to them to explain explain to Canada she

she received immense electorally famiiy

remain team you see on an exact record

metal Excel appropriately they position

signal upon a new Mac agency commander

leave you see I would stay d please

elector

who is this economist among the

delicious cake the Kasich campaign not

return for a d-league controversy and

threatened survival they say folk like

measured a day

the Canadian affected income revenue -

workers politic electrically make

president early labor

the benefits for a linear appearances

including confident City date

Donna Chandra becoming a laissez-faire

Canadian tip a lot of coffee on coffee

so it's very easy to have a clear

contrast between our plan and the

liberal clan the liberal plan is just

not as advertising people of Canadians

understand that Justin Trudeau raised

taxes on the middle class he made life

more expensive he broke his promises and

he has lied to Canadians it's on the

question of trust

who do you trust they leave more money

in your pocket so you can get ahead

Canadians cannot have trust in Justin

Trudeau on some policies he's actually

copied ideas for me that he voted

against in the House of Commons so he's

clearly has no plans to implement them

and at the end of the day Canadians know

that the carbon tax will continue to

increase and make life more affordable

so if Canadians are looking for a real

plan to help them get ahead they can

they can have confidence in our plan we

will deliver on our promises they know

that Justin Trudeau has not come on

buddy a dog for its methane secrets fed

on so close you don't fall for sushi

yeah planet no apology day no proper

political put it kennedy the blackest

equality fairness on the contract

Kathleen Wynne age though they mem

architect

bolon disaster Kathleen Wynne a dolphin

in Haiti

man okay bye fortitudo in sweep em come

on our Sikh temple a director Ontario

less let's say food around all our

passion so say it's a sec there so the

big difference the real question is

what's the difference between Kathleen

Wynne and Justin Trudeau the very same

people who are the architects of the

failed Kathleen Wynne Delta McGuinty

government that raise taxes ran massive

deficits mired in scandal and

corruptions are now working for Justin

Trudeau and they're following the same

playbook so voters in Ontario now but

they can limit the damage Justin Trudeau

to one term and they can elect a

Conservative government that will lower

taxes protect our public institutions

and our public programs like health care

and education and make life more

affordable so they can get ahead Christy

perk up with The Globe and Mail just

have all Pope on what you just said

about Kathleen Wynne you recently your

party really recently released in

advertisements aimed at her aren't

people going to get confused about

whether this is a provincial election

versus a federal election I think

Canadians are quite clear and in the

contrast this election they see they see

Justin Trudeau who is mired in scandal

and corruption who has lied to Canadians

who has lost the confidence of Canadians

because he just simply cannot tell the

truth

continues on a daily basis to not be

able to come clean with canes and they

see in myself a leader who is ready to

make life more affordable to cut their

taxes to return to balanced budgets over

responsible here a time the choice

between the two parties and the two

leaders in this election could not be

more clear and I'm convinced the

Canadians see that and we'll make litter

and we'll vote conservative on October

21st but mr. Trudeau is not campaigning

against the premier and you're not

campaigning against Kathleen Wynne so

why make that the central focus of your

message to one Koreans I think it's

important for people in Ontario to know

that Justin Trudeau will follow the

exact and has been following the exact

same playbook that Kathleen Wynne and

dolf McGinty ran here in Ontario voters

here understand what happens when you

let liberals continue their corrupt ways

continue to run massive deficits

continue to break their promises in lye

and to the people that they're elected

to serve and I believe that on October

21st voters not chair and across the

country will limit the damage of Justin

Trudeau's government come on Gerald

surely being CPAC sure you're in the

king bond transportation congestion is

already a real major problem your

climate you've just outlined talks about

you know making it easier for new builds

and new developments what does your

government gonna do to you know a

mediate that problem

that's an excellent question we will

have more to say throughout the campaign

about ensuring that infrastructure

dollars follow through on on being

linked to new developments that new

housing markets can come onto the market

starting new because the developments

we're providing to the market and that

the infrastructure projects to help

people move where they look to where

they were go along with it in addition

things like the public transit tax

credit that we've announced will make

taking public transit more affordable

for so many people and that will help

alleviate a congestion as well and we

will have more to say on specific

infrastructure projects both here in the

GTA and around the country that will

help to address that good morning Mr

Shearer Joyce thank your CPV so I'm

wondering why despite the troubles the

liberal campaign has had in

and the scandal this winter how come

you're still neck and neck

well I believe that Canadians will see

the clear contrast between a

scandal-plagued Liberal government led

by someone who can't tell the truth and

breaks his promises and our real plan to

make life more affordable I don't get

too worried about the polls there's only

one poll that matters that's on October

21st I can tell you our candidates are

telling us that the response of the

doors is fantastic we're getting more

volunteers over this election than we

did in the last election we've got

campaigns all across the country where

there were three years ago people who

are writing us off and we are going to

win those seats we're just surprised a

lot of people October 21st

I've been underestimated my entire

political career and I can tell you that

I'm very happy with the way the campaign

is going

our plan is resonating people are

getting excited about their policies or

tax cuts and what we're going to do for

them and I'm quite confident about the

results on October 21st yeah so my own

son - he come to see their son - the

vendee and I'm talking them back home

dollar back that's become a county daddy

all selling points a Marvel is a lot

pretty penny but you don't need it as an

axiom it's just you click off you put a

piece of that there the bank in a film

or is the Sheridan RCC's my colleagues

mentioned Prime Minister Trudeau

mentioned Stockport actually 15 times in

its and he said that his model of cuts

to help in Ontario would be the model

that you would follow so I do respond to

that do you intend to cut health care

and do you intend to bring in some kind

of a universal armature so it's quite

clear that I'm ready to run against

Justin Trudeau I am holding Justin

Trudeau to accounting he is desperate to

run against anybody other than me I have

made a commitment that we will only

increase transfers to health care and

education by at least three percent that

means that means we have confidence that

their health care systems will be there

to give them the services that maybe I

made the commitment

the same for social transfers so that

programs like magic education will

continue to go out Justin Trudeau

continues to lie though what

conservatives will do he continues to

lie about what he has done and what he

will do

Acadians know that they cannot believe

anything that comes out of his mouth he

will literally say anything to try to

distract from his record of scandal and

corruption we have someone we have a

prime minister who is the subject of our

CT inquiries into whether or not he

obstructed justice to whether or not he

interfered in a criminal prosecution

case that is that is a very serious

condemnation on his record as Prime

Minister so it's not surprising that

he's desperate to change the channel and

shift the focus from his own disastrous

record I know in universal Florida

well I mean this is a promise that

liberals have made since I was a

teenager and had one of the ministers

from Kathleen Wynne's failed government

design the proposal Canadians know that

this will cost billions and billions of

dollars

none of his plans are costed no details

he's clearly unable to explain to Keynes

how he would implement any of these

things and so once again Canadians

cannot have confidence and

thank you see what could do it alone

thanks very much
