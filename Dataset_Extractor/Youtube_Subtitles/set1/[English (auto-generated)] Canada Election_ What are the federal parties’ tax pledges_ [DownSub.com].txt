taxes are always a big part of campaign

promises but they loom especially large

in this election for the Liberals and

the Conservatives it's mostly about

lowering taxes both parties have

promised broad tax cuts that would each

cost around six billion dollars a year

and leave around 300 to 400 dollars more

per year in the pockets of the average

taxpayer the Conservatives are also

saying they will eliminate carbon

pricing and the GST on home heating

costs and introduce a long list of tax

credits on things like public

transportations and green home

renovations when it comes to tax

increases the focus has mainly been on

taxing the rich the Liberals want a

luxury tax for Canadians buying cars

boats and aircraft valued at $100,000 or

more the NDP and the Greens propose

attacks on wealth over twenty million

dollars and hiking taxes on capital

gains which would mostly affect the

wealthy it's a long list and those are

just some of the promises but how will

these tax changes play out will they

make a difference and are they a good

idea although the conservative and the

liberal plans would cost about the same

amount in lost tax revenues those

benefits would go to different people

under the two plans the conservative

plan would give a bigger tax cut to

Canadians who receive higher incomes

result of that is to get the full

benefit under the conservative plan

you'd have to be earning about $50,000

or more that's quite a bit of money we

contrasted the liberal plan gives

roughly the same amount to most Canadian

taxpayers today except for the very top

of the income distribution and it's

important to remember that we don't have

a lot of information on some of these

tax promises and with tax policy often

the devil is in the detail that's your

money one two three four this week I'm
