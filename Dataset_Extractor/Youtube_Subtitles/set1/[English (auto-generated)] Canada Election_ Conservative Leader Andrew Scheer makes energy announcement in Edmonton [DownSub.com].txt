well good morning everyone

I am so happy to be back in Edmonton

today it's great to be joined by so many

hardworking and passionate Canadians and

I want to thank my friend and the

candidate for Edmonton mill woods

Tim uppal thanks very much Tim for being

here I'm looking forward to having you

back in Ottawa as Canadians we are the

most fortunate people in the world our

country's potential is as vast as the

distance between our shores throughout

our history our leaders have brought

people together from all walks of life

from all around the world in pursuit of

something bigger than ourselves leaders

like Sir John a McDonald whose vision of

a country that spanned from the Atlantic

to the Pacific led to the Canadian

Pacific Railway like Louise similar on

whose vision of a more engaged more a

united nation led to the st. Lawrence

Seaway and the Trans Canada Highway like

John Diefenbaker whose vision of a

Canada of the north led to the first

all-weather road across the Arctic

Circle

these were leaders who could see beyond

what was there to what

there could be leaders who weren't

afraid to turn to Canadians and say

follow me the journey will be difficult

but the destination will be worth it and

in doing so they created a

tria possibility and opportunity for

someone like me who grew up in a

middle-class family can go on to run to

be prime minister say premier Minister a

dad a leader can have a pepper the

crocodile a Kennedy a like an Indian

down easier Ella dear sweet a more

severe difficile Malaysia onvo LaShonda

Samba tea and pay the possibility who

cocoon come ma ke grandi does infamy

teleclass my end pursue present a threat

remedies Justin Trudeau lacks the

leadership and vision of those who came

before him he pursues short-sighted

policies for short-term political gains

pitting region against region province

against province Canadian against

Canadian since taking office Justin

Trudeau has repeatedly attacked Canada's

energy sector and the men and women who

work in it there's bill Bell c69

the no more pipelines bill then the

shipping ban bill c48

he continues to turn a blind eye as

foreign special interests smear our

energy sector which adheres to the

highest environmental standards in the

world the results have been as

depressing as they have been predictable

two major pipelines cancelled trans

mountain on life support investment has

left the country and hundreds of

thousands of hardworking people have

lost their jobs families across the

country are hurting sometimes

desperately so in Trudeau just won't

listen last December just down the road

from here in this queue I met some of

the unemployed oil patch workers it was

one of the most emotional experiences in

my life what I heard was heartbreaking

story after story about hard-working

Canadians losing their good-paying jobs

and struggling to provide for their

families the pain in their voice was

clear as was the hurt in their eyes

albertans and all Canadians deserve

better

it's time for a government that

understands that we're in this together

that Canada works better when we work

together and that our natural resources

can be a for

for good which brings me to why I'm here

today to reaffirm my commitment that a

new Conservative government will create

a national energy corridor to carry

Canadian energy and resources from coast

to coast it will move oil gas hydro

electricity telecommunications and

accommodate other linear infrastructure

it will be a transnational quarter that

will generate economic and social

benefits for the entire country a

national energy corridor will provide

Quebec with opportunities to explore its

hydroelectricity to new markets it will

provide rural communities with

opportunities to connect to vital

telecommunication infrastructure it will

provide economic opportunities for

indigenous communities along the route

juice we see or should we prefer me in

engagement proceed on a new vote

the connect a an infrastructure or the

telecommunication Vittal without our

fear they possibility economic or

community attack done with a single

corridor industry wouldn't need to

submit complicated route proposals for

every new project with a single corridor

we could minimize environmental impacts

lower the costs of environmental

assessments without sacrificing quality

increase certainty for investors get

critical projects built and create

good-paying jobs a new conservative

government will appoint a blue-ribbon

task force to provide recommendations

within six months of its establishment

on how best to proceed will then work

with

offenses and indigenous peoples who

would both share in the prosperity this

project would provide to realize this

vital coast-to-coast link now there will

be those who say it can't be done who

say it's simply too ambitious but

Canadians have heard that before and

each and every time through our

determination and our enginee

we have proven the naysayers wrong

Canada has spent four years being a

country of no under Justin Trudeau that

needs to change as Canadians we need to

return to the optimism and vision of

great Canadians like McDonald sail Iran

and Diefenbaker we need to start

dreaming big again and we need to start

dreaming together we need to start

building a stronger more united country

worthy of those who came before us

and that our children and grandchildren

deserve we need to move from no to yes

yes to more responsible resource

exploration yes to getting our energy to

market yes to more better paying jobs

yes to new infrastructure projects that

shorten commute times and keep our

economy moving and yes to being a

country where big things are possible

and where every Canadian whether here in

Edmonton or Vancouver or Quebec City or

st. John's has the opportunity to

benefit from a strong energy sector this

election is about the future of Canada

and the future of your family and the

choice is between a government that

makes life more expensive and a new

Conservative government that will

support economic opportunities for all

Canadians a new Conservative government

that will make life more affordable and

a new Conservative government that will

live within its means put more money in

your pockets so that you can get ahead

merci beaucoup thank you very much happy

person

[Applause]

good morning Mr Shearer Joyce Napier CTV

you say your plan is ambitious and we

know how difficult it is to build a

pipeline how are you gonna get the

province to agree with you on this

energy corridor well you're absolutely

right it has become very difficult to

get pipelines built in this country it

wasn't always the case

there are thousands of kilometres of

pipeline all across Canada in every

province and I am convinced that with

this idea we can address some of the

concerns that that indigenous

communities have that provinces may have

and do the important environmental

assessments all up front so that when

project proponents come along the the

heavy lifting has been done and they can

do what they've always done that is get

pipelines built with private sector

money not with taxpayers money mr. Kovic

comedy series of your motel they visit a

community actor turn yesterday Cotulla

province valve valve are in situation

keeper prophet a the set corridor l

sector pre-baked perfectly circular to

your face is a constantly growing

project

avec la Ronda sector prevalent the

contragravity what would be your plan

for boil water advisories on in

indigenous communities well the plan

will be to ensure that there's both

funding available for the capital

requirements and ongoing funding to

ensure maintenance and training for

people on reserve to be able to make

sure those facilities are working so a

lot more to say on that jethro out the

campaign but that is something that will

be very important to to a Conservative

government under my leadership Thank You

Kelly Malone the Canadian Press you'll

be meeting with mr. Kenny today but in

Ontario you've made no effort to meet

with the premier there will what was the

decision to meet with mr. Kenny and will

he be meeting with other conservative

premiers across well Jason Kenney

offered to meet up with me today I've

known him for almost 20 years where

we're very good friends and I was

excited to be able to to attend an event

together today I've been meeting with

conservatives and Canadians all across

the country who are tired of Justin

Trudeau's high taxes massive deficits

and embarrassing track record on the

world stage

I've met with provincial leaders in

Newfoundland and annum Reds wick and

people from from all across the country

supporting our great candidates and

we'll continue to do so throughout this

campaign we gotta participate even more

should we avec nous ce que knee a news

[Music]

amoebas go right now he served try being

impacted a decision do you think lower

leg of anomaly we have if there's one

province that it's been hit hardest by

Justin Trudeau's record of failure and

attack on the energy sector it is

Alberta

if there is one province that knows all

too well the devastating impacts of

things like Bill c69 like the carbon tax

it is Alberta and so I'm very excited to

appear with mr. Kenney later on today

see in province ISA ibn Lee's impact

disaster is named Cleo sail abraca

it's ably impact a part of our safe zone

if the tax to the carbon Arata

participate back mr. Kuney

should be people in Ontario are also

worried about their economy does that

mean you'll be meeting with mr. Ford at

some point you're quite right the people

in Ontario are very worried about the

impacts of the carbon tax they are very

worried about how the manufacturing

sector in Ontario has been hit by the

energy sectors troubles as well and so I

have no doubt that the people are

Ontario are looking forward to a new

Conservative government as well that we

Canada it's a boy damas until the fair

campaign avec Monsieur Candie George

school sure I know that Quebecers

understand that it's better to buy

Canadian energy that it's but it's it

makes no sense that they're spending

their consumer dollar on energy that's

coming from the from the United States

I've made my choice

I support Canadian energy I support

Canadian energy workers I think the

world needs more caning energy I think

Canada needs more Canadian energy and

this energy quarter will help us

accomplish exactly that same situation a

conclusion B yes so the Liberal

government has closed the door on on the

on the equalization formula locking it

in for another five years I believe that

with announcements like this on the

energy corridor we can get big projects

built again we can get those pipelines

built we can get the energy sector back

on its feet

and Alberta will benefit greatly from

that as will all provinces good morning

Christy kirkut from The Globe and Mail

our newspaper has reported that it was

not able to find any evidence that you

were indeed a licensed insurance broker

just for clarity's sake were you ever a

licensed insurance broker and if so for

how long I was I did receive my

accreditation under the Canadian and

accredited insurance broker program and

as I as my staff mentioned to your

newspaper

I left the insurance office before the

licensing process was finalized one

thing that's been pointed out is that

your website though does say that you

are a licensed broker and I know during

the campaign you've criticized Liberal

leader Justin Trudeau for not being as

advertised does this mean that you are

not as advertised if that is what it

says on your website as I said I was I

did receive my accreditation through the

program CBC News virtually every

campaign stop we've been on there's been

environmental activists protesting you

you haven't spoken to any of them that

I've seen is there a recent reason why

you're not engaging with these climate

activists is there a reason why you

haven't gone up to them to make your

pitch in the environment well you know

I've engaged with Canadians all across

this country I've been attending public

events and holding events that are open

to the public I have actually engaged

with people who do come to my events I

was in Quebec for for an event and sat

down with people who were concerned

about a number of issues so I'm always

ready to engage with people when they

have something to say or a question I

can understand the frustration of people

who are concerned about the climate

because of the failure of Justin

Trudeau's handling of the environment

when we look at the fact that his carbon

tax is not working we're falling further

and further away from our targets but

the cost of living is getting more and

more expensive I can understand the

frustration there seems to be activists

at every turn that we're on this

campaign why do you think that they make

a choice to come to your campaign events

well I note that they are also attending

other leaders events the activists that

here today supporting our the activists

who want the energy sector back on its

feet the people here who want to be able

to work I have met with so many people

who had the insult added to the injury

of watching their company go bankrupt

and selling the equipment to American

companies to build projects in the US

and this devastation that that has had

on families in Alberta and Saskatchewan

and in other provinces those are the

people that I am going to be a champion

for this announcement is how we're going

to get this done to repair scoot a

little back to moon yeah the 4k do the

reunion vectors on Kia he manifested or

toward the nose a Eva Marcille Johnson

National Post do you have a preferred

route for this corridor end up on either

coast and it has to go through Quebec

yeah well obviously the the exact

specific location will be determined by

this blue ribbon panel and by after

extensive calm consultations with

indigenous communities and with premiers

obviously it will need to get to ports

we would we would envisage this to go

through areas that would ultimately

allow us to export our energy around the

world so that would be the ultimate end

point how we get there will leave to the

experts the scientists the geologists

and the first indigenous leaders it's a

very good point because it's not

necessarily about buying the land it's

about creating the regulatory approvals

process so that as is the case already

with pipelines being constructed it's

about establishing the regulatory

process that allows the private sector

proponents to do what they've always

done in this country so

you know as I said the exact specifics

and exactly where the route will go will

be determined after these extensive

consultations are done but ultimately we

would envisage this terminating in ports

that will allow us to ship our energy

around the world so that more Canadians

more countries have access to Canadian

energy so they don't have to purchase

oil and gas from countries with terrible

records on the environment with terrible

records for human rights and the world

can have access to more Canadian energy

the pipeline is not of course only

something you have to take negotiate

with province this is also presumably

have to expropriate private property to

build an energy corridor across Canada I

know there are people in Alberta who are

upset feel hard done by their Energy's

landlocked and can't get out but are you

not concerned that by taking land

expropriating land exposing people to

risk of spills and so on when most of

the benefits will come here you're just

transferring resentment from Alberta to

other parts of Canada over this issue

not at all and people here aren't just

feeling hard done by they're feeling

devastated many of them have lost their

homes they've they've been working for

companies that have existed for decades

that have gone bankrupt because there's

no confidence that we can get things

built in this country again and as I

said there are hundreds of thousands of

kilometres of pipeline now in Canada

this does not need to be done in terms

of expropriating large amounts of land

it's about the regulatory process

addressing the environmental concerns

and getting the indigenous consultations

done properly and in terms of benefiting

from it there's no doubt that the people

who have been laid off here in Alberta

and Saskatchewan will benefit when we

get these projects back up and running

again but the benefits of Western

Canadian oil and gas is shared with all

Canadians it benefits every province in

this country a refinery jobs in eastern

Canada manufacturing jobs in Ontario and

Quebec the revenue that goes into the

federal government that allows the

federal government to support provincial

programs for health and education in

every country this is not a zero-sum

game and this is the problem with Justin

Trudeau's attitude he thinks that it's

pitting region against region and he

thinks the way to go is to divide

Canadians my vision is to unite

Canadians and promote the benefits of

responsible resource extraction in

Western Canada that benefits every

single Canadian say say claire curley

benefits in the sector of energetic EC

Sante a ledge occasion oh allah - leykin

in da prophet the like suction - no

wrote that it was simplistic and wrong

to think that brexit would bring

political or economic uncertainty you

encouraged the British to vote to leave

the European Union clearly took sides

clearly took sides on that issue so I'm

not asking about whether you support

that right to choose we know you do I'm

asking about you personally what lessons

if any have you taken from the last

three years yourself personally well as

you mentioned at the time I did publish

that article it was soon after Justin

Trudeau took a side in the conversation

as well I'm focused here during this

campaign on issues that matter to

Canadians that impact Aidan's daily life

making life more affordable reducing the

cost of living putting more money back

in their pockets bringing in things like

tax credits for kids sports and

eliminating the carbon tax that's my

focus this campaign

doing short Edmonton Journal and son

yesterday we saw thousands of Canadians

march and strike for or for the

environment and for climate and now

today you're announcing a national ing

quarter how do you plan to balance both

concerns well exactly because this

corridor will allow the federal

government to take care of and address

environmental concerns up front what's

happening right now in the energy sector

is that there's no confidence in the

approvals process companies are not

willing to put in the hundreds of

millions of dollars only to have the

Liberal government move the goal posts

and change the conditions halfway

through the process

this will create certainty this will

allow the federal government working

with provinces to identify the

environmental challenges that have to be

addressed by project proponents and then

those proponents will have to meet those

standards in order for projects to

proceed so this is a balanced approach

that that achieves the dual goals of

protecting the environment and allowing

Canada to extract its natural resources

well as I said this will be an ambitious

project that will require a lot of

consultation I believe that can be done

in the medium-term obviously we will

wait to see what their recommendations

are from this panel but I do believe

that we can start working on this within

this first mandate and and ultimately

get to the point where big projects can

get built again in this country

Jordan Olmstead CBC amitin just

wondering you mentioned kind of

balancing these these different

competing objectives here but how do you

plan to meet the 20 30 pairs climate

goals that you said that your government

would meet when independent analysts say

that your comment and wouldn't actually

reduce emissions enough to meet those

goals

well I reject those those statements our

environmental plan is the most

comprehensive policy ever put forward by

a party in opposition over 50 specific

concrete proposals that will help Canada

reduce emissions not just here home but

around the world and that is the part

that Justin Trudeau is missing in all of

this we could shut everything down

tomorrow morning we could tools down

power down everybody stop doing

everything

within a matter of weeks China India

Indonesia would replace all those

emissions he's thinking too narrowly

it's easy for him to walk in parades or

to make announcements with no details

but our plan allows Canada to export

more of what we can produce here at a

lower rate of emissions for example in

Canada we can produce aluminum thanks to

our hydroelectricity and technological

advancements at a fraction of the

emissions for that same unit of

production in China it doesn't make

sense to chase those jobs and investment

here from Canada only to see production

moved to other countries where emissions

will actually go up but so by exporting

our clean technology our advancements

like carbon capture we can do more to

lower global emissions and after all

isn't that the point isn't the point for

there to be fewer molecules of co2 in

the atmosphere that's what our plan does

we miss a clear Network plomp longer

mozilla comprehensive the proposai power

in partying opposition least wadu'

canada yeah previous segments Monsieur

specific Kiba realism is your EC au

canada may dancin contacts global OC

it's a Cecilia shows Kimmy adjusting to

the mark in a constant romper so the

impact we realize emission of

exportation the energy proper a small

technologic and just can you point to

one example in your plan that would

actually push us towards reducing those

emission targets past mr. Trudeau's plan

well sure we maybe announcement just a

few days ago about our green home

renovation tax credit which will lead to

lower energy bills for Canadians making

life more affordable and less energy

being consumed that's estimated to be at

least nine megatons of co2 reductions

people could do one thanks very much
