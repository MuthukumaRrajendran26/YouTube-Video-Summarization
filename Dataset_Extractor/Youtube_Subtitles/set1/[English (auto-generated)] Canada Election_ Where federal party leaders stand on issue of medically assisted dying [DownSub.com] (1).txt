David akin is here with me now David

you're here because you're traveling

with the conservative leader who is

campaigning here in Nova Scotia how much

of a battleground is Atlantic Canada in

this election it's a big battleground

there's definitely gonna be some changes

here in Atlantic Canada and possibly in

this writing as you mentioned it as a

history going conservative there are ten

seats in the region that's about one

third of everything in Atlantic Canada

that could flip away from the Liberals

most likely to the Conservatives I think

there's one seat up in Newfoundland

Labrador that could go to the NDP the X

Factor here is the Green Party they are

showing some strength in PEI and in New

Brunswick and health care we know is a

major issue for many Canadians and a

life-and-death issue came up last night

assisted dying a Quebec judge recently

struck down some parts of the assisted

dying law because it was to is

restrictive what did the party leaders

say about it

right and this was a campaign issue last

night and again today this Quebec Court

is saying this ruling is

unconstitutional because it restricts

the right to a legal medically assisted

death only to those who are facing a

painful death and the courts saying no

those who have incurable conditions who

are facing a painful life ought to be

able to choose to die as well so Liberal

leader Justin Trudeau says his

government is not going to appeal the

decision that the deadline to do that is

October 18th

but if reelected the Liberals will

introduce legislation to amend the

current law in line with the judge's

ruling the government needs to make sure

we're getting the balance right the

balance between protecting the most

vulnerable and making sure people's

rights and choices are respected now

conservative leader Andrew Shearer

thinks Trudeau should appeal that Quebec

ruling he'd like to have the certainty

of a Supreme Court decision NDP leader

jug meats saying well he'd like to open

up the discussion about loosening the

restrictions on who may have access to a

medically assisted death and Donna this

is not an academic discussion this is a

live hot issue for all campaigning

politicians because whoever forms

government after October 21st is very

quickly going to have to confront this

Quebec Court ruling that says more

people ought to have the right to a

medically assisted death a

life-and-death issue for so many people

David a can thank you
