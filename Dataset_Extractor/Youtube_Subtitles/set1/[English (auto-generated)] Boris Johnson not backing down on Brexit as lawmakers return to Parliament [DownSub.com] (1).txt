Boris Johnson arrived back from the UN

in New York early to face a resumed

Parliament seething with anger but first

up was the Attorney General who faced

angry questions and accusations like

this hundred coming here with these

barristers bluster a party like this and

a leader like this this prime minister

to talk about then the prime minister

arrived to the baying benches he again

said he disagreed with the Supreme Court

decision to nullify his prorogation

before challenging the opposition to

trigger an election they have until the

house rises today to table a motion of

no confidence in the government

opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn says he

won't do so until Johnson strikes a deal

with the EU or delays breakfast

the latter is something the Prime

Minister says he will never do he says

he wants a general election get an

extension

korban is hugely divisive - even within

his own party

so one extraordinary outcome to all of

this could be the opposition taking

control of governments with a more

neutral prime minister in charge

temporarily and then an election before

the end of the year and tonight when

Bryan Minister Boris Johnson was asked

if he would prorogue for a second time

he refused to answer
