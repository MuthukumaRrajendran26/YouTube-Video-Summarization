I think obviously when it comes to an

issue that is so important so delicate

so difficult for so many families the

government needs to make sure we're

getting the balance right the balance

between protecting the most vulnerable

and making sure people's rights and

choices are respected that's why we'd

move forward on responsible legislation

three years ago but we recognize that we

need to take more steps to move forward

as a society we recognize that court

cases would come in that people would be

evolving as a society and that's what

we've responded to we will move forward

in a responsible way with legislation

that responds to that okay new oconee so

we've actually committed to more

investments in palliative care the

essential element around a society is

ensuring that everyone gets to support

the treatments that they need to live in

dignity and to make the choice of

medical assistants and dying one that is

made in in a way that isn't because

you're not getting the kinds of supports

and cares that you actually need that is

something that we're committed to

investing in we've made a commitment on

six billion dollars

more invested in healthcare in

particular areas like mental health like

support for seniors like making sure

that we're out also ensuring that

everyone can get a family doctor these

are investments we're gonna make because

we have common priorities with the

provinces and we will work with them on

ensuring that their outcomes for people

I think any government that makes big

changes and that delivers on so many of

the promises we have is going to go

through experiences where people have

disagreements with them but I think what

we've been able to demonstrate is that

the approach that had been orthodoxy

particularly around the right for so

long that trickle down is the only way

to grow an economy doesn't work the

first thing we did was lower taxes on

the middle class and raise them on the

wealthiest one percent ask the

wealthiest to pay more we delivered

child benefits that have helped the

middle class and people working hard to

join it and that has led to economic

growth that is among the envy of the g7

we have the lowest debt to GDP ratio of

any country of any of the g7 countries

and it's continued to decline at the

same times we created over a million

jobs most of them full-time as well as

lifted 900,000 people out of poverty

there's lots more to do on the

environment there's lots more to do on

on fighting climate change on putting a

price on continuing with our price on

pollution there's lots more to do on

indigenous and we recognize there's lots

more to do but that's what we're going

to do I've spent a lot of time talking

with Canadians across the country and

people remain positive and focused on

the work we're doing together

we are recognizing that Quebecers are

defending their rights through the

Charter the way the Charter is meant to

be done

citizens can take a government to court

and and challenge a particular law that

conversation is happening right now but

as I've said we're going to keep

monitoring this process and if there is

a moment where we feel that the federal

government should engage in this

discussion formally we will do that on a

personal side and as a government

Canadians and Quebecers know full well

that I will always defend people's

rights whether it's minorities whether

it's francophone minorities outside of

Quebec

whether it's women's rights whether it's

LGBT communities the position of the

federal government is always to be

unequivocally there to defend people who

need need their rights defendant and

that's what we will continue to do no

other campaign right across the country

and at the same time ensure that we're

protecting the environment but what

we're seeing here from the Conservatives

is a classic and desperate attempt to

distract from the fact that they have

zero approach on climate change don't

even think it's important it's a

well-established far-right tactic to try

and discredit

environmentalists and people who

actually want to fight the environment

by distracting this is something that

simply won't work because Quebecers and

all Canadians know we need a government

that will fight climate change and that

is exactly what we've done and what we

will do no Haqqanis okay yeah please

we've recognized that reconciliation and

investments in partnership with

indigenous communities is essential for

the future of the country and the future

of reconciliation we need to continue to

work with indigenous peoples as we have

over the past four years to do concrete

things like eliminating boil water

advisories investing in new schools

investing in new health centers and

supports for mental health and addiction

treatments but also economic empowerment

and partnerships that move towards

self-government right across the country

we recognize there's much more to do we

also recognize that people are impatient

and I'm impatient I'm impatient because

the Conservatives continued to block a

bill that was about implementing unrep

we're impatient because they continue

and people continue to drag their heels

when a Liberal government is focused on

moving forward in partnership with

indigenous peoples and we will continue

to do that conservatives will continue

to block leadership on indigenous issues

we will continue to move forward

I don't I will refer to the quote to the

chief of the Assembly of First Nations

who pointed out that no government in

the history of this kind of country has

done more for reconciliation for

supporting indigenous peoples than our

government but I recognize there's much

more to do and that's what we're focused

on doing and that's the choice facing

indigenous peoples and all Canadians do

we go back to the failed Harper approach

I've been absolutely unequivocal that I

will always defend a women's rights to

choose I will always defend LGBT

communities I will always defend

minorities I will always defend

linguistic minorities across this

country this is something the Canadians

know of a Liberal government and of me

as a leader what is unclear because Mr

Shearer won't answer a direct question

on whether or not he believes that women

should have the right to choose he will

not answer that question about his

personal beliefs and if we don't know

who he's willing to fight for who he's

willing to defend how can Canadians make

an informed decision about whether or

not he will fight for them and defend

their rights I think it's very clear

that on a question so fundamental as

women's rights

mr. shear is simply not there to defend

them
