welcome to the jack layton park here

this part we are only five minutes away

from the huts of God club and in the 60s

it was a place where French kids did not

belong it was an exclusive place that

didn't give space for the minorities in

the area and Jack Layton was a member of

the club when he was a teenager he felt

the pain of the exclusion of his cracker

Pony friends and he saw injustice and so

he decided to fight it

he found the rule book that as a junior

Commodore he could invite a friend so he

came up this scheme with his friends and

invited everyone of his francophone

friends and they had a grand party and

that was an annual party here at Hudson

yard club and I can just imagine young

Jack you know I just be following smile

thinking of him at that age already with

the instinct to lift people up to fight

his justice and discrimination I too

felt excluded I came to Canada when I

was 13 barely speaking my English still

learning I felt lost and excluded and I

was alone

and thirty years being public service

something s still happened to me even

though I represented Canada overseas as

a member of parliament during emeriti

debate recently a few years ago I was

told to go back to China and I didn't

even come from China imagine now a

different child in grade four bullied

relentlessly insulted

punched assaulted mocked taunted bashed

because of the way he looks because of

his religion because of his skin color

and instead of his heart going hard he

grew up hopeful loving and determined to

fight injustice and carry out that fight

with compassion with love and even with

joy he's the leader of NPD jack meat

sing Jamie gives people hope he gives

young people hope for a better future

for their planet

he gives families hope for better times

ahead he gives everyone who feels the

pain of discrimination and exclusion

hope we've all felt excluded whether we

are to talk too short to fat to skinny

or who we love how we worship the color

of our skin agenda

it didn't matter or even from the wrong

side of the town of the village I'm here

in Hudson today where it began for Jack

Layton saying to Canadians

to bet bars follow your heart and vote

for a truly progressive movement

followed and have to courage to vote for

government that's in it for you and

every vote for the NPD it's a

declaration that we all belong because

we support each other

Jackson Canadians don't let them tell

you it can't be done so go find a friend

who he was excluded and feels it

alienated who feels it doesn't make a

difference a few powerless and ask

him/her to join this wonderful movement

of progressives I'm also here because

the legacy of Jack Layton is being

carried out by a wonderful courageous

compassionate leader my good friend Jack

meat sing I do not expect that

I want to say thank you to me for being

here is really messy too with the team

want to thank everyone giraffe a mess

here to be Kiki SC Mexico Olivia I want

to thank just again Olivia for being

here and I wanted to take a moment just

to talk about being here at the park

about exactly it's an inspiration

Jack was someone that was able to win

over the hearts of Canada Canadians went

over the hearts of Quebecers and he did

that not just with his personality which

was pretty amazing and not with just his

ability to connect with people but

because of his values these values of

fighting social injustice and to defend

our planet and the environment and and

we want to build on that we want to

build on that dream that Jack had to

connect the progresses of Quebec with

those across Canada and build a better

future together

so our priorities in this election have

been really clear we want to fight the

climate crisis like we want to win it we

want to make sure we deliver better

services invest in health care medical

medication coverage for all dental care

and

the light is more affordable we want to

make sure that they're very rich those

at the very very top pay their fair

share I wanted to make it clear go back

that you know despite maybe differences

of appearances I share the same values I

believe firmly and a woman's right to

choose I believe and they're not just

talking about the right to abortion but

in defending and expanding access to

those services I believe firmly and the

rights or LGTBQ communities to love who

they love to marry who they want to

marry I want to make sure that people

can die in dignity and I want to

continue to make sure that there's a

clear separation between church and

state something that I believe and I'm

proud to say I think oh records are

seeing that I share their values I think

it's also clear that Quebecers are

seeing that the Liberals don't share

their values over the past four years

and during this campaign has become

really clear that there's a lot that the

Liberals like to say in public there's a

lot that mr. Shute olessa say in public

but in private

behind closed doors he meets with a

powerful lobbyist and keys are their

demands and continues to subsidize oil

and gas companies continues to give big

exemptions to the biggest polluters and

continues to choose the pharmaceutical

lobbyists and the insurance lobbyists

and their priorities over people need

medication and better health care and

the block is also meeting clear that

they're not the choice for progressives

with their candidates that they some

great candidates but with the candidates

recently and the revelations that we've

learned about them and the really weak

response by the leader and by those

candidates it shows that they're not the

progressive option for Quebecers and so

I want to put it to go Becker's like

this if you want someone who's gonna

fight the climate crisis who's going to

stand up for you who's going to make

sure we make like more affordable zoun

invest in health care invest in dental

care and medication coverage for all and

make sure that the people at the very

very top the richest pay their fair

share that progresses the progressive

option for Quebecers is us the New

Democrats

lines you also mentioned in the speech

leading up that may look different how

much of a challenge has it been and it

continues to be for you in this province

given the fact that you are a turban

well I mean I grew up in places across

this country and I have faced I've had

amazing people that have been warm and

generous and loving and I face people

that have in some cases believe me or

attack me because I look different and I

didn't grow up equal back I mean Olivia

touched on the fact that it's a reality

for a lot of Canadians that because of

how they look it could be their

appearance it can be the color of their

skin it could be where they live where

they come from that people face a lot of

challenges and I face some of them

myself but I hope people in Canada

across this country could see if he's

someone who's experienced a little bit

of what they feast they face and that's

willing to fight hard to build a Canada

where no one faces barriers because it

were there this is your last stop in the

province and their final pitch

Connecticut voters how do you

differentiate your type of progressive

politics from the politics that Justin

Trudeau is currently telling Canadians

the government they need is a

progressive government to fight the

Conservatives what what is the

differentiating factor that people will

see that we are actually I just wanted

to catch you and then I want to give you

the deep one no I'm really what mr. Chu

is done and I mean is so so so firmly he

said a lot of nice things he said a lot

of nice things in 2015 but there's a

really clear pattern of behavior it's

not one time it's multiple times wait

Paul this is something that would help

people out and he does the opposite

meets a commitment to do something to

defend the environment that does the

opposite I just want to make those

examples really clear he said very

clearly 2015 that he would end the

subsidies for oil and gas he promised

that in 2015 well what happened for

years he met with his government met

with the oil gas Lobby is 1500 times I

want to be clear meeting with lobbyists

isn't the problem

it's when you listen to them over people

when you break their promises to defend

the environment after meeting with the

lobna slots the problem and that's what

mr. Schue dot chiodo does he's got a

very different reality what he says in

public and what he does in private he

says he's gonna lower the cost of

medication and he meets with the

pharmaceutical and the lobbyists for the

insurance companies and he breaks a

commitment a simple no cost commitment

that would have lowered the cost of

medication the only reason I can imagine

he did that was because he wanted to

protect the profits of the

pharmaceutical industry that to me is

wrong he is not a progressive because he

does not biker people he fights for the

powerful in the wealthy yes he gives

them 14

dollars in tax breaks when families are

saying we can't find housing he spends

19 percent less than the Conservatives

on housing so it's really clear he says

nice things but he does the opposite

we have so many examples he is not in it

for people he is not fighting for people

what he is fighting for his power he

wants a stay Prime Minister that's sure

but he's not actually gonna make it was

life better

the difference is we are fighting for

people we're in it for people we want to

make their lives better and every

decision we make is gonna put people at

the heart of it and make sure that we're

deciding to do things that invest in

them not an enriching how full leather

started this campaign there was a lot to

talk to built on one how it would affect

you because you wear the turban and

carry the car pen there was a gentleman

who asked said suggested that it can cut

off your turban it would help

do you find though now that people in

Quebec are starting to see past with

Herman I should say I always saw that

you'll come back and sometimes that

small always captured we we had events

had bless these up in Montreal and the

number of times people came up to me

francophones and Anglophones they said

they loved this server and they liked

the color I was wearing I should wear

that color more often because I got a

lot of compliments on it I think it was

a good pinkish show it I think where he

won again actually no but I receive a

lot of love and and I'm really when I

said that in the beginning of my speech

in French I was i I'm thankful for the

reception that I received the fact that

Quebecers have listened that's what I've

had to say

I've always received an incredible

experience every summer comfortable back

there is definitely a spirit of openness

that doesn't get I think it's ignored

sometimes because of the talk of Bill 21

there is a really strong spirit of

openness and I've always received just a

lot of love that I'm really inspired by

that and I'm humbled by that but I

certainly believe things have changed

throughout the campaign I think as I be

able to talk about my values it's gone

beyond just the appearances and people

you know what he actually does share our

values and I'm proud of that because

pains should matter and it does matter

and I've seen the change

Quebecers are saying you know what this

is a guy that sounds just like us talk

like us aren't just not bad

and and but more importantly he's got

the C values he believes in the rights

of women he believes in the rights at

the LGTBQ the right to die with dignity

Quebec is is a leader in that field at

the top field but people here in Quebec

understand the importance of that right

and and they're seeing in me something

that understands and values and shares

us but we are saying things like you

could potentially be wiped out in Quebec

do you think it will translate into

seats as well that people are seeing the

Haast

yes translate into the support that

we're receiving on the ground is gonna

translate into support at the poles and

I'm confident that people will will see

that we will fight for them we care

about them we share the values of

Quebecers I'm going to make sure that

they can they can count on us to fight

for them in the next parliament no

matter what the Parliament looks like I

want folks to know that I will be there

for them our team will be there for them

and we're gonna make sure that they have

us on their side I like to say one see

that difference okay I said in French is

good no

would be the top priority whether you

became prime minister or if you were

part of coalition or part of minority

but first and one first priority

Quebecers the environment is really

clear for Quebecers they care deeply

apassionata there's a really strong

connection with the leakage on the

regions they have a deep connection with

the environment and there's a reason why

it's such an important issue being

perfected and so that's something that

we're really product we've got a strong

offer for Quebec and it respects that

how important that is to the people here

in Quebec and we've had time to reflect

on it in 2011 the New Democrats really

established a presence here it's 2019

and as Hannah mentioned you could be

wiped out how did it get to this

situation for your party here in Quebec

in 2019 so I don't want to make it sound

like I accepted that frame I think that

that's not the case at all we're not in

any fear of that happening now we've got

an incredible team and a strong base and

a base of support that shows that people

really believe in us and and we're going

to continue to fight hard there is there

is a lot that we've done in this

campaign that was different than the

previous campaign that shows how

important we take the issues of Quebec

we announced a plan specifically for

Quebec something that Jack did and and

that

we wanted to bring back but had it been

done in a little bit of time so we

wanted to bring that back show Quebecers

and not only we're gonna fight for you

but we've got a specific plan that

responds to unique things that matter to

people come back environmental

evaluations or rights to control culture

is culture so importance of spending

when it comes to go back culture and

music and hearts making sure that the

federal money goes to allowing go back

to peace need to direct and to allocate

those funds the way they seem most

appropriate given come back to me

identity really proud of that and so we

put forward a unique offer we've got a

lot of support there's a base of support

that exists is not disclosing the source

contributions that it's made to third

party groups that are attacking the

Liberals do you think that they should

have to disclose the the source of the

money that they've received yeah I

believe in a transparency

my values are that no more transparency

helps and it's important and

particularly with third party there's

concerns around where the party

that's come from and the financing so I

think it's a fair question that's being

asked and and of course journalist like

yourself doing the great work to get to

the bottom of it this morning mr.

Trudeau said that we could work out

where Canada could wake up with the

sheer government and called the Tory

campaign

dirty' sorry he called it a dirty

campaign I'm just wondering if you share

that view well I believe campaign should

be respectful and we should be able to

have this difference in the opinions and

express those differences passionately

but in a respectful manner so that's

what I believe in

I'm not sure I haven't really made the

evaluation between this election and

others clearly to see if this is worse

than others but I think that's something

we should all strive for we can disagree

you know different opinions we should

all agree to do respectfully but also to

do it in a way that doesn't divide the

population purposely we can have

different opinions and we can still seek

to bring people together but I also want

to push back do not vote out of here and

don't let mr. Trudeau encourage you to

vote out of here nothing like nothing

good in life comes from making a

decision out of here

if you want something bold if you want

to see someone fight for you both we're

both with your heart vote with hope vote

for what you believe in I believe that

is how you should always vote and that's

how we make big things happen a lot of

people predicted that this would be a

really very dirty campaign or very

divisive how have you found it yeah I

have been relieved I gotta be compared

it thoroughly I've kind of been in the

campaigns it's hard to kind of step out

and compared to other campaigns there's

been moments which I think have been

have you troubling

well when when it keeps light that mr.

Shido done blackface a lot of lots of

times that that was something very

troubling I think that hurt a lot of

people so there's been moments that have

been highly hurtful and hard to deal

with for people but there's been moments

of loss of hope there's been lots of

excitement as some people that have seen

a real alternative I think with New

Democrats have seen our leadership and

really they've seen our campaign books

on people while others focus on you know

mr. Trudeau seems to be focusing eyes

runny or Mr Shearer I've been focusing

on people and I think that's what people

are looking at as that's what campaign

should be about it should be about what

people are going through and and how we

can make their lives better and I think

that's that's something I'm really proud

of and I think that's something that

campaign should she continue to do

there's a lot of talk today about

exactly and voting his name a lot

especially when you're trying to appeal

to Quebec voters and across the country

does this mean like you don't feel that

you're resonating enough as a leader

that you're having to draw on Japanese

name no I think it's I think it's always

important to remember the roots and

honor those roots and I think Jack did

something really amazing and I'm proud

of that and I'm proud to be able to

continue his legacy and I don't think

that it's in any way I got won't take it

personally I think it's important to

acknowledge that he did some amazing

things

though always he did some things better

than he and I think that's that's good I

think it's important a knowledge that he

had a long time to build up an

incredible movement in Quebec and I

think that's beautiful and I want to

build on that ladies know you both get a

fight for the people and let them know

that we're fighting for that I don't

know that they can count on us and I'm

confident that the progresses of Quebec

will see in us they're champions they'll

see in us the folks that they get what

they're going through and that have real

I just want to kind of come back to what

I was asking you to see if there's

anything more specific if you give it

your twin and become Prime Minister or

if you were in a coalition or minority

what would be the first thing like is

there something specific I know you said

climate but is there something specific

that you would say this would be the

first thing I'd push about well be we've

got a whole plan for Quebec and it's

hard to find one like that plan B so did

the valleys of Atomos have Quebec from

seeking the people on the ground is the

environment so some of the key steps we

take when it comes to the environment

generally is to end fossil fuel

subsidies and invest that into clean

energy that's one massive step we would

also specifically assure Quebec that

there would be no pipelines impose on

Kovac I think those are as a specific

commitment to Quebec and a general

commitment but helps up Quebec and

Canada and the world to end possible

subsidies those are two really concrete

things that we would do that speak

directly to a concern that I hear and I

think defending the language and the

culture is something that's really

important to me personally I feel that

learning French has given me a richness

in my life that is giving me a beautiful

gift and I want to make sure that that

that language is strong in Quebec and

across Canada so changes to the to the

law a law on official languages and to

increase funding to help the new

arrivals or new immigrants to count to

Quebec with French courses are some of

the specific things to protect and to

make sure that there's a equal playing

field when it comes to taxiing web

Giants or always to protect the culture

of Canada also but specific

right yes

you
