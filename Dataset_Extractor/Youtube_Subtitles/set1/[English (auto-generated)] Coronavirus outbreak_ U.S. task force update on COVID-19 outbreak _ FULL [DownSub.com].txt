good afternoon we just completed today's

meeting of the white house coronavirus

task force and I couldn't be more proud

of the efforts of the men and women

standing behind me

or all of those standing behind them

President Trump said from early on that

this would be a whole-of-government

approach and today gives evidence of the

fact that it is also a whole of America

approach we're bringing the full

resources to the federal government and

the full resources of of this great

economy and our great business sector to

bear in protecting the American people

and protecting American families a few

updates from today as we continue to

expand testing availability across the

country testing is now available at all

state labs by the end of this week there

will be more than 4 million more tests

made available in jurisdictions around

the country 1 million are already in

place thanks to the good work of our top

commercial labs that the President Trump

brought together yesterday

LabCorp and quest are in the process now

of distributing and marketing

coronavirus tests all across America and

we're working with state and local

officials to ensure that that happens as

rapidly as possible but as the testing

is expanding we want to make sure the

American people knew that testing was

available to them and that cost would

not be a barrier today President Trump

assembled the top health insurance

executives in America and as we

announced earlier today all of our major

health insurance companies have now

joined with Medicare and Medicaid and

agreed to waive all co-pays cover the

cost of all treatment for those who

contract the coronavirus they've

committed to no surprise billing and

they've committed to encourage

telemedicine

it was a year ago that Medicaid actually

expanded to pay for telemedicine

Medicare pays for telemedicine so now

for seniors who may think that they are

either at risk or have contracted the

disease they can get medical advice

without having to go to the doctor or go

to an emergency room I know I speak for

President Trump when I say how grateful

we are to see our health insurance

industry step forward to meet this need

so that that no American should be

concerned about about being able to pay

for or for the cost of a coronavirus

test if they deem and their doctor deems

it to be appropriate and necessary

president also went to Capitol Hill

today to meet with members of the United

States Senate Republican caucus there he

talked about an economic package

including a call he's calling for

payroll tax relief and I think most

important to the president's heart we

want to make sure that hourly workers

hard-working blue-collar Americans that

may not have paid family leave today

that small and medium-sized businesses

in America would be afforded the

resources to provide paid leave so that

no one would feel that they have to go

to work if they might be infected or if

they might have been exposed to the

coronavirus we get a good reception on

Capitol Hill our legislative teams have

fanned out we're gonna be working with

Republican and Democrat leadership to

move an economic package Larry Kudlow

will be reflecting on that in just a few

moments we also talked about what are

known as n95 masks and we're working

senator Deb Fischer and others have

important legislation that would extend

temporary liability protections so that

masks that are made for industrial use

could be sold to hospitals to ensure

that our health care workers are

properly protected and outfitted and

we're grateful for growing bipartisan

support for that measure and we're going

to be working earnestly with Republicans

and Democrats to move a reform that

would

make more n95 masks available I'm also

pleased to report that we did receive

this afternoon a comprehensive proposal

from the cruise line industry proposal

that includes advanced screening

improving medical services on ships

providing for airlift evacuation and

land-based care at the expense of the

cruise lines for anyone that might be

not only infected with the corona virus

but with any serious illness we'll be

reviewing that in the next 24 hours the

president's objective is for us to make

a Cruise Lines safer even as we work

with the cruise lines to ensure that

that no one in our particularly

vulnerable population is is is going out

on a cruise in the near future I'm gonna

recognize doctor foul Qi to talk about

where we are and dr. Burks will give us

some research that she's done on the

scope will have other updates but let me

say once again this is a

whole-of-government approach and from

early on President Trump has insisted

that our that our government at the

federal level all of our partners at the

state level work in concert to protect

the American people and as we stand here

today the risk to the average American

of contracting the corona virus remains

low but we're absolutely determined to

give every American the tools and the

information that they need to protect

themselves their families their their

workplace their schools and and we're

going to work together we're going to

work together to see our way through

this and and working with leaders in

both parties in Congress working with

with leaders at the state level all

across this nation I'm confident we will

with that dr. Tony Fauci for update on

the status thank you very much mr. vice

president just to give you a very brief

sketch of what we do every day the cases

continue to increase globally we

potentially paying particular attention

to the cases in Europe and Italy in

France and we

starting to see that up at the same time

as the relative number of new cases come

down from China what we're seeing in

Europe is that Europe is in that up

slope so that's something that is

expected that's the way these kinds of

outbreaks go this is not a surprise to

anybody if you look at the history of

infectious diseases outbreaks in the

United States we continue to have new

cases as of this morning there were 712

I believe with 27 deaths guaranteed by

the time of this evening that's going to

be up and there'll be several war and

tomorrow there'll be several more so we

realized that this is something

obviously that we've been saying all

along that we're taking very seriously

now the question is what are we going to

do about that and there are a number of

things that one can do in order to blunt

it if you look at the curves of

outbreaks you know they go big Peaks and

they come down what we need to do is

flatten that down that would have less

people infected that would ultimately

have less deaths you do that by trying

interfere with the natural flow of the

outbreak so what we're saying today is

that although we keep coming in and

saying appropriately that as a nation

the risk is relatively low there are

parts of the country right now that are

having communities spread in which the

risk there is clearly a bit more than

that and you know the places you know

Washington state California New York and

Florida but what I want to talk to you

about today just for a moment or two is

that we would like the country to

realize that as a nation we can't be

doing the kinds of things we were doing

a few months ago that it doesn't matter

if you're in a state that has no cases

or one case you have to start taking

seriously what you can do now that if

and when the infections will come and

they will come sorry to say sad to say

they will but when you're dealing with

an infectious disease you know we always

have that metaphor that people talk

about that Wayne Gretzky you know he

doesn't go where the puck is he's going

where the puck is going to be well we

want to be where the infection is going

to be as well as where it is

so what we have here if you could see

that here what it's here is that if you

go to coronavirus gov remember when dr.

Burke's yesterday mentioned some of the

things that we put together these are

really simple

keeping the workplace safe keeping the

home safe keeping the schools safe and

keeping commercial establishing safe

this should be universal for the country

everyone should be doing that whether

you live in a zone that has community

spread or not when you have community

spread you obviously gonna ratchet up

the kinds of mitigations that you have

but at a minimum this is the minimum

that we should be doing so everybody

should say all hands on deck this is

what we need to do so I'll stop there

and later I'll be happy to answer

questions Thank You mr. president and

thank you dr. Falchi for that clarity we

continue to monitor the situation across

the country and across the globe and we

are very fortunate between dr. Falchi

and I we have long term contacts out

there and many of these countries that

are experiencing current outbreaks we

continue to review all the scientific

literature to look for insights and to

really determine who's at the greatest

risk and that's why we've talked to you

about people with immunodeficiencies at

any age people with medical conditions

and the elderly and how important it is

for all of us that take these

precautions in the household to protect

others because we have circulating flu

and other respiratory diseases at this

time we all have to act like all of

those diseases any respiratory disease

can be transmitted to others and as we

said yesterday we're hoping that

decreases all the respiratory disease

were experiencing finally we got more

new reports out of China who had nine

pregnant women I'm during an acute kovat

infection and all nine were infected

both and they delivered while they were

infected and all nine babies were

healthy and the mothers were healthy so

we continue to look for data like that

to be reassuring to the American public

at the same time ensuring that every

single person is participating in this

response to this virus and taking those

precautions that we should be taking

every day

we start doing this today we will be

ready next year for any of our

respiratory diseases because I think

we'll be able to show that these simple

simple household simple works simple

school simple business approaches across

the country can change all of our

respiratory diseases so we thank you for

getting the message out we thank you for

the participating and ensuring in your

households and in households around

America that we're protecting all of

those who need our support right now

thank you dr. Burks and dr. Falchi and

this information is available at

coronavirus gov and as we said we can't

say often enough the risks of

contracting to coronavirus to the

average American remains low but for

senior citizens with serious underlying

chronic health conditions the potential

for serious consequences is very real

and make no mistake about it by

practicing these habits in your home

your school and your business you're not

only protecting your health but you're

also protecting those that are most

vulnerable with that for an update on

our the progress the President Trump

made today with our health insurance

companies I'd like to recognize CSC Emma

Verma the vice president said we had a

terrific meeting with the insurance

companies a real example of a

public-private partnership where they

agreed to waive co-pays for testing not

do any surprise billing and also cover

the costs of the Cova virus associated

costs and the other things that they did

is they asked the president for more

flexibility in Medicare Advantage plans

and the president agreed to do that and

so today we issued guidance to our

Medicare Advantage plans that not only

can they waive the costs for the tests

but they can also go further to removing

prior off those authorization

requirements they can waive prescription

refill limits they can allow for mail

delivery of prescription drugs and

expand more access to telehealth

services if they weren't offering that

in their plan also at CMS we continue to

work with health care providers around

infection control practices we

with home health agencies and also

hospitals and today we issued guidance

to dialysis facilities as well as home

health agencies around infection control

it's been a great deal of attention

about the Grand Princess and HHS working

with the Coast Guard with the Department

of Defense is currently working through

a disembarking American passengers

returning foreign nationals to their

country and I wanted to ask the

secretary SAR to speak and update us on

the progress so with regard to the Grand

Princess I wanted to first express our

appreciation to governor Newsom to the

mayor of Oakland the people of Oakland

the longshoremen the stevedores who've

helped with bring it in and clearing the

clearing the dock area so that we can do

all of our operations there we've got

Admiral Abel here with us today who's

been leading the Coast Guard efforts and

then Deputy Secretary vegan from state

has done incredible work with our

foreign partners to help with the

repatriation of their nationals who are

onboard the ship as of our data that

I've got is as of noon pacific time

today so this will have increased quite

substantially since since my last update

but as of noon pacific we had 548

individuals who have been offloaded from

the ship 228 Canadians are already back

in Canada flown there I believe was

overnight 171 Californians were taken by

the government of California and are now

at Travis Travis Air Base 26 individuals

were sick and they're being they're

being treated for various it could be

from the novel coronavirus it could also

just be we had some frail individuals

who are sick that needed treatment our

goal is to get all of the citizens of

California off today to be in the care

of the key of the California state

government as well as to get the UK

citizens off today so that they could be

repatriated to the United Kingdom we

continue to work with other countries on

all of those maneuvers we will have non

California residents who will be in

transport to the bases at Dobbins and at

Lackland today we hope it or

night so everything is pressing it seems

to be progressing well we're using the

highest isolation quarantine procedures

medical screenings possible to ensure

the safety of not just the passengers

but also of the the local communities

and all of the health care workers and

others emergency responders are helping

so thanks to all of our partners for

this their help with this very complex

operation and let me echo the

Secretary's appreciation to governor

Gavin Newsom the state of California the

City of Oakland it has literally been a

seamless partnership everyone on that

ship will be tested isolated in

quarantined as appropriate and provided

with treatment the crew on the ship

other than those who were ill will be

quarantined on the ship offshore but it

really represented the kind of

partnership in cooperation from every

level of government that that every

American I know is grateful to see with

that on the economic front alert cuddle

oh thank you sir hi yesterday in a

meeting in the Oval the president

acknowledging there going to be

challenges on the health and economic

side he mentioned that he intended to

bring the full power of the federal

government to deal with these challenges

and accordingly as vice president said

up at the Republican Senate luncheon

today and he mentioned it in this room

yesterday President Trump has unveiled

his proposals strong proposals for a

temporary payroll tax cut holiday which

I think he would prefer to last through

the end of the year also

administratively as Treasury secretary

minutiae and others have suggested we

are trying to we will use assistance to

unpaid sick leave people very important

point also small and medium businesses

another important point and also

possibly to some distressed industries

or sectors

in the economy maybe tax deferral might

be a useful tool and other means so this

is strong cross the board package we are

consulting with leaders in the House and

the Senate with respect to this package

and particularly the payroll tax holiday

let me just say coming into this

difficult period the economy isn't

fundamentally good shape we saw

blockbuster jobs report last Friday

today for example the small business

confidence index the NFIB business

confidence index registered a very

strong number keeping it's near record

high the unemployment remains low at

three and a half percent other

indicators look pretty good we had a lot

of momentum in the first quarter

good thing I recognized the challenges

and that is why we are proposing these

fiscal measures to combine with monetary

measures that have already taken and

again I'll repeat the president's words

it just struck me as his determination

he intends to bring the full power of

the federal government to deal with

these health and economic challenges and

in a word from Surgeon General Jerome

Adams good evening everyone

as Surgeon General whether it's opioids

or cigarettes or the corona virus my job

is to help the American people

understand how to live a healthy life

and I'm asking all of you I'm imploring

all of you to help share my prescription

for America to overcome this coronavirus

situation that we're in there are three

parts to it number one know your risk as

you've heard many times but it's still

important to impress upon America and if

you are immunocompromised if you have

chronic medical conditions if you are

over the age of 60 you are at higher

risk if you are a child or a young adult

you are less likely to be impacted by

the corona virus number two the second

part of the prescription know your

circumstances are you in an environment

where you can telework are you planning

on going to large gatherings like church

do you live in a community that is being

particularly impacted by the coronavirus

and you can find out this information

from your state or a local health

department does your state have a

hotline that you can call in to to help

you assess symptoms again knowing your

circumstances then number three and this

is the most important part know what you

can do to stay safe and we have really

leaned into coronavirus gov I please

send people to that website we've put

the tools on there for individual groups

specific audiences so that people can

understand how to say sticks stay safe

if we follow this prescription we will

we will overcome the corona virus as dr.

Falchi said and we will see more cases

unfortunately we are likely to see more

deaths we have not hit the peak of this

epidemic quite yet but if we follow this

prescription then we will decrease the

number of people who were impacted we

will decrease the number of people who

will died and we will more quickly get

to the end of this situation thank you

great job so will Pence Trump campaign

suspend campaign rallies and other

activities I think that'll be a decision

that's made literally on a day to day

basis I thought dr. foutch you spoke to

that yesterday very well that we're

gonna I'm very confident that the

campaign will we'll take the very best

information and make the very best

decision going forward but these

proposals are are things that every

American can do all across the country

that that will reduce the risk of either

contracting or being exposed to the

corona virus

the word unveiled was just used but so

far the public has not seen it how big

is this package how big is the payroll

tax cut gonna be when is the general

public gonna see what you all put

together right learn we were working out

details right now so I don't want to

quote any numbers ahead of time you know

you make a proposal we're checking with

the leaders of both parties in both

houses and see what is doable and where

the you know tough nuts are gonna be so

I don't want to get into any detail

I think the outline of the thing is very

important the payroll tax holiday is

probably the most important powerful

piece of this but on the other hand I

want to draw attention we can use

administration and executive authority

again to help unpaid sick leave people

which is very important we can use it

for the medium and smaller businesses

which is very important other distress

sectors we have some leverage on tax

deferral if we know I mean look I will

say again as I have for quite some time

the economy is strong we also know there

gonna be problems ahead we know they're

gonna be challenges that don't deny it

we'll see I want to take that a day at a

time and a fact at a time a statistical

release at a time but anyway this will

be the broad package and at some point

in the in the near future we will

outline a more detailed package for you

the president proposed to the GOP policy

once today to

remove the entire payroll tax from both

employers and employees that would be a

twelve point four percent reduction back

in 2010 we had a two percent reduction

can you basically eliminate four however

number of months the payroll tax without

blowing a huge hole in the budget in

furthermore the president told the

Munchie he'd like to make that kind of

permanent how do you do that

you know the payroll tax holiday is a

bold move it's a very bold move and this

has always been a bold president and

we've been cutting taxes and rolling

back regulations and changing trade

deals and opening up the energy sector

and doing things that nobody thought we

could do before John we've had pretty

good economic results for it we're in a

challenge period now I get that so with

respect to your question on the

specifics I think there'll be a big a

big growth payoff I think it'll help

deal with whatever challenges occur in

the next few months I think beyond that

ameliorating the tax burden on the

middle class the so-called blue-collar

boom that I talked quite a bit about

that's what this is aim for that's

really what the payroll tax is

principally about by lifting the burdens

of those middle-class folks I think

we're gonna get a big growth kicker

we've had a terrific ly strong labor

market as you know it may stall a bit or

not I'm just speculating on the on the

challenges of the unhealth side but I

think over time we'll make it up with

much better economic growth and I will

remind also that later on way down the

road probably later this summer early

fall we will unveil another package of

tax cut and tax reform proposals but

yeah it's a bold proposal and this is a

bold president and I think it's paid off

in general revenue to make up for I mean

the fiscal year 21 Social Security

unemployment insurance and Medicare Part

A revenues are 1.2 3 trillion dollars I

just say we're not talking about

Medicare at this point I'm gonna by the

way the answer is yes you can backfill

it and that has been done before because

we've had other payroll tax cuts and you

mentioned one of them in 2010 or 2011 so

the answer that is yes and the answer is

we will always maintain a solvent Social

Security system but you know tax reform

is very important economic growth is

very important incentives for middle and

lower income workers are very important

that I will just add you know in terms

of the boldness of this president's

policies despite what some of our

critics think actually it's the middle

and lower middle people that have done

the best in wage growth terms and I

think this is absolutely consistent this

lips' tax burdens on the middle class I

think it's absolutely consistent with

his earlier policies let me also say

John if I can that the other piece of

this is is what the doctors have said to

us what the experts have said is if

you're sick if you have reason to

suspect that you may have coronavirus we

want you to stay home

and the president's absolutely adamant

working with the Congress or using his

executive authority to ensure that that

hourly workers people working for small

or medium-sized businesses that don't

currently have paid family leave what

will be able to stay home and be

confident that they're not losing a

paycheck I think every American can

identify with that concern and and we

we're going to work forward whether we

do it legislatively or the president has

some some some resources in his

executive authority to act we're gonna

work to make sure that that hourly

workers don't feel like you have to go

to work sick because you're risking a

paycheck get home stay home take those

couple of weeks to get better

Thank You mr. vice president I want to

drill down on something that Larry just

said though because in 2018 according to

the Center for Budget Budget and Policy

Priorities federal payroll taxes

generated 1.1 seven trillion dollars

it's an enormous figure Larry you're

suggesting that you can make that up

from general revenue where are you going

to get a trillion dollars from you know

let us put the proposal out in concrete

details and flush that out and we'll

have much better answers right now I

want to stay in my lane and I think the

health story the coronavirus story is is

very very important here we will do the

best we can a man to give you specific

plans and details once we flush them out

increased testing capacity where do I

still state reports of severe rationing

in many cases because of the limited

supply it appears to be close to

impossible for average Americans to get

tests without being hospitalized first

so when can the American people expect

to see these test kits available at

doctors offices and Urgent Care admitted

clinics that sort of thing specifically

when well I'm gonna have the secretary

step forward and address that but let me

say we've made great progress over the

last week a million tests are in the

field every state lab in America can do

coronavirus tests if you if you're

concerned that you have corona virus

your doctor can contact the state lab

can have a test processed by the end of

this week another four million tests

will be distributed but to your very

important question we're working day by

day with the largest commercial labs in

America we had we had some good

discussions today with outside experts

as well who said that when the president

brought the commercial labs in he did

exactly the right thing because it's

those big companies that have logistics

infrastructure all over the country have

labs all over the country that can

distribute the test process the test

whether it's quest or whether it's lab

for and we believe that in the days and

weeks ahead we're going to continue to

see the availability of tests

dramatically rise and we're driving

toward that every day mr. secretary do

you want

maybe dr. Redfield can add in oh also um

so by the end of this weekend we had 1.1

million tests that were actually shipped

we have another 1 million that are

either in transit or waiting for orders

so we actually have a surplus capacity

already of tests that have been produced

and as the vice-president said by the

end of this week be another 4 million

tests so the tests are out there the

tests are in every public health lab in

the country they're in hospitals they're

in labs but I think there's a false

premise in your question which is the

notion that just because I as a person

say oh I'd like to be tested for the

novel coronavirus I should be going to a

minute clinic or some other facility and

just walking and saying give me my test

please that's not how diagnostic testing

works in the United States were frankly

almost anywhere in the world always if

their doctor we've always be clear if

their doctor or public health physician

believes they should be tested it needs

to always be clinically indicated to

receive a test so it's a false premise

go to your doctor if you first actually

don't go to your doctor call your

doctor's office if you believe you may

have the novel coronavirus call the

clinic call the hospital call the

doctor's office so that you don't just

walk right in follow their infection

control procedures for doing that and

then they will decide working with you

whether a test is appropriate to be done

but there are millions of tests out

there now and it's good as the vice

president said with quest and LabCorp

getting it at the doctor's office

swabbing that their distribution and

transport system it's going to be an

even better closer to the patient

experience as I promised I talked to you

on Saturday when we met together that's

very good and answer you I'm gonna ask

dr. Burks to speak to this too because

she's just done a tremendous job

bringing our commercial labs to bear on

this but to your other point the

president directed us to essentially

change that the criteria that CDC was

giving labs around the country we heard

from governors around the country that

people that were only mildly symptomatic

were being told that they couldn't be

tested we changed that we changed that

description and so as the president said

anyone who on a doctor's order wants to

be tested can at a doctor's indication

be tested now we're working to fill that

need and if we're making great progress

every single day but I wanted dr. Burks

to speak to it as well yeah I just

wanted to talk to you briefly about what

happened in decreasing barriers I've

I've been a lab person I've been a

vaccine developer I've been a doctor

I've been all those things but I've

never in my lifetime of government

service have worked with the CDC in a

way that every time the state or local

government calls and says I have this

barrier I need a modification to the

regulations that has happened almost

daily and the reason we have commercial

labs willing to step in immediately is

because the FDA has created that ability

and posted on their website I don't know

if you've been there this unbelievable

waiver system and the clear definitions

there every single hospital every single

University can utilize this testing

algorithm and that's highly unusual but

it's also it's bringing this super large

high throughput companies to the to the

table and I just wanna this has been

unique for me to be able to see this

unbelievable dialogue between what

states need what local governments need

and federal government being responsive

with changing those regulations and that

has been really wonderful to watch why

has it not extended those bands to South

Korea or Japan or Italy and is it still

under consideration or has the

administration really shifted to

mitigation from containment well I'm

gonna let I'm gonna let dr. Burke speak

to that in a moment but there is no

question as dr. Fauci said just a few

days ago we would be in a very different

place if President Trump had not

suspended all travel from China and

we've been also I suspect be in a very

different place if we hadn't issued

travel advisories for portions of Italy

portions of South Korea and initiated

screening of all passengers on all

direct flights into the United States

from both of those countries I will tell

you we had a very we had a very thorough

discussion today the prospect of

recommending to the president additional

travel advisories what we're doing

particularly as dr. Fauci said is we're

following the facts and and we're going

to bring those recommendations forward

in the time and manner that we as the

White House coronavirus task force

determined are appropriate but let me

tell you it it's literally a day-to-day

consideration and we're going to

continue to put the health and safety of

America first dr. Burks did you want to

amplify that

Thank You Foster who used to be a part

of this administration I have an op-ed

where he basically said that the US has

two days before hospitals could be

overrun he recommended that schools be

shut down for it maybe what does the

administration think about that the

degrees that the US could be at the

point where there could be a turning

point in the next ten days or so and

what about well let me say the

recommendations that you have and that

every American now has at coronavirus

Goong apply to every jurisdiction in the

country every state in every community

irrespective of whether or not there's

been a corona virus case established I

will tell you that we're working very

closely with California Washington New

York Florida to develop community

specific recommendations for those areas

where we have had what is known as

community spread a number of coronavirus

cases that appear that it's being

transmitted in the community in the next

24 hours working with those states we'll

be publishing CDC's recommendations for

what ought to be done but I want to turn

it over to dr. foutch you to tell you

that we really think the most important

thing here is that we continue to bring

the facts forward to the American people

and that in that our proposals and our

recommendations well well all of these

apply to everybody in the United States

and it'll help reduce the infection rate

of the corona virus that for those

communities that are being impacted

we're going to develop specific

recommendations that'll make the most

sense for them dr. pouchy

there is it can you wait until there's

community spread to make some of these

imagine well it depends on the degree of

community spread I mean community spread

could be just a small amount you can

start to see multiple generations but

getting to your individual individual

question that everything is on the table

for consideration so the idea that we're

not closing oh I mean I think for the

country right now to say we're gonna

close all the schools in the country I

don't think would be appropriate with

school closures the appropriate

depending upon not whether you have

already the horses out of the bomb but

when you start to see we're getting a

little bit dangerous so let's do it

so it's incorrect to say now everything

has happened bad let's close the school

and it's incorrect to say let's just

blanket closed the schools in the entire

country tonight I don't think that that

would be appropriate but I do think it

would be appropriate to carefully try

and do things like closing but there's

other things besides closing to do real

mitigation sometime before you think you

really need it that gets back to what I

said a few moments ago about where the

puck is going to be but you want to make

sure you're not so far ahead that you

overshoot a few moments ago on this sign

up here it says you should stop and

shaking if you're at your workplace and

you're in your school or in commercial

establishments should the president set

that example I notice you've been opting

for the elbow bump well look as the

president has said in our line of work

you shake hands when someone wants to

shake your hand and I expect the

president will continue to do that I'll

continue to do it what what this is is a

broad recommendation for Americans but a

really good recommendation is to wash

your hands often and and that all the

experts tell me that while while people

want to want to get the various

sanitizing lotions washing your hands

with hot soap and water

20 seconds it's just as good as any

lotion you can buy to coordinate a

response with all their countries

I'm sorry sagen you seen a plan to

coordinate a response with other

countries either continent president

Trump met president from Brazil or

Sanada this weekend did they talk about

coronavirus I know that they spoke about

a broad range of issues and I'm

confident the coronavirus so was

discussed what I what I can tell you is

that our focus is on the health and

well-being of the American people we're

going to continue to communicate with

nations across this Hemisphere and

across the country but what the

president's given us as a mission of the

White House coronavirus task force is to

see to the health and well-being in the

American people and will continue to

make recommendations to do just that how

about one more take questions one on

Washington State they made a request of

the strategic stockpile for face of

233,000 assets and they received half of

that wondering

and if that report is inaccurate that

please speak to it and secondly on

cruise lines are you looking at a

bailout from Cruise Lines at several of

these companies or taxable percent so so

they got half of the shipment from the

strategic national stockpile initially

and then when the Vice President

actually went out to the state of

Washington that's when the second half

of the shipment arrived but I have

spoken directly with Governor Inslee

with whom we've had a superb working

relationship and he has informed me that

there are some additional personal

protective equipment needs that a couple

of their hospitals have and we're

working through the strategic strategic

national stockpile to make sure we are

directing and fulfilling shipments to

them as needed I want to echo again our

gratitude to governor Inslee and and all

the health officials in the state of

Washington I was there last week our

teams are working very closely together

we'll follow up on that public report

but the Secretary's indicated but look

we're in as I said in the next 24 hours

we will be working with not only

Washington State of California with New

York with Florida and in unveiling our

recommendations CDC's recommendations to

those areas that have been impacted by

community spread and then will continue

and to come alongside those communities

to do everything in our power to

mitigate the spread let me just say

again as a resource thank you all we'll

be back here again tomorrow coronavirus

gov practical information for every

American details for state labs that may

yet have questions about performing

their own tests we have specifics

enzymes agents ingredients that that

where they can be acquired and how for

the performance of coronavirus tests but

for every American I just want to say

again remember that well the risk to the

average American of contracting the

corona virus remains low but however the

the risk to senior citizens the serious

underlying chronic health conditions is

very significant and it's important for

all of us to continue to take all the

steps necessary to look after the most

vulnerable to look after our health

and I'm confident that we'll get through

this together
