[Music]

just let our friends come in good

morning everyone it's great to be back

in Whitby and thank you for coming out

I'm happy to be joined today by Ryan

turbo as we talk about our liberal plan

to keep moving on Canada forward for

families for Ontarians and for everyone

we're here today at baby shack with

local families talking about the joy and

expense of raising kids as a dad of

three myself including a 12 year old who

had his birthday today I know that for

all the fun and wonderful parts of

parenting it's a huge financial

commitment that's why our liberal team

has been focused on helping parents from

day one when we formed government in

2015 the very first thing we did was cut

taxes for the middle class and raise

them on the wealthiest one percent and

shortly after that we introduced a can

of the Child Benefit because we knew

that families here in Ontario and right

across the country needed the extra help

you see the old Harper government was

sending Child Benefit checks to

millionaires we didn't think that was

right because liberals believe in

helping the people who actually need it

so we scrapped Harper's boutique cat

tracks credits and brought in the more

generous tax free Canada Child Benefit

and over the past few years the CCB has

made a real difference for hardworking

Canadian parents I've heard from parents

right across the country who used their

CCP money for things like new shoes

field trips and skating lessons the CCB

gives parents the breathing new room

they need and deserve and that's why we

indexed it to inflation two years ahead

of schedule but we're going to do even

more because we believe in investing in

families a reelected Liberal government

will increase the Canada

child benefit by 15% for kids under one

that'll mean up to a thousand dollars

more in your pocket on top of the

regular CCB amount we're doing this

because we realize that crucial first

year comes with some big expenses things

like cribs strollers and car seats many

things you can purchase right here at

the baby shaft we think new parents

should focus their time and what little

energy they have left after 2:00 a.m.

feedings on their new baby not on trying

to scrape by on top of increasing the

CCB will also make maternity and

parental benefits tax-free diaper

diapers formulas new clothes for a

little one that grows ways too fast

these things cost a lot but by

increasing the canada child benefit for

kids under one and making maternity and

paternity benefits tax-free up front a

reelected liberal government will give

families the help they need when they

need it most in just a few days

Canadians will head to the polls and

Andrew Shearer wants people to think

this election is about me but this

election is not about me it's about you

it's about Canadians and between now and

Monday here's what people in Ontario

have to ask themselves are you ready for

even more harmful conservative cuts cuts

that are four times larger than Doug

Ford's Andrew Shearer privada Cooper of

Shakuni he could do for the coup de

nieve an allocation Canadian to have in

order to slash fifty three billion

dollars in spending

Andrew shears conservatives will have to

make massive cuts to the programs and

services that you rely on Ontario

families can't afford any more

conservative cuts you need a government

that will invest in you and give you the

support you need to succeed if you want

to build a better future for our kids

and grandkids and I mean really build a

better future

voting conservative won't get us there

the Liberal Party is the only party that

can form government and has a plan to

fight climate change we can't afford to

let conservatives take us back a vote

for the Liberals is a vote to move

forward

really mahalo lady who's about that

let's say real control this arm I feel a

little cold if some automatic is it an

MST son Kanoa community in office our

conference

Oh Canadian convoy yeah really not

really behind but to true

fairly intelligent alchemy they are some

effective Wafaa come Ryan Turnbull

Ottawa / continuing the fair haven't

seen at V Perry with CBC News Andrew

Shearer says that you're gonna tax

people's homes

you're gonna legalize hard drugs he now

says that a NDP liberal coalition would

raise the GST do you have any plans to

raise the GST and what do you think

about these claims or mister share both

claims are entirely untrue it is

unfortunate that the Conservatives to

keep having to make up attacks against

us

but all they're offering is cuts cuts

four times greater than Doug Ford's so

perhaps that's all they can do is make

things up we are focused on making life

more affordable for Canadians on

fighting climate change and on getting

guns off our streets these akashi these

attack the he's attacked Andrew here so

folks the poverty ifalcon devil t v--

shows Bastille know Vienna of three o

Canadian so the Cooper you not claw

Plock Bahama it pleased about that

belief any political disarm a climactic

Eva on Vinny's armature the noise and

Russia R has said repeatedly he has no

intention of reopening the abortion

debate and yet your party keeps raising

questions about his commitment to a

woman's right to choose how is that any

different than what Andrew shares doing

to you Mr Shearer has not said that he

would stand up for access to

reproductive services in New Brunswick

where a conservative premier is watching

the only private clinic to provide

reproductive services to women close

down because they don't get provincial

funding we need a federal government

that will unequivocally stand up and

defend women's rights not passively

accept what the law is even though they

don't personally agree with it we need a

government that will fight for women's

rights and that's exactly what we will

do you know in New Brunswick and

anywhere else access to reproductive

rights and services are limited by

conservative governments good morning

mr. Trudeau Joyce Napier CTV many things

happened during a campaign but two in

particular the rise of the block a

Bitcoin Quebec

and the rise in the polls of jugman

Singh in the rest of the country were

you expecting that we know that you

can't take any votes for granted in an

election and Canadians have an important

choice to make about the kind of future

they want for the kids but the kind of

government they want to have come

Tuesday morning and that's why we've

made very clear when our focus is what

our focus has been for the past four

years investing in families making sure

the families have more help with the

high costs raising their kids with

things like the Canada Child Benefit

that helps those families that need it

and doesn't help the families of

millionaires we're focused on fighting

climate change with the most ambitious

plan the Canada has ever had to fight

climate change we're focused on

strengthening gun control and getting

guns like assault weapons and handguns

off our streets the Conservatives are

focused on proposing cuts on weakening

gun control and on stopping the fight

against climate change the choice is

clear do we move forward on making life

more affordable for families on fighting

climate change on getting guns off our

streets or do we go with conservative

cuts what do you think this rise of

these two parties happened during this

campaign I think in a campaign Canadians

look at all sorts of different paths for

work look at different ways of making

the choice about where their government

is headed and we see that it boils down

with days to go before the election

between a choice between conservative

cuts and a liberal government that will

continue to make life more affordable

for Canadians fight climate change and

get guns off our streets

trio you repeated a few times in French

over the last few days that can

could wake up on Tuesday morning with a

Conservative government with Andrew

Shearer as Prime Minister you're now

running English radio ads with that

sentence I'd like to know if that does

happen is it your fault

I think Canadians have a choice to make

Canadians I'm confident we'll make the

right choice a choice between

conservative cuts or continuing to move

forward on making life more affordable

on fighting climate change on getting

guns off the streets

I'm not taking any vote for granted and

I know Canadians are reflecting on the

kind of future they want for their kids

for their grandkids I'm confident that

we're gonna make the right choice and

move forward that sentence more in

French and in radio ads and not at the

podium like right now I'm happy to to

repeat what Mr Shearer is saying in that

there is a chance that there could be a

Conservative government and that would

mean cuts it will mean fifty three

billion dollars in cuts four times

bigger cuts then even Doug Ford is doing

in Ontario I know Ontarians don't want

that I know Canadians across the country

don't want that the choice we are facing

on Monday is do we continue to move

forward and making life more affordable

in fighting climate change and getting

guns off our streets or do we accept a

Conservative government with cuts as its

main agenda abaco Beaman Global News a

Global News investigation this morning

showed that in the cases of some people

wanted for deportation if they have a

detection for long enough the CBSA will

simply cancel their arrest warrant

should that practice continue

unfortunately over ten years of

Conservative government there were

massive cuts to the Canada Border

Services Agency which was extremely

unfortunate but it is what happens when

a Conservative government chooses cuts

to services instead of moving forward on

investing in communities investing in

community safety investing in Canadians

we of course take the responsibility of

protecting the integrity of our borders

and our immigration system extremely

seriously which is why we've made

massive investments and we will continue

to support the important work that the

CBSA and our immigration officials do

every single day the practice of

cancelling those arrest warrants

continue we will continue to make

investments in CBSA to make sure that

they are doing their job and ensuring

the integrity and the full application

of our immigration rules and laws Canada

is one of the few countries in the world

where people are positive towards

immigration because it has created such

a strong country strong not in spite of

our differences but because of them and

the choice we have going forward is do

we see cuts to programs and services

under a Conservative government that has

done that in the past wants to do that

again or do we make my life more

affordable get guns off our streets and

fight climate change

good morning yesterday and that if you

don't get the clear answer that you're

doing so on purpose do you think the law

is discriminatory yes or no I have made

it very clear that I do not think that a

government should be telling people what

it is they should or shouldn't wear but

Quebecers themselves are taking this law

to court and defending the Charter of

Rights and Freedoms as is their right I

have said that my federal government

would not intervene at this stage but I

also have not closed the door to

intervening at a later stage because we

understand that a federal government

always needs to be there potentially to

defend rights like women's rights like

LGBT rights like minority rights like

the rights of francophones outside of

Quebec there with my preamble here Mr

Shearer gave a speech and Quebec

earlier this week directed at

francophone bloc potential voters and in

the room I went to see the only brown

people who were there and I asked

whether they supported mr. Sierra's

position on bill 21 and the gentleman

told me that he agrees with mr. Schurz

position because he thinks Canada should

be a Christian country do you think

Canada should be a Christian country I

think Canada is a country that reflects

that defending individual rights and

freedoms is the core of any strong

Society we know that defending women's

rights minority rights freedom of

expression freedom of exempt assembly

defending people's rights is key to

creating a strong pluralistic society

that's exactly what Liberal Party will

always stand for we will always defend

the Charter of Rights and Freedoms which

includes freedom of religion morning

Adrienne gobril with City News City TV

Toronto it's no coincidence that the

Friday before an election we're standing

would be this is a writing that's wide

open especially after your former MP

decided to leave your party and not run

in this election how concerned are you

about losing an important GTA rotting

like movie first of all let me thank

Selina Cesar for that again for her

extraordinary service to this community

and wish her the very best in her future

we're not taking any votes for granted

anywhere across the country which is why

I'm excited about getting out across

Ontario as I was across rural Quebec

over the past few days as I will be

across different parts of the country in

the coming days to talk to Canadians

about the really important choice we're

facing on Monday we're facing either

conservative cuts four times greater

than Doug Ford's or a government that

will continue to make life more

affordable for Canadians we'll fight

climate change

we'll get guns off our streets

strengthening gun control he said twice

this morning you're not taking taking

any votes for granted though there's

many who believe this election will be

won and lost in the GTA

do you agree there are 338 ridings right

across this country and every Canadians

vote and voice counts I look forward to

the opportunity to work right across the

country to continue to earn the trust of

Canadians with the investments we've

made over the past years that have

lifted hundreds of thousands of people

out of poverty including 300,000 kids

that have invested in the fight against

climate change to record levels

protected more of our oceans more of our

land banned single-use plastics put a

price on pollution right across the

country over the objections of the

conservative premiers who want to do

nothing

and to continue to strengthen gun

control at a time where conservatives

want to weaken it this is an important

election for every Canadian and that's

why we're sharing this message from

coast to coast to coast

good morning mr. Trudeau John cook

Durham Radio News just wondering about

Salinas's Irish events do you think that

her experience in the whitby rioting has

hurt the Liberals chance of taking this

seat yeah as I said Selina has been an

excellent representative and an

excellent MP for for quippy and I thank

her deeply for her service and I wish

for the very best in the coming coming

years I know that Ryan Turnbull is going

to make an outstanding member of

parliament for for Whitby I look forward

to working with him and our great team

right across the country to make life

more affordable to get guns off our

streets and to fight climate change and

to push back against conservative cuts

and was the experience with Miss Sarah

bans did that impact your decision to

come to the Durham Region so late in the

campaign I am happy to be back in the

Durham Region and continue to campaign

right across the country

to make sure that Canadians understand

the important choice and the positive

choice they get to make on continuing to

deliver more help to families safer

communities and a better stronger fight

against climate change

mr. Trudeau Justin Ling freelance

yesterday the Trump administration

signed an agreement with Turkey that

basically greenlit their annexation of

parts of northern Syria

do you have concerns about that

agreement you have concerns about how it

may impact our Kurdish allies and you

have concerns about how it may in fact

lead to a conflict in the northern part

of Syria we are very concerned and

strongly condemn turkeys incursion into

Syria we will continue to work with our

international allies to push for

stability de-escalation in the region to

ensure that there is not a re rise of -

we will continue to play an important

role in leading the NATO training

mission in Iraq at the same time as

Canada works alongside all our

international partners to fight

terrorism and push for stability in the

Middle East

okay new condon o Fatima le cochon de la

serie travailler avec no sorry no

Callaghan international for the simplest

ability for this is can I be said

situation the Canada pleasure on Iraq

we've shown leadership done omission

Dorota in will continue to have a lead

on a ratio pour up a Vermont a the -

over the last four years you've signaled

support for the Kurdish people and

you've even offered military aid that

military aid never showed out it sat in

a Montreal warehouse for the past

several years and exports military aid

to at least the Iraqi Kurdish people

have virtually stopped so at a certain

point is your ally share more words than

action you've not said you'd do anything

differently

you've not offered any sort of actual

tangible support so you know at a

certain point how can our allies trust

that you'll do anything more than just

express condemnation when we got elected

in 2015 we decided that Canada would not

anymore have any engagements in Syria

and we would focus our help in Iraq and

that is exactly what we've done we've

worked with multiple partners over the

past four years to offer help support

and strengthen our local allies in the

fight against - we will continue to work

with our allies with international

partners on stabilizing the region and

pushing back against - yes thank you all

very much

[Applause]
