I have just spoken with Prime Minister

Trudeau to congratulate him on winning

the most seats

it hardly sounded like a concession

speech the day after Andrew Shearer

doubled down putting Justin Trudeau on

notice we will be ready when the time

comes and his government Falls to take

the fight back to Justin Trudeau and

give Canadians the government they

deserve the party did win the popular

vote and the Conservatives did increase

their seat total in the House of Commons

but how was sheared unable to unseat a

prime minister who was facing the SNC

lavell a scandal - violations of the

ethics laws and the blackface brownface

story he dodged that question and

promptly left this is just the first

step and the work starts immediately the

work starts today we're flying back to

Ottawa with our team we're gonna be

going through what happened this

campaign we're gonna be preparing the

groundwork so that next time we're even

stronger and we're ready to replace this

Trudeau government so is it very much

everyone

but not even a quick follow-up sir

really a quick exit from the news

conference as he starts the fight of his

political life the Conservative Party

Constitution states there is an

automatic leadership review following an

election loss there will be a lot of

discussion about Andrew sheers future

and see the person to carry the

Conservatives through that's natural but

I think it's a discussion he wants to

get ahead of so after failing to

convince Canadians that he would be the

best person to lead this country Shearer

will now spend the next six months

trying to convince conservative party

members that he is still the best person

to defeat Justin Trudeau
