good morning and thank you very much for

coming to Toronto Police Headquarters

today I'd like to introduce you the

officer in charge of homicide squad

inspector Hank it's Inga who will be

updating us on the death investigation

of honey and Barry Sherman Thank You

Victor thank you everyone for being here

two years ago on December 2 the 13th

2017

Barry and honey Sherman were murdered in

their home the police investigation has

been and continues to be active and

ongoing the work of the private

investigative team hired by the family

at the outset has been completed the

Sherman family appreciates the hard work

and dedication of the police officers

working on this case they are committed

to working with us and have full

confidence that the Toronto Police

Service will solve this crime to date

investigators have obtained 38 judicial

authorizations which have resulted in

the searches of residential and

commercial properties electronic devices

and the production of 73 individual

Records 150 items have been submitted to

the center of Forensic Sciences for

testing 243 Witnesses have been

interviewed for terabytes of security

video has been obtained 205 tips have

been provided directly to the police

from the public 343 tips have been

provided so far to the police via the

private investigative team 701

investigative actions have been assigned

but we are still asking for help the

family and the police urge anyone who

has reliable information regarding the

murders no matter how small or

unimportant that information may seem to

please contact the

police through their usual channels

either anonymously through Crimestoppers

at four one six two two two tips or

directly to the homicide squad four one

six eight zero eight 7400 we have also

set up a direct email address for this

case and tips can be provided via

Sherman tips at Toronto Police dot o NCA

this email address will only be accessed

by police investigators directly

assigned to the Sherman investigation I

would encourage anyone who has provided

tips in the past to the private

investigative team to please resubmit

those tips directly to the police last

October the Sherman family established a

collaborative reward program to assist

the police in their investigation should

any tip or information lead to the

arrest and conviction of the person or

persons responsible who perpetrated the

murders the Sherman family in

consultation with the Toronto Police

Service will be responsible for the

dissemination of any reward money it is

important to note that Crimestoppers is

an anonymous reporting mechanism it is

preferable under circumstances such as

these to report any tips or information

directly to investigators the Sherman

family would also like to thank the

public and the media for their

continuing support during this difficult

time they request that their privacy be

respected accordingly they will not be

answering any questions at this time

I would like to thank the Sherman family

for their continued support and patience

during this very lengthy investigation

solving this case has always been the

priority and responsibility of the

Toronto Police Service and our thoughts

are always with the victims and their

loved one

given that this is still a very active

investigation there's little by way of

investigative details that I am willing

to discuss I will try to answer any

other relevant questions it does

absolutely caused me concern as you well

know Steve we don't operate on

speculation or theories we operate on

evidence and I've said in other

investigations and I'll say this in this

investigation if you don't hear from the

primary investigators mouth or the major

case managers mouth then you've got to

take everything with a grain of salt and

I can't imagine how disturbing it must

be for the family and and loved ones of

these victims to continually read about

speculation in the media so I understand

there's a job to be done but it does

make it very difficult for them again I

can't get into what the evidence is

telling us there there are a lot of

theories there are there is a lot of

speculation I just can't get into that

right now now that that's why do you

need those people to do some instance I

believe it was 343 tips and I want to be

sure that we have all of the tips that

were provided in the past so I want to

encourage people if you have have

submitted that information please do

resubmit it to us so that we can go

through all of that information

okay that's between the Sherman family

and and that investigative team I'm not

going to speculate on any communication

between them that's the information I've

been provided by the Sherman family this

is the issue here why we're here today I

believe that tip line is now offline and

that's why I'm providing this

alternative for people to pass their

information on to us again I don't want

to get into what's been going on between

the Sherman family and that private

investigator we're improving again III

don't want speculate on that we have

received a lot of information from them

we are still going through a lot of that

information and we'll see where it

brings us sorry say that again

it has been 2 years but that's that's

not unusual especially in an

investigation such as this we've had

we've had some high-profile

investigations in the past that have

taken I believe the Glenn Davis case was

two and a half almost three years before

that case was broken I've had murder

cases where I've made an arrest four

years after the fact and as we know we

have a cold-case squad that can make

arrests and close cases decades

afterwards I don't think this case is

going to fall into that category but it

there is a lot of material that has to

be gone through before we get to a

conclusion no no the Sherman's have been

have been terrific with us they've been

very cooperative and especially under

the circumstances that they're dealing

with I applaud them very heartily for

that I refer to the Glenn Davis case

only to put things into perspective

timeline-wise

Glen Davis case I was working homicide

when that occurred I believe it was 2007

it took a year and a half before the

information started really rolling in

and then another year after that before

arrests were made so I'm not drawing any

parallels other than timelines to that

case I think I've I've already said

there's lots of speculation and there's

lots of theories so we're still combing

through a lot of information so

[Music]

again it refers to what you're

discussing as what happened in the case

that can go in different directions

yeah I'm and you know I've talked about

it before Steve I'm very loath to call

the case a cold case or III definitely

won't say a case has ever closed even

after conviction and upon appeal cases

are always open we're always open to new

information coming in to help with those

cases and unsolved cases are still

poised actively being worked on we're

still always actively looking for more

information well that's a that's a tough

question to answer

it really is depending on what

information comes in and what evidence

comes in if we have to expand and

involve other off officers from other

units from other services that's exactly

what we do so it's a it's a changing

number literally day by day no the

family is still offering the family was

behind that 10 million dollar reward the

estates of the schurmans that reward is

still outstanding and all we're doing

now is moving the responsibility for

collecting the information back to the

Police Service where it should belong

and at the end of the day it's still the

schurmans responsibility to decide what

they want to do with that tip

and you're what would you say the most

challenging the sheer volume of

information is overwhelming and trying

to gather all of that information we

really in in a lot of murder

investigations were the gatherers of the

information and then we have to go

through it all and decipher it and see

what's information versus evidence and

there's there's just a massive volume of

information relation for relation to

this case I'm not going to comment about

that at all sorry again I'm not gonna

comment about that at all it's a it's a

very unique situation we've seen private

investigators doing some overlapping

work in cases in the past but not a

dedicated team like we've dealt with in

this case and there's been some sharing

of information but at the end of the

days the Toronto Police Service that has

to resolve this investigation and has to

present this investigation and the

evidence in court

so we'll take whatever information we

can get to further that

I don't think I'd go down that road

sorry forward investigations

having the tips come directly to us and

avoiding that any delay in receiving

that information is going to be huge for

us so I anticipate the next several

weeks we're going to be very very busy

going through a lot of information no no

our investigation is carried on just as

it should have carried on and we've made

some progress and we will continue to

carry on again that's a question for the

Sherman family can you elaborate a

little bit more on just how much of that

occurred and how much how much of a

hindrance was it is it all about certain

tips perhaps going to the privates

well we've always said that the tip

should be coming to us and there's

Benson over overlap between the tips

we've received and the tips of private

investigative team received and we'd

like those tips directly to us and avoid

those time delays and avoid that any

potential editing of the tips or

continuity of the information so I think

this will be a great help to us and I

wouldn't characterize them going to the

private investigative team as a

hindrance but this is certainly more

beneficial for our purposes we've been

getting a lot of great information from

a lot of different sources and like I

said I anticipate we're going to be

getting a lot more information but

that's what we're here to do we're here

to in take that information and work

with it and decipher it and and follow

up with that information so

paulla as you know no investigation was

perfect I'll never make that claim but I

will say that the homicide squad from

the Toronto Police Service were present

at the scene the night that the the

victims were found and I've been working

on it diligently ever since so we're in

daily communication with members of the

Sherman family and have a very good

relationship with them right now

I would call it a targeted murder yes

definitely okay thank you

thank you very much that concludes

today's conference
