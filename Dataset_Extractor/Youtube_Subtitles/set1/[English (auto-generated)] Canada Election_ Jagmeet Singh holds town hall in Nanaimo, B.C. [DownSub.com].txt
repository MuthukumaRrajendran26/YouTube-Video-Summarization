now as I normally do I've got my speech

prepared for all of you that's what the

speech looks like oh just so you can see

too

we've got I want to thank Gary very much

for coming and opening for us in the

proper way tonight it's known Abel

unceded territory and and for me of

course as the First Nations man it's

very important that we recognize the

lands that we are on and the paths that

we have in front of us for Canada is one

of a full recognition of human rights

for indigenous peoples and equality for

all peoples within this country

and once we achieve that we can be the

country we can be all that we can be and

that's the vision I have and in my heart

I believe that we have a majority of

people in this country that believe in

equality that believes that no one is

better than the other and this evening

we have a very special guest you may

have noticed today we have the champion

for the common hardworking Canadian we

have our dear leader jug meat Singh of

the NDP and so every day when I see my

leader on the TV talking about how the

government has lost its path how the

governments have forgotten the everyday

Canadian and the challenges of living

with low wages and high cost of living

my heart gets a little happier knowing

that we have such a champion fighting

for all of us at the national stage and

the NDP are going to continue to be that

voice for the hard-working Canadians

as always and the plan that we have is a

very progressive plan it outshines all

the other election commitments from all

other parties it's one that's grounded

in truth it's one that's grounded in

facts and it's one that's grounded in

ensuring that we reduce the cost of

living for all Canadians but I know that

that many of you already know me so you

know that I could probably talk for at

least another 20 minutes right ready 25

he says so without further ado I want to

introduce you to my dear friend jug meat

Singh NDP leader

thank you very much friends for being

here and the huge huge thank you to Bob

for fighting so hard for the people in

the nine m'lady Smith give it up once

more to Bob Bob Chamberlain Bob I don't

know if Willie wanted to get shout it

out but I met him outside yeah and I was

really excited he's really proud of his

sign and he's outside and I got to say

hi to him so I was really cool no I

think we're we're at capacity so people

couldn't get in so that's why you stuck

out friends friends I want to say I'm

really honored to be able to spend some

time with you and I'm looking forward to

our conversation I want to hear

questions from you and before we get

into that it's one a lay out a little

bit of the struggles that we're facing

in and a little bit of an update of what

we're trying to do and then I want to

get into questions from all of you so

you permit me I want to also acknowledge

that as Bob did acknowledging the the

traditional territories that were

gathered on for us is more than just

acknowledge them as Bob pointed out we

also have to commit to a future where we

remedy the historic injustice and the

ongoing injustice is and we do that in a

way that that looks at the first people

this land with this with dignity and

respect and equality and fairness and

those are our guiding principles we're

gonna make sure

so friends we're gonna talk about a lot

of topics and I want to focus a bit on

on some of the problems that are faced

with people right now and so what we're

seeing in in Canada is we see on one

hand the economy that's going well

economy is booming as they say but then

I meet with people and they tell me that

they're working harder than ever before

they're struggling hard and they feel

like they're not getting ahead so the

economy might be working but it's not

working for everyone right it feels more

and more like the economy is rigged and

it's rigged to help those at the very

top the wealthiest multi billionaires

and millionaires in corporations it

works for them and they keep on

benefiting but everyone else is

struggling and I think about some of the

real concrete things that are going in

going on in people's lives we see people

who cannot find housing housing is one

of the most basic things that you need

in your life and if you don't have

housing it's all you can think about and

it's not just owning a place that's out

of reach for people even renting a place

is becoming out of reach for a lot of

people I remember I was knocking on

doors in the Burnaby by-election and I

went up to a house and I met somebody I

met a family I'm a husband and wife at

the doorsteps and I asked them what

their biggest concern was and they said

housing and I looked around I saw this

nice house I was a little confused

and he saw me looking around at the

housing no no we got a house but we only

can afford this place because we bought

it a long time ago we could never afford

it today and our kids they can't ever

own a place I'm gonna worried about them

and they said in fact one of our kids is

lives in the basement I'm gonna bring

her up and you can talk her to her so I

imagine a kitty I thought they meant

like like someone really young up comes

up a young woman a professional a

teacher have been teaching for six years

five or six years and she says do I work

I have a good job I earn a good salary

with benefits but I can't afford a place

to live and it's more and more the

reality people cannot find a place to

live and that's that's a young

professional who's been working for six

years then we meet people on all ends of

the spectrum seniors who are

with losing their homes and that we just

met a woman in in Campbell River River

today who lost her housing a couple

months back and now is living in a tent

in the backyard of her friend's house

she's living in a tent in the backyard

of her friend's house and and I asked

her about what what that must be like it

must be so hard it's like you know what

if it was just me I'd be alright but I'm

worried about my kids she said I kids

that live with her and they can't find a

place to live and Campbell River has no

vacancy

it's basically zero vacancy it's like

two percent or something it cannot find

a place and if you find a place it's

astronomically expensive and so I look

at that and I say well what can we do

like in a country as rich as ours does

it make any sense that that's what's

going on right does it make any sense

that we can't have a system in place

where everyone in our country has a

place to live you know I mean it just it

just boggles my mind and then I look at

you know the other concerns that people

have health care people know we're proud

of our health care system we've got a

health care system that was built on the

idea that we want to take care of one

another right a really Canadian value

that someone else is struggling we

believe we should all pitch in and help

each other out but more and more when

you need that health care system that

we're so proud of it's not there for

people and they need it we're seeing

that there's been an erosion of services

and it's not a coincidence government's

have chosen to cut funding and we're

dealing with provinces that are being

starved of the funding they need and I

think about what that means for people

they can't get the care they need I also

meet so many people so many Canadians

they cannot afford medication when they

need it I think about how illogical that

is you can go in and get diagnosed find

out what's wrong with you

but you can't afford the medication to

get better and how does it make any

sense that you find people that get so

sick they end up in a hospital bed in

the emergency room which costs $1500 a

day because they couldn't afford a fall

$5 a day pill like this the the sheer

absurdity of that situation just

flatters and this flattens me it shocks

me and then I look at all these

struggles and I see young people who are

we're telling us they're telling their

parents

telling leaders we've got people like

Greta people like autumn an indigenous

woman from Ontario who go to the United

Nations and say they speak truth to

power and they demand why is it that

world leaders governments are failing

young people why are they betraying

young people's future and they say how

dare you betray us and ignore the facts

and the science and I say young people

who got in their eyes instead of having

hope and excitement for the future

they're afraid and worried I think what

a betrayal to those young people's

future if we don't do everything we can

to make sure we defend this environment

and I think and I think right so we got

all all these worries you know and and

like let's take housing for example if

finish up on housing and I look at this

crisis and we see what are the choices

that people have in this election they

got a choice and look at the Liberals

and the Liberals say oh it's a housing

crisis we're gonna fund we're gonna put

money towards solving their housing

crisis well all right it sounded good

sounded like a nice thing to say that

there's a housing crisis and you gonna

put money towards it they announced a

national housing plan they announced

some money for housing and then we dug a

bit deeper more like alright how much

money they're actually spending and so

mr. Trudeau often talks about the

economy doing so well and it is but mr.

Trudeau is actually spending 19 percent

less than mr. Harper's spend on housing

so let's try to take that in the economy

is doing well but you're spending 19

percent less as a percentage of GDP than

mr. Harper the person you criticized and

attacked again and again you're spending

almost 20 percent less on housing again

it really makes it clear the economy is

rigged the economy's doing better and

better but mr. Trudeau is spending less

and less on housing and and I think

about you know the other option

conservatives and I'm not sure I need to

make that an option in this room but

it's not an option but let me just let

me just finish the point you know yeah

totally totally but I mean let's just

make the argument in case you hear from

people the Conservatives are gonna say

they're gonna say this they're gonna say

we're gonna put some money in your

pocket they're gonna say that they're

gonna say we're gonna cut your taxes

ensure they might cut the taxes a bit

they're gonna cut it mostly for the

wealthiest and the people at the very

top but they might put a couple extra

dollars in your pocket well what else

are they gonna cut they're gonna cut

services and we've been there before we

know how viciously conservatives cut

services they cut all the services that

families depend on they're not gonna

solve the housing crisis are they

they're not gonna solve it they think

it's the free market that's gonna fix it

somehow the free market that goddess in

this position in the first place they

think it was leave it to that and it's

gonna solve it it's not gonna solve the

problem they're gonna cut some taxes put

a couple dollars in your pocket but

they're gonna cut services that you need

services that your family need and it's

gonna cost everyone a lot more and

they're certainly not the option and I

look at both parties I think what are

they actually doing here what what is

going on and I put it to you the

question in the election is this who's

in it for you right who's in it for you

I put it to you the question is who's in

it for you we look at Ottawa Ottawa

certainly hasn't been in it for you if

you look at conservatives and look at

liberals they've been working hard to

make life easier for the richest the

wealthiest the biggest corporations it

makes it makes life easier for them but

harder for everyone else and I want to

change that I want to change that and

together we're gonna change that we're

gonna put in place we're gonna build

half a million new affordable homes

across this country but we know that's

gonna take some time it's gonna take

time to build we're gonna put those of

that dollar and those investments in

immediately we're gonna make this bold

investment right away but it's gonna

take some time to build all those those

affordable homes and those people are

struggling right now and we want to say

to that to that woman who was worried

about having a place to call home I want

to say to her she doesn't have to wait

for help we're gonna immediate immediate

ly put in place a rental subsidy that's

gonna help out 500,000 families it's

gonna provide them supports up to $5,000

because we don't got a make up for 30

years of inaction on the part of

liberals and conservatives we're gonna

make up for that inaction we're gonna

invest boldly we're also gonna take care

of people right now with supports to

people that need it right now on top of

that we're gonna tackle the root cause

of this because I think we can take on

these problems if we have the courage to

take on the powerful the people at the

very top right and so with the root

cause one of the root causes of why

housing is rising so quickly it's

speculation right speculation is driving

up the cost of housing and the BC

government's done a good job putting in

a foreign buyers tax which is help

control some of the speculation but we

know that money moves around there's

different jurisdictions people buy

things from different areas so we want

to put in place a federal foreign buyers

tax to make sure we clamp down on people

who want to use our market like a stock

exchange no more of that this is a place

where people have their own housing we

also want to clamp down on something

that's driving up the castle housing

here in BC significantly and that's

money laundering right at the federal

level there's a money laundering

department that has no one in it doing

anything on money laundry and I asked

the question to mr. Trudeau I said well

we've got the department why don't you

hire the staff so they can actually do

the work that we need to clamp down on

money laundering so it doesn't drive up

the cost of housing

it doesn't fuel the drug trade in the

opioid crisis and I'm sure you can guess

what mr. Trudeau's answer was he didn't

answer but we're gonna make sure that we

fund a specific anti-money laundering

department in the RCMP make sure it's

funded and half of that funding has to

go to BC to make sure we tackle that

crisis human BC

there's a lot we can do and we're gonna

do a lot together and I was going to

wrap up with this and I believe that we

need to expand our healthcare system you

know it's something that we're so proud

of we've got to invest in it and we need

to make sure that everyone in our

country has access to medication when

they need it and that means if you need

medication in our country you should use

your health card not your credit card

that's what we're gonna do and we're

gonna go beyond it because we know that

but not only do we need to have

medication coverage for all we also need

dental coverage for everyone I mean your

dental care for all we want head-to-toe

health care coverage and that means

Vision Care Hearing Care that means

addiction and rehabilitation services

it means mental health services when you

need it

and I'll wrap up with this people gonna

say well how are you gonna pay for this

it's a fair question people are nice how

are you gonna pay for this

and I want to say really clearly it's

about choices we're not in it for the

rich we're not in it for the wealthiest

people we're not in it for the

corporations at the top

I'm in it for all of you I work for all

of you so so what we're gonna do is this

we're gonna ask the wealthiest people

the super-rich in Canada the ones who

owned more than 20 million dollars in

fortune we're gonna ask them to pay a

little more we're gonna close the

offshore tax havens that's making us

lose twenty three billion dollars we're

gonna make sure they pay their fair

share we're gonna ask the wealthiest

corporations to pay a little more so we

can invest in all the programs that

people need and it's gonna be about

choices I'm gonna give you a quick last

example about choices

last year alone if you look at what mr.

Trudeau's spend money on he spent 14

billion dollars on the wealthiest

corporations he gave them basically a

check to buy corporate jets and

limousines he gave them 14 billion

dollars in the fall economic statement

he spent 4.5 billion dollars on a

pipeline he also forgave 6 billion

dollars in loans too they were owned by

the corporation's the biggest

corporations unbelievable that's almost

25 billion dollars of spending in one

year and just to give you a contrast if

people ask you you know what does that

mean our plan to cover cover dental care

for every Canadian who earns less than

70,000 who has no coverage that's 4.3

million Canadians we're gonna cover

right just like that we've got a plan to

cover it

that plan that plan which is going to be

a public a government insurance program

to cover all those 4.3 million Canadians

immediately that plan costs eight

hundred and fifty six million dollars so

less than a billion the government just

spent twenty five billion to the

wealthiest corporations last year our

plan would be paid for twenty five times

over with that amount of money right

it's a matter of choices it's a matter

of choices and my friends the choice is

this you choose governments I work for

the rich do you choose governments who

work for the people at the very top or

do you choose a new democratic

government that works for you that

fights for you thank you thank you very

much thank you

and we're gonna ask some questions now

so we've got Jesse's gonna mic and we're

gonna see some hands up and we got

someone else with the mic yes we got

another mic over here and yeah get your

hands up and we will come right to you I

also apologize this lighting is to make

me look really good right but it's to

make the Loom it's make to make the

groom look really nice but it's kind of

bright in there one's eyes I apologize

but it's important it's gonna show your

beautiful faces and show all the great

folks are here so yes let's go whoever

we have someone right there in the back

I'm gonna go to there

start there he's gonna hold on to it I

think ya know don't be afraid it's just

I think more efficient that way okay so

it's not so much a question I just

quickly want to share it some of my

story I'm here because a fellow named

bill came to my door and I've never been

involved my family wasn't involved in

politics so I brought my kids I'm a

single mom I've been up at viu studying

for my BA for 44 years we have moved

eight times in the past seven years okay

and I've dealt with slumlords four times

now I'm sorry

the housing yes it's a crisis but the

housing that is out there and the people

I know there are good people and I know

there are good landlords and I know

there are horrible tenants but the

family is the single-parent families all

families struggling anyone the tenancy

branch that I honestly truly feel in my

heart something needs like Reformation

there like it needs to be looked at

because landlords who do not take care

of properties and me and my kids have

been suffering like it's it's

astronomical what we've gone through I'm

not kidding you um I'm writing about it

that's why I'm going to school so yeah

but I just wanted to share that Prince

it takes a lot of courage to share his

story so thank you for sharing your

story and it's a part of what's gonna

help motivate us we already know how bad

it is and we've got to fight hard but

your story is what helps us you know put

a real human to that to that struggle to

what's going on so thank you for sharing

and and we know we've got to build a lot

of affordable housing we've gotta build

housing that's non market so you're not

dealing with tenants that are landlords

that are trying to make a profit off you

but nonprofit housing and non-market

housing and some of the solutions that

we want to invest in but this is you're

raising something that we've got to make

sure that tenants are protected and

thank you for bringing that up yeah no

no okay

noise thank you so much thank you thank

you thank you for sharing yep yes I'm

here you got a question over here thank

you for coming it's been marvelous to

hear you speak jag me and I grew up in

Strathcona so you know Strathcona and

the projects there for low cost housing

destroyed the neighborhood and we had to

move out of the neighborhood after my

family and the neighbors save that

neighborhood so I know very much about

people we also grew up due to the First

Nations generosity sharing their

skills with my father so he could feed

the family because we were in a ghetto

at that point Chinatown was a ghetto so

my question is not to the people of

course now because I am Canadian even

though I wasn't born a Canadian I was an

alien when I was born they did not give

a citizenship but I care my heart is now

on Vancouver Island and I welcome you to

the home of the gharial

medal and you know the federal

government is responsible for Sara and

we have no teeth in that first

endangered ecosystems and it does not

cost money it costs the focus for the

federal government to trickle down to

the local governments for us to care

about our home place and our local

biodiversity so I haven't seen anything

in any of the party platforms that speak

to biodiversity even though we have

declared climate change crisis how do

you and the ante P want to focus on

Sarah and our local gary-oke ecosystem

thank you for the question

thank you very much we know that this

week is it's a really appropriate

question to talk about you know

biodiversity and talk about the climate

given that this is climate strike week

we've got a week where people around the

world are striking to say please save

our planet

listen to the young people who are

worried listen to the science that

points out that we need to act now and

really if you look at why we haven't

seen action you know I can give one

example a concrete example of the

choices you know the choices that the

government's making and where we could

be putting money towards investing in

protecting our environment and what mr.

Trudeau is doing instead to give an

example of the current government so mr.

Trudeau promised for example to end

fossil fuel subsidies and that would

free up some money that could be

invested in tackling the climate crisis

that could be invested in clean energy

that could be invested in protecting

water and protecting land and marine

diversity but instead he failed to break

whatever he broke that commitment and I

wondered why you know why is it that he

there's a simple commitment he made in

2015 why did he break that commitment

well after four years in government

turns out he was lobbied a number of

times he's lobbied a number times by the

fossil fuel sector and those fossil fuel

sector the energy lobbyists lobbied mr.

Trudeau's government a whole bunch of

times does anyone want to guess how many

times over four years wild guess 600

it's a pretty good random guess hey you

know dude no even higher than 800 we got

to go up Oh someone read our press

release you did a good job it was over

1500 times and just to give you an

example of the influence you know those

energy lobbyists the powerful

corporations lobbied mr. Trudeau and his

government and he broke a commitment to

end the fossil fuel subsidies and as a

result the policies that we're seeing in

in Canada right now are more informed by

the pressures of powerful lobbyists than

they are by the science or by the people

who are demanding action to protect our

planet to protect our diversity and so

we as New Democrats aren't afraid to

stand up to the big polluters and

to make sure they pay their fair price

when it comes to a price on pollution

we're gonna end fossil fuel subsidies

immediately we're gonna invest in clean

and renewable energy we're gonna reduce

our emissions which is one of the

massive causes of a loss of marine

diversity and global diversity czar

emissions and I also want to make sure

that we protect our water you know why

is it that in our country as wealthy as

ours we're still sending untreated water

out into the ocean into lakes into

rivers we need to stop that so we're

gonna make massive investments in

ensuring that the infrastructure that is

in all cities is adequate to ensure that

we're never putting untreated water into

the oceans untreated water into into the

rivers and lakes around us and now I got

Bob Chamberlin beside me and we're

talking about marine diversity I gotta

talk about salmon I gotta talk about

salmon and we got a there's so much we

can do to protect salmon we know that

farm the farm fishing it as it's

creating risk open containment is

causing a risk for wild populations and

you know our candidate over here knows a

lot about that is probably one of the

best experts in fighting against making

sure we've got a sustainable way to do

it these are decisions we can make we

can work together and solve these

problems it's a matter of courage and

it's a matter of wanting to do it you

Democrats want to make this a priority

we were going to make it a priority and

we're gonna get the job done more

questions yes

anyone else hands up you got someone

back there yeah check me I'm a Canadian

Legion member long time my father served

in NATO he's deceased now for many years

my father-in-law was an RAF pilot 5,000

veterans were on the streets last year

what is what is the the NDP going to do

to address that my father and my

father-in-law are turning over in their

graves

thanks No thank you for the question

thank you very much

you know the the men and women that

served for us men and women that that

sacrifice for us that serve our country

we are so we're incredibly thankful for

them but they're not being treated with

dignity and respect and and it's

absolutely deplorable the fact that

people who who serve our country who

serve for all of us get treated with

such a lack of care with such negligence

odda at a starting point at a basic

level everyone who serves for our

country needs to be treated with respect

and dignity they need to have access to

the services that they need and what

we're seeing in the past year is when we

looked at the service standards the

government failed the majority of the

service standards that that it would be

adequate just basic service standards

for veterans who need access to services

often they had to wait weeks and weeks

just to get basic yes knows to whether

they're covered for certain services

that they need and then in terms of

housing you're talking about you know

veterans being on the street this is a

reality we have so many men and women

who serve for us who then have PTSD have

mental health concerns and end up not

being able to continue to work and end

up in situations where they're

struggling so poorly so so so much we

need to make sure they're supported we

need to treat them with respect and

dignity I am committed to doing that

we put in a bill in Parliament that said

there was a budget that set aside for

veteran services and every year it gets

it doesn't get spent on veterans it gets

it gets spent on other things but it

doesn't get spent on veterans and we put

forward a bill that says every

commitment that's made to veterans has

to be spent on veterans and make sure

they get the service they need and we

put a law we put a motion in place that

was passed that was going to mandate

that every year we will spend the budget

that's allocated for veterans on veteran

services to make sure they get the

dignity and respect they deserve

we got more hands up yeah yeah you can

go too maybe yeah go right there I'm

senior Chuck meet on a fixed income and

I really worry about medications they're

so expensive I can't afford them so what

can I do

what will the NDP do for me thank you

very much for the question thank you you

know you're not alone yeah there's a lot

of people that are in that's the very

same same position and I think about you

know seniors we talked about people who

served for our country seniors also gave

their whole lives to building up a

society for us and they give so much and

at a minimum they should be able to

retire and knowing that they're gonna

have dignity and respect in the

retirement but for far too many seniors

that's not the case they don't have

access to adequate housing and they

can't afford their medication and I've

heard heartbreaking stories of seniors

who have to cut their pills in half they

skip medication that they need they they

just don't take the medication at all

because they can't fill the prescription

I've met seniors who tell me they

literally have to look at the budget and

they choose between whether they buy

food or they buy the medication they

need and I think in a country as rich as

ours there's no way that should happen

right it shouldn't happen so what we're

gonna do is this we we have a plan it's

a public universal single-payer

medication for all Pharma care for all

plan that we want to get done in one

year we don't want seniors to wait gonna

get it done in one year

and so and so seniors like you don't

have to worry about the cost of

medication we don't want anyone to worry

about the cost of medication or medical

devices you know all the medical devices

that people need to stay well those

should be covered as well and we're

gonna make sure that happens yes yes yes

okay more mics you got hands up here we

have someone there where where's our

mics at what you got you goin okay what

about yeah sure maybe in the corner

there

sure

I was nervous you're gonna be long yeah

the thing is that I'm concerned about as

I do a lot of talking online and the

misinformation on climate the amount of

money that is spent and the think tanks

that are out there that are putting a

Haunter percent baloney all you got to

do is ask Google who's financing this

stuff and you'll find has come from the

guys that are running the biggest

industrial complex in the world yeah

that's horse hands they got a lot of

investment there they got all they got

nothing to lose they got a made and

instead of taking the money and sharing

it with us they're spreading peanut

butter crap yeah all over anything

that's true

I hear you thank you for the question no

I got you know not to get to know thank

you thank you you're absolutely right I

mean the in the sense that the powerful

the wealthiest corporations have far too

much influence over decisions they're

putting out a lot of misinformation

there's a lot of people are trying to

say that there is no crisis when we've

got all the world's scientists

mass number of scientists at the United

Nations making it really clear that

there's a crisis but the positive side

of it is if we make better choices today

if we end fossil fuel investments if we

invest in clean energy if we invest in

public transit Electrify transportation

Russia for our homes we can actually

turn things around we can turn things

around and I'm confident we can do that

and that's what we've got to really

focusing on that we can do this

just before that once I can just before

that I also just want to acknowledge

we've got an incredible champion amidst

us someone who's fighting hard for us

who was my dear friend at the federal

level and now is gonna fight hard for us

at the provincial level so thank you so

much for joining listen to everything

like basic things we on central island

and there's northern islands we people

have to go to Victoria for even for

putting this shunt we have to go there

and the families have so much hard time

in Victoria middles class people ok for

like people from North up North Island

they have no place to live in the city

and no place and we need Nanaimo is the

best place a central place on the island

we need you know we don't have

neurosurgeon here we have to bring to

the notice of the this is federal as

well a pre-show where entity was there

so from you know on the behalf of our

island people I want to bring to this to

notice that we need more facilities

Nanaimo is battle people coming home

port hardy or interior places we need

more facility here in animal and and

also the public funds should be used in

proper manner past in something happened

I bring to notice of I try to bring to

the notice of the NDP that public money

should be invested on the real cause

like where we need it thank you very

much and a ticket that Oliver

thank you thank you you touched on a

bunch of really good points one of the

things is that it's absolutely true that

people aren't getting the care they need

where they need it where we're seeing

that most care is in the the bigger

centers and the further you live away

from Victoria the harder it is to get

access to care that you need and and

that's just wrong you know we need to

make sure that we're having the the

access to care that people deserve and

need has to be available and when it's

concentrated in one area and there's not

here in other areas it makes it more and

more difficult so we absolutely need to

make sure that that happens he talked

about the proper use of public funds

she's an example of that we absolutely

need to make sure we invest in public

health care and then I look at the

contrast what recently is happening is

you all remember the Christy Clark

liberal time period where things were

not being spent

not being spelled well not being spent

well under Christy Clark there was a

Minister of Health

Terry Lakes in Terry Lakes was

responsible for health when BC was fined

16 million dollars because they were

allowing private delivery of public

services and guess who mr. Trudeau chose

as his star candidate in Kamloops right

now Terry Lakes so again this is an

example of not respecting British

Columbians who are saying hey we want to

make sure that our investments in public

health go to public services go to

public health not go to a government

that's gonna then use that to open up

the door for private services that's

just wrong well mr. Trudeau is signaling

is that he doesn't respect the reality

that british columbia's have gone

through he also was signaling that

Chrissie Clarke liberals are considered

a star candidate in his list of

candidates which is not true to anyone

who lives in this province they're not a

star candidate but you're absolutely

right we're gonna make sure we spend

that money adequately we're gonna make

sure there's checks and balances when

the Canada Health Act is our tool to

make sure money that's given to

provinces has to go to publicly

delivered services for everyone it's

accessible

I could ask like a hundred questions but

I'll try and restrain myself I brought

my kids to Nanaimo a year ago because I

as a former youth in care I get free

tuition at Vancouver Island University

it was a huge opportunity to try and get

out of poverty nobody would give us a

place to live we would go I have three

kids go see a three-bedroom house oh

we're looking for a smaller group of

people to rent our three-bedroom oh you

have three kids that $1,600 place that I

advertise well I'll have to charge you

2400 for that oh you can have free rent

in exchange for benefits and I went I

went to the Ministry of Children and

Family Development mandated help

families keep families together they put

my kids and I in a room and told me over

and over that I cannot raise my children

and I can put them into care yeah and I

went to crow Leonard crow I don't even

know what party he is went to his office

asking for help oh we can't help you

until you apply for BC housing so I do

and then they say oh well he's not

allowed to use his position to influence

anything and so I guess my question is

partially how do you decriminalize being

homeless so that people can ask for help

like what like literally what can you do

to change how this works and as much as

as the rental subsidies help if nobody's

willing to rent with somebody who has

children and like there's ads that

specifically say no natives there's ads

that want you know three months bank

statements there is no enforcement so

people can get away with it what what

can be done to help with that thank you

for the question yeah thanks

what you're going through is horrible I

think everyone in this room increased

that that should not be happening I'm

really sorry that's happening to you I

mean all those examples were just

horrible being discriminated being

harassed I mean that's just wrong and I

hope you know that that's wrong it

should not be happening to you I you

were describing the problem that we're

faced up against it's it's a crisis for

a reason and you are describing the

crisis like you are trying to do

everything you can you're doing

everything right you're moving to a city

hoping that you can build a good life

for your kids and no matter how hard

you're trying you're up against one

barrier after another barrier after

another barrier and it's like how do you

get ahead then how do you get ahead

that's horrible I wish I could answer

and solve all the problems I want to

like I really care I want to fix

everything you said right now and of

course

oh no for sure and that's beautiful yeah

I want to fix all those things the yeah

for sure I mean what we can do yeah what

we can do at the federal level and and

what we haven't seen for so long in

terms of the Tennessee rights and

protections those are all provincial

jurisdiction and I want to jump in and

fix them but I understand that this you

know limitations but what we can do one

of the things that we're not limited at

all is one of the reasons why you're in

this position is there's not an option

for non-market housing cooperative

housing right nonprofit housing where

the goal exactly exactly exactly and so

that's what we want to do so what's

happened for about three decades is the

federal government hasn't actually been

involved in building housing has it

haven't been involved in investing in

non-market housing so now you've got all

this market housing and market rental

where you're up against all these

problems but if we invested boldly and

you know if you look around the country

and you find where there's affordable

housing where there is non market

housing or nonprofit housing that's

where CMHC used to make those

investments used to partner with those

organizations and build those affordable

places to live that were governed by

that were governed by the principle of

accessibility and affordability

not-for-profit they weren't guided by

the principle of profit they weren't

guided by tenant or landlords they were

just seeking to exploit the the people

and that's not all

but there are some that do that that's

why we need a non-market option that's

why that's what we want to invest in we

want to invest massively in building

those type of homes and in the meantime

we know people need help right now and

so I kind of struggled to find a way we

could help out people right now and one

of the ways we can is that we're

offering a direct subsidy to those folks

and families that are struggling and

that's why we put forward an

announcement earlier just earlier today

in fact where we want to help out

500,000 families with a $5,000 rental

subsidy that's going to help out people

that are kind of on the edge they can

almost afford a place but they just need

a little extra help that's why we want

to put that forward to help out people

now and then we want to make sure we

invest and build affordable housing so

you won't be in that position again okay

we can take one more maybe we come over

here if you have to Mike Mike you give

you have someone chosen right did you

have someone already okay sorry I was

gonna go to you but I only have time for

one more question

yeah what's that I'm in high school I am

just graduating this year and I

understand that students of middle-class

families have the hardest time affording

University and I'm just wondering if you

would support increasing the threshold

of family income that would disqualify a

student from receiving a student loan

thank you very much to the question and

it takes like I said it takes a lot of

courage to ask your question in front of

a big room full of people and all these

cameras so thank you for that that's

awesome we heard from a young person and

young people should be our future and

young people now are faced with this

barrier to getting the education they

need and you know you want to pursue

education to live and realize your your

best potential but what you do is gonna

help all of us and if you're faced with

barriers not only do you miss out not

only to young people miss out on

achieving their dreams we all miss out

on their contribution and so we

absolutely need to make sure that

there's no barriers so what we're hoping

to do one is we should make it easier

for young people to access loans but

that's a short-term thing because what

we see with loans is the federal

government is charging massive amounts

of interest on those loans so yes yes is

that you is that your question okay we

got it

really connected we're gonna connect it

out so you got young people who who have

who even if they get a loan they have

massive debt and just to give you a

picture of this debt the government the

federal government is charging prime

plus 3% on student loans that is way

more than a bank will get you if you

wanted to get like a line of credit it

wouldn't be prime plus 3% so the

government is loan sharking what is

going on here it's messed up so so yeah

young people who take a loan and and

where you're talking about increasing

the access to it we'll look at that but

if students have a loan they're being

charged prime plus 3% so we looked at

four years of this what does that amount

to you over the past four years so over

the past four years

effectively mr. trudeau while he's been

in government has profited to the tune

of three billion dollars off the backs

of students who are in debt

remember what I talked to you about

choices before here's a choice that mr.

Trudeau made last year he forgave six

billion dollars in corporate loans so

the wealthiest corporations had loans of

six billion he said okay you're cool

you're forgiven

students oh no I'm gonna charge you

three billion dollars of interest so

what we need to do is we gotta change

that all up none of that makes any sense

so what we would do this like oh you're

like you're just like you know what

you're gonna change it that's good

enough change it no let me tell you how

I'm gonna change it okay I'm gonna

change it with doing this I'm gonna make

sure that on day one of a new democratic

government the first step there's many

sub scream take but for step one is we

immediately waive all interests and all

student loans right away step one all

interests wait step two we got to look

at waiving forgiving the debts of

students not of multi-million dollar

billion dollar corporations right step

three to your question instead of loans

we need to replace loans with grants you

should be getting non repayable France

three getting grants right you shouldn't

we shouldn't be applying for a loan to

go to school you should get a grant to

go to school and then ideally and

ultimately what we want to do is if

you're going to school from kindergarten

all the way to your career there should

be no barriers in your education and

that means free tuition for everyone

last question we're gonna squeeze one

last minute okay what do one last one he

she's in all that there my question to

you is competition children seniors

adults of every race tribe are suffering

by four ripoff Canadian companies that

are rubbing this population let dry what

can you bring in competition for the

cell phone companies ok great question

great question

I feel I could hear fashion I feel your

passion I feel the same way I mean can I

just put it out there how many people

are just incredibly angry and frustrated

every time you open up your cell phone

bill no yeah for me I get I get I get

frustrated sorry I get so frustrated

when I open up my cell phone bill and

the thing that annoys me the most is you

ever get to the point where you're

running out of data and then you get

that note that says hey you've run out

of data do you want to spend $800 on one

gig sure it's not $800 but you don't I

mean like you got to spend like your

plan is $80 and then one gig is like $50

for one Giga data it's like what my plan

cost 80 why is one gig where is 50 and

you know people feel it do you feel like

you're being ripped off a bit yeah well

you are being ripped off

surprise surprise your feelings are

right because we're paying some of the

highest cell phone bills in the country

in the world sorry in the world we are

paying some of the highest cell phone

bills in the world in our country we're

paying incredibly high bills and it's

again not a surprise because liberals

and conservatives have been working to

help out those those wealthy powerful

big telecom companies and it's made it

harder for everyone else and just last

year we looked at again a tally of how

many times the big telecom companies

lobbied mr. Trudeau's government so over

four years it's it's a lot but not as

much as the the false a few ones but

what do you think how many times

well that's pretty close actually 500 is

pretty close we counted over 550 550

times I mean in in four years that's a

lot of lobbying that's a lot of lobbying

and so they kept the prices high so and

then mr. Trudeau put out of this phony

plan he said okay I'm gonna lower the

cost of cellphones how are you gonna do

it I'm just gonna sit down and talk to

them that's literally his plan like a

money's a dream he's gonna sit down and

talk to them and somehow get it lowered

like that's my kind of work just heads

up it's not gonna work so our plan our

plan is this we're gonna make sure we're

not gonna ask them we're gonna impose

certain restrictions we've got a

powerful tool called CRTC it actually

governs it governs cell phones and into

internet prices so what we're gonna do

is something that the United States has

done Australia has done we're gonna do

it here in Canada we're gonna put a

price cap and it's gonna say that

cellphone companies cannot charge more

than the average of other OECD countries

that's gonna immediately save you money

that's that's gonna immediately save you

money the second thing we're gonna do is

we're gonna put in place a mandatory

requirement to have truly unlimited data

an affordable unlimited data plan that

families can choose to get unlimited

data not the fake unlimited where you go

over a certain amount then they throttle

and slow you down after it's truly

unlimited data these two measures are

gonna say families significantly make

the prices more affordable and then to

bring in competition the third thing

we're gonna do is right now you know the

these telecom companies build roads

build kind of cell phone lines

effectively and only they can use it

it's like building roads that no one

other company can drive on and so what

the states is done is those roads they

allow other companies to lease out those

roads and to put in other companies to

compete I want to open up those those

lines those those networks and allow

competitors to use the existing networks

not have to build their own but use the

existing ones and they can offer

lower-cost options to compete with the

existing ones to bring prices down these

three measures are gonna significantly

massively reduce our cellphone bills and

it's going to see families thousands of

dollars thank you

okay we're gonna ask you to sit tight I

know there's more folks headed questions

I'm gonna answer this questions kind of

one-on-one we've got to take some

questions from the media they they're

travelling with me and we want to make

sure our message gets out to the rest of

Canada and highlight the beautiful

wonderful people of Nanaimo so stay in

your seats you're gonna be on TV tonight

hopefully and we're gonna take some

questions from the media

we got a question there hello mister

saying it's Annie Bertrand Oliver their

smiles on so when your family sees you

hi burn all of her with CTV national

news so I know that I've asked you this

question before obviously it's a tight

fight between the greens and the NDP in

BC and especially here on Vancouver

Island tonight we're in a writing that

your party won back in 2015 but just in

May it was defeated by the Greens

winning basically their first ever seed

aside from Elizabeth May in Parliament

how confident are you that your party is

going to be able to take this riding

back because the greens are obviously

putting in a lot of effort here to

maintain that seat I'm absolutely very

confident we'll win the seat back no

question

but but for some very specific reasons

first off just a really clear reason why

there is a massive difference first of

all we're not trying to beat any third

place party we're and we're trying to

form government in Canada we want to

replace mr. Trudeau to put in our that's

where our goal is that's where our goals

are set but just to distinguish from the

Green Party there's a couple of really

key things I made it really clear for me

there is no we can't negotiate between

social justice housing health care a

woman's right to choose you can't

negotiate with these with any party

those are things that are fundamental

values we want to fight for social

justice as well as environmental justice

we don't to separate the two but the

Green Party so the Green Party has said

very clearly that they would work to put

Mr Shearer in to the prime minister seat

so they would point they made it very

clear they're gonna work to put the

Conservatives into power regardless if

they're gonna cut services regardless if

the fact that they don't support a

woman's right to choose and not to me is

not on that's the distinct difference

between us we don't believe in working

with the party that would cut health

care they would cut education they would

cut the services that family need and

they don't have a solid position on a

woman's right to choose for us that is

non-negotiable for the Green Party it is

negotiable for us it's not that's a

clear difference

you

you

let me know n-nobody deal if you were

the prime minister what is the first

thing you'd say to Donald Trump first

thing I would say to Trump I I hope he

gets impeached before I get this feature

no but honestly the reason is I mean I

say that I say that in a little

tongue-in-cheek but but to be honest

with you I would say it's disgusting

that a president could inflame hatred

against people and be so divisive it's

it's horrible that someone in a position

of power like him would allow for kids

to be stripped from the arms of their

parents from their moms to be put in

cage that needs to that needs to be

denounced you can't allow someone like

that to do that

without any sort of repercussions with

out anyone else condemning that and I

would condemn it

what's Bedell Castro a dictator he was

someone that was in power without

without a without a vote so he would

meet the definition of someone that was

in power without a democratically

elected system pretty random it's okay

people it's okay it's no problem I got

to be on my toes be ready for any

different take but curious Noakes we've

heard some party leaders talking about

whether or not they support the Indian

Act if you were elected as prime

minister would you abolish the Indian

Act it needs is it is a system that is

perpetuated a lot of injustice and it

needs to be massively it needs to be

completely changed we need to have a

whole new way of looking at our

relationship with the first people of

this land so we would replace that

framework with the United Nations

declaration framework that's the way

we've

when it comes to drug legalization your

party's talked about it but can you

explain a little bit more clearly where

exactly would your line be on

decriminalizing drugs versus legalizing

drugs and would it apply only to

possession but also to distribution yeah

pretty much pretty much that would be

the quick answer if I had a one-word

answer it would be Portugal but yeah to

be honest to be honest with you the

approach is this our current approach so

if you look at our country and we look

at what's going on we've got thousands

of people dying to the opioid crisis we

got thousand thousands of Canadians that

are losing their life I met a woman just

a couple days ago and she was in her 20s

and she told me she lost her dad to the

crisis and it is a real crisis we're

losing lives and we've got to do

something about it and so the war on

drugs has not worked that is a failed

that is a failed approach and what we

need to do is this I think is one if

first of all come together and say do we

agree on saving lives right okay we want

to save lives and we have to do things

differently and so I was a criminal

defense lawyer I represented a lot of

clients that were charged with personal

possession and these good folks that I

represented they were charged with the

personal possession we're people they

were dealing with addiction they were

dealing with mental health issues they

were dealing with poverty and those

three issues mental health poverty and

addiction are not criminal justice

problems they're healthcare problems and

they should be treated that way

sort of draw the line and what I would

say is for personal possession we should

not be spending any money on arresting

people putting them through the court

system getting bail being detained in

custody all the cost that's being spent

on people that just need help they need

rehab they need addiction services they

need compassion and so I wouldn't draw

the line very clearly on not arresting

people who are struggling with with the

use of drugs those who are selling drugs

should absolutely be responsible to the

full force of the law but when we're

talking about other measures I would be

open to any measure any step that would

save lives if there's evidence and

there's a science-based approach that

would save lives that we know what

actually how about people I believe we

have to have the courage to have those

conversations and be ready to take any

step necessary that's based on evidence

that will save lives

[Applause]

Nicholas must garden and I Mona's Bolton

mr.singh you've talked a lot about

affordable housing and one of the things

that we've noticed here in Nanaimo is

that housing of course is a multi

jurisdictional issue we've seen

provincial government put in supportive

housing in parts of the city that

perhaps other people that lived around

there wouldn't like we've also seen

councils up and down the island make

decisions about housing choices that

people don't because people in the

community don't want it so if you become

leader what would you do to try to work

and fix these issues that really a lot

of them just have to do with zoning so

thank you for the question so zoning

matters aren't necessarily in the

federal jurisdiction so I wouldn't have

an impact over zoning that's municipal

and and some parts perhaps provincial

but what I know is missing I can just

tell you exactly what I know and what

needs to be done what certainly needs to

be done is there's been 33 decades where

the federal government has completely

been absent in putting up money real

concrete investments in building

affordable housing and that lack of

investment can can largely be attributed

to the reason why we don't have the

affordable housing that people need

right now there is not a non-market

option for many people and there was at

one point we were almost as high as 10%

of our housing being non-market and now

we're at an abysmal less than 4 percent

so things are really tough right now and

we know that in every country in the

world where there's affordable housing a

significant portion of that housing is

non-market and that's what I want to

invest in and that means investing in

cooperatives in non-market and nonprofit

housing and collaborating with cities

municipalities collaborating with

provinces not-for-profit organizations

that want to build housing that don't

have the money we need to put money up

as a federal government to build housing

in a massive way

just to follow up to that then how would

would because you have touched on

wanting to do coops and these different

types of housing what would you offer

them to municipalities are provinces to

encourage councils to put in zoning or

to to approve projects like this because

at the end of day we can sit here and

see we're gonna do all this and then

watch a council to turn around and say

we don't want supportive housing in this

community or we've heard a bunch of

people in a well-to-do part of the city

say we don't want this and vote down a

project that would have given people

housing and getting cotton people off

the street our incentive is the funding

and when we put forward funding we have

to sit down and negotiate I don't work

directly with municipalities and say

we're really ready to fund this program

and we need this type of housing here's

money on the table and you know if you

take it you'll have the housing if you

don't take it you miss out on the

funding we've got to sit down and

negotiate there's lots of different

housing that we need we need supported

housing but we also just need a just

affordable straight up rental affordable

housing for families that just want a

place they don't need any other supports

beyond just an affordable place to live

but we need all sorts of housing so we

need to be able to build out for seniors

for people who are low and no income for

people who have income but just can't

find a place to live for professionals

they can't find a place to live

really our solutions got to be

comprehensive and deal with all the

range of housing that's needed because

it's all needed sure how's it good night

okay thank you very much friends thanks

for being here I know there's a couple

people that want to ask questions so I'm

gonna walk around and chat with you but

we are gonna wrap up this event thank

you so much thanks for being here

thank you

[Applause]

[Applause]
