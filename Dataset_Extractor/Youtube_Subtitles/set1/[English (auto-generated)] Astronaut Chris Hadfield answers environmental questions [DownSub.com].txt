are you ready

[Music]

okay here we go in what ways of cutting

edge space technologies already

contributed toward and may eventually

contribute towards the goal of

sustainability here on earth a whole

bunch of different ways number one is

whether we used to just sort of wait for

the weather to arrive but now with our

orbiting weather satellites we can see

the huge storms we can watch the effects

of the changing Jetstream weather allows

us to grow better crops and to prepare

our people so that we don't have as much

destruction navigation seems simple but

the global positioning system allows

combines on earth to exactly go down

certain paths to be almost a driverless

agricultural machine keeping track of

crop health all around the world you

know how are the bean crops doing in

Asia versus in in the Americas what's

happening around the world that global

understanding which you can't get here

on the surface allows us to make better

informed decisions on earth and with

better informed decisions hopefully come

sustainability some might say that the

carbon footprint of space exploration

isn't justified given many issues just

as climate change what are your thoughts

on this the people who think that the

carbon footprint of space isn't

justified haven't done their homework

how much carbon footprint is there if

you can't answer that question very

clearly then you're just speculating and

making a guess so what's the carbon

footprint of one car or all the cars

around Toronto or the truck fleets or

the trains or airplanes or spaceships

versus what is the return that they give

us we couldn't measure most of the

environmental changes in the world

without having gotten to space to be

able to see them if we want to look at

the health of the ozone layer or look at

the rate with which the the ice cap in

Greenland and Antarctica is melting its

melting at 400 billion tons a year we

wouldn't know that if we didn't have the

sensors in orbit to be able to tell us

measuring sea sea water levels globally

you have to break a few eggs to make an

omelet

and the number of launches I mean one

launch a week versus billions of people

driving to work every day it's

completely lost in the noise so if

you're gonna make a stand on a technical

issue do your homework make sure you

know the stand that you're stepping onto

and then look for ways to improve it and

solve the problem and that's that's what

I do for a living do you think we'll

come far enough for the next hundred

years to get off this planet before we

all drown and the rapidly rising oceans

well the oceans are rising but they're

not going to drown us all most people

don't live within a few meters of sea

level like here in Toronto were a couple

hundred meters above sea levels so

there's not that much water you know

it's not going to envelop all the high

land masses but a large percentage of

the world does live close to sea level

so we need to either raise where people

are living or we need to stop the oceans

rising and hopefully we can do a little

bit of both inevitably the oceans are

gonna rise some and they've already seen

some of that effects in various places

we have to solve that problem multiple

different ways we need a different

energy source we need to do carbon

capture out of the atmosphere and we

need to scare take care of the people

that live near sea level getting off the

earth is not the solution we need to fix

the problems on the earth while we're in

the process of going to other places

besides her it's not an either/or it's

all of this together how his face

exploration made you more

environmentally conscious I wish you

could ride with me onboard a spaceship

if I could float to the window with you

and we could just go around the world

once it takes 90 minutes you know the

time to have a meal in a restaurant

that's how long it takes to go around

the whole planet and you see the

incredibly inextricably integrated

nature of everything on this planet how

the weather and

the Sun and natural forces and people

and the oceans are all completely

intertwined and you come away realizing

when you look at something like the Aral

Sea which has been a cataclysmic human

example of bad decision making that has

affected a whole nation worth of climate

you see that we can have a very negative

effect on our planet at the at the

national scale so you come away forever

more concerned about being a better

steward about the planet but you also

come away optimistic it's a big tough

Rock then it's been here four and a half

billion years and we may be messing it

up for ourselves the world's not going

anywhere what we really need to become

conscious of is how to do the things

we're doing in a more sustainable way

it's not an unsolvable problem we just

have to take responsibility for our own

actions is the fragility of planet Earth

more apparent from outer space yes then

you stand outside anywhere in the world

and look up the atmosphere looks like it

goes on forever but in fact half the

atmosphere is in the first five

kilometers I mean five kilometers on

earth you can run that distance so you

really realize just how incredibly thin

the atmosphere is if the earth were the

size of an onion it's thinner than one

layer of skin you also see how shallow

the oceans are they sort of look

bottomless and you look at a globe but

it's just like like after the rain

that's skim of water on a puddle you

know the earth has a very tiny little

biome in between the rock and the

emptiness of space and the fragility of

that is worth recognizing the

preciousness of it and the necessity for

us to assume a responsible role in

preserving it and preserving it for our

grandchildren
