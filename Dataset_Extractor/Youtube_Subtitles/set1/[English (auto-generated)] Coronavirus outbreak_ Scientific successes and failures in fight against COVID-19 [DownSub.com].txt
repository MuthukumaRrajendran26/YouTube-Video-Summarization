as Canada deals with a surge in kovat 19

cases we can learn from countries who

are ahead of us in this outbreak

extensive testing isolating those who

are sick and their contacts and physical

distancing are crucial to suppressing

the spread of the virus wait too long to

do that and it's too late is Erik

Sorenson reports this is a crucial time

for Canada Germany's Chancellor learned

weeks ago the importance of keeping

apart staying off the streets was

adopted early in Germany and testing is

big while Canada reached a hundred and

twenty thousand tests this week

Germany is testing 120 thousand every

week Bahamas flew a cunt

we detected it early says this senior

health official because we tested it

early 43 thousand Germans have

contracted kovat 19 but with remarkably

low mortality one death for every 200

cases half the rate in this country

Canadian doctors are learning from

countries with even just a few more

weeks experience we have set up a

specific social media group where we

exchange any new information that we

come across but I think we're in a

dynamic situation where we're forced to

treat and learn at the same time it's a

crucial time for this country to stay on

top of the outbreak the critical period

of days is measured after a country

reaches 100 confirmed cases Canada

reached that date on March the 11th

since then the cases have surged past a

thousand two thousand towards three

thousand then the curve is bending

upwards Japan has done a better job than

most countries of flattening the curve

attributed by some to a mask wearing

obedient population other countries have

been at this much longer

Canada has a fraction of the number of

cases of China which is over 80 thousand

South Korea managed to bend the curve

down with a massive testing program to

below 10,000 Italy didn't get started

soon enough same thing for Spain and

maybe most worrying of all is the united

states all of these are arcing upwards

which suggests that cases are doubling

more quickly the goal for Canada then is

to get Canadians to stay home and Bend

that curve downward over these next

critical weeks whether Japanese

diligence or South Korean thoroughness

being rigorous makes a difference the

path ahead for Canada remains uncertain

our pandemic infection rate is still

growing exponentially in Ontario and in

all of Canada over the next few weeks

hopefully we'll start to see that the

rate of increase is slowing which would

indicate that the social distancing

measures are working Canadians may yet

need to take more measures but we have

the experience of other countries to

show what works and what doesn't

Eric Sorenson Global News Toronto the

race is on across the world to come up

with rapid test kits treatments and a

vaccine for kovat 19 as Heather Eurex

west reports they could be game changers

in this pandemic researchers in New York

have significantly advanced the science

that will help the world fight back

against kovat 19 it's important because

we can now actually identify individuals

who already have had Cohen 19 and are

immune to it when people get infected

the immune system reacts and the immune

system produces what we call antibodies

and these are chemical substances in

your body that can attack the invading

German a team at the Icahn School of

Medicine at Mount Sinai has developed a

blood test that can detect whether

people have antibodies to kovat 19 in

their blood it's a critical development

for a number of reasons it'll give us a

handle on who was exposed and who wasn't

so if this virus comes back in a second

or third wave will know who is

unprotected and who's protected we know

that not everyone infected with kovat 19

has symptoms so an antibody test is the

only way of determining who's been

exposed and who's now immune this is a

vital tool particularly when it comes to

identifying those with immunity within

the health system these people can

actually treat critically ill patients

they can treat patients who are

contagious so they don't have any risk

of infection having this test may also

help with treatment some patients who

have recently recovered from kovat 19

have blood rich with antibodies and this

blood known as convalescent plasma can

be used to treat up to two other

patients who may be critically ill on

Thursday New York's Mount Sinai Hospital

announced it's now using the therapy to

treat covered 19 patients in its ICU

it's very exciting as a urologist to be

able to contribute in a time like this

the New York researchers are now sending

the protein used for their tests two

labs around the world hopeful their work

can lead to the next big advancement in

the race to stop the spread of kovat 19
