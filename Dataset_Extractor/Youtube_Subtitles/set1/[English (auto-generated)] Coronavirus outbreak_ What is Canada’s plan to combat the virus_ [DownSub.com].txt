good evening and thanks for joining us

Canada is now ramping up the federal

response in case what's happening in

other countries with kovat 19 starts to

happen here it would strain both our

already overstretched health care system

and the economy so a special new cabinet

committee led by Deputy Prime Minister

Chrystia Freeland has been set up to

tackle it the job of this committee is

to ensure that Canada is ready and

prepared for all eventualities and we

are we take the cove in nineteen out

break very seriously there's natural to

be concerned about what Cove in nineteen

might mean for you and your family's

health this is a concern that public

health authorities across Canada are

taking very seriously and government at

all levels are engaged in the response

the Bank of Canada also slashed its key

interest rate today by half a percentage

point saying the virus is a negative

shock to Canada's economic outlook we'll

have more on that in just a moment but

we begin with the outbreak itself there

are now 34 confirmed cases in this

country all are in BC in Ontario except

for one in Quebec in tonight's top story

David akin looks at Canada's rapidly

evolving response to what is an

unprecedented outbreak so today we had

our first meeting of the Cabinet

Committee Deputy Prime Minister

Christophe Freeland chairs this special

committee but it will be Health Minister

patty haidu who will take the lead on a

whole-of-government effort to make sure

health care systems across the country

can contain the virus and if that fails

deal with an outbreak so far so good

cases in Canada all related to travel no

cases yet of community transmission and

our discussions and work has focused on

ensuring that our self surveillance

systems are detecting cases and our

health systems are prepared for an

increased activity a key task for public

health officials communicating to

Canadians that most kovat 19 infections

are mild such patients can be cared for

in the community while reserving of

course very scarce resources potentially

for those who really need it

Tamm says phone ahead before going to

the hospital

now half of this special committee holds

economic portfolios in Trudeau's cabinet

that's no coincidence every forecaster

now including the Bank of Canada says

the country's economy will take a hit we

recognize there are many different

people and industries that are seeing

challenging situations because of the

coronavirus that's why opposition MPs

are pressing for quick action now on the

economic front and so what I'm looking

for from the government are things like

is there a fiscal stimulus plan is there

a jobs plan I'd like to see some support

for workers who may have to self

quarantine to make sure that they're

there's some financial compensation for

them so that there's not a disincentive

to to stay at home so lots of pressure

on the prime minister and his co vid 19

committee to rapidly deliver results on

both the health front and the economic

front and Donna there's going to be not

much margin for error David there is

news tonight about how the Canadian

military is preparing in case this

outbreak impacts their operations tell

us about that

that's right Donna a general order went

out to the military today because they

are getting prepared in case there's a

pandemic we have two main objectives

want us to preserve the force and our

ability to function should there be a

pandemic gathers to support Canadians

and of course the military first of all

has to protect its own members and so

these new orders ban all non-essential

travel to countries with an outbreak

commanders also have the authority to

cancel vacations for the troops the

military is also going to review whether

it ought to hold large gatherings now

second of all the military has to have

plans in place to assist a federal or

provincial government or municipal

government in trying to deal with a

pandemic here chief a defense staff

Jonathan Vance telling global news that

the military is making those plans on

the worst-case assumption and that is

that they might have as many as 25% 25%

of their members could be in quarantine

or fighting kovin 19 Donna wise to make

worst-case-scenario plans David akin in

Ottawa thanks the outbreak is already

having an impact on supply chains of

companies in Canada and the Bank of

Canada is concerned about the economic

for this country so it cut Canada's key

interest rate by half a percentage point

overnight its dropped from 1.75 to one

point two five percent that's the first

drop since 2015 and it's in line with

the cut the US Federal Reserve made

yesterday it's hoped the lower rate will

boost consumer confidence and help

settle the markets which have been on a

rocky ride over the past week

today the TSX closed up 355 points

Doug Porter the chief economist at BMO

says it's a smart decision given the

situation very few people saw Bakic and

the interest rate cuts anywhere close to

this this soon so obviously the world

has changed in a very short period of

time and I think this is a constructive

step in helping to address the the risks

of the economy from from the virus the

drop in interest rates might help those

looking to buy a home or a vehicle but

it won't help cover the costs if your

company's employees have to stay home or

other parts of your daily life are

disrupted by the outbreak Porter says

the rate cut is an immediate step

policymakers can take and they do have

other tools they can use further down

the road if the economy slides if things

really do get tough and challenging in

the in the months ahead there there is

room certainly at the federal level for

the government to to either cut taxes or

to to spend more money to support the

economy
