tell me the physical call presented me

it coulis you gonna give it one to

participate we won't have the liberal

and NDP platforms and a coalition of the

two we would run a deficit of forty

billion dollars next year alone to pay

for even half of these never-ending

deficits the Trudeau NDP coalition would

have to raise taxes either the GST for

5% to 7.5% or increase personal income

taxes or cut important transfers to the

provinces these polish deficits will

raise your taxes and starve our vital

public services of much-needed funds and

so the choice is clear an NDP government

wearing a Justin Trudeau maps that will

raise taxes kill jobs and it's our

economy and take more money out of your

pockets or a conservative majority

government that live within its means

and put more money in your pockets so

you can

and just too intense forma a working

partnership with the NDP after the

election if he loses this election he

needs to have the courage to come clean

with ladies as to which taxes he will

increase to buy healthy
