deadly bush fires still raging in

eastern Australia residents say it's

like an apocalypse the swift-moving

fires taking lives gutting properties

and forcing thousands to flee it's just

the worst thing oh there's a saint

honestly the fire front was coming at us

just nothing you could do about it

so I lost a few friends in the fire lost

all authorizations positions are nothing

so people that can a the fires are now

bearing down on the country's largest

city officials warning of a catastrophic

threat to Sydney and surrounding areas

on Tuesday as temperatures are expected

to hit 37 degrees and wind gusts up to

35 km/h in New South Wales a record

number of emergency fires are destroying

the region the death toll is expected to

rise we've got more than a thousand

firefighters working on the fires more

than 70 aircraft working on the fires

and dozens of heavy plant and machinery

trying to do the best they can to save

and protect as many people as possible

this is an early start to the fire

season

residents say climate change is to blame

pointing to evidence that 2018 and 2017

were the third and fourth hottest years

on record we've been telling the

politicians the same message for over

ten years and they are not listening we

have a prime minister and a premier in

denial about climate change this this is

real

the Prime Minister dodging questions

about climate change while consoling

victims and an evacuation shelter where

people have reached out got people out

of homes made sure they've got to safety

looked after each other's livestock and

animals talking to each other putting

themselves in harm's way for each other

I've got to tell you as a prime minister

I'm never more proud of Australians than

in moments like this what Australians

are frustrated and scared facing a fire

season that could end up being the

country's worst ever Jennifer Johnson
