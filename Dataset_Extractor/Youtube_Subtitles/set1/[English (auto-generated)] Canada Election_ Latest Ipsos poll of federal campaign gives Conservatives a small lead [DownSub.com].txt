well if you take a look at what's

happening over all there's been very

little movement since the start of the

election campaign we have the

Conservatives with a very slight lead 32

to 31 over the Liberal Party and we have

the NDP up at 18 so basically what

you're seeing is a very tight election

that we will probably be half having to

watch all the way through British

Columbia before we figure out who's

actually won what's happening in British

Columbia is we see the Conservative

Party with a bit of a lead see the NDP

doing pretty well in second place and of

course they have the provincial

government in British Columbia and the

Liberals trailing a bit at in third

place which probably means that we're

the Conservatives and the NDP are going

to have some seat pickups and probably

the NDP is gonna lose or the Liberals

are going to lose a couple of seats in

verse Columbia what we tend to find are

voters who are older they tend to be

homeowners they tend to be people who

are commuters those are the people who

tend to show up to to vote and if you

look at those voters they tend to be a

little bit more conservative last

election campaign Justin Trudeau was

really able to animate a lot of younger

less attached voters to show up

particularly in places like the province

of Ontario the question is this time is

he going to be able to do that and that

could make the difference in the

election campaign while the Tories have

a less efficient vote than the Liberals

have what that means is that the

Liberals because of where their votes

are placed across the country tend to

get more seats for the number of votes

they have the Conservatives because of

the big lead that they have particularly

on the prairies and in Alberta because

they have a huge lead they're not going

to do very well on election night it

makes their national numbers look a

little bit better than they really are

so the Liberals have a more efficient

vote from then the Conservatives do at

least on paper we'll have to see how

that transpires through the night well

based on what we're seeing right now in

the polling neither party has enough to

form a majority so it looks like a

minority is probably going to be the

outcome the question is will the

Liberals and the NDP together be able to

get over a hundred and seventy seats if

they don't it will become a lot more

complicated in terms of what the next

government is going to look like but

even a liberal NDP scenario what is the

NDP going to ask for supporting the

Liberal Party that's a question that

really hasn't been answered so we'll

have the election which probably won't

settle very much and then the

negotiations after that between the

various parties among the various

parties will decide what the government

is going to be
