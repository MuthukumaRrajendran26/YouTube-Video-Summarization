this hearing will come to order

thank you all for being here today one

year ago today lion Air flight 610

crashed into the sea shortly after

takeoff from Jakarta Indonesia all 189

people on board perished five months

later Ethiopian Airlines flight 302

departed out of Sabah Ethiopia

just like lion Air flight 610 at the

open the Airlines flight 302 experienced

problems

shortly after takeoff and crashed all

157 persons on board died both of these

accidents were entirely preventable we

cannot fathom the pain experienced by

the families of those 346 human beings

who were lost many family members are

here today and we appreciate their

attendance I appreciate many of them

meeting with members of the committee

over time as chairman of this committee

I promise

their loved ones that we are working to

obtain a full answer as to how to

prevent future tragedies these families

deserve answers accountability and

action and the public deserves no less

the type of aircraft involved in both

accidents is a 737 max 8 manufactured by

Boeing international aviation safety

regulators began grounding the Mac's the

day after the Ethiopian crash on March

13 Federal Aviation Administration

formally grounded the aircraft in the

United States the maxes returned to

service is contingent on Boeing's work

with the FAA to test and certify fixes

to the M Cass flight control system

which activated during both

Asha's in order for the max to return to

service international regulators also

need to be satisfied that it is safe to

fly as the certification process

continues many questions remain about

Boeing's actions and the FAA s actions

during the design development and

certification processes as well as the

operation of the Macs today's hearing is

divided into two panels let me note for

senators that the committee will follow

regular order and recognition of both

panels the five-minute rule will be

observed strictly because we have so

many people who wish to participate on

the first panel

Dennis Muhlenberg president and CEO of

Boeing will testify on behalf of the

aircraft manufacturer he is accompanied

by John Hamilton chief engineer for

Boeing Commercial Airplanes who will

provide technical expertise our second

panel will examine these issues from the

government's perspective the witnesses

today include National Transportation

Safety Board Chairman Robertson Walt and

chairman of the Joint Chiefs technical

review or jeder

Chris Hart chairman son Walt oversees

the NTSB which recently released a

report and recommendations regarding the

Mac's certification chairman hart led

the jetter an FAA commissioned body that

included the FAA NASA and nine foreign

aviation safety authorities tasked with

reviewing the maxis flight control

systems the jetter has submitted a broad

range of recommendations to the FAA let

me note that chairman Hart has extensive

past government service in aviation

safety but he is a private citizen today

who agreed to lead the chatter we have

many concerns that Boeing should address

today we need to know if Boeing and the

FAA rushed to certify the max in

particular critics have focused on the

MCATs development and testing the jet or

criticized Boeing's

munication with the faa on em Casas

development particularly after the

system was modified to activate at lower

air speeds the jeder also criticized the

faa for relying on outdated regulations

guidance and certification procedures

and failing to incorporate realistic

human behavior factors into its

assumptions the NTSB also called into

question Boeing's and FAS assumptions

about pilot reaction during MCAS

activation these questions were

specially important for stressful

situations with multiple alerts going

off in the cockpit our witnesses should

address the company and safety

regulators actions regarding Mac's

certification general and MKS in

particular the process for certifying

the Mac's necessitated a close

partnership between Boeing and FAA under

a decades-old system called organization

design authorization or Oda the FAA has

delegated certain certification

activities to the Oda holder in this

case Boeing while the OTA has been used

to certify many aircraft over the years

some have criticized the system for

permitting an inappropriately close

relationship between companies and their

safety regulator indeed email

correspondence dating from as early as

2015

between the Maxis former chief technical

pilot mark fourtner an FAA personnel

released on October 18 reflect a

disturbing level level of casualness and

flippancy that seem to corroborate these

criticisms I was disappointed to learn

of a November 2016 instant messenger

conversation between mr. for fork nerve

and and a colleague is which he

acknowledged misinforming the

they a boy should have notified the FAA

about that conversation immediately upon

its discovery although FAA is not

testifying today let me express my

frustration with the agency's lack of

responsiveness to my request dating back

to April of this year four documents

relevant to the 737 max as part of the

investigation that I opened as chairman

based on whistleblower disclosures the

relationship between regulating agencies

and organizations they regulate is

important but so are the internal

reforms that Boeing is implementing

witnesses should provide their views on

the ODA system and whether or not

reforms are needed I invite mr.

Muhlenberg to describe the steps Boeing

is taking to improve aviation safety and

to ensure that technical experts never

experience undue pressure to put profits

and relationships ahead of safety the

committee's oversight is not limited to

past actions the reviews by both Tjader

and NTSB note that future aircraft

systems are likely to be even more

complex and interdependent than current

models managing interfaces between

humans and machines will become even

more important as automation increases

at the same time commercial aviation is

set to continue expanding around the

globe many future pilots will fly in

countries without the same training

requirements and safety standards that

we have in the United States we welcome

the witnesses thoughts on how to improve

design development and certification in

the future to account for these major

changes this hearing will by no means in

our inquiry additional oversight

hearings will be held the committee will

carefully review the final Lion air

report which was released on Friday as

well as the ethiopian airlines report

which is forthcoming the committee will

also consider the findings and

recommendations from chatter NTSB and

all other investigations

and reviews I now recognize the

distinguished ranking member senator

Cantwell for her opening statement Thank

You mr. chairman and thank you for this

important hearing I too want to take a

moment and recognize the families who've

lost loved ones in both the Ethiopian

Airlines and Lyon air tragedies some

whom are here with us today I can't

imagine the loss and the enduring pain

that you must feel I thank you for your

vigilance on this issue just as we have

seen the families of Colgan Air flight

vigilant's help us improve safety for

the future right now mr. Muhlenberg

these families millions of airline

passengers and over 150,000 Aerospace

Workers want to know what we're doing to

fix what went wrong and what did go

wrong to date we haven't gotten all

those answers hopefully today's hearing

will help provide some but one thing is

crystal clear if you want to be the

leader in aviation manufacturing you

have to be the leader in aviation safety

aviation demand especially for 737s and

single aisle planes is exploding to 101

percent growth over the next ten years

something like 35,000 planes and three

trillion dollars I think that's actually

20 years but we cannot have a race for

commercial airplanes become a race to

the bottom when it comes to safety the

company the board cannot prioritize

profits over safety safety always has to

be job one so it is troubling to hear

that Boeing may have skirted the FAA

certification process over a desire by

airlines to have more fuel-efficient

planes but without pilot training now

this issue of lowering standards is

permeating through all of aviation we're

dealing with it here in the committee my

Democratic colleagues have led the

charge to try to stop companies coming

here to say they don't want to have the

same training for co-pilots on the

regional jets because they don't have

enough pilots or the issue my colleague

is championed on rest requirements for

cargo pilots having the same

requirements for rest as passenger

planes thank god captain Sullenberger

the hero of the hudson made it clear

when you're in an emergency the pilot

and co-pilot don't have time a lot of

time to communicate so that is why today

we need answers to how the first 737 max

certification process was done and we

especially need transparency on this

process of review before the 737 max is

put in the air again the public needs to

know and fully understand what testing

what review what processes were

conducted both by Boeing and the FAA

so

we're not listening to whether there was

enough testing and complex system

integration and information into a

cockpit alert system that we out now all

know was flawed and whether there was

even enough data presented to the FAA

these are all questions that are

important including outsourcing of

engineering and coding there are many

questions about software and cockpit

automation and overload I guarantee you

the FAA codes and laws are clear when it

comes to the standards for certification

yes software and automation flight

training better rest requirements for

pilots have all led to 10 years between

20 2009 to 2018 as the safest 10 years

in aviation history but more software

and more automation without robust

third-party testing and validation will

lead us to where we are today we should

note that the last five ABA ssin

accidents have all involved this issue

of automation and pilot response to

automation

whether it's lion air Ethiopian the

Asiana the French or Qantas 330

accidents they were all in response to

an automation in a command in a response

from the pilot so that is why last week

I introduced legislation with my

colleagues senators Duckworth and

senator Blumenthal to implement the

recommendations of the NTSB Safety Board

and the Inspector General report on

better safety management systems better

cockpit prioritization and a new FAA

Center of Excellence on flight

automation and human factors the FAA

needs the best engineers to understand

the engineering challenges of the future

and stay ahead on this human behavior

response to new automation we're dealing

I see people here on the transportation

automobile side it's the same issue in

advanced vehicles what automation exists

and how do humans respond to it so I

look forward to also hearing from

chairman some Walt and Chris Hart about

their findings on improving the safety

review process that we've included in

this legislation I would just say again

our sorrows are nothing like the

families who are with us today but I do

want to note that 737 max accidents have

struck at the heart of everyone in the

Northwest

soon after the Ethiopian crash a Seattle

firefighter approached me and asked if I

thought he could get a job at Boeing he

said I just want to go there and make

sure we get the safety right everyone

feels that way

generation of workers in the Pacific

Northwest have dedicated their lives to

aviation excellence and safety and that

spirit lives on in Everett and Renton so

this isn't a question about line workers

this is a question about a corporate

view from Chicago whether there is

enough attention to manufacturing and

certification you should take you no

offense to the fact that people say it's

a great company not being run correctly

so for the 346 people who trusted Boeing

without a second thought we need to get

this right these families are counting

on us Thank You mr. chairman thank you

senator Cantwell mr. mellenburg you have

submitted an extensive written statement

it will be entered in full in the record

at this point you're now and I

understand mr. Hamilton will not be

making a formal statement

so mr. Mullen where you are recognized

at this point to summarize your opening

statement for five minutes thank you

thank you for being here sir

chairman wicker ranking member Kent well

committee members thank you for the

opportunity to join you today and we

share your commitment to aviation safety

before we start today I'd like to speak

directly to the families of the victims

who are here with us on behalf of myself

and the Boeing Company we are sorry

deeply and true

sorry as a husband and father myself I'm

I'm heartbroken by your losses I think

about you and your loved ones every day

and I know our entire Boeing team does

as well I know that probably doesn't

offer much comfort and healing at this

point but I want you to know that we

carry those memories with us every day

and every day that drives us to improve

the safety of our airplanes and our

industry and that will never stop I'm

grateful and humbled to be here today

and to be able to say these words to the

families directly and I want to convey

our absolute commitment to safety our

commitment to learning our commitment to

rebuilding the public's confidence in

what we do and to preventing accidents

from like this like this from other ever

happening again we will never forget and

that is our commitment going forward mr.

chairman I know this committee has many

questions about the Mac's we'll do our

best today to answer all of those

questions and while one of the accidents

is still under investigation we know

both accidents involved the repeated

activation of a flight control system

called MK s which responded to erroneous

signals from a sensor that measures the

airplanes angle of attack based on that

we've enhanced M casts in three ways

first it will now compare information

from both sensors instead of one before

activating second MK s will only

activate a single time and third M casts

will never provide more input than a

pilot can counteract using the control

column alone pilots will also continue

to have the ability to override M casts

at any time we've brought the best of

Boeing to this effort we spent over

100,000 engineering and test hours we've

flown more than 800 test flights

we've conducted simulator sessions with

545 participants from 99 customers and

41 global regulators I flown on a couple

of flights myself this is taken longer

than expected but we're committed to

getting it right during this process

would work closely with the FAA and

other regulators we provided them

documentation had them fly the

simulators answered their questions and

regulators around the world should

rigorously scrutinize the max and only

approve its return to flight when they

are completely satisfied with its safety

the public deserves nothing less mr.

chairman today and every day over five

million people will board a Boeing

airplane and fly safely to their

destination decades of cooperation and

innovation by industry and regulators

and the rigorous oversight of this

committee have reduced accidents by more

than 95 percent over the last 20 years

but no number other than zero accidents

is ever acceptable we can and must do

better we've been challenged and changed

by these accidents we've made mistakes

and we got some things wrong we're

improving and we're learning and we're

continuing to learn we established a

permanent aerospace safety committee of

our board which stood up a new safety

organization we strengthened our

engineering organizations so that all

engineers now report up through Boeing's

chief engineer we're also helping to

rebuild the communities and families

impacted by these accidents we've

pledged a hundred million dollars to

this effort and have hired renowned

experts in this area to ensure families

can access these funds as quickly as

possible no amount of money can bring

back what was lost but we can at least

help the families meet their financial

needs mr. Chairman I started at Boeing

more than 30 years ago as a summer

intern in Seattle I was a junior at Iowa

State University studying engineering

having grown up on a family farm in Iowa

I was awestruck to work at the company

that brought the jet age to the world

and helped land a person on the moon

today I'm still inspired by what Boeing

does and by the remarkable men and women

who are committed to its outstanding

legacy but these heartbreaking accidents

and the memories of the 346 lives lost

are now part of that legacy it is our

solemn duty to learn from them and we

will recently there has been much

criticism of Boeing and our culture we

understand and deserve this scrutiny but

I know the people of Boeing they are

more than 150-thousand of the most

dedicated honest hard-working men and

women in the world and their commitment

to safety quality and integrity is

unparalleled and resolute we will stay

true to those values because we know our

work demands the utmost excellence mr.

chairman thank you very much mr.

Muhlenberg during my opening statement I

mentioned an instant message

conversation and then a series of emails

the instant message conversation was

between the 737 max chief technical

pilot and a colleague and it expresses

concerns about the operation of the

MCATs

boeing knew about this instant message

for months but failed to share it with

the FAA until recently with regard to

the emails again mr. Fortner the former

Mac's chief technical pilot calls for

removing any mention of the MKS flight

control system from the flight crew

operating manual he talks about Jedi

mind-trick

of regulators with at least one person

who works for the FAA so with regard to

the instant message conversation when

were you made aware of the existence of

the November 2016 message

mr. chairman as I recall I was made

aware of that message earlier this year

it was discovered as part of a document

gathering process in response to a

government investigation so it was after

the crashes you were made aware of it

this year uh sir as I recall I believe

it was prior to the second crash on a

syringe was it your decision to wait

months before disclosing this to the FAA

mr. chairman at that point it had been

identified as a document in response to

an ongoing investigation and I relied on

our our counsel to provide that to the

appropriate authorities okay well did

the what did the counsel tell you did he

say I'm going to I'm going to supply to

the Justice Department or did you say

I'm going to get it to appropriate

authorities mr. Chairman I don't recall

having a specific conversation about

which authorities just again as part of

this investigative process our intent to

cooperate fully with the request and to

provide that to the appropriate

authorities I think over this over this

time period this year we provided on the

order of half a million pages of

documents in support of various requests

you agree that this should have been

provided to the FAA in retrospect

senator as I became familiar with the

details of the document over the last

few weeks as I expressed our our

disappointment and and concern with how

this came to the FAA I think you heard

the same from Administrator Dixon I

called him and apologized for how this

had come through the process again I

wasn't involved in the document

production process but it counted on our

team to make sure all the right

authorities were notified okay so we

should look to the team then can you

assure the committee that boeing has now

turned over all such safety related

communications to the FAA related to the

737 max Thunder aye

our team continues to cooperate with all

requests for documentation I'm sure that

additional documents will be provided

time as they're discovered as would be

normal to the process and uh we will we

will cooperate fully with the requests

it seems to me that a request shouldn't

have to have been made with regard to

that I am conversation service let me

ask you when did you become aware of the

emails that I referred to in the second

part of my question about Jedi mind

trick in regulators senator again just

recently I've been informed of the

details of those emails and the instant

message that you give us an idea of how

recently it's over the last couple of

weeks when it became public news okay

you did not know about it until then sir

I don't recall being briefed on the on

the details of those documents anytime

prior to that can you see that this

raises much concern about the level of

coziness between Boeing personnel and

FAA regulators miss mr. chairman I

understand the the concern there and

again we're doing our best to lean

forward and provide information as part

of this process

I can I can tell you that the the

comments the the values the approaches

that are described in those emails are

counter to our value said that in no way

would meet any expectation I would have

for our team our employees so I

understand the concern share the concern

and just want to convey it's it's not

consistent with our values as a company

at all in this series of emails has only

in the last few weeks come to your

attention is that right sir as Senator

as I said I was aware of the the

documents that were being produced as

part of an investigation that's what I

recall from earlier this year

I don't recall getting briefed on on

details of these documents those details

are things that I learned of over the

last few weeks

senator Cantwell Thank You mr. chairman

and if you could help I have a lot to go

through so we're going to try to move

quickly through it was Boeing aware of

the defects in the

system which it failed to disclose to

the FAA at the time the aircraft was in

development and certification senator as

you know the the UM cast development

occurred over a lengthy time period

about a six-year development program of

the the max we have learned from both

accidents and we've identified changes

that need to be made to MKS we did

during the development process you

follow our certification standards and

long-standing industry standards behind

the MKS design but clearly we've learned

and there are things we need to improve

on em yes answer the question mr. bond

from Senator could ask you what was

Boeing aware of defects in the EM cast

system which it failed to disclose to

the FAA at the time the aircraft was in

development and certification senator I

just have two question I'll say the

premise of the question

so we as part of our development process

we do identify hazards and failure modes

and they were disclosed that was part of

the failure mode analysis that we shared

as part of the certification process

during that time period

so you think everything that you were

aware of was disclosed to the FAA as it

relates to defects in the EM cast system

well senator as we get to two defects

things we need to fix

you know we've identified three areas

that we talked about needing to address

one was the single sensor feed that was

a piece of the architecture that was

shared with the FAA the fact that the

system would operate more than once

during a flight that was also part of

the design description and the the

control authority of the system at

various parts to I don't know what mr.

Faulkner is referring to when he says

unknowingly lied to the FAA or Jedi

mind-trick

senator I I'm not sure what he meant by

that we haven't been able to talk to him

he doesn't work for Boeing anymore we've

been trying here's my concern that if

you don't know what he meant then you

also don't know wasn't what wasn't

disclosed and so we don't know if there

are things

in the mcat system that were defects

that he or someone else knew about that

weren't disclosed so I hear what you're

saying that there's a lot to discover in

a process but I'd like to go over some

of the very specifics about what was

tested and did Boeing test the

consequences of the EM cast reliance on

a single AOA sensor did it test that

yeah senator we tested a broad array of

different aspects of the M cast system a

set of failure modes we we did thorough

flight testing no John if you want to

comment on on the details there yeah

senator the 737ng is one of the safest

airplane says and we're trying to

understand what got tested so did you

test the reliability of the AOA sensors

in general did you test the reliability

on a single sensor did you consult with

the pilots on the lack of guidance on M

cast and the flight manuals did you test

the AOA sensors degree alert to ensure

reliability did you test the human

factor response these are all things

from the lion air report and my guess is

you didn't test those and that's at the

heart of this but if you did and you

have data on that and it was provided to

the FAA that's what we want to see

senator we we did test the MKS

uncommanded inputs to the stabilizer

system due to whatever causes was

driving it not specifically to who an

AOA sensor we assessed that hazard level

we which now do you think is wrong

in hindsight senator yes I thank you

because I I agree yeah a certain Senator

fight if I could just add a point to

that because as John pointed out we

relied on on these long-standing

industry standards as part of our

evaluation of response time behind M

cast and that is one of the areas here's

the thing about shortfall here's the

thing I'm

very confused about which is just this

larger issue and look we want to get

this right because we do want to go

forward and we know there is going to be

automation in many aspects of our lives

but this robust testing that must occur

and third-party validation there were

just I just don't understand how you

have sensors on the outside of a plane

and you are going to let that send a

command to the inside of the plane that

basically says trim the plane 2.5

degrees and then all of a sudden you're

gonna be yelled out from the cockpit

from somebody saying pull up and then

the same time you're being forced down

in your nose and you have seconds to

respond because you're in takeoff that

doesn't seem like a lot of robust

testing was done to me because if it was

then the lion air incident wouldn't have

happened okay

so I see my time I have a few seconds

left I want to just bring up a cup I

think this whole issue of air speed is a

major issue writ large for all of us to

get right the sector those crashes about

automation even the Air France crash is

related to a faulty pitot tube I don't

know how much we should be trusting

things on the outside of the plane to

give commands to the inside of the plane

when they can be damaged so but I do

want to know that you are improving the

safety culture this issue of both

reporting people not being able to talk

to FAA oversight people and this issue

of some of the machinist Boeing quality

inspectors being there work being taken

over I want to understand that a safety

culture is going to exist senator if

anything I can leave with you today I

want to reinforce the culture of safety

at Boeing and we know we can improve you

know we encourage our employees to speak

up when there are issues and and some of

those have been public recently we

respect and accept those inputs we take

action following on those we have

recently made a number of improvements

that includes restructuring our safety

review boards elevating them to increase

transparency and focus on safety we've

moved all 50,000 Boeing engineers to now

report directly to our chief engineer

separating them I'm gonna ask you to

come back on the SPEA and Boeing quality

inspectors two different issues with a

rig

response Thank You mr. chairman I know I

went over my time thank you now I have

the beauty of telling the distinguished

whip that he's limited to five minutes

Thank You mr. chairman mr. Muhlenberg

it's my understanding that the MKS

has been substantially redesigned to

include several redundancies that will

better prevent erroneous activation

could you speak to why some of the

changes being made in the

reconfiguration of the MKS

were not considered in the initial

development of the system yes senator I

think you raised a very important point

and as as John began to allude to

earlier the original concept for the MKS

design was an extension of what we call

the speed trim system on the 737ng the

previous version of the 737 that is a

single sensor system that's been proven

safe in flight more than 200 million

flight hours so one of our safety

principles is to minimize change from

model to model that is a good standard

safety process that was the concept

behind the original M cast design now

what we've learned from both accidents

is that we made some mistakes there are

some things we can improve one of them

is this idea of going to a dual sensor

feed instead of single as well as

limiting MCATs to a single action or

activation during a flight those are

improvements that we've identified we

take responsibility for that we feel

responsible for our airplanes and we

know that there are some fixes that we

need to make we own that and we are

implementing those fixes going forward

as we discuss possible improvements to

the certification of aircraft would be

helpful for you to explain how safety is

supposed to be integrated into the

certification process from the initial

conception of the aircraft all the way

to flying at 30,000 feet filled with

passengers since these crashes we've

heard concerns about whether Boeing's

relationship with the FAA is too cozy

and we want a certification process that

is efficient and that promotes us

competitiveness but one that always

prioritizes safety so what would you say

to address the concerns that have been

raised about regulatory capture senator

I agree with the

in that area I would say that over the

last couple of decades the improvements

that have been made in aviation safety

are because of strong government

oversight that includes the work of this

committee it includes the the oversight

of the FAA the delegated authority

process as its structured we do think

has contributed to safety of the

industry I mentioned in my comments that

there's about a 95 percent improvement

in safety over the last two decades some

of that I believe is associated with the

delegated authority but we have to get

the balance right and I think it's very

important that we have strong government

oversight strong FAA oversight but we

also tap the technical depth that our

industry teams can bring to the table

that's the concept but if we need to

rebalance it if I fully support

evaluating that concept looking at the

details and making sure we've got the

ballot did you briefly explain very

briefly if you could how Boeing and the

FAA work together to certify aircraft

yeah senator I could but I think mr.

Hamilton here is a deeper expert on that

if I could ask him to take that question

it's really senator the FAA is actually

in control of a certification process

the whole time let me just kind of walk

you through the process very quickly

starts off by identifying the

requirements to certify the airplane

that is the sole authority of the FAA it

establishes the certification basis of

the airplane the second step is

identifying the methods of compliance to

those requirements so this is how you're

going to show that the airplane design

actually meets those requirements again

the FAA is the sole authority on that

they that's their action the third step

is doing the testing the analysis and

the documentation that demonstrates the

airplane meets those requirements and

that it's done by Boeing in our case or

the applicant and then there's a review

of those documents to validate that they

actually met the requirements and that

can be done by the FAA or the ODA who

acts as a designee of the FAA or it can

be a combination and finally there's an

oversight the FAA is oversight of the

actual you

members they do oversight of the ODA and

are you following the processes they do

oversight of did you find compliance as

they expected with the methods of

compliance and then they do systemic

oversight of entire system mr.

mellenburg how are you working to ensure

coming back this issue of safety that

employees who raise concerns even if

they inhibit your ability to get a

product to the market quickly are taken

seriously and that importantly those

concerns are raised to the top and not

brushed aside a senator in my role is

the CEO this company I take that

responsibility very seriously we have a

number of ethics hotline avenues that

our employees can use when it comes to

delegated authority in particular we

also have additional survey tools that

we deploy and we openly share that data

with the FAA and make improvements that

said again we know we can improve and

one of the areas that I've taken recent

action on is to restructure our safety

organization so we we have now created a

new safety organization a vice-president

Beth pastor reports to my chief engineer

who reports directly to me that safety

organization has responsibility for all

safety related accident investigations

our Oda process and also responding to

any employee concerns thank you sue

Thank You mr. chairman senator Klobuchar

Thank You mr. chairman and thank you to

Senator Cantwell I also want to give my

sincere sincere thanks to the people who

are here who lost their loved ones in

these two crashes I think you know you

are here not only for them and it must

be hard to hear all of these technical

issues when you think of your brother or

sister or father or mother or son or

daughter but I want you to know that we

want to get to the bottom of this and we

want to change this so I guess might I'd

start with where Senator Thune I was

going with the FAA and Boeing and this

relationship a recent Inspector General

report found that only 4% of airline

manufacturers employees

responsible for conducting the

certification we're certified by the FDA

that the FAA that they conducted

oversight the same report found that one

manufacturer proved about 95% of

certifications for their own aircraft

what can you tell us about the

percentage of certifications that boeing

conducts on its own aircraft senator I

can't answer that number off the top of

my head I don't know John if you have

them at nine I'd have to follow up yeah

okay

how many Boeing engineers both designed

systems for the company and then certify

those same systems for the FAA I'm just

trying to get at a safety check from the

outside so we have approximately a

thousand insuring you two members that

work not just in system what percentage

of them then certified the safety as

opposed to having the FAA certified the

same those are roughly a thousand you

know members that are acting on behalf

of the FAA to find compliance and that

but that's beyond just systems this

includes structures and propulsion so

it's across the whole airplane senator

just to clarify we have about 50,000

engineers at Boeing about a thousand of

them are what we call operate in this

area that John's referring to

unit members so these are members who

have the authority and the training okay

why don't we we'll follow up and I I am

trying to get at when the FAA steps in

and when you certify yourself and we'll

get that later

two months after mr. Fortner sent these

messages expressing safety concerns he

asked the FAA to remove mention of the

MCATs automated flight control feature

from the 737 max pilots flight manual

and training course change that the FAA

approved in 2017 notably Indonesia's

National Transportation Safety Committee

report on the Lion air crash confirms

that the pilots lack of knowledge of

MCAS was one of the key reasons for the

plane crash how frequently are new

automated systems left out of the manual

and training that you give to pilots

senator first of all one of the things

we've learned from both of these

accidents is that we

need to provide additional information

on em Casta pilots just just to give you

a context as we develop our training

manuals our idea is to provide training

on pilots so they can respond to the

effects of failures as opposed to trying

to diagnose failures that's a very

important distinction and so more

information in the training manuals is

not necessarily safer but we've as we

understand from both of these accidents

we need to provide more information on

em casts to enhance safety but we do try

to include information in the training

manuals it's acceptable to have pilots

flying planes without knowing about

these key automated flight systems

senator again our approaches is to train

pilots on the the effects of a failure

mode so in this case that the M casts

automation system when it fails it fails

in what we call a runaway stabilizer

uncommanded movement of the horizontal

tail that is is what's in the training

manual and we try to train pilots to

respond to the effect of the failure as

opposed to diagnosing let me let me move

on to two more quick things after these

terrible crashes have claimed 346 lives

do you think it makes sense for these

aircraft to be allowed to fly in some

countries and not others because the FAA

says each country can make its own

decision yeah well senator we we respect

the the jurisdiction of the regulatory

authorities around the world do you

think it's acceptable just say yes or no

senator that's up to the regulatory

authorities that's not a decision that

we can make we respect the authority of

the regulator okay

and you're saying the same thing against

I'm going to go with it yes while there

have been several factors that

contributed to the plane crashes one

that is particularly troubling was

highlighted in a recent article in The

Washington Post which found that the

lion air had a faulty angle-of-attack

sensor which gave pilots and airplane

systems unreliable information the day

before it crashed do you think that's a

problem and what steps can be taken to

change that senator in the in the case

of the angle-of-attack disagree alert we

got the implementation wrong

I mentioned in my comments up front that

we we made some mistakes we made a

mistake on that implementation once we

discovered it our engineering teams

quickly convened a safety review board

they confirmed that it wasn't an

operational safety issue and the FAA

subsequently concurred with that but

nonetheless we got the implementation

wrong and we've addressed the the faults

in the process we have fixed that and

the angle-of-attack disagree alert will

be standard implementation on all maxes

going forward Thank You senator

Klobuchar senator Fischer Thank You mr.

chairman I too would like to recognize

and offer my sympathies to the people

that are here today and the people who

are at home who have lost loved ones in

these crashes I hope that we can get

answers at this hearing and also in the

future so that these issues these

mistakes will not happen again and cause

future loss of life mr. mellenburg

the joint Authority's technical review

notes that Boeing made several other

changes to the 737 max that differ from

the earlier model such as structural

changes that would accommodate the new

engines that were planned on the plane

and other advanced technologies senator

Thune touched on this with the delegated

authority was Boeing delegated authority

over the certification of those changes

as well a senator I I can't answer that

question completely because as you

pointed out there were a number of

changes again those are done and

evaluated jointly with the FAA

you know John you want to comment on any

specifics there there's approximately 92

certification plans associated with the

max which encompass all the different

change to the airplane the FAA reviewed

approximately 80 of those initially and

are you are you looking into those

certification processes as part of your

review of the 737 max Thunder yes we are

I asked my board to set up an

independent review committee

headed by Admiral Jim vos Gianni about

five months ago and that committee did

its work provided inputs that were

acting on and with the other authorities

we're continuing to take a hard look at

that and we look forward to taking

action on those reports okay

also the joint Authority's technical

review included a recommendation that

states quote if any flight control

surface is used in a novel manner the

FAA should be directly involved this is

based on the observation that the FAA

was not completely unaware of MCAS but

because information and discussions

about M casts were so fragmented and

they were delivered to disconnected

groups within the process it was

difficult to recognize the impacts and

the implications of this system do you

agree that the communication between

Boeing and the FAA is fragmented to the

point that relevant information on M

Cass was not provided to the agency is

this what you were referring to and you

talked about getting the balance right

senator I think you raised some very

good points there I do think one of the

areas we can improve and we've seen it

in the Jay ATR report and others is

system-wide integration cross system

integration amongst the different

technical expertise areas and

improvements in documentation and

communication and again we found some

areas there where we could have should

have done better improve your

communication with the FAA senator I do

do you think the FAA has a

responsibility to also change its

process to improve communication senator

I believe I believe the FAA does but I

wouldn't say that's only the FAA is

responsibility we at Boeing need to make

some improvements in communication and

we own that and we're committed to doing

that the Boeing 737 airplanes are based

on a type certificate that was

originally provided in 1967 I believe

and it has been amended to address the

different 737 models

then that technical review notes that to

quote some elements of the design and

certification remain rooted in the

original 1967 certification of the

Boeing 737 - 100 is Boeing are the FAA

reviewed the elements of the 737 that

are based in the 1967 certification for

continued safety when new models of the

airplane are produced senator if I could

ask John to field that question this

under as you know the the there's a

single type certificate for the 737 but

as the design has evolved with each new

generation of airplanes the safety

standards on which the airplane is

designed to has have also evolved yes

there are some amendments that the

design might reference back to an

earlier amendment level but those may be

are likely changes that have not changed

in the family of airplanes since the

original design an example might be some

of the structural elements however we

have stepped up in many areas

voluntarily to later amendment levels to

demonstrate that it still meets the

latest standards in in compliance thank

you senator Fischer senator Blumenthal

Thank You mr. chairman and thank you to

both our witnesses to being here today

and thank you most important to the

relatives who have lost loved ones if

you could please stand so we could thank

you all thank you for being here if you

could just stand thank you end up good

if go ahead up and hold up the

photographs that you brought you've been

very kind - I was going to ask that you

hold up those photographs because I

understand that for security purposes

you can't

during the hearing but just for this

short period of time miss Muhlenberg so

thank you and if the timekeeper could

start soon - Blumenthal's

time over

thank you very much to the family

members senator Blumenthal thank you

very much mr. chairman mr. Muhlenberg as

I watched those loved ones stand and

frankly as I reviewed this file over the

past week or so again and as I sit here

today my anger has only grown these

loved ones lost lives because of an

accident that was not only preventable

as the chairman said at the very start

but was the result of a pattern of

deliberate concealment Bowen came to my

office shortly after these crashes and

said they were the result of pilot error

those pilots never had a chance these

loved ones never had a chance they were

in flying coffins as a result of Boeing

deciding that it was going to conceal em

casts from the pilots and the best

evidence is this message from Marc

Falkner saying in effect we're going to

conceal em Cass delete it from the from

the manual used in training when did you

become aware of the fact that M Cass was

not going to be included in the flying

manual senator first if a guy I could

express my my deep sympathies for the

you've done that and my time is limited

I apologize for interrupting you but I

want to know specifically when you

become became aware of this effort

senator I can't reference that email and

I'm not asking about the email you've

been asked about the email already

I'm asking you about Boeing policy as

reflected in this email it's chief test

pilot deciding he was going to mislead

pilots who were then going to take

passengers into the air these loved ones

and turn those planes into flying

coffins

senator I'm not sure what mr. Fortner

meant by that email I I can tell you

that certification and training

materials are not determined by one

individual well in fact let me just

interrupt you again in the over 1600

page original flight manual of Boeing

737 max the aircraft's new M cast

computer system was mentioned only once

once in 1,600 pages in the glossary of

abbreviated terms so when Boeing came to

us and they said it's the pilot

inexperienced pilots you were lying to

us as well

senator if I could try to respond to

your question first of all the the

premise that that we would lie or

conceal it's just not consistent with

our values well I know it's not

consistent with the values that are

you're articulating here but let me just

since my time is limited move on would

you agree that this system of

certification and oversight is

absolutely broken that's the lesson here

isn't it that Boeing lobbied the

Congress for more delegation and now we

have to reverse that delegation of

authority would you support those

legislative efforts senator again I I

support taking a hard look at the

delegator I'm not asking you for a hard

look I'm asking you for a commitment

here because you have the opportunity to

make things right senator I'm not

familiar with particular legislation but

now Cohen asked for working and

supporting going asked for the

legislation that exists right now will

you commit to supporting reform efforts

such as many of us on the

committee of advocating senator will

commit to participating in those reform

efforts and providing our inputs well I

agree that your input would be valuable

I'm looking for input in support of

reform that will stop outsourcing by the

FAA and I might just add the FAA has

been really disappointing and it's

disclosure to us this is an example of

the kind of disclosure the FAA has given

us total redaction I've asked for full

disclosure of documents the FAA has

failed to provide them I've asked for

the FAA to return my phone calls it's

failed to do so and I think the FAA is

part of this problem as well and it is

the result at the end of the day of

Boeing rushing this process I'm using

the Chairman's term putting profits over

safety rushing the certification process

with you in charge of that certification

and prioritizing speed and cost over

safety and my time has expired but the

folks who really deserve time here are

the people who lost loved ones and thank

you let's do this this poster is

entitled MCATs lives in both FCC's if

you can provide a copy of that we'll

admit it into the record at this point

without objection thank you and mr.

Hamilton me just ask you when it says

MCATs does live in both FCC's what what

does that mean sure certainly so briefly

the the MKS function is replicated in

the two flight control computers that

are on board the airplane and so each

flight control computer previously

received its input from one a Oh a

sensor on the left or right side in the

software changes we're making going

forward

now both flight control computers will

receive the data from both sensors

compare it and only if they agree they

like to be okay thank you suture Moran

mr. chairman Thank You mr. Mullen

did did you have you determined that the

failures that resulted in the tragic

consequences were they failures in the

policies and protocols that Boeing had

in place or was it a failure to comply

with those protocols and policies that

resulted in these consequences yeah

senator in some cases we relied on on

these long-standing industry standards

policies and certified to those and and

we're now raising questions around those

that gets back to this pilot response

time discussion that we had earlier in

in some cases we we missed on

implementation as I mentioned earlier

with the angle-of-attack sensor but

overall we did follow the certification

process and steps but nonetheless we've

we've learned from both of these

accidents and the the fixes that we need

to make are clear so the fixes are both

in policy and then making certain that

the policies are followed

once they're the new policies are in

place senator I believe that both are

true yes thank you

and I assume there's other certification

and just developments at Boeing that are

always ongoing have you changed your

behavior and/or policies for a

certification and development process

for other pieces of equipment other

aircraft that boeing is now proceeding

toward certification at senator we have

and we're going to continue to change we

as I said we have learned but we're

still learning I mentioned earlier the

change to our safety review board

structure that is a big substantive

change the stand up of our new safety

organization the realignment of our

engineering team those fifty thousand

engineers we're also taking a look at

some of those long-standing assumptions

behind how we design as we look at

next-generation products like the triple

7x as an example so we are taking a

comprehensive approach to those updates

as this committee looks certainly a

certification as we look at the FAA what

suggestions does Boeing have for this

committee

when you look at any policies or

failures at the FAA so the way I would

view this is we have two major

organizations involved in this process

one is the manufacturer Boeing the other

is the federal agency that is there to

certify my assumption is that neither

one did things right and what have you

learned about the FAA that we should

know as we look at the FAA now and in

the future senator we have a we have a

great deal of respect for the FAA I

personally worked with the FAA for many

years have a great deal of respect for

them and their professionals I know the

FAA is also taking a hard look at all of

the reports and inputs and

investigations and is committed to

making changes I think you've heard that

from Administrator Dixon if you have

suggestions what changes the FAA should

make senator I don't have specific

recommendations for you but we'd be glad

to follow up on that if it be useful

thank you

where are we now in the 737 max it seems

like every week there's a report that an

airline is going to believe they're

going to have that plane flying again or

that certification is is nearby yeah

what is the status senator we're in the

the final stage of the stages of the

process so we are currently testing the

final software updates when ready and

with the FAA s approval we'll proceed to

a certification flight in the near term

subsequent to that be the FAA s

responsibility to evaluate that and

issue an airworthiness directive that's

all work that we're proceeding on over

the next few weeks and and months but I

think it's important again that the

airplane will return to service when

it's safe right this is not going to be

timeline driven we are committed to

answering every question the regulators

have and the airplane will fly when

everyone is convinced it's safe that is

the most important thing here it it

troubles me that to get to that point I

is it certainly not that it's taking so

long I want the result that you just

described we want the right circumstance

before we're flying again but it

suggests to me that there were much more

significant problems with the max 37 if

it was previously certified and yet now

it takes so long it's something more

than just a glitch it's something more

than just a minor change that makes me

concerned about the process that allowed

it to be certified in the first place

what am I missing

senator I think you raised a very good

point

our initial effort early this year was

focused on the MKS updates that we've

already talked about around the middle

of the year as we were evaluating all of

the other inputs and data we identified

some additional safety enhancements that

we could make not something that was

required for certification but something

that we thought while the airplane was

was grounded was the right thing to do

and a safety enhancement and rather than

waiting to do that later after return to

service

we as a company and with the FAA decided

that we would take the extra time for

those additional software updates and

that's the work we've been doing through

the summer and into the fall that's

designed to add additional software

redundancies throughout the flight

control computers and that is the final

software we're testing what I want to

convey here is this is really the

culture of Boeing and I understand the

questions that are being raised but when

our teams find opportunity to improve

safety that goes to the top of the list

that's the top priority and if it takes

time it takes money to do that that's

where we're focused and and that's why

it's taking longer that I think some

anticipate I'd request your follow up on

your thoughts about the FAA thank you

thank you senator Moran senator Markey

senator Udall senator Peters Thank You

mr. chairman and let me begin also by

expressing my sympathies to those who

lost loved ones in the two 737 max

crashes and I'd like to thank the

families that are that are here today

for your continued attention to safety

and for working to prevent future

tragedies like we saw here over the

years our

aviation system has become the safest in

the world but these tragedies certainly

remind us that we cannot rest safety

cannot be taken for granted there is no

doubt from what we've been hearing in

the testimony here today that

this technology becomes increasingly

complex the bait about how to move

forward can't be simply about a

one-size-fits-all regulatory regime

versus a let the free market just police

itself type of approach I believe a new

paradigm may need to be developed to

address the the regulatory challenges

associated with very complex technology

and that's something this committee

needs to weigh in very heavily and too

as we as we move forward mr. Rotenberg

as you know the the BP oil disaster in

the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 workers

lasted 87 days and cost upwards of sixty

five billion dollars and in the wake of

that disaster it was revealed that the

oil and gas industry had lobbied for the

reduced safety precautions that could

have prevented that disaster we often

hear in Congress about how much

regulations cost industry however

thoughtful regulation plays an

incredibly important role in protecting

the public so I'm curious if Boeing's

view on oversight has changed in the

wake of this tremendous human tragedy as

well as the cost that this company is

facing right now is your view change

you've talked in earlier in response to

an earlier question about having a

balance clearly something is wrong with

that balance please let me know if your

thoughts have changed recently senator

my thoughts have have changed we have

learned lessons from these two accidents

and the families that are here with us

today the pictures we saw they're

heartbreaking they remind us of the

importance of the work we do and the the

paramount importance on safety that's

what makes this industry great and

strong oversight is part of the fabric

of our industry always has been and I

think this should give us pause to take

take a hard look at that well I heard

the hard look you said we need to look

at the balance as the balance gone too

far - allowing industry to police itself

senator I don't know if I can

characterize it that way my sense

is that will have the same objective

here we all want the safest industry

possible that is our our objective and

my sense is that we could look at the

balance that there are refinements that

would be worthy I think you know

technology you think it's out of balance

now he's based on what happened here do

you think we we have to just take a look

at it but seriously understand that the

balance is I may be out of whack if we

delegate too much to industry and don't

have a impartial eyes and make sure the

regulatory regime is sufficient that you

truly have impartial eyes looking at

these factors but it's gonna save lives

and you won't put a company through the

cost that you have you when you balance

those regulations is it out of balance

right now yes or no as Senator again I

think it can be improved I I completely

agree with you on the importance of

strong oversight yeah I've worked in

this industry for more than three

decades from airplanes to spacecraft

people's lives depend on what we do and

and strong oversight from the government

is a key to our our successful the

safety of our industry so I think we

have a shared objective there and we

will we will work with you on examining

any improvements we can make we have a

mutual interest mr. Rob Lurie the NTSB

report indicated that the FAA and

industry have historically used highly

trained test pilots to verify the safety

of new aircraft models rather than

average pilots who typically have less

experience does Boeing use pilots with

average training and experience senator

our Boeing test pilots are experienced

highly qualified pilots we work with

with Airlines the FAA the regulators to

bring other pilots in from around the

world as part of the evaluation but I

think as you're pointing out as we look

to the future again we want to make sure

that the testing we're doing is

representative of the of that future

pilot population thank you thank you

Souter Peters senator Caputo Thank You

mr. chairman I thank the ranking member

as well

I want to say first of all to the

families who are here my extending my

sympathies but also my gratitude for you

coming forward through your pain to

bring to us to Congress which is not an

easy thing to do your frustrations and

and and probably stronger feelings and

the loss of your loved ones I will say

that when Colgan flight 3407 went down

in Buffalo in in the early 2009 the

families that came forward to us I was

on Transportation Committee and the

House side made such an incredible

impact and it's made flying on our

regional airlines much much safer

because of that so hopefully that's that

will be what what the result of this is

for you today and for all of us mr.

mellenburg particular attention has been

called to the fact that Boeing later in

the development process of the Mac's

revised the range of flight conditions

that could lead to activation of the

MCATs

but that Boeing did not notify the FAA

of these changes at the time this is

troubling if in fact this is true was

Boeing not obligated by the FF FAA to

report changes like the ones I just

described as Senator I believe you're

referring to the low-speed extension of

M kes and I've seen those same reports

but they do not reflect the the facts

the extension of M cast slow speeds was

done in a rigorous way it was done in a

very visible way there was testing done

on that from the mid 2016 timeframe to

the early 2017 timeframe including

flight tests including flight tests with

the FAA on board the FAA was aware of

the low-speed extension and ultimately

certified that and I believe FAA

leadership has published publicly stated

so that's an it's a false report then I

believe it's a false report

I believe the low speed extension was

fully certified with the FAA okay

another report that's been out in the

media and among is that after the second

flight went down that boeing actually

actively lobbied the faa to keep the

planes in the air can you respond to

that

senator could you just clarify your

question sir after the second plane went

the Ethiopian air went down that there

was quite several countries had

expressed a had a limited the flight of

the of that plane we had not done that

yet in the United States there's media

reports that Boeing was actively

lobbying the FAA to keep the planes in

the air at that time in this country is

that true senator let me let me clarify

what was happening in that timeframe did

you make it brief please yes we

immediately after that accident reached

out to the FAA and right other

regulatory authorities to understand

what happened in the accident what has

made aviation safe is that we make

decisions based on data at that point we

didn't have data and so we with the FAA

we're looking to understand what

happened there were early reports that

the airplane had some kind of a

low-speed low altitude problem that

turned out to be incorrect

so we with the FAA were pursuing data to

make a good safety based decision that

was our position with the FAA when data

became available satellite data that was

referred to in the media again with the

FAA we came to a conclusion that there

could be similarities between the two

accidents and that led very quickly to a

decision to ground the fleet well I

think you know in retrospect I think it

was pretty obvious and I don't want to

say conclusively so but there's a

problem and a consistent problem the

other thing that's really bothered me

about this whole thing and I questioned

this and they'll and the last committee

hearing that we haven't between the Lion

Air client crash and the Ethiopian air

crash it defies logic to me that some of

these folks who wrote emails or sent

text messages did not come to you and to

the expertise of the engineering of

these engines and and of these planes

and say this is what we were talking

about why was there any reaction at all

like that within your company after the

lion air crash and I don't tell me

because you didn't have the official

report that would

maybe saved those people in that

Ethiopian air point senator I think

about that decision over and over every

day and if we knew everything back then

that we know now we would have made a

difference okay the question then didn't

people come to you at the highest levels

at any level and say wait a minute this

is sounding familiar sir

well senator after the first accident we

we convened our broad technical team

across Boeing it wasn't any single

individuals or a small team it was a

broad team we brought all those experts

to bear trying to assemble data from the

accident understanding what occurred we

quickly with the FAA issued a an

operational bullet to our bulletin to

remind everyone of the training and the

emergency scenario that around that

particular system around what we called

runaway stabilizer which again it was

the effect of that system and at the

same time we began work on an EM cast

software update in that timeframe so the

interest yes Thank You mr. chairman just

one point of clarification are you

saying mr. Muhlenberg the FAA did know

about the 2.5 trim not 0.6 but 2.5 the

FAA knew about that yes senator you're

referring to the the low-speed extension

which is the two point five degree trim

yeah that is the low-speed extension the

FAA did know about that Thanks

participated senator udall Thank You mr.

chairman and thank you to the ranking

member for having this hearing and mr.

Muhlenberg you know I first want to say

to all the people that stood up that I'm

very moved by you being here and the

your losses are very very I think

heartfelt across the committee here and

you know the thing that really bothers

me is knowing that it's preventable it

makes it even more outrageous that we

haven't made the kind of dramatic

changes that I want to talk to the CEO

here about mr. Muhlenberg you showed

some emotion

when these folks stood up and everything

what should come from that emotion is

some action to do something to really

make a difference and for this committee

to coalesce around the solution that's

really going to move us forward would

require you to step forward and

specifically say what you support and I

haven't seen you do that in all the

questioning you've been asked over and

over again what would you support I mean

it's absolutely clear that it's too cozy

a relationship with the FAA and your

airline and so what is it you're gonna

commit to specifically in terms of

reform that's why you're up here and

that's what we want to see you do is to

weigh in with us this is what would make

a difference this is what would make it

safer this is what would make sure that

we don't lose the passengers like this

in the future or the nor the crew

senator while I respectfully don't agree

with the characterization of coziness

with the FAA we respect the independent

oversight of the FAA and and that's very

important to us from a safety principle

standpoint we have taken a number of

internal actions that we think are

meaningful as they relate to our own

internal reforms on safety we are

engaged in the legislative process and

Senator I I appreciate your invitation

for us to to be involved in that I know

there are many stakeholders as you heard

from me earlier we are committed to

strong oversight in the aerospace

industry it's part of what makes this

the system safe we have a shared

objective and if there are things we can

do to make it better we will I don't

know if John if you have any specific

Thank You senator you know I would say

that you know one of the big issues was

we made you use an industry standard

assumption on pilots and how they would

react and that proved incorrect in these

two accidents so in terms of things that

I think we need to change the FAA is we

need to go revisit some of these or get

Tory guidances and make sure that

they're up to date I would even

tell you there's probably some

regulations that we advocated as part of

the FAA reauthorization bill 10

regulations said FAA should work with

industry to update based on technology

that's out there today well but in terms

of hosting us I used to be the lead

administrator for the OTA and I can tell

you that we have a respectful

relationship with the FAA but we do have

our differences of opinion sometimes but

we discussed those we work it out on

what how we're going to comply and it

it's not a cozy relationship it's a it's

a professional relationship it's a

relationship that didn't work for the

consumers in this and for your employees

that went down in those flights you and

others in your company blamed the

deceased pilots and the culture of the

countries where the crashes occurred for

the accidents but from what we've seen

in the last year since the first crash

it appears that Boeing's own culture is

more blame worthy for installing a

faulty system that resulted in too many

deaths and could have caused more this

culture starts at the top and that's why

I've been asking you for the specifics

of what you support and I hope after

this hearing you will come forward and

when there's legislation out there say

this is gonna make it better and come up

here and spend some time to build the

consensus to get this done because I I

think the large powerful interests that

are a part of this don't want any reform

they want you to tinker around like

you're talking about but they don't want

to see any reform if Boeing could not

guarantee that pilots were prepared to

fly these jets your company should not

have sold them did anyone at Boeing

question hesitate or raise any issues

prior to selling the 737 max eight with

this software to Lyon air or Ethiopian

air senator first we we look forward to

responding to your your request there

and providing inputs on the on their

reforms to your question we do rely on

the on the airlines and the regular

taury authorities around the world as

part of this integrated system to make

sure we're fielding airplanes and crews

that can fly safely I do think it's

important for me to clarify a point that

you made earlier we have not blamed the

pilots and I know that's been reported

but that is not our company position and

it never will be

we are responsible for our airplanes we

are responsible and we own that

regardless of cause any accident with

one of our airplanes is unacceptable

well that's gonna change is welcome but

that that about the culture went out

from your company early on Thank You mr.

chairman Thank You senator Udall let's

do this at this point mr. mellenburg

that the jeder

published 12 main recommendations will

we'll both of you get back to us on the

record and tell you Boeing's position

with regard to these 12 recommendations

senator we will thank you senator Markey

is next Thank You mr. chairman let me

begin by recognizing the families who

lost so much on this flight many of you

are here today including Michael Stu Moe

and Nadia Miller on the parents of Samia

Stu Moe University of Massachusetts

Amherst graduate and a resident of

Sheffield Massachusetts who was

tragically killed on the ethiopian

flight the losses that of the stumail

family and all of the families suffered

is absolutely inexcusable and we will

remember that as we are moving forward

in the drafting of legislation we will

do it in the memory of your families one

thing is clear to make sure that safety

is our top top priority is to guarantee

that every aviation safety measure is

built into every plane and that it is

never for sale unfortunately our current

laws only prevent aircraft manufacturers

from like Boeing from selling critical

safety elements for an additional price

existing rules allow companies to charge

extra but non-critical safety enhancing

features and bowing actually does charge

more for those technologies the 737 max

aircraft involved in the Indonesian and

Ethiopian crashes lacked to to safety

enhancing features an angle of attack

indicator and a disagree light both of

these technologies would have helped the

pilots recognize the faulty sensor

readings were causing the planes

automated flight control system to push

the aircraft's nose down towards the

ground with that knowledge the pilots

may have been able to take more

effective action to prevent these

crashes in fact the Indonesian crash

report released last week specifically

cited the lack of a disagree like on the

737 max as contributing to the lion air

tragedy shamefully the law allows Boeing

to treat these safety technologies as a

Lockett add-ons that airlines can obtain

only by paying an extra fee a la Cotte

add on safety not like XM radio all

leather seats on a plane

safety is a la Cotte safety is an added

on feature these tragic crashes have

made it all too clear that there should

not be any distinction between critical

and non-critical safety enhancing

features and that's why I've introduced

my safety is not for sale legislation my

bill will require aircraft manufacturers

like Boeing to offer I'll provide any

technology that measurably enhances

safety without an additional charge to

airline carriers if you believe that

that safety should never be for sale the

question is why was it now you've seemed

to now recognize that the disagree light

should be standard but you have yet to

say the same thing about the angle of

attack indicator and whether or not that

should be offered for free all whether

or not each airline should be given the

option of not building it into the plane

for free so

I think your you have to make a decision

here in terms of where you're going to

go because otherwise you're disagree

light is still on coming from Boeing

towards these safety features so I want

first of all to have you answer whether

or not you according to The Wall Street

Journal you agree that Boeing did not

originally include the disagree light on

the 737 even though the same technology

was standard on prior models of

airplanes is that correct

a senator feel they need to respond to

your earlier point about selling safety

we don't sell safety that that is not

our business model and I do want to

clarify your your points on the angle of

attack indicator that is a system that

we have offered as an option to Airlines

some airlines don't want it it's it's

not necessarily a safety improvement it

actually takes up space on the flight

deck displays and more information on

the displays is not necessarily safer so

that is not a safety feature on the

angle of attack disagree no I'm saying

you should not offer it for a price you

should give the option to the airline

without any price attachment do you

agree to do that senator yes and in fact

we've already announced that the angle

of attack disagree alert will be on all

Macs airplanes going forward standard

and the angle of attack indicator will

be available as an optional dollar so

given given your stated support for the

principle behind my legislation will you

support my legislation that ensures that

you offer to provide any technology that

measurably enhances safety without an

additional fee to analyze would you

agree to support that legislation

senator I haven't seen the specific

legislation I think the principle around

focusing on safety as a top priority is

I agree with that and it's a worthy

principle and I'd ask if we could take a

look at at legislate he's just reward is

free to an airline for anything that

measurably impact safety do you agree

yeah we don't sell safety and that's not

our business model

thank you Thank You senator Markey

searcher Duckworth Thank You mr. Thank

You mr. chairman

so I'm gonna try to put some of the

issues here into layman's terms I went

to first of course my sincere

condolences to the families who are here

but also to the families in Ethiopia and

in Indonesia who are watching this

hearing and we'll be watching this

hearing

I don't speak amharic but for the

Indonesians kepada cleric Loran Cohen

young Dan orin orin Indonesia selamat

datang dan saya ingin member tau and

Abajo kami senator akan sebenarnya

manually Deacon Pena Bob tried to deter

me and what I just said was we will as

senators get to the bottom of this

tragedy and we will continue to

investigate this we will not stop

because you see Boeing sells its

aircraft to the world and we in America

have a well well own reputation as

leaders in aviation in the world and I

want us to reach that shining example

once again pilots know that tragedies

don't occur in a vacuum catastrophic

outcomes result in long succession of

failures that often overwhelm the pilots

at the control of the aircraft we call

it in aviation the accident chain and

there are many links an accident chain

that must happen that it eventually

overwhelms the pilots a new result in

the crash many of these links an

accident chain happened with Boeing and

your decisions in the development of the

end of the 737 max so let me talk about

what has happened here

you put a sensor on the inside their

coverage is standard but you allow that

sensor to override the pilots input in

this system so in every other 737

aircraft there is the function of the

you can pull back the the pilot to cut

out and that will override that

uncommanded nose-down attitude that is

standard that is the basic assumption as

you put and as you said you use an

industry standard on how a pilot would

react because to a malfunction like that

I command it nose down every pilot

including helicopter pilots you pull

back but what

you did we should put an M cast system

into an aircraft you didn't tell that

pilots that this M cast system was in

there and you put in a function in order

to M cast to work the way you want it to

work after the pilot does two

uncommanded reaction to the uncommanded

nose down in every other 737 cut out

that's the end of it in the end the 737

max after five seconds their system

resets and it pushes the nose right back

down the pilots had exactly three

seconds to pull nose down pull up now we

got to do a new procedure that did not

exist in previous 737 models which is

the electronic cutout switch because you

have now put into a system that

overrides the pilot in command of that

aircraft so you've been telling this

committee that yes you use basic pilot

reactions that is true but you've not

been telling this committee the whole

truth time and again this is my

frustration boeing has not told the

whole truth to this committee and to the

families and to the people looking at

this yes the pilots did exactly what

they were supposed to do but five

seconds later especially if that sensor

is still stuck it overrides what the

pilot does and it pushes the nose right

back down again three seconds the pilots

best friend is time and altitude and on

takeoff there is no altitude and it's

got no time you set those pilots up for

failure and when I sent you a letter

asking you to answer several questions

it took Boeing over five months to

respond to my question I only got the

answers the day before you and I met and

one of the questions I asked was what

date did Boeing discover that a stock

angle-of-attack veined would result in

MKS issuing persistent commands with

unlimited authority to trim the airplane

nose down in layman's terms if this vein

is stuck MCATs will continue to provide

faulty directions and will keep pushing

that nose down over and over and over

again no matter how many time and

experience 737 pilot pulls back on the

yoke five seconds later reset nose back

down

you know in 2016 you knew in 2016 that

this was happening and your team at

Boeing decided we didn't need to fix

that because of well understood piloting

techniques and procedures but the

problem is that well under supply

lifting technique and procedures is to

pull back and that's it but you added

something else you put in a system and

you didn't tell pilots about and then

you put in an override by resetting the

system five seconds later boeing is the

company that built the flying fortress

that saved Europe

I remember watching b-17s fly overboard

above the it is a story aircraft that it

has rescued the free world and yet you

knew about these problems and you

continue to put them into system the

system into place and when we asked you

about to answer these questions you have

told this committee and you've told me

half-truths over and over again

including in that meeting this is why I

am so upset you've not told us the whole

truth and these families are suffering

because of it Thank You senator

Duckworth members of the committee at

this point senator Scott is deferring

his time to the chairman of the

subcommittee senator Cruz you're

recognized sir for five minutes

Thank You mr. chairman mr. mellenburg I

I have to say the testimony here today

has been quite dismayed I want to focus

on the text exchange that has been

referred to and has been publicly

reported on this was a text exchange

between mark Forkner who was then

Boeing's technical pilot for the Mac's

chief technical pilot for the Mac's and

mr. Gustafson who in 2018 was promoted

to being Boeing's

737 chief technical pilot is that right

I believe that's the case senator yeah

so this exchange

is stunning mr. Forkner Oh shocker alert

em Cass is now active down to m2 it's

running rampant in the sim on me at

least that's what Vince thinks it's

happening gusterson's responds oh great

that means we have to update the speed

trim description and volume two mr.

Faulkner so basically I lied to the

regulator's unknowingly Gusterson it

wasn't a lie no one told us that was the

case Fork nur I'm leveling off at like

4,000 feet two hundred and thirty knots

and the plane is trimming itself like

crazy I'm like what Gusterson that's

what I saw and sim1

but on approach I think that's wrong

fourtner granted I suck at flying but

even this was egregious that exchange

describes what happened in Lion air and

Ethiopian air the men and women who are

gathered here with the photos of your

loved ones three hundred and forty six

people are dead because what these chief

pilots described as egregious and crazy

that's their language that's Boeing's

internal language in this exchange now

what I find truly stunning boeing handed

this exchange over to the Department of

Justice in February in March I chaired a

hearing of the aviation subcommittee on

these two crashes Boeing did not see fit

to give this committee that exchange

nor did Boeing give it to the FAA or the

Department of Transportation but what I

find most stunning is your testimony

here today that you said you first learn

to this exchange a couple of weeks ago

these are senior leaders at Boeing in

exchange saying and I will quote again

so I basically lied to the regulator's

look I practice law a lot of years you

had your lawyers look over this document

and they read a senior leader after

these crashes has occurred saying they

lied to the regulator's mr. Muhlenberg

how in the hell did nobody bring this to

your attention in February when you

produce this a Department of Justice how

did you just read this a couple of weeks

ago senator again to clarify my earlier

comments I was made aware of the

existence of this kind of document this

issue as part of that discovery process

in the investigation early in the year

as you pointed out at that point I

counted on my council to handle that

appropriately and did you read this

exchange that look I was made aware

documents were being produced that is

passive voice and and disclaiming

responsibility you're the CEO the buck

stops with you did you read this

document and how did your team not put

it in front of you run in with their

hair on fire saying we got a real

problem here how did that not happen and

what does that say about the culture at

Boeing if they didn't give it to you and

you didn't read it it if you didn't say

I want to read and see what happened

your testimony here earlier today is

well we're not sure what they were

talking about because he's not at Boeing

anymore how did you not in February set

out a 9 alarm fire to say we need to

figure out exactly what happened not

after all the hearings not after the

pressure but because 346 people have

died and we don't want another person to

die Thunder as you mentioned I didn't

see the details of this exchange until

recently and we're not quite sure what

mr. Fortner meant by that exchange his

his lawyer has suggested he was talking

about a simulator that was in

development in that time period

that's where he

working that could be the case we don't

know I fully support diving deep into

this and understanding what he said and

what he meant but I could also tell you

that in that same timeframe where his

original message was made mr. Gustafson

still works at Boeing corrector he yes

he does have you had that conversation

with it

sundar my team has talked with Patrick

as well have you had that conversation

with it sundar right I have not thank

you thank you senator Cruz senator

tester all right let's do this

the entire post for senator Cruz if you

can have that reduced in size and we

will enter into the record

without objection at this point so

ordered there's your tester Thank You

mr. chairman I want to thank you and the

ranking member for having this hearing

and I know for the two folks on the

panel this morning it was probably a

painful morning for you but the fact is

it's infinitely more painful for the

folks that are sitting a couple rows

behind you you have said many times mr.

Mullin burger that mistakes were made

and obviously they were unfortunately

that admission was made after 346 people

died and there are a lot of reasons an

airplane can go down whether it's a

pilot air weather equipment malfunction

or birds but safety should not be one of

them

and in a previous question you said you

guys don't sell safety and I'll be

honest with you I didn't listen to the

whole thing but you damn well better

sell safety I fly four legs a week and

there's a lot not for the grace of God

it could have been me on one of those

airplanes and we expect we expect there

to be safety obviously something went

wrong and it's not the first time

there's the MCAS of a situation here

that was pointed out as several people

on this committee have already pointed

out to you

and nothing was done or to your

leadership team there was a South

Carolina whistle blow that talked about

de de breeze being debris being left in

the planes they were those technicians

were removed there's a kc-46 finding

wrench bolts and trash inside a new

airplane so that was in June of this

year there was a cargo 777 you get the

deal it goes on and and so the question

is the one that Senator Udall brought up

that you didn't answer and I think other

people in this committee also brought it

up and that is what do we do what do you

do so I'll be a little more specific I

do believe there's a cozy relationship

and I don't believe that quite frankly

time and money are no object because

there's also plenty of examples for

example in 2014 FAA made regulatory

changes to safety standards that would

have required changes the max2 add new

crew alerts Boeing appealed it to the

FAA for seek an exemption arguing there

would cost too much money 10 billion

dollars which was a lot of money but the

truth is is that it wouldn't happen if

FAA would have been doing their job and

it also wouldn't have happen if you

would have known what the hell is going

on so my question is is that and I know

there was a push a number of decades ago

about privatization of federal

government and I think that's how we got

here is privatization of government but

why don't we just turn over the

certification back to the FAA and let

them do it and then they would be the

one sitting at this desk a day and not

you why not do that

well senator we share we share your

focus on safety and I can I can

confidently say that that is our

number-one priority okay cool but we've

failed in this case and there's a whole

bunch of people back there that are

going through incredible anguish because

we failed sit senator I I agree and and

we we feel so Elizabeth let's get our

question and look there's I can pivot

with the best of them I know how to

pivot I know when people are pivoting

you're pivoting tell me if you would

port having the FAA do the certification

senator we believe that delegated

authority process that we have today

that has contributed to improve safety

over the last two decades okay I

mentioned earlier we are open to

improving it but the idea that we can

tap the deep technical expertise of our

companies across the aerospace industry

is a valuable part of the certification

process but the FAA is the certification

Authority and should be and should

continue to be well but but but they

really aren't the truth is is you can

say that they have the ultimate

responsibility but the truth is if the

issues aren't flagged by the ODA but are

your people by your people doing the

certification the FAA never does it

because quite frankly it would cost some

more money to have the FAA do the

certification and by the way it's cost

you money so we could charge you for

that certification to help pay for it so

it would have no reflection on the

taxpayers so the question becomes I'm

gonna tell you what when when when the

FAA says you didn't need to do this and

you come in and say no you don't need to

do this it's fine if nothing happens but

when 350 people die we got a problem

and he bring up the point that senator

Cruz brought up that there was plenty of

information out there on this and

nothing was done and so so the whole

thing about it you know when it comes to

safety time and money or no object is

not the record certainly doesn't show

that Senator I understand your points

and criticism and I think it's true that

we operate in a very competitive world

and we are the only large airplane

commercial airplane maker left in the

United States we do have competitive

pressures around the world but I can

also tell you that never takes

precedence over safety but it does this

model look at airplanes I think it

absolutely could be argued that it did

in this case and and I heard senator

Duckworth questions and Boeing has had

an incredibly valuable name

but I I've got to tell you and I think I

told you guys this in office some time

ago I would walk before I was to get on

a 737 max I would walk there's no way

and the question becomes when issues

like this happen it costs your company

huge and so you shouldn't be cutting

corners and icy corners being cut and

this committee is gonna have to do

something to stop that from happening

Thank You mr. chairman Thank You senator

tester I'm gonna ask that mr. Muhlenberg

answer on the record his opinion of the

current bode a system whether it should

be modified an answer to Senator testers

question senator Johnson a mr. chairman

let me add my condolences to the

surviving family members and friends of

the victims of these tragedies and mr.

Muhlenberg among many failures that

strikes me there are two primary

failures first and foremost in the

original design and certification

process and then secondly in the

reaction after the first crash well

let's concentrate on those two things

tell me if I'm getting this right the

737 very successful airframe new more

fuel-efficient engines were available

and so you wanted to include that in an

upgrade of that airframe correct new

fuel efficient engines and some other

enhancements and those fuel efficient

engines create a different air dynamic

for that aircraft correct that's correct

is the EM caste systems that a standard

type of automatic pilot type of software

system on planes is that is that pretty

standard to have something like that

senator the the MKS system that we have

on the max is unique to that airplane so

it was it was put in there specifically

because you added a different type of

engine to a known error successful

airframe which made that less stable and

requires some kind of state as you call

today run run away stabilizing system

senator if I can clarify that the the

737 family has a system called the speed

trim system and the M Casson is an

extension of that system that's unique

for the max but but even unique because

of that added engine design

we tailor the the the software of each

one of our airplanes so that they

optimize the handling qualities for the

unique airplane configuration but again

going into the introduction of this 737

Matz you realize that that airframe was

changed because those engines and

required this mcat system for

stabilization that was one of the

additions we made to create the handling

qualities we wanted for the pilots we

also made some changes to things like

the the vortex generators on the wing so

it's an integrated solution to create

again you are well aware that this

design change created something that

required an AM cast system so now

fast-forward you have you have the lion

air tragedy according to senator Cruz

the email that he sent up there which I

believe was written on November 15 2016

just a couple weeks after that lion air

crash there are people it sure appears

in some in Boeing that knew exactly or

certainly suspected what went wrong

because they integrated in the design

you had an EM cast system to take care

of this this eventualities the flight

characteristic wrecked the senator again

I'm I'm not exactly sure what was meant

by that traffic that email traffic but I

can tell you in that timeframe it seems

pretty obvious doesn't it I mean doesn't

it mean doesn't seem pretty obvious I

mean again you you are eros I mean you

are engineers you understand how this

was designed you understood you needed

an EM cast system to make up for that

instability and then something happened

pretty well I would think diagnosed

pretty fast I mean again I'm reading

these things I'm not a pilot I'm not an

aerospace engineer and yet I'm

scratching my head going whoa

something really wrong happened you know

a whole lot why didn't you react faster

well senator completely separate from

that email traffic and what it might

mean our team very quickly after the

lion air accident assembled with the

regulators we evaluated the data from

the accident we saw that M Cass was

involved and and so we began to take

quick action immediately it doesn't have

to do with

email that that's not relevant to that

discussion

our team was immediately identified

which is exactly my point the fact that

it took another tragedy to actually

ground the airplane so you could

actually have a true a fix that worked

is I think really what's on the table

here and the diagnosis is why why didn't

we react why didn't we ground that

aircraft a lot sooner still another

tragedy wouldn't happen and senator we

have asked that question over and over

and and you know if we knew everything

back then that we know now we would have

made a different decision the the

decision that was made on that at that

point with the data we had we quickly

convened a safety review board the FAA

coming out of that confirmed the

continuing air worthiness of the

airplane and and issued that officially

that was the safety case that was built

but senator as you point out we've we've

learned from the second accident and if

we could go back we would have made a

different decision and and we have

learned we are making those improvements

to M casts and that's where our focus is

going forward well Boeing is an

important company it's important for our

economy I want to see you get this right

but you have you have to properly

diagnosis you have to accept its

responsibility for what happened so you

we actually can make those those changes

both in within Boeing also within the

FAA Thank You mr. chairman thank you

senator Johnson senator Rosen thank you

and I want to thank all the families

that are here today who have lost their

most precious loved ones their deaths

should not be in vain and we all have to

do every bit of our part together to

make sure that we prevent future

tragedies from happening and in order to

honor the memories of these 346 Souls

and the empty chairs that they will

leave behind this Thanksgiving and

Christmas and on and on and on and so

you said additional information wasn't

available I want to touch a little bit

on MKS and Brazil according to news

reports when the Brazilian National

Civil Aviation Aviation agency

came to the US and 2017 to test out the

max eight they determined that changes

made to the old 737 were significant

enough that they needed much more

information from Boeing and we're going

to provide it for their pilots when they

eventually published their pilot

training requirements they were

therefore able to flag the EM Cass is

one of the changes the pilots needed to

take into consideration when flying the

max eight and yet for United States

pilots mmm Cass wasn't mentioned in

their manual so mr. mellenburg why was

this information not flagged for your

other customers who had 737 maxes in

their fleet did you prevent your company

from sharing these differences to other

regulatory bodies or operators I have

here the Brazilian manual they decided

their pilots should learn this and why

wouldn't you provide it to the United

States pilots senator I I can't comment

on the details of the Brazilian document

John maybe be able to but let me more

broadly make the point that that's

exactly how the process is is supposed

to work we provide information we we

evaluate with the with the regulator's

in the various jurisdictions what should

be included in the training we have no

desire to hide features of the airplane

that pilot back to you and it was

significant enough for them to put this

in their manual then why wouldn't you

consider that it was a significant

change in senator I understand your

point and that was a decision that was

made in Brazil again I'm not familiar

with the with the details of that one

but the discussion you just ask you this

question then moving forward will you

commit to making it a practice when

other countries are clearly paying

attention enough to make significant

changes to their pilot manuals based on

major operational changes that Boeing

will send these notifications of changes

to the other users of these aircraft so

at least they have the opportunity to

train their pilots you didn't you deny

them the opportunity sir senator we are

committed to sharing that information

and

it's part of our international

collaboration but I also want to note

again that the discussion around MCAS

training and whether it would be

included in the training manuals that

was an active iterative discussion with

the FAA and it was a decision made based

on safety again we try to put

information in the training manuals that

focuses on the effects of failures and

things that will be valuable to the

pilots and it's not always the case that

more information adds to safety although

in this case we understand this and this

is one of the additions going forward

there's no thought had added to their

safety but I want to touch a little bit

on senator Fisher the question that she

raised earlier all these changes have

taken place of course over the years and

this plane is still working off its

original certification from 1967 this is

despite despite the fact that pilots

have told me that the max eight is in no

way functionally similar to the original

737 that took to the skies 52 years ago

I said in the last hearing that we had

seems to me like there's been so many

significant modifications it's almost as

if you took a canoe and tuned turned it

into a cruise ship

so mr. Hamilton can you tell us how many

derivative certificates Boeing has

received for the 737 since initially

being certified over 50 years ago

senator I I don't have the exact number

in my head it's approximately at 14 but

14 or 814 I'm sorry 14 derivative 14 Joe

but let me take the action to follow up

with on that yeah thank you I appreciate

that and the last thing I'm going to ask

do you believe that the 737 max is

functionally the same plane that was

certified in 1967 senator as I mentioned

to the earlier senator safety standards

have evolved as the airplane has evolved

and one of the important things I think

to understand is what's really important

also is for the pilots as they

transition from an earlier version of

the 737 to the newer version

that the airplane behaves it handles in

the same way that was important from a

handling characteristics standpoint and

an important enough for Brazil dimension

but not for us with respect to that

Center so there is a joint operation

evaluation board that determines the

training but other regulators can

determine what train they want to do

above and beyond

based on their information I don't know

the specifics of the Brazilian document

that you're referencing I we can follow

up on that thank you thank you thank you

senator Rosen senator blunt thank you

thank you chairman so small Berg I don't

want to absolve you from both the

opportunities and responsibilities to go

back and look at that long question from

Senator tester and answer it for the

record but for now one of the sources

one of the central thoughts in that

question was should why shouldn't we

change this process and go back to where

it's no longer cooperative where the FAA

takes full responsibility given the

answer to that should this process be

changed where the federal government is

fully responsible with employees only

hired by the federal government what

impact would that have on safety to you

senator I believe the the data clearly

shows that creation of the delegated

authority process and its implementation

as to enhance safety over the last

couple of decades I mentioned earlier

about a 95 percent improvement in

aviation safety over the last couple of

decades I think a portion of that at

least can be attributed to the delegated

authority process that doesn't mean we

should refine it reform it over time but

the fundamental process of strong

government oversight combined with deep

industry technical knowledge in the

right balance is a strong saftey process

and I firmly believe that's one of the

things that's contributed to aviation

safety and that process demands

oversight and we are fully supportive of

strong oversight but we also fully

support the idea of tapping deep

industry technical

expertise and that combination is the

safest combination and what what do you

think the view of the industry

technicians is their responsibility

there you think they feel the right

level of both responsibility and

liability of providing the information

that they need to provide senator they

do and I can tell you that's the culture

of our company and I respect the the

comments that were made today and the

questions have been raised about our

culture we deserve the scrutiny but I've

been at this company for 34 years I know

the people of Boeing you all know the

people of Boeing these are 150,000

people that everyday come to work

because they have an important mission

they are honest they are resolute in

their efforts they are committed to

safety that's our culture and every

employee at Boeing that that's that's

just how we think about the work we do

and we're going to continue to improve

as a company

I'm not saying we've done everything

right as I've noted today we've gotten

some things wrong but this is a great

company with a great legacy that's

committed to excellence and where we can

improve we will where we can learn we

will but our culture is about safety

that that is at the very core of Boeing

it's been that way for 103 years all

right mr. Hamilton on the I had two or

three questions that actually senator

Rosen just asked pursuing that further

but on you know you've got a 1967

certification that said 14 variants

since 1967 you have a significantly

different plane just based on the 14th

variant of the original plane what

difference do you think would have made

if the certification process would have

been would have gone back to the were

certifying a new plane would that have

made a difference in the EM caste system

or you've been doing this a long time

what difference would it have made if we

hadn't built on the previous

half-century of this planes history and

just has started with an

plain would that have been better or

worse you know the in part 21 of the

federal regulations it spells out the

change product rule which is I u.s. s

for a derivative type certification and

it's a process as it's in you SFA's

regulations it's also in European and

other countries regulations and it

requires you to look at all significant

changes and and step up I think there's

a sumption here that a derivative type

Sturt is less robust than a new type

cert I think when you look at a new

types or you oftentimes have some

exceptions or equivalent levels of

safety very similar to what you see on a

derivative so I'm not sure it would have

necessarily resulted in a safer airplane

it might have draw driven some different

design decisions though but

fundamentally one of the things that

happen in these two accidents was this

assumption around how we expected crews

to respond under certain situations

which proved to be not it did not happen

and I think you know that that's a

fundamental issue that we have to

address as an industry thank you mr.

chairman Thank You senator blunt senator

Blackburn Thank You mr. chairman I thank

you for being here today and for taking

our questions I will tell you this as

you've responded you've addressed

senator senator senator I think you

should be addressing victims because

they're the ones we're asking questions

on behalf of and they're the ones who

have come today on behalf of their

family members another thing I want to I

want to ask you you've mentioned a

couple of times a lack of awareness of

emails or documents or communications

and you know mr. Muhlenberg we have

something around here before we vote we

say we read the bill so that we know

what's in it

and if we need to ask questions we ask

questions

and we developed that awareness that is

so necessary to make good decisions and

to have a full view of the situation

that is in front of us and it is

disconcerting to hear someone whose to

be the leader of a company to say I

wasn't aware or I didn't know or hadn't

hadn't read that nobody made me aware of

that I depended on that you know we call

that passing the buck and it is your

responsibility if you're going to lead

the company to have that awareness so

have you at this point read each and

every page of every document that is

relative to the situation in this case

senator I I can't say I've read every

document every page I know we've

provided more than half a million pages

of documents as part of the production

process over the last year

I accept your input and your criticism I

am accountable our companies accountable

accountability starts appreciate that

but I think that it is unsettling to

hear you say I haven't read that let me

move on

I do believe you're in the business of

safety as a priority and even though you

say you don't sell safety let's talk a

little bit about the simulators because

you had pilots that were training in the

simulators as well as training in flight

correct you're referring during the max

development yes senator yes yes okay so

the simulators that were being used for

training were they built by the same

engineers with the same components the

same sensors the same systems as the max

system senator we have a wide variety of

simulators some of which are what we

call conformed simulators which

represent the actual

hardware and software of the airplane we

have others that are some of the pilots

were not training on this specific

simulator and then you also you know mr.

Peters had started down a line of

questioning with you about the pilots

and the pilots that were trained and you

only had highly experienced pilots in

simulators before flying the new max

system correct senator I was referring

to our Boeing test pilots we also have

pilots from a number of other

organizations regulators and airlines

would use pilots with a variety of

experience a wide range of experience

because there are pilots with the wide

range of experience that are going to be

in that cockpit flying that plane in

real time senator I agree with your your

view on the necessity of having a

variety of pilot experiences involved in

the testing process but again our our

Boeing pilots are not the only testers

in okay well then let's take it this way

what changes are you going to make in

the simulators and in the training that

is going to bring to account for human

factor senator we've made several

changes and have more to come but to

start the baseline training program for

the max is roughly a 24 day training

program which includes heavy use of

simulators advanced simulators

we've also modified the computer-based

training for the incremental training

between the ng and the max we've added

visibility to the training materials for

the M cast system that we've talked

about that new training is all currently

being evaluated and will be ultimately

certified by the regulators to make it a

baseline in the program we're also

investing Rd significantly in advance

I appreciate all

that appreciate your your answer prior

to these occurrences did you feel that

your training was not sufficient

senator no we we implemented the

training that was planned and certified

for the airplane Thank You senator

Blackburn Senator Scott Thank You mr.

chairman first off my heart goes out to

all the families I mean I just can't

imagine you know the impact on these

families after these tragic accidents

Florida I come from Florida so air

travel is pretty big pretty big deal for

us 126 million people traveled to

Florida tourists last year and a lion's

share of them came by era aircraft so

the safety of everybody is really

important mr. mellenburg the presidency

of your commercial airlines was let go

after this what so what's your process

to hold people accountable to make sure

you know this doesn't happen again yeah

senator first of all my company and I

are accountable

I believe that accountability starts

with me my board took some recent

actions regarding my position which I

fully support and will allow me to focus

even more on safety so every action we

take to try to focus on safety I have

also taken some management actions again

those are focused on operational

excellence and safety going forward as

as other reviews are completed if we see

additional actions that need to be taken

we won't hesitate but some cases

accountability also includes

improvements to our processes and our

organization structure and that gets to

some of the changes we announced on our

safety review boards our new safety

organization our new board Safety

Committee and the realignment of all

50,000 of our engineers to our chief

engineer in terms of reporting structure

all of those accountability

actions are important and all of them

are focused on safety so if anybody if

any of your whether it's engineers or

non-engineers if somebody has a concern

in the future about safety what's the

what's the process you've you've created

to make sure that it gets to you and you

can you can react to it because

ultimately if you as a CEO the buck

stops with you senator that's that's

been one of the key learnings from this

whole process is we need to elevate the

visibility on safety issues that might

come up there at the ground floor level

make sure they get the right visibility

in action so a couple of things we've

done there one is again restructuring

our safety review boards so I now get a

weekly update on safety review boards

from across the Boeing Enterprise at a

detailed level which I've found to be

very helpful

we've also with the stand up of our new

safety organization under Beth pastor

instead of having those safety teams

underneath our businesses they're now

separated and report up through our

chief engineer any safety concerns that

employees have will come through that

organization we set up a new anonymous

reporting system for those employees

that want might want to make anonymous

reports to facilitate that and we

continue to have a full range of ethics

hotlines across our enterprise that

encourage employees to make their inputs

and we we have a culture of asking our

employees to speak up we want them to

speak up we want to make sure they're

heard and that we take action what have

you made any changes at the board level

that to increase the accountability for

all employees senator uh our board has

been very engaged in this entire process

one of the things we did is it now about

six months ago

I asked our board to set up a

independent review led by Admiral Jean

Bosch Gianni he has tremendous safety

background that committee came forward

with a number of recommendations some of

which I mentioned in things that we've

implemented our board will continue to

be engaged in that process and this new

this new safety organization that I

talked about in addition to reporting to

the chief engineer and to me it also

provides

independent audit if you will back into

our board and our board is set up a new

aerospace safety committee that's now

permanent headed up by Admiral GM Bosch

Gianni you might have seen on Friday we

added another board member and Admiral

Richardson who also has deep experience

in safety he will also be a member of

that committee and so our safety

organization will have an independent

reporting line to them as well which i

think is a good disciplined process

I did go preside so I couldn't I didn't

get to hear all the testimony but have

you made any recommendations to this

committee at things that at the federal

level we ought to be doing differently

to you know to do you know make sure

whether it's Boeing or Airbus or anybody

else this doesn't happen again senator

we've discussed a number of options

there again we have we have learned and

there are some things that we need to

fix that are related to the airplane

design and training and communications

we also think there are some

opportunities to reform our processes

and and how we work together as a

government and industry thank you Thank

You senator Scott

Sullivan Thank You mr. chairman and I

also want to express my sympathies and

condolences to the family members here

we have a a safe commercial aviation

industry in America but I think we

always have to look at ways to improve

it industry the Airlines FAA Congress so

I'm sure it's difficult for the family

members to be here but it's important

that you're here so I want to thank you

for that I'm going to start with just a

bit of a kind of a parochial question

mr. Mallen burger mr. Hamilton Alaska

Airlines is our my state's airline it's

a very good airline it's certainly

critically important in my States I know

it is to the ranking members state as

well

they fly almost all 737 Boeing's we

Alaskans travel a lot

I've had many constituents in the

aftermath of these max crashes that have

asked me are the 737s that we are flying

on all the time in Alaska to and from

Seattle and other places safe so can you

can both of you assure my constituents

that these 737s are safe that are such

an important component of Alaska air

travel senator the 737ng fleet that

Alaska operates is a safe fleet it's a

safe airplane and it's got about two

hundred million hours of air safety

track record behind it mr. Hamilton I

agree with mr. mellenburg comments I

also just want to say that we have a

weekly meeting that we review all the

reports that are coming in from the

fleet on whether or not they are

potential safety issue or not so the max

issues that were focused on here with

regard to 737s are not issues that

exists with your other line to 737 is

800 900 no that's incorrect

let me ask and I know the house side was

looking at this issue as we focus as

this committee is on the tragic lessons

learned from the max 737 accidents

should we also take the time to ensure

that the other 737 models that are

receiving less attention now are

nevertheless continue to be safe and to

take the opportunity to look at the FAA

certification process on those to make

sure that that is not bedeviled with

some of the challenges that we are

discussing here with regard to the max

would you agree that that's an

opportunity to not just focus on the max

but the overall process to reboot the

focus both at your company but also in

the FAA on safety the senator I believe

there are a number of independent

reviews underway right now looking at

that broader certification process

some of them begun to report out we we

support that broader look so models that

aren't just the max all models so we are

taking an end-to-end comprehensive look

at the certification process and I

believe there are a number of government

independent reviews that are focused on

that let me ask for both of you I keep

hearing from safety experts about the

importance of what they refer to as

functional safety and that is the way

the different systems work together with

the operator as opposed to looking at

each system as its added to a new model

in a vacuum and it seems to me that this

issue of functional safety is a core

issue as it relates to the max given

what has happened can you tell the

committee about what your company's

approach to this issue of functional

safety is when adding new systems to an

existing aircraft like the 737 obviously

there was a failure here on that issue

how are you working to improve that and

does the FAA do enough to focus on this

idea of functional safety not just the

individual additions to existing in

older models that's John to take that

question yes so senator I think it

starts with require our requirements

break down of what's our airplane level

requirements system level requirements

component level requirements and then

validating at the component level a

system level and at the airplane level

how any change method requirements and

interacted across at the system or

airplane level you also talked about

regulatory requirements yes there's

something called does FAA focus enough

on you think on functional safety so

there's been some rather recent changes

in what we call development assurance

that I think is is continue to mature

and and again this looks at the

functional safety and some of the things

that you really focus

status the breakdown requirements and

how different systems interact with that

so I think as mr. Muhlenberg pointed out

some of the recent industry committee

reports I have discussed this and I

think will support those recommendations

and the FAS actions going forward thank

you thank you mr. chairman senator

Sullivan and and thank you to the panel

we appreciate you being with us I'm sure

we'll be questioning you further as we

continue to get more reports our second

panel of witnesses will be escorted in

now we we thank you two gentlemen for

being with us the second panel as said

before is mr. Roberts um Walt chairman

of the National Transportation Safety

Board and the Honorable Christopher Hart

mr. Hart is the team chair of the joint

Authority's technical review which we

use the shorthand up chatter for and

have preferred that to that a number of

times during this hearing and mr. Hart

is a former chairman of the National

Transportation Safety Board and they've

been waiting patiently during these two

and a half hours so gentlemen we are we

appreciate you being here you have

submitted testimony we ask each of you

to summarize your testimony in five

minutes and mr. somewhat we'll begin

with you you're recognized Thank You mr.

chairman good afternoon chairman wicker

ranking member Cantwell and members of

the committee thank you for the

opportunity to testify before you today

this afternoon I will address

NTS b--'s recent recommendation report

regarding the 737 max certification

processes this recommendation report

issued last month contained seven

recommendations did you get my call mr.

someone it's it's on but I'll move

closer these recommendations are the

result of the NTS b--'s involvement as

an accredited representative to the

Indonesian government's investigation

into last year's lion air crash and to

the Ethiopian government's investigation

into this year's crash involving the

Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 max the

NTSB participates in foreign

investigations in accordance with ICAO

annex 13 which details the standards and

recommended practices of international

aviation accident investigations under

annex 13 the state of occurence

leads the investigation and the US has

the right to participate in the

investigation when it involves a US

manufactured or a u.s. registered or

designed aircraft sections the 737 max

eight this is so that any design or

manufacturing issues can promptly be

addressed by the FAA and the

manufacturer as an accredited

representative to these crash

investigations the NTSB investigated

initiated an in-depth examination of the

u.s. design certification processes used

to certify the max the issues we

identified revolve around three basic

areas and our safety recommendations are

centered on them first the system safety

assumptions used by Boeing for the MKS

and ultimately accepted by the FAA did

not use realistic pilot recognition and

corrective actions in response to

uncommanded flight control inputs quite

simply the assumptions that boeing used

did not consider or account for the

impact that multiple flight deck alerts

or or indications could have on pilots

responses to

comanded MKS activation next we

identified the need for manufacturers to

validate their pilot response

assumptions using scientific methods and

application of human factors principles

to improve cockpit design procedures and

training we believe that the use of

validated methods and tools to assess

pilot performance in dealing with

failure conditions and emergencies would

result in more effective requirements

for flight deck interface design pilot

procedures and training strategies and

finally we believe that manufacturers

should develop and incorporate in

airline concrete's mechanisms that would

allow pilots to better diagnose

prioritize and react to multiple alerts

and alarms the pilots in the lion air

and Ethiopian crashes were faced with

multiple aural and visual alerts

research demonstrates that emergency

situations would increase workload and

require additional effort to manage

effectively because of the stress

involved and possible confusion

regarding which actions are necessary to

resolve the problem each of our seven

recommendations are detailed in my

written testimony in closing it should

be noted that the NTSB investigators

continue to examine the design

certification process and we may issue

additional recommendations in this area

if warranted thank you again for the

opportunity to testify and I look

forward to your questions Thank You mr.

Sam Walt mr. Hart you recognized Thank

You chairman wicker and ranking member

Cantwell and members of the committee

thank you for inviting me to this to

this hearing today first I would like to

extend my condolences joining others who

have already done so to the families and

friends of the passengers and crew

Online Air flight 610 and Ethiopian

Airlines flight 302 the FAA created the

joint Authority's technical review

because these crashes revealed a need to

review the robustness of the aircraft

certification process the j8 er which

included representatives from the FAA

NASA and nine other civil aviation of

Ortiz was created to review the max

certification process to determine

whether the appropriate regulations were

applied to assess whether compliance was

shown and to recommend improvements

I commend the FAA for seeking this

certification process peer review and

for making it public the max grounding

was unprecedented to previous groundings

where the McDonnell Douglas dc-10 in

1979 when an engine separated from the

wing and the Boeing 787 in 2013 due to

battery fires in those two groundings

excuse me the airplanes were rendered on

air worthy because the airplanes were on

air where the pilot competence was not

an issue because those groundings

resulted solely from airplane problems

the country where the airplanes were

manufactured made the grounding and on

grounding decisions the grounding of the

max on the other hand involves

automation that usually worked but

sometimes failed and when it failed some

pilots knew how to respond but some

including those who crashed did not

because the scenario was not just an

airplane problem but a problem of

airplane system / pilot interaction

every country that licenses pilots must

also be involved in the grounding and on

grounding decisions as Automation

complexity increases I anticipate that

future problems are more likely to be of

the airplane pilot type rather than

airplane only after three j8e our

meetings in Seattle in which Boeing and

the FAA were very open and helpful an

extensive work between the meetings the

j8 er gave the FAA a compilation of team

members recommendations in 12 areas and

they we did that on October the 11th

some of the recommendations derive from

the need for the certification process

to address how a single system failure

may create issues in other systems other

recommendations raise the issue of

whether a process that has been based

largely upon compliance should also

address safety as systems become more

complex the likelihood increases that

compliance with applicable regulations

will not necessarily ensure safety

moreover as systems become more complex

the certification process should ensure

that failsafe design principles

prioritize the mitigation of hazards

through design minimizing reliance on

pilot action as primary means of risk

mitigation delegation will probably be

become more prevalent as regulators

encounter increasing difficulty hiring

and retaining technology leaders thus

although the recommendations do not

address the desirability of delegation

they do recommend examining how to make

the Oda process less cumbersome to avoid

stifling communications query for

example whether inadequate

communications resulted in the failure

to address the effects of evolving the

maneuvering characteristics in system

meant M cast from a benign system to a

more aggressive system and query whether

inadequate communications resulted in

the fair to address the effects of

modifying M cast from one scenario to

another scenario other recommendations

relate to the FAA standards regarding

the time for pilots to identify and

respond to problems j8e our members

recommend reviewing whether existing

standards are appropriate for today's

complex systems for example when a

system failure results in cascading

failures and multiple alarms query how

adequately the certification process

considers the impact of multiple alarms

along with possible startle effect on

the ability of pilots to respond

appropriately these two crashes are the

latest of several recent crashes in

which pilots encountered scenarios that

they had never seen before even in

training and responded inappropriately

increasing complexity and reliability

exacerbate the challenge of training

pilots to respond to problems that they

have never seen before increasing

complexity exacerbates a challenge

because it reduces the likelihood that

pilots understand the system increasing

reliability exacerbates the challenge

because it increases the difficulty of

determining what types of problems might

occur and therefore including those

types of problems in training in

conclusion the j8e our members hope that

their recommendations will continue

improving aviation safety by helping to

improve the certification process thank

you again for inviting me and I look

forward to your questions thank you

gentlemen

is is the work complete regarding the

max

for either of your organizations mr. Sun

wall mr. chairman thank you for that

question we are continuing to go through

scores and scores and Design

certification documents and we are

looking if we need to make additional

recommendations we certainly will

so to answer your question our work is

not completed and mr. Hart our work is

completed because we were chartered to

to review the situation and give

recommendations to the FAA we did that

on October 11th that completed our work

I think Ratto the did this particular

janitor joint Authority's technical

review is is over and disbanded that's

correct

all right let's talk about the time

between the first crash and the second

crash it was it was evident pretty clear

after the first one after the lion crash

that the M Cass system was not working

correctly is that does that true was

some Walt yes sir that is correct and

mr. Hart this would this was there are

many factors but but the dysfunction of

the M casts what was central that's

correct

okay and at that point what what notice

was sent out to other airlines and to

the pilots to make it clear that that

that was the main problem mr. chairman

as you are aware today is the one-year

anniversary of lion air so on October

the 29th was the crash I believe it was

October these are correction November

the 7th when the in when the FAA put out

an air worthiness directive to require

certain procedures procedural

modifications what was was that a

typical air worthiness

directive or was it highlighted as an

emergency air worthiness directive I'm

not sure Chris do you know airworthiness

directives pretty much by definition are

considered emergency so I think this one

this one was definitely one that is

supposed to command the attention of the

entire industry okay so it and mr. Sun

Walters is consulting with staff and I'm

it's fine if he supplements that but

this was a red flag set out about the

max and the MKS part of it is that

correct but would you would you either

of you gentlemen quarrel that this was a

red flag warning it was an industry-wide

warning that everybody who flies this

airplane needs to know about this issues

and so that to that extent yes okay well

is there a way that that it could that

we could have made it more explicit it

is was was there something about this

advisory though that didn't get the job

done mr. Hart I'm sorry but I can't

speak for the FAA and their decision

process on how to handle this the

decision process to have the

airworthiness directives within days of

the of the second crash was intentional

to make to get the word out as quickly

as possible but I'm really I was not

privy to the decision-making process

nobody but in that's I'm talking about

the way it would typically have been

received internationally and around in

in the aviation industry that this would

have been taken seriously and and and

given a heightened bit of attention is

that correct that certainly is the

purpose of an air worthiness directive

yes how people responded to it I can't I

can't don't have a good answer to that

okay now did did I hear you say mr. Hart

that some pilots reacted in in one way

which was sufficient and some pilots

not for whatever reasons do that if you

could elaborate on what you were telling

the committee yes thank you for that

question I was referring specifically to

the fact that the law in the lyin error

crashed the day before that crash that

same problem was encountered and the

pilots responded to it appropriately

well what do you think there was a

failure lion air to notify the other

crews that a problem had occurred it was

resolved in this fashion and we need to

be mindful of that but was do you know

if that was communicated between the

flight that did land safely in the one

the next day unfortunately I do thank

you for the question unfortunately I do

not know the details of who told what to

whom whether it was the mechanics the

other pilots I don't know the details of

how that information about what happened

the day before was transmitted to the to

the subsequent pilots and mechanics mr.

sum well do you want to clarify anything

that you've said based on some advice

that you've been getting well in fact it

was an emergency air worthiness

directive that was issued by the FAA as

mr. Hart has indicated so that is a term

of art an emergency air worthiness

directive that's correct and that means

that it does not allow for public

comment oftentimes for normal air were

than its directive the FAA has to put it

out for public comment unless it's an

emergency air worthiness directive is it

fair for me to characterize that as a

red flag well as Chris Hart indicated it

does indicate that there was something

that needed immediate awareness within

the within the aviation community as

soon as you can't will Thank You mr.

chairman and I thank the the second

panel for being here wish there was many

people listening to this panel as the

first because this is the hard work that

we have to do in getting this right and

moving forward and I so much appreciate

mr. somewhat the NTS b--'s

recommendations and mr. Hart your

committee's recommendations

my colleagues and I senator Duckworth

senator Blumenthal have already

introduced legislation on the NTSB and

other recommendations last week and

hopefully we will be able to move

forward on those you heard the

discussion I'm I believe we're here for

this this issue about what happened in

the cockpit and the level of distraction

which I think is the point mister some

Walt of at least two of the

recommendations that we put in our

legislation that is your recommendation

that the FAA direct Boeing to have

clearer corrective actions from

uncommanded

and that there be this some sort of

resolution that they've had in other

planes to the cockpit situation so that

we don't we're not bombarding pilots

also that they develop the same kind of

assessment now when I read the circulars

and I've read many it's pretty clear to

me that you know this this already

should have been done that I mean it's

pretty clear that you have to talk about

the effectiveness that you when you

submit a plan for a plane you have to

submit this alert plan so we'll see

we'll find out at some point

what alert plan was submitted and what

was reviewed but it's very clear that

you have to have you know this

effectiveness intended for human and

machine integration you know people

understanding the alerts compatibility

with other displays and warnings

ensuring that the system you know is

telling the pilots what to do so I

listen I appreciate your recommendations

and we are going to get them into law

trust me the the question becomes like

what are we doing on top of something

that isn't already clear here what is it

that actually we're doing and helping

people understand what is it we're doing

here to make this system safer and the

reason I ask this is because as I said

in my opening statement I actually

believe this is the issue du jour I

think it is for automobile safety moving

forward on more AVS and on airplanes

there's going to be more integration in

to the into the cockpit so anytime you

are taking over command of that plane

with a response we need to know and we

need to understand that functionality so

what is what are these alert system

requirements that we're asking the FAA

to do both for the max and for all

planes what is that really giving us

that we don't currently have now in the

statute well thank you for the question

senator Cantwell and thank you for your

for your leadership and your advocacy on

this area of course we issued these

seven recommendations a month ago

because we did identify holes in the

design certification process I'd be glad

to get into some of those holes and what

those recommendations are but I don't

want to dominate your time I defer to

you well my question was why do you

think this is important because you you

actually don't think that the details

are there that's correct and we really

what the long and the short of it woven

throughout each of the seven

recommendations is that we found that

the width when pilots are faced with

multiple alerts they're not performing

or reacting in the way that Boeing

thought that they would react when they

develop their design assumptions and

what about safety management systems for

aerospace manufacturers what about that

recommendation

the NTSB has has found the benefits of

safety management systems in in many

modes of transportation including

aviation we don't have specifically a

recommendation for an SMS for the

manufacturers however we do believe that

when you're properly analyzing and

assessing your risk that is improving

safety so if I think personally I think

that would be a good idea for

manufacturers to have a safety

management system in place and and what

does that mean to most people who are

trying to listen to this conversation

post the one we just had what does that

actually mean that happens you know I've

always looked at safety management

systems and I like the term safety

management instead of safety management

systems because it's an act

thing we want to manage safety the way

that we would manage other vital

business functions so they're generally

thought to be about four tenets of SMS

one of which is safety risk assessment

where you're actively assessing your

risk and managing those risk to an

acceptable level and so that's a key

component right there of a safety

management system well the this issue of

risk management is critical and that

that's what I believe is that you have

to say what are the highest risks so you

can focus on is clear no one thought

this change of a new system that took

outside information control deplane gave

a different commands with different

alerts that do or different things

it wasn't tested so we we have to

implement this the FAA was given this I

don't know if it was a directive or

nudge before but then they pulled back

on a rulemaking in 2014 on this system

management but you believe Iko others

are recommending this is what we should

go forward with because it creates this

robust discussion constantly is that the

right way to describe it as a safety

practitioner I agree with that

and I do want to say again the NTSB is

not really going on the record to have a

recommendation for that but from a

safety practitioners perspective again

when you're managing your risk you're

managing safety thank you thank you I

see my other car my time is passed so

senator senator Blumenthal thank you

thank you senator Cantwell and I want to

express my appreciation to Senator

Cantwell and Senator Duckworth for the

legislation that we're working on

together and additional legislation that

we hope will be based on your reports

and others you know I had a lot of

questions for our previous witness which

unfortunately I didn't have time to ask

one of them would have been why did he

call the president United States in

effect circumventing the FAA if they

were really going to respect safety are

either of you aware of the call or calls

that

made by mr. Muhlenberg to the president

United States seeking to prevent

grounding of these airplanes in the

immediate aftermath of the second crash

senator Blumenthal I'm certainly not

aware that I sat in this hearing and in

March when you asked mr. Elwell the same

questions I'm not aware of that we were

not involved in the decision to ground

the aircraft in any form or fashion mr.

Hart it was not within the purview of

the jtr either we were - we were looking

at the certification process to decide

how to make it better the the fact of

the matter is that the United States of

America was among the last nations to

ground those airplanes correct that's

certainly my understanding us in Canada

and normally the United States of

America would be at the forefront of

safety correct mr. Hart good question

senator just for your awareness I'm on

record through an op-ed in USA Today to

congratulate the FAA for waiting until

they had enough data to see was this a

one-off event because if it was a

one-off event they're gonna be grounding

airplanes after every crash or was it

more than a one-off in other words were

in today and ready in retrospect was a

good decision to the ground that

airplane after they had enough data to

see the similarity of the two yes but

the United States was the last to have

enough data for whatever the reason just

just saying right well everybody had the

same date at about the same time I just

think the US the FA as a reputation for

waiting until the data to react let me

ask you your report found that quote key

aspects of the MKS functions such as

intended function description its

interfaces and architecture were not

directly visible to the FAA in a

straightforward manner through the

certification deliverable documents I'm

trying to put that in simple English

that you would use in the USA Today

article they didn't do full fair

disclosure to the FAA correct in simple

language the process the certainty

the HSU process was complicated enough

and challenging enough and bureaucratic

enough that the communication was

stifled and and so the communication

didn't get where it needed to be when it

needed to be there okay I think that

answers my question and that was

something we should correct correct

that's something that the JH er has

recommended correcting and yes it

doesn't eat correcting The Wall Street

Journal recently reported that internal

Boeing surveys revealed that about 30

percent of its employees felt potential

undue pressure from managers regarding

safety-related approval in fact one of

the Boeing engineers Kurtis Ewbank filed

a complaint that asserted quote Boeing

management was more concerned with cost

and schedule than safety or quality and

quote did your report your investigative

work indicate that kind of undue

pressure from Boeing on its employees to

move the safety process at the expense

of I'm sorry move the certification

process at the expense of safety thank

you for your question our investigation

our review found enough concern about

undue influence that we recommended that

it be reviewed carefully for the next

time the next certification process you

indicate I think in your testimony that

you thought delegation would continue

which seems contrary to what we have

found here so far the a lot of the

thrust of the questioning has been to

reverse delegation so I hope that maybe

we can have your further thoughts on

that issue let me just ask one more

question of mr. mr. sum Walt on Sunday

just this past Sunday the New York Times

reported ongoing efforts to undercut

regulatory oversight early and often

the story of Boeing sabotaging rigorous

safety scrutiny is chilling to all of us

and more reason to keep the 737 max

grounded until certification is really

and truly independent and this is

is reform what are your views on the

amount of delegation authority from the

FAA the Boeing shouldn't we reverse the

delegation that exists right now senator

Blumenthal thank you for that question

the NTSB his role in all of this is to

serve as an accredited representative to

each of the respective accident

investigations as such we looked at the

design certification processes of the

737 max and we issued these seven

recommendations we have not looked at

the ODA process that is not something

that we have done why well because there

are approximately 79 organizations that

have Oda approval we've got about two

people that have the expertise to dwell

into the design certification issues

we've devoted those energies to come up

with these seven recommendations that we

issued one month ago that is an enormous

task I'm under the impression that the

US do TIG is doing a study of of this

issue as are numerous other entities

Thank You senator Duckworth Thank You

mr. chairman for Chairman's son Walt

welcome at the March 2019 hearing held

by this committees aviation subcommittee

chairman wicker asked you a simple

question concerning lions air flight 610

and I quote what should the pilots have

done and you responded as follows and I

quote well I flew the 737 for ten years

and I do believe that there is a

procedure at least for the Flintstone

version of the 737 that I flew a very

odd 737 but I do believe that the very

first thing you would do is oppose that

motion by pulling the yoke back and that

would engage the state break or the

stabilator cutout function and to me

this answer makes sense the most

reliable initial human response to an

uncommanded nose-down dive is to pull

back on the yoke would you concur with

this view yes I do

I've actually looked at the procedure

and and it says to to grasp and to hold

it firm

but as you know as an experienced pilot

your natural reaction would in fact if

it's going in a direction you don't

intend it to you would you would tend to

oppose it which should in the older

models of the Boeing aircraft that I

flew the 727 and 737 that would engage

the stabilizer break and stop the stab

from from running but as you pointed out

in your earlier round it will not do

that when M Cass is active on the 737

max right so that's what I would like to

add to your response is the critical

importance of the column cannot function

whether after four it is that it's not

just limited to the very odd 737 but in

fact according to a former Boeing

engineer who was responsible for the

control law development in the 757 767

and a 747 400 in every Boeing airplane

in every Boeing airplane until the 737

max uncommanded stabilized stabilizer

runaway is stopped by column motion only

you don't have to do another step once

you pull back and you've over it in it

that's it

there's nothing that resets and then

pushes the nose back down five seconds

later there's nothing else you have to

do that is it in every other model of

Boeing aircraft of the 737s but for the

max with the MKS malfunction the pilot

has to also apply the manual electric

trim within the same three-second window

otherwise the MKS which the pilots did

not know was installed in the aircraft

could reset and put the mouse back down

so now you're telling pilots okay

natural reaction you've put back you've

overrode it you'd think that's it but

now you have to troubleshoot for a

system that you don't know exists that

is now overriding your pilot's command

input in pulling back the yoke mr. Sam

oh are you aware of Boeing notifying

commercial 737 pilots before the lion

air crash that when MCATs activates

during manual flight it disables the F

column cut out safety function that is

it overrides that safety function

Senator Duckworth I'm under the

impression that just as you said that

prior to these two tragic crashes that

information was not widely known within

the piloting community

Thank You mr. someone the MCATs

malfunction has it should have been

elevated to a hazardous rating in my

opinion because the F column cutout was

removed and worsened by tripling the

state trim rate which made severe Mis

from likely especially with a persistent

malfunction had Boeing done this instead

of rating it as a major hazard we would

not be where we are today would you

agree with that it changes how they

report to the FAA am I correct yes that

that hazard category of major as I

understand it only required there to be

one angle of attack sensor if it was at

a higher hazard category it would have

required the input from - Thank You mr.

chairman I would like to enter Peter

lemmy's flaw as a flawed assumptions

pave a path of disaster into the hearing

record without objection thank you

can you talk about the accident chain

the concept of these decisions that that

pileup and leads to those lion air

pilots for example fighting to save that

aircraft and how these decisions add up

yes we as you know Senator Duckworth the

NTSB was an accredited representative to

the Lion Air investigation as well as

the Ethiopian Accident Investigation we

participated closely with and with both

of them but since the lion air is

wrapped up we have worked closely with

it with the Indonesian authorities we

commented on their report we feel that

their report the Indonesian report the

KN kt report is as comprehensive and and

we're satisfied with that report so I

think that report outlines the chain of

chain of events it's not just one factor

there were several issues that that led

to that crash thank you Thank You

senator Duckworth senator Cruz Thank You

mr. chairman

chairman son well the NTSB report that

you mentioned in your testimony stated

that the NTSB is quote concerned that

the accident pilot responses to the

unintended MCATs operation were not

consistent with the underlying

assumptions about pilot recognition and

response that Boeing used based on FAA

guidance for flight control system

functional hazard assessments including

for EM cast as part of the 737 max

design why do you think it was that that

Boeing made the wrong assumptions

senator Cruz thank you for that question

and what what we do know is that to

simulate the EM casts or to assess the

level of hazard the less level of risk

associated with that they put Boeing

pilots test pilots in the engineering

simulator and while they were flying all

of a sudden the trim started moving they

wanted to see how a pilot would have

reacted and if they reacted the way that

Boeing expected them to do then they

said okay well a pilot will immediately

recognize this problem they'll notice

because the nose is starting to pitch

down they'll notice because it's

increased the pressure on the control

wheedle and and one other thing they

would Anna stabbed him wheel was moving

that's all correct but what Boeing

failed to account for and their

assumptions was to consider that the EM

cast could have failed because of

another reason the M cast could have

activated because of a failure of the

angle of attack which would have led to

numerous other alerts and warnings in

the cockpit so with a failed angle of

attack they would have had a lowest low

airspeed indication on their primary

flight display they would have gotten a

stick shaker or stall warning which is

rattling the stick and making a lot of

noise they would have gotten an aural

warning that says airspeed low airspeed

low they would have had various lights

in the cockpit so in the long and the

short of it is is that Boeing only

evaluated pilots performance with the

stab trim it's

self-moving they did not simulate or

replicate how multiple failures could

affect a pilot's performance and why did

the fa processes not catch this not

catch these failed assumptions well it's

a great question senator and I'm not

sure that I know the answer to that but

that's why we've issued these seven

recommendations is so that these design

assumptions can be more realistic we

found in three instances in the tube

accident flights plus the flight the

Lion Air flight prior to the accident

flight we've seen three cases where the

pilots did not perform in accordance

with the assumptions that Boeing's that

Boeing used and as a bird strike a

scenario that that that engineers

designing a plane should anticipate and

the regulator's focusing on a plane

should anticipate I believe so and I

believe they do in certain areas I'm not

sure how it might apply to this as you

know there's conjecture that the that

perhaps a bird might have taken out the

AOA sensor on the Ethiopian aircraft I

don't know if that's a part of the total

risk assessment for the 737 max as it

relates to to M castle is there any

indication either Boeing or the FA

considered the possibility that a bird

strike would shear off the angle of

attack sensor I do not know but but I

can certainly look into that and get

back with you if you like I would

appreciate that very much mr. Hart one

of the the key findings of the joint

Technical Review Committee report is

that the FAA s visibility and two

important system safety information was

quote incomplete and fragmented the j8

er then went on to say if the FAA had

been more involved in the certification

of the M cast this quote would likely

have resulted in design changes that

would have improved safety based on the

j8 ers findings why would the FAA accept

incomplete and fragmented safety

information from Boeing and what can be

done to fix that thank you for the

question that's the purpose of the the

recommendation that the communication

process that the ODA

less bureaucratic and less complicated

so the communication process isn't

undermined by the complexity of that

situation so the FAA dit was not

adequately aware of the evolution of the

EM castro MAME from a relatively weak

system to a much more robust system the

FA wasn't aware of the details of the of

how adequately the transformation of the

MCATs from a high-speed wind upturn

correction to a low-speed

angle-of-attack correction and and where

the assumptions properly considered in

that process the fa the communications

to the fa were not adequate for it to be

fully aware of the of the impact of

those issues thank you thank you senator

Cruz senator Blumenthal I have just one

question and you may consider it outside

of your expertise but the CEO of Boeing

told us today that they made mistakes

and regretted them and wanted to take

action in response to do the right thing

for the families who were affected the

loved ones of victims boeing has said

that it will take responsibility

specifically for the Lyon air crash

resulting in the deaths of 189 people in

Indonesia last year and the Ethiopian

Airlines crash that killed 157 people

but it has filed court documents for the

Lyons aircraft indicating that it will

move to change the venue of the case to

Indonesia where the plane was maintained

if settlement talks failed the case was

filed in the Northern District of

Illinois where Boeing is headquartered

as you know resolving these claims in

Indonesia seems a lot less likely to

provide justice to those families

there's no Seventh Amendment right to a

jury trial there there's no requirement

of discovery

there's no rule allowing for depositions

would you agree with me that equity

fairness justice would argue in favor of

keeping these cases in the United States

my friend Chris Hart is a

harvard-educated lawyer don't the

Harvard Law School graduate accessing

lawyer in addition to being a pilot so

if you want to defer to him that's fine

absolutely thank you for the question I

am a Harvard attorney so to speak but

I'm not I I don't know anything about

the litigation strategy to be able to

comment on what they want to do

litigation why is that that's way

outside of my Lanie JT JT R did not

consider it and I'm I'm not really I

don't consider myself competent to speak

to that issue well in general wouldn't

you consider this courts of the United

States to be a better place to do

justice for American families than the

courts of Indonesia I'm not enough of a

thank you for the question but I'm not

enough of a litigator to be able to give

you a competent answer Thank You mr.

chairman thank you sooner Blumenthal

we're gonna close this hearing now Thank

You mr. chairman for a second round I

just wanted to clarify mr. Hart I think

I heard earlier from the testimony from

the company that they actually do think

that the FAA knew about the the level of

trim I think this is gonna be a big

issue I think we're gonna hear a lot

more about this but you would hope that

a plan at the very beginning of

certification would include that data

then they would make decisions but I am

concerned that the level of automation

and technology and human response I want

to see the best engineers I think it's

when the automobile industry and Toyota

went through this we didn't know what

happened

we basically called NASA and said would

you look at this code and figure out

what happened okay I don't want to call

NASA to look at software code I want the

FAA to be the best technology engineers

in understanding problems with software

problems with

nation and challenges with human

response that's why part of our

legislation is that center of excellence

for the FAA just by the way I've done

two other center of excellence is one on

composite manufacturing because the FAA

didn't know enough about composites that

know how to certify the plane and one on

biofuels for jets because they also

don't know how to certify fuel sources

for planes if they don't understand

jet fuel themselves okay so I'm a

believer that we give the FAA the extra

resources and tools so they can stay

ahead

or at least be the you know know the

right parameters of debate but isn't the

right parameter debate have to focus on

this human technology interface today

isn't that where we are because we saw

those ten years of making a safer and

and and yet this level of integration is

also sold as that five of the last

accidents were all around this and I

think you know for me and many Americans

are waking up wondering what is a pitot

tube and a you know AOA sensor on the

outside of the plane giving commands and

responses to inside the cockpit without

the pilots understand so I just feel

that the FAA and we've had this

discussion with Captain Sullenberger

needs to understand human response to

these automation systems what do you say

about that recommendation of a center of

excellence mr. harderberg

mr. someone thank you for the question

it also gives me an opportunity to

respond to senator Blumenthal raising

the same issue and that is I I think

that as first of all the type of problem

we're going to see with airplane safety

in the future in my view is going to not

be things falling off the airplane like

the dc-10 engine it's going to be the

pilot airplane interaction issue so the

human factors piece is crucial and

that's why I'm totally on board with the

human factors recommendations at the

NTSB made there are two problems one is

the the reference was to multiple things

going wrong at the same time I would add

to that it's not just multiple things

going wrong it's also never having seen

it before even in training that's that's

really the challenges when they are

seeing this for the first

I'm in real time of this series of

accidents where this has happened and

it's been unsuccessful the one exception

to that was Sully when he had an onion

in a situation he had never seen before

even in training and he handled it

master masterly

so that listen I think I've consulted

him a lot about this but that is why he

came to us after the cold in air and

said do not change the regulations on

the copilot for regional aircraft

because you don't have enough time you

don't have enough time to talk so I

think if you're going to develop a

system for certification and give it to

the FAA

I think the FAA has to know the

parameters of human response and what

pilots are capable of we just need a lot

more data if this is the route we're

going to keep going on innovation then

we just need to know a lot more about

what is that factor I think even I don't

want to speak for him but I think his

perception is that that's where you have

to start because you don't have any way

to a judge's system if you don't really

understand what the human limitation is

and that goes to my point that the

leading technologists in these rapidly

advancing and innovative technologies

the leading technologists are not going

to be with the regulator that's why this

is not an FA problem this is an

international certification problem

because the regulators are not able to

hire and retain the leading technologist

and these rapidly advancing technologies

they're going to be with the companies

that's why but I want the FAA to have

enough data information and

understanding to ask the right questions

because if they're not asking the right

questions because they don't understand

the technological impact we're going to

have a problem okay so you we have to

make sure they understand the Rd and at

least the parameters whether that is

composites biofuels or cockpit

automation and that's precisely why

adequate information is so crucial yes

straight to your point thank you for

making that point Thank You mr. chairman

Susan Blumenthal just one quick question

if the FAA were able to pay enough to

offer career opportunities would that

affect your judgment that they can't

hire the

the leading technologists as you put it

I can't speak to the totality of the

circumstances why the regulator's don't

have those people but that's probably

part of it yes well I'm just really

discouraged and frankly somewhat

skeptical about your view that the FAA

should be sort of doomed to failure and

has to outsource safety they are I don't

mean to suggest they're doomed to

failure I'm suggesting that's why I

think the collaborative process of the

delegation will will continue because

there is no way that in my view in the

way the things are currently situated

the FAA is gonna have the expertise with

in-house to do it without the

collaboration well putting aside the

word collaboration I hope we can prove

you wrong by in fact incentivizing both

financially and otherwise people with

those skills to go to work for the FAA

because that's where the disinterested

and independent safety function belongs

if you outsource safety that is doomed

to failure I certainly agree with you

that would be ideal yes senator

Blumenthal thank you well thank you very

much and thanks to the members of the

committee who've participated throughout

I have to say this has been one of the

most difficult hearings I've ever

participated in and I know it's been

difficult for the family members who are

still with us in the room some have had

to leave let me reiterate what I said at

the outset and that is this committee

under my leadership and Senator

Cantwell's leadership is working to

obtain as full and answer as possible we

owe it to the public and we owe it to

the families and to the victims and you

you have my assurance that we are not

finished with with the work that said

the hearing record will remain open for

two weeks during this time senators are

asked to submit any questions for the

record upon receipt all witnesses are

requested to submit their written

answers to the committee as soon as

possible I thank the witnesses for

appearing today and this hearing is now

adjourned

you
