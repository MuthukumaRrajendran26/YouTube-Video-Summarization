good morning everyone

I just wanted to begin by recognizing

that two people were killed outside of a

synagogue earlier today on a Jewish high

holiday and of course my thoughts and

prayers are with the families of the

victims in and indeed with Jewish people

all over the world who are celebrating

this festive holiday to the ball German

ash government l for Canadians to have

faith in the immigration system the

rules have to be followed and the laws

have to be enforced as Prime Minister

that's exactly what I will do as I said

will close the loophole in the safe

third country agreement will also hire

250 additional officers at the Canada

services of the Canada Border Services

Agency this represents a 25 percent

increase in our inland enforcement

operation which will strengthen law

enforcement at the border and we will

deplore we will deploy more judges of

the Immigration and Refugee Board to the

hotspots of illegal border crossers

so claims can be processed faster we

will also closely monitor those consider

to be a threat for criminality

especially ms-13 gang members will

establish immigration levels every year

according to Canada's national and

economic interests nothing else and my

government will prioritize economic

immigration but a more vigilant

immigration policy does not mean turning

a blind eye to refugees fleeing violence

and persecution abroad quite the

opposite as Prime Minister I will

improve foreign credentials recognition

and help new Canadians with recognized

skills to put them into practice I will

give those who enter Canada as

low-skilled workers a path to permanent

residency with adequate wages and

salaries I will also facilitate family

reunification and I will ensure that our

system gives priority to those who face

persecution or civil war will also

accelerate the reunification of genocide

survivors already settled in Canada and

we will do more to promote the private

sponsorship of refugees because we can

do more for the most vulnerable if the

government gets out of the way and works

to better enable and support private

sponsoring organizations the

government's own data shows that even

more than a decade after they arrived

privately sponsored refugees earn more

and depend less on government than those

hi mr. shear David Cochran with CBC News

we're not gonna get your platform today

tomorrow's debate day so I don't think

we're gonna see it then the advanced

polling starts this weekend and you've

promised to release it by the time that

happens so our Canadians gonna see

you're fully costed platform on Friday

so I can assure you that Canadians will

see our fully costed platform with

plenty of time to make up their minds

before they vote and again I will

contrast even today the Liberals have

not released their platform they claim

to have released their platform but

their platform is not costed and a

platform without costing is not

something that Canadians have confident

it can have confidence in okay but you

said earlier in this campaign by

advanced polling is that still your

position that's this weekend are we

gonna see it this weekend as I said when

we put forward our platform it will be

fully costed we've gone through the PBL

process they've looked at all their

announcements Canadians can look at it

see exactly where we're going to leave

more money in their pockets they're

gonna see how we're gonna cut corporate

welfare and foreign aid to pay for the

tax cuts that will help Canadians get

ahead and they will have that

information with plenty of time before

they vote and just one final point on

that will it have a fully detailed path

to a balanced budget within five years

will you show us through deficit targets

and the spending reductions that have to

be made to get there absolutely and

we've already highlighted some of those

measures like cutting corporate welfare

and reducing Canada's foreign age aid

budget by 25 percent we don't believe

that taxpayers dollars should be going

to highly profitable companies or being

sent through foreign aid to relatively

well-off countries we're going to leave

that money here at home in the pockets

of Canadians we are we on the mantra of

acknowledge a perv innocent person good

morning Mr Shearer Kevin Gallagher with

CTV national news I'd like you to

comment on the Global Mail story today

that says your campaign manager the

company he co-founded has taken

contracts to run ads for both the

Conservative Party and for

a large oil and gas lobby now there's

concerns that this could violate

Elections Canada law how can you

reassure voters that your campaign is

not in violation of new Elections Canada

illegal standards well quite the

contrary we actually have a ruling a

decision by Elections Canada that states

that it's it's it's per its allowable

for vendors to have contracts with with

with two different advertisers during

the last Parliament your government I

should say criticize Bill Morneau on

more than one occasion for having a

conflict of interest because of his

handling of the financial portfolio and

his family holdings how can you assure

Canadians that your campaign manager is

not at a conflict of interest when the

campaign he works for is paying a

contract to a company he founded what's

quite clear the our campaign manager has

taken a leave and is not involved in the

day-to-day decisions of that company and

again as I mentioned Elections Canada

has already made a decision on this

about the allowability the

permissibility of vendors having

different contracts from different

different advertisers they're not a

conflict of interest sir because his

company's financially benefitting from

the party that he's running a campaign

for but as I said not at all he's taking

a leave of absence during and prior to

oh we know that's exact lilyc stay in

Canada at Asian ProSource Ettinger say

permissibly Paul Avon daredevil they

contract back the who's your advertiser

a lady after the natural campaign pre in

and absence to set position hi mister

shear Tom Perry with CBC News you're

talking about renegotiating the safe

third-country agreement you've got a

government in Washington that is

clamping down on refugees what are you

gonna offer Donald Trump the US

administration to accept really more

refugees what how do you get them to

agree to renegotiating this well I

believe it's in both countries mutual

benefit to have this situation resolved

on a bilateral basis that is our

preferred option we do believe that it

is in both our country's best interests

it is not it does not serve people who

are crossing into Canada does not serve

Canada does not serve the United States

well to have this type of situation I am

optimistic before that that could be

resolved as the original safe third

country agreement was signed in the

first place and that is our preferred

course of action of course we will

explore other options but that is our

our first course of action what other

options I mean your preferred option

what other options are there

well you know we can apply the

principles of the safe third-party

agreement at at other points along along

the border as well can you do that

unilateral unilateral well as I said our

preferred course of options to do this

is to resolve this in partnership so

that both countries can ensure that that

personal security that the health and

well-being of people coming through is

resolved but as I said there are other

options are other tools available to the

government that will also be exploring

this at the end of the day we have to

restore Canadians confidence in this on

this issue there are people in other

countries who are now facing longer

backlogs for applications because of

this situation and Justin Trudeau has

done literally nothing over the past two

years - more than two years to resolve

this issue

I'm francais we know not to have a new

preferable say the d'Ivoire in

in a new void in insurance to the dollar

on tone don't release it as a nearly

Canada myriad is otra opción on / septic

septic le le principe don't set downtown

Alessandra pound our door to the left

front yeah and if you'll just indulge me

one more why are you mentioning as 13

today

well it's quite clear that when people

come across the border that that it's

it's difficult for law enforcement here

to know exactly who they are and we do

know there are reports of people who

have entered into Canada with criminal

records or who have been identified as

being members of criminal organizations

so we want to make sure that when people

come into Canada we are putting the

safety and security of Canadians first

that is paramount and people who have

engaged in dangerous or violent activity

in the past should not be in Canada hi

mr. Schurr Mercedes Stevenson Global

News Harjit Sajjan speaking in his

capacity of defense minister responded

to the global news story about the

military looking to pay less into

provincial health care for their members

to use the system he says that the

provinces are taking advantage of the

military by charging them out of

province rates that are 2.5 to 3 times

higher than people who live in the

provinces even though the military live

in the provinces do you think it's fair

for the provinces to be charging

military members more than other people

who live in the province what I don't

think is fair is that quietly on the

just before an election a change is made

to this arrangement that significantly

affects the ability for our veterans and

our men and sorry for our men and women

in uniform to receive care that is not

fair and to have this kind of cut that

will have an impact not just on our our

men and women in uniform but also on

healthcare systems in provinces across

the country that is extremely unfair and

it's another example how Justin Trudeau

is such a hypocrite running around the

country raising the specter of cuts and

it's actually in the reality is his

government is engaged in these types of

cuts cutting health care services to our

men and women in uniform to our armed

forces personnel and creating pressure

on

angel healthcare departments but do you

think that the provinces are ripping the

military off

is this a cash cow for them look I I

think it's important that the federal

government live up to its obligations

when they enter into these types of

arrangements it's important for them to

uphold it and the fact of the matter is

they are now creating an increased

pressure on provincial health

departments and on the ability for our

armed forces personnel to receive the

care they receive that's unacceptable

Justin Trudeau has had ten point five

million dollars for Omar Khadr he has

millions of dollars to fight our

veterans in court but when it comes to

ensuring that our armed forces personnel

have the ability to get the care that

they need

he seems to be you know he starts

shortchanging them that's hypocritical

that's unacceptable

if you become Prime Minister will you

commit to increasing funding to military

health services I am committed to

ensuring that our armed forces personnel

get the health care that they deserve

that they have the highest access to

health care services across the country

rfrontier sure so it's a very good

question because it allows me to further

further highlight our announcement on

foreign aid spending what we said is

that we will cut 25% of the foreign aid

budget but in addition to that by

refocusing away from countries that are

relatively well-off that have relatively

high income levels and development

levels we are going to repurpose some of

that funding precisely into countries

that are facing humanitarian crises or

have extreme levels of poverty that will

of course

alleviate some of the pressure by

improving living conditions in countries

where people are currently leaving to

come to Canada but we must realize that

it

even with increased development aid the

only way to stop this problem is to stop

the flow of illegal border crossings

right here at the border and that is why

this announcement also contains a focus

on ending the loophole in the safe third

country agreement and he Blachford

Canadian Press sir you've said Canada's

relationship with China needs a reset

but you haven't given details which

specific steps would you take to reset

the relationship and would that involve

asking for a meeting with president G

well everything we do with the

government of China right now must be

done with within the backdrop of two

Canadians who are being held in in

extremely difficult conditions who have

who are being detained without any

justification that will be my that will

be what guides me and my relationship

with the government of China I have

already called for the government and as

Prime Minister I will send the signal to

the government of China that we will

stand up for ourselves

by pulling funding from the Asian

infrastructure bank I called on the

government to send a complaint on on the

on the trade file to the WTO much much

earlier they took nine months I would

never have waited that long and I will

proceed with that aggressively I've also

called for increased inspections on

Chinese imports coming into Canada which

would have the dual goal of sending

China the government to China a message

but also allowing Canadian Border

Services agencies to crack down on

things like fentanyl coming into our

into our community so those are some of

the measures I've said that would send a

signal to the government of China that

we're going to take the situation

seriously we're gonna stand up for

Canadians and Canadians interests and on

the part about president G well you know

if there is if there is a sign that he

is willing to live up to international

standards of justice and a meeting would

help facilitate that of course that

would be something that I would be

interested in but it must be done not

just for optics it must be done with a

view to getting those two Canadians

released would you would you we miss say

would you work to reset relations with

Saudi Arabia even after the Khashoggi

killing and concerns about Canadian made

military vehicles and how would you go

about it well I'm always very concerned

by the abuse of human rights in Saudi

Arabia I believe the best thing we can

do to show this the governor of Saudi

Arabia that we take these things

seriously is to stop buying things from

Saudi Arabia when Canadian consumers

dollars goes to Saudi Arabia that does

more to support that regime than

anything else and that is why a part of

the principle part of the the motivation

behind our national energy quarter is

precisely to get Canada off of foreign

oil and specifically Saudi oil that's

coming in to refineries in New Brunswick
