this is a moment when in the climate

emergency we have to say regardless of

where you're from or what party you used

to vote for if you're listening to our

children what you hear is all hands on

deck right now it's not only for the

federal government to take action

municipalities have been playing a

leadership role for a long time

indigenous peoples have been playing a

leadership role for a long time the

province of Quebec has been playing a

leadership role for a long time we have

in this country everything we need to

make a change that ensures our children

have a livable world while protecting

economic activity to be prosperous to

have workers have meaningful work just

to be clear the environment isn't that

priority security is our priority we're

talking about the collapse of human

civilization if we don't act in the next

18 months the collapse of civilization

won't happen in 18 months mind you it's

very important to understand the context

and I don't think anyone here fails to

understand it but it's easy to be

misquoted I'm not saying the world will

end by 2030

but the Intergovernmental Panel on

Climate Change has told us very clearly

that we're very close to tipping points

in the atmosphere that unleash unleash

unstoppable self accelerating global

warming which sometimes gets called

hothouse earth I don't think that's an

environmental problem I think it's a

security threat now are there other

issues absolutely we're very committed

to electoral reform this may sound

familiar but the years changed 2019 will

be the last election held under

first-past-the-post I'll be clear for me

I mean the Greens will work together as

a caucus we work by consensus the leader

isn't a dictator my view is that we will

meet as a caucus after the election and

each member of the caucus will commit in

a personal contract to abide by whatever

commitments we make if they're in the

interests of avoiding climate disaster

but I think it's very likely and I'm

certainly for myself I don't want a

cabinet post and somebody else's

government I want to make sure they do

the right thing

and I think the gameplan that I see is

being more likely is we insist on an

internal cabinet that ensures that all

parties have a hand in the climate plans

that are adopted so that after an

election we don't risk that a new

government comes in and cancels the

plans we've made we need to ensure that

we do this together because it's not an

issue it's not a political issue like

any other it's different and it means we

have to take decisions differently it's

not a shock but it would be an awfully

good I don't think I mean I don't think

a majority government is good for the

country I'll say that any party these

false majorities are dangerous very

concerned you're saying we're not saying

we won't vote for things we don't

believe in Justin I don't think that

that I've been clear enough I must have

not been clear enough any government

that thinks it can pass if we have

enough green MPs that in a minority

situation we hold the balance of

responsibility we don't know that this

might happen it's just as hypothetical

as I was getting a majority and me being

Prime Minister you ask in a minority

situation would we ever accept some

crumbs off the table would that be

enough if canceling the trans mountain

pipeline would that be enough no we will

not vote one vote of confidence for a

government that fails to understand that

we must hold global average temperature

to a level that sustains human

civilization through the lifetime of our

children's that's what's at stake

that's what this day one more question

here saying that you support spending

tens and tens of billions of dollars on

naval vessels I don't remember ever

being on record supporting fighter jets

we certainly support no actually not no

I'd be very interested to see if it's

not the case yes because we need we need

coastal search and rescue vessels we

need Coast Guard vessels we'd aerial

surveillance of our coastlines we're not

or not at all prepared for the loss of

ice in the Arctic so I just to be clear

I've never said we needed more military

training the contract because we wanted

to we want to have our naval vessels

Coast Guard vessels icebreakers are

important and may I clarify I'm excuse

me I'm the only member of parliament in

June 2011 who voted against bombing

Libya my record on being a canceled

bombing and I have never never did you

read mission your question is well your

question is bounded on things that

aren't true so I just want to be clear

I've never this party has never called

for more military spending just to be

clear
