that does they don't care thank you for

everyone to be here so without any

further adieu we'll ask the mayor of

Montreal miss viola brown to speak with

you Thank You Jenna yes thank you to

everyone for being here this afternoon I

wish to salute dr. ho when we speak

quite often these days dr. Doyle who is

the regional director for public health

and I would also like to salute mr.

Advani who is the coordinator for civil

safety for the agglomeration as well as

the interim director for the

firefighting services of the city of

Montreal so before starting I wish to

clear things up a lot of information has

been circulating for the past few hours

so I wish to reassure the population and

to tell them exactly what is happening

so know the city is not confined it is

not in quarantine either neither today

nor tomorrow if it some day it does

become the case it will be at the

request of the government of Quebec in

public health and if it were to be the

case it would be done in an orderly and

gradual fashion so I wish to remind you

and tell you today that we're not there

at all yet it is normal that the city be

prepared for any possibility and that it

has plans and consequence that is what

responsible administrations everywhere

in the world are doing and yes there are

certain sectors of the island that are

more affected than others but the

situation is worrisome elsewhere in the

city of course we're going to be working

with Public Health to limit the spread

in a general way now this afternoon

we're going to go to an important stage

in our collective fight against the

corona virus this afternoon at 4:00 p.m.

we had declared the state of local

emergency over the territory of the

Montreal agglomeration at the request of

the National

Director of Public Health dr. arruda

since the beginning of the crisis we

have been working together with the

expert team of the Center for

coordination of emergency measures and

the regional direction for Public Health

to take the best decisions the

established plan has been very efficient

up until now but taking into account the

evolution of the situation we have today

arrived at a point where we must give

ourselves new powers exceptional powers

to be even more flexible I have declared

the state of emergency because our

resources for homeless people need

reinforcements and they need them now

today it is the most vulnerable people

in our society who need us and I wish to

emphasize the heroic work of our

community resources from young homeless

are doing I thank them for their hard

work I also wish to thank our

Commissioner for people experiencing

homelessness mr. Sahu situation in the

day centers and shelters is very

difficult right now day centres who see

700 people per day are now closed except

for a few exceptions the shelters that

house about a thousand four hundred

people per night are reducing those

places for the past week we've lost

about 300 the homeless population ends

up without food without place where they

can rest and without protection and that

is unacceptable the premier is asking us

to stay home but staying at home what

does that mean when your home is the

street for for one week the Health

Network plan as well as the city of

Montreal are operating resources in the

field there's two new places downtown at

the complexity fefo and the YMCA that

are there to respond to the needs of

shelters that was now decreased the

number of available spots the Royal

Vikas Patil which is being transformed

into a shelter for the homeless

population that is declared positive to

the coronavirus or which who are

awaiting a diagnosis and then finally

sanitary pilots have been put in down at

the downtown area but we have to go

further than that there's new temporary

shelters that are planned for in the

next few days to

be able to make up for the spots that

are being lost in other shelters and

we're going to create outside day

centers in public spaces that are

usually visited by the homeless we are

creating five sites that will be able to

welcome a thousand people per day the

first one would be in square Cabo cooked

together with a CD on smokey eyed and a

second site very quickly will be set up

in the next few days this sanitary

crisis must not become a humanitarian

one and that is the message that I have

for you today and that is while we are

acting that is why we're getting the

necessary powers to be able to act the

provisions of the law allow us to take

all the measures to protect the life the

health and the integrity of people for

example we'll be able to conclude

agreements the necessary and require

private places if necessary to house

people will also have the ability to

make purchases of emergency material as

well as food for those shelters and our

day centers we wish to act quickly and

efficiently that is our priority and it

is this agility that we are giving

ourselves today to end with I am

speaking to Montreal is right now

because we all have the duty to respect

the guidelines from public health the

numbers that we see in the media that

we're reading are real these are real

numbers so we all each and every one of

us we have to make an effort to limit

the spread within the community it is

true than ever before and once again I

reiterate and ask the entire population

to follow the guidelines that have been

clearly established by public health and

the Quebec government so before giving

you news about why we're here today I

definitely wanted to set the record

straight there has been a lot of

information going around in the last few

hours so I want to reassure the public

and give them an accurate picture of the

current situation so know the city is

not under lockdown nor is it

quarentine not today and not tomorrow if

this happened one day it will be at the

request of the government of Quebec and

the Public Health Department and he if

it happens it will be done in a coherent

and orderly way we are not at that point

at all

it is absolutely normal for a city to be

prepared for any eventuality and to make

plans accordingly

that is what responsible administration

and cities do around the world yes some

areas of the island are more affected

than others right now but the situation

is serious and other areas as well and

in other areas as well

we will of course work with the public

health authorities to limit a widespread

propagation on the island we have we

have now moved to an important step in

our collective fight against the Kohana

virus this afternoon at 4:00 p.m. we

declare a local state of emergency on

the territory of the agglomeration of

Montreal this was a request that we

cracked the request sorry of the

National Public Health Director dr.

hakuta since the start of the crisis we

have worked with the team of experts

from the Sandow quaternion Demoiselle

Joe Jones and a regional direct

direction of Public Health to make the

best possible informed situation all the

time the established plan has been very

effective but given the evolution of the

situation we have now reached a point

where we need to adopt exceptional

powers in order to be more responsive I

have declared the state of emergency

because our resources for the homeless

needs to be reinforced right now

immediately at this moment the most

vulnerable in our society needs us I

want to salute the arrow ik work of our

community resources helping the homeless

and I also want to thank Sasha who the

Commissioner of the homeless of the city

of Montreal the situation in these

centers and shelters is very difficult

and so it was important for us to find

solution rapid an efficient solution the

Prime Minister has asked us to stay at

home but I need ask

we need to ask herself what does it mean

staying at home when when when you

actually when your home is actually the

street what does he mean what do you do

so for us it was really important to

assure that the ohm 'less homelessness

community would have a roof something

some food and feel secure so even though

there's been a lot of things done in the

past week for the homeless situation we

must go even further and this is what

we're doing right now more temporary

shelters are planned to be open in the

next few days to cope with the reduced

number of beds in shelters the city will

help create outdoor day centers in

public spaces frequented by homeless

people where they will also have access

to food we aim to create five sites that

can accommodate a total the other

thousand people per day there first will

be in square cable in collaboration with

resilience and the second site will be

announced very shortly in the next

coming days this health crisis cannot

become a social crisis that is why we

are taking immediate action the

provisions set out in the emergency in

India that's a difficult versus I'm

sorry emergency preparedness act allows

us to take all measures needed to

protect the life elf and safety of our

citizens so of course we will be able to

ask for some private accommodation for

example offer material and food for four

shelters as well so many things that we

can put together fast and efficiently so

and I just want to conclude by saying

the same thing I just said in French to

all Mon travelers listening to us it is

very important to follow the

recommendation follow the different

rules that were that we've been saying

over and over but we all see the numbers

in the papers and those numbers are real

so we do need to make sure that we're

all taking this very seriously where we

are following the recommendation and

this way we will go through this

actually together so thank you so much

for your attention

and I would like to ask the ductile

DeWine to share some words with us on

the situation messy so hello everyone so

today is a great day for mantra you've

all seen the epidemiological situation

the acceleration that we've seen this

week Montreal has community transmission

that has been well shown and today the

National Director for Public Health dr.

Arruda is asking us to set up additional

measures to reinforce the actions that

are really on course so that our entire

array of prevention be even more solid

[Music]

concretely the objectives that we wish

to pursue with these measures are really

to ensure that the population are

distant distancing measures are really

applied everywhere in stores and in

public places to make sure that the

people who must be isolated the cases

the people who are awaiting

investigation or results people who are

in places where we've asked them to be

isolated we had to make sure that they

respect that isolation order and of

course extra measures to protect

vulnerable populations that are specific

to our urban context the homeless among

them so it really is about these

objectives that we're going to emit

measures which are not being deployed

right now everywhere in Quebec but for

which it is not justified that Montreal

take an extra step as the mayor has said

I wish to reassure you Montreal is not

closed down Montrell is not closing down

Montreal is not in lockdown or

quarantine the measures that we'll be

announcing we will be announcing as of

tomorrow at public health fees will be

progressive measures progress measures

have already seen but now we're gonna

have extra leverage that we'll be

working with with the spbm for example

individual orders for people who do not

respect the isolation guidelines

probably fines

for stores that have not yet closed down

or for gatherings that are still being

held in certain places but I wish to

reassure people most of the population

is respecting right now the said

recommendations but following the spread

of the virus we can no longer tolerate

any leeway about these recommendations

of course we'll also be able to go

towards progressive measures as we've

been seeing in Europe linked to the

control of people in public spaces so

we'll be normal to see more police

officers in the street however we do not

plan on specific measures to just one

area right now we can see it clearly the

part of the spread is more intense in

certain zones and certain neighborhoods

but very quickly we are in a community

transmission staging so we can see it

from one day to the next it's not just

one neighborhood it is the entire Island

of Montreal that has to firmly apply

these measures more specifically the

measures apply to homelessness the

leverage that is being given to the city

of Montreal today should be understood

as being leverage to allow us to be

complementary to the health network

measures we announced earlier on this

week the health net worth already active

for the entire healthcare for the people

who are homeless the screening somebody

who has to be isolated and who is

homeless at the real Vic we are already

installing zones at the Royal Vic for

these people specific beds that are

dedicated to them for people who are

homeless and who need to be hospitalized

so the action of the city will be done

in complementarity for together with all

the homeless who are not ill but with

whom we also have to have social

distancing measures we can no longer

have 100 150 people in just one room

sleeping and we have to make sure that

they have access to food and two basic

elements to be able to live

and avoid of course that there is social

tension so that is the summary of most

of the measures and as of tomorrow we'll

be able to announce them to you more in

detail and of course I also wish to

reaffirm that what we wish is not to be

in coercive measures I believe that the

population mainly respects these

measures but now we're gonna have to be

a little bit more rigorous as Montreal

errs our wish is not to have police

officers give tickets left right and

center but if it is necessary we don't

have a choice we'll have to do it

because as we said we are here to

protect our elderly and also to make

sure that there is as few

hospitalization and deaths associated to

this pandemic in montreal montreal is

not closing down we're not closing the

the bridges we're not putting montreal

in quarantine the director Nationale de

santé pubic asked me today to increase

the measures to protect montreal hours

from the pandemic we've seen an

acceleration in the number of cases that

we in the last week we know that we have

community a transmission and we have

mostly in some neighborhoods but we know

that by in a few days it's going to be

it's going to be more in more

neighborhoods so the objectives of our

strategy is really to put measures to

make sure that people do respect the

order of social distance iation

businesses that should be closed and

orders to make sure that people that

should be isolated do respect the the

confinement order and also we want to

put some additional measures to protect

vulnerable population that are specific

to our urban context those measures are

going to be announced in the next days

they're going to be progressing

we're gonna see orders like I said to

make sure that people do respect the the

recommendation to be to be isolated or

confined and we may see some fines if

businesses do not respect or if we still

see gatherings in neighborhoods and so

we are going to be able to announce more

precisely what is going to be put in

place in the next day with our partners

spbm I want to reinforce the

recommendations I think most Montrealers

are respecting the recommended the

public health recommendation and I thank

you because this is we're going to see

the impact of the respect of those

recommendation in a few days I hope so

and you have the power to change the

curve of the pandemic so I ask everyone

and we're not here to put fines and to

pollute and we're not here to put

policemen in every neighborhoods we just

want to make sure that we put we have a

success in our collective efforts of

facing this pandemic thank you

[Music]

the question parade has started

unfortunately the questions are

inaudible demanding Mizzou get wrist

power measures that can be taken in case

it is forced by the government are you

ready

without having anybody panic to apply

bridge controls if we have to get to

that and if so what is your plan with

the collaborations of the Montreal

police and the area of Montreal I'm

going to give you an answer that you

might perhaps I'm going to find boring

because I'm not going to go further than

what might be it's something that I

found unfortunate today is that there's

information going around that come from

real plants so it's not invented but

which create a lot of stress this

afternoon I received a lot of emails

from people a woman who said I am in the

Laurentian I have to give birth in my

shelters I have a complicated you know

pregnancy window I had to come back in

the city that's just one example and

there's all sorts like that I want to be

transparent with my information but I am

NOT going to start putting forward

scenarios which honestly we don't want

to apply but what I can tell you is that

in any case we are ready and all that

has been done since the beginning in

collaboration with Public Health with

the Health Network or with the

government of Quebec and of course with

our coordination center for emergency

situations the spbm and the firefighters

so all that is concerted if we have to

set up other measures like closing down

the bridges let's say then we'll be

ready so what would trigger then more

constrictive measures I'm sure that you

must have some sort of threshold where

you say we have to measure these or

start them maybe this is for public

health yes that's what I was going to

say because for me the order is going to

be coming like the way it was done today

by discussing we had shared her problems

but basically it's the government of

Quebec together with Public Health who

is going to be pressing on the button so

who is going to decide on that threshold

well it is the epidemiological study

that will show us it's progressing

quickly but we were expecting it the

number of cases that we see today Friday

was what I had in my head as the

Director of Public Health Monday in

terms of progression knowing very well

that the cases that we have right now

transmit the transmission of ten or

twelve days in the past so we're not yet

quite seeing a slowdown linked to the

measures that were announced on the 12th

of March but which were not necessarily

applied perfectly right away I'm

thinking it took a few days before the

population understood the importance and

after that there was the intervention at

airports for travelers which what brings

us to make that decision we're looking

at the epidemiological situation the

acceleration everything going on around

we can see very clearly that Nevada and

the mythology are not at all

experiencing the same situation at us as

us and as dr. arruda said it is evolving

very quickly depending on the level of

acceleration tomorrow we'll be

announcing measures but it's possible

that in the following days we'll

announce more and the idea is really to

see how the population reacts and

implements the recommendations that we

are emitting if we see that we've

already recommending restricting travel

between regions it's already something

that's been recommended if we see that

it's pretty well applied well maybe we

won't go up to you know putting out

right beds however we know that in

cities for which there have there has

been a very rapid spread and very

accelerated growth it is the kind of

measure that we might imagine and that

are part of a scenario but there's not a

cut-off like dr. arruda said it's not

you know after a thousand or a thousand

five hundred we say okay we're getting

to the next stage it really is an

analysis of the transmission corridors

of course was still with 46 percent of

cases that are associated to

there's a lot of outbreaks but outbreaks

that are a lot in health care settings

so we know that the potential for

community spread is not the same so it

is that entire situation that is being

analyzed to decide whether or not we

will add subsequent measures the morgue

lives on anymore less have water I would

like to know you spoke with a thought

that you'd be announcing more details

what was going to happen tomorrow with

the police officers but what can people

expect as of tonight since the emergent

estate of emerges that already been

declared are things certain things going

to change quickly well I would tell the

population tonight like any other

evening it's the same thing if you

respect the recommendations there

shouldn't be an issue

basically the first stages that we make

sure that we have the means except for

the homeless because they will see a

very marked difference as of now to be

able to respond to their needs but if

people like I'll give you an example

right now we have 200 investigations

being done per day of people who are

confirmed my investigators are telling

me I had 25 to 35 people that I can't

even get in touch with over the phone

where are those people well by omitting

those measures we're going to make sure

that they are isolated we'll be able to

make sure that we go see in their homes

to make sure that they are respecting

the public health directives so we're

not changing the recommendations we're

not changing the intervention of Public

Health we are just giving ourselves the

means to make sure that these people

respect the orders and we're also giving

herself the needs in more difficult

social context which is something that

we experienced this week in terms of

mental health issues homelessness that

people to whom we're asking to be

isolated who don't have a place to be

isolated we create that tragic torii and

we give ourselves the means collectively

together with the spbm

and the city to make it so that we can

have places to isolate these people

Madame pom that gives you a lot of

latitude in terms of the powers that you

have with the spbm the police Corps have

Guidelines already been sent for what's

coming up tomorrow and Sunday I know

that a it does give us extra powers but

I think that just to make a parallel I

would like to remind you that the state

of emergency was declared yesterday

during the floodings it is exactly the

same thing it gives us the ability to

spend more quickly

it also can give us a possibility of

sending either firefighting the services

or police services in certain places to

have certain guidelines be respected

require spaces like we did for the

flooding so you know private places

parking lots so you have to see it in

that perspective I think that we have to

be careful to not send out an impression

that the state of emergency says if we

were in a repressive state that's not at

all what it is Montreal says doctor who

I was saying respect the rules and we

are very proud of it and I thank

Montreal errs for this but of course we

want to spend a very clear message that

if certain people continue gathering

we've already said it

we like chatting first but if we have to

give a fine we will do so we will do

what is necessary to make sure that

things are respected but to answer your

question everything is being deployed

within next actions and the reason that

motivated me to ask for extra powers

through declaring the state of emergency

is really the situation of the homeless

and I want to say when I said I don't

want for this crisis of this health

crisis I don't want it to become a

social one or a humanitarian one that's

what I was thinking of because I felt

that despite all of our best efforts of

helping out this population that is very

vulnerable that we were getting to the

end of our capacity to act and that is

really what motivated us first and

foremost

gozu Kipling novella price the first for

you dr. Hawaii I would like to know

there are close to a thousand cases

right now in Montreal the West Center

does it still remain the most important

outbreak center yes let me just check

yes today so with the progression of

cases it is still the same territory

with 38% it represents 38% of cases as I

was saying once again it's 42 percent of

our cases are associated to a trip and

traveling and we'll see it the

transition will be done and with the

community transmission there will be a

lower proportion throughout the days

that are going to be associated to

traveling but we can see it even since

yesterday in terms of mapping we can

clearly see that it is starting to be

going over to other territories as well

so yes it is more prevalent in these

territories but the perspective of

intervention for Montreal is going to

remain one of the entire island there

can be specific intervention in certain

neighborhoods to make sure but we're not

going to be targeting one more specific

area area to say we're gonna you know

put up barricades it's not at all what

we're doing so do you wish to

concentrate police activity well

everywhere in Montreal so there will be

guidelines for all patrol officers to

respect the basic guidelines weather for

businesses or individual gatherings if

there are issues about certain areas it

will be more intensive so they are the

ones that are going to go knock on

people's doors to make sure that for

example you were talking earlier on

about epidemiological investigations

where we're looking at this I wanted to

give you a little bit more information

about this tomorrow but of course we

also want this to be a human

approach we're not saying that the

person who hasn't answered the phone for

example is necessarily at fault there

might be a reason why they are not

answering so we'll be looking at the

approach to make it so that the

intervention can be done at this meeting

that will be done with with the specific

person are there any other deaths in

Montreal today in Montreal we are at

four deaths today nine people in

intensive care and 59 people who are

being hospitalized and the four deaths

is it in a specific place

I don't want us anything wrong but I

think somewhere in us here - cell D but

I'd have to validate with my team it's

not concentrated only one sector it's in

different places we always come back to

these questions but concerning police

officers could they go in to parks for

example give tickets and as of one will

be able to give you more details on

those elements it's perhaps not the

first measure that we'd be sitting up

but of course when we look at what was

done in other countries where we try

that people perhaps stay a little bit

more in their own neighborhoods when

they go out that they don't go out in

groups that when it go and run errands

you know that they don't go you know

with the entire family but that it be

just one view in person it'll be that

kind of measure we're inspiring

ourselves a lot with what was done

elsewhere we don't have any randomised

trial you know of course but we really

are looking at what European countries

and other countries have set up as

measures to have social distancing

measures be respected good afternoon

doctors we get it else we need the

suburban I suppose do you want no yeah I

will be asking these questions in

English because you have people

listening in English just your own key

repair it's a question on Facebook and

this question refers to West Island

okay this morning we woke up major had

major news daily newspaper informed us

that if we don't want to get sick don't

go to the West Island which is great

news of course it is not the west

northwest on the western part of the

city we get it could you tell me more

about what exactly is happening a in

côte saint-luc n D G and B within the

Hasidic community Montreal where there's

been one death so far I cannot I do not

have the the religious dara'a on the

core of the cases that we investigate

it's not a question that we ask what we

know is that we have higher rate rates

higher rates in some neighborhoods and

yesterday the raider the medium median

rate for montreal was 36 cases 400,000

of population and we saw in some

neighborhoods like côte saint-luc or

like amstead or tomorrow we had like 200

or 150 cases 400,000 of persons so we

know there is a concentration is it a

grape of families is it a context of

people that I've traveled or people that

I've been screened more this is quite

difficult for us to know what are the

specific cause around this have they

been to a wedding or some places where

there's a propagation so we're looking

at it but we know that the the maps

shows us that there's something

happening in those neighborhoods of

course but I cannot have a specific

diagnostic it's not there's not a

outbreak in an SSL day or someplace

specific but we know there's something

happening in the community again for the

benefit of the audience could you

mention its give me an English answer

damn if akes

question about some 39%

who were affected by traveling you said

no it's 42 percent of the cases that we

have right now that that our travelers

people that have been traveling and

another like 25 percent or so is really

people that have been in contact with

travelers that were symptomatic or with

cases so we're still in grapes of cases

but we also have communicate cases from

which we cannot find a specific source

that's why we're saying that we are in a

sustaining community transmission of the

virus thank you so much

tourism castillo palma de hond second

question for Miss Brown Madame pond

without wanting to play with fire you

also have the fine parade is a city

prepared for those sectors in French or

in English

perhaps in English if you wish there's

other things happening at the city and

we're looking at the with the spring

arriving which we were happy with

there's always applauding the risk of

flooding and last year was an episode

where we started we were prepared well

enough to really minimize the impact and

negative impact and not to minimize some

of the psychological or their stress but

at least we were able to very lower the

number of house and houses lost so yes

we are preparing we're working with the

different boroughs you said it'll be

Zabka fallbacks bajo unsick but also

some of the village as well just to make

sure that everything is is ready for

that but as you know it's also about

following the situation and kind of

crossing our finger that the water the

the ice will melt in a kind of you know

smooth way so but whatever happens we

will be we you know we will we will deal

sure many thanks

Alton anneristo from CDC just a few

questions

further mayor first I'll start with the

Royal Vick what has been behind the

delay in terms of opening the isolation

unit or the shelter for the homeless the

sense I got last week was it would be a

few days so what has been behind that

delay why's it still not open I don't

have the national TV can work so they

would probably be in a better position

to give you like that the very more

details but for sure

it's actually two floors or two aisle

that we will be using one for people

that are waiting for results and the

other one for people that are that needs

to be treated and so there's a lot of

material that needs to be put there in

terms also of making sure for the safety

of workers but also of the people that

will be will be going there so for the

from what I understand it's really

connected of making sure that the site

is prepared well done to receive all the

the homeless population within the

installation my second question is

regarding the site's the city always

looking at setting up what can you say

in terms of the resources devoted to

those sites in terms of manpower

equipment and specifically what kind of

figure is attached to those resource

like what is the financial investment

into those sites in terms of the

financial resources I will not be able

to give you the numbers today because

well with the state of emergency what

I'm glad about is it gives me the

flexibility to move forward quite

quickly so but we've already identified

the spots where we want to do whatever

is for the daesh's they Center all the

night shelters as well so everything is

identified we will be putting everything

in place in the next coming days and we

want to do this very fast and also

everything related to food because again

this is something that I'm sure I'm not

the only one not comfortable with the

idea that you know some people are just

cannot find food and in the city right

now so they'll be able to sleep let's

say outdoors or so they will be days

center outside for example in front of

the resilience Center we will put

and so this there are new power gives us

the opportunity you know move fast with

tents there will be food there there

will be workers as well social workers

and people there worse with that have

the expertise and we're also we have

sites for for people to sleep to sleep

in let's not forget that since though we

closed the rail mount to get ready to be

the kind of medical or operational

medical site we've already opened the

why and the sound Gustavo to replace the

while Vick but what we want to do now is

be more proactive in offering more beds

so the shelters and night shelters will

be able to have less beds so it's you

know it's better for we want to minimize

the risk of contamination and it's not a

clarification question it's almost like

a yes or no question from dr. Moy you

said in French for deaths today I just

wanted to be sure that's the total is

for so it's not for today in the total

of five it's for okay thank you look out

the window certification dr. Okoye

because on those numbers you said at

nine in intensive care

fifteen nine hospitalized and four

deaths the Jewish General Hospital said

that they have 19 people in intensive

care I just want to make sure that I

understand the nervous that we give I

give the number that the premier

announces but it's also there always a

number as of 9:00 p.m. de the previous

evening to avoid a whole array of

hospitals the Jewish Hospital also

receives patients from other regions

outside of Montreal I'm talking about

the situation people who live in

Montreal so have 59 people hospitalized

9 in intensive care and four deaths but

it is normal that the general Jewish

Hospital has more people in intensive

care because it absorbs also the

neighboring regions thank you doctor

Arruda

had not asked for the state of emergency

would you have done it anyway in the

present context were in a state of

sanitary emergency and the public health

emergency was declared by the National

Director of Public Health he is the one

who coordinates the action so he

delegates certain powers to me to a

certain extent to be able to emit extra

resources for the city of Montreal but

of course we speak on a daily basis so I

recommended certain things to him as

well but it really is the way of working

so the actions that we're setting up

right now are attached to the larger

provincial plan you really have to

understand like that Montreal is not you

know doing things on its own and going

rogue the actions that we're going to be

taking in the next few days are going to

be discussed with him a question for you

in a bit of a follow up after Amanda and

I just when you're looking at the maps

and you're seeing how you know epic

the epital epidemic at that's not the

word I'm going to say that's alright we

all love those today but when you know

I'm not an epidemiologist but when

you're looking at how these things move

and how the cases are spreading we've

talked about how it was a you know

looking in the the west part of the city

how are you seeing things spread

spreading is that changing like you know

who Tomas moves all on to the east side

of the of Mount Royal may we had like a

the odd spot was at the north of the

Mahayana don't we see that all the

neighborhoods but now we're seeing a

plateau hos ma we're seeing it's really

at the center of the island and of

course all the the fubu don't care

Santos sued so we're really seeing it's

really at the center of the island that

we're seeing the spreading but of course

we have some some cases more at the east

and west island but maybe I think at

this time it's more travelers that have

came back and that we won't necessarily

see a transmission a community

transmission at the end of the island

right now okay

my mana is just looking at how the this

new state of emergency and working with

police particularly trying to crime have

crackdowns now we've had some reliable

to tips come in a police stop stopping

people alone in their cars saying you

know where are you going what are you

doing is this something that's already

been pop put in place or as an ordinance

like this or has it come down from on

high to do this and also you know I what

about places like I live in the plateau

I see all the people that you walk

together whether their families are not

that are not necessarily 66 feet or two

meters apart are these guitar when we

were looking at Mount Royal at the power

at the park or Papa John Mouse are these

gonna be the places where we're talking

about police in public that are going to

be where you know we're not gonna

certainly see a crackdown but more so to

ensure that the social safety measures

and physical distancing measures are

being respected well the presence of

police officers will increase and that's

the whole point it's one of the well not

the whole point because it's not what

motivated us at the first to move

forward with the state of emergency but

of course is to send a message that this

needs to be taking very seriously and

though we know that for a family to be

kind of close together is one thing but

of course people need to be super

vigilant and to respect the two meters

separation within whatever they're in

the park or walking in the streets and

like I said that the most of Montrealer

is like the the big majority are

following those rules but it has to be

it's not time to to to stop doing those

things and as a city or mantra we're

trying to be as more as proactive as

possible like closing the kids module

you know the plateaus passive as well

even in parks I mean I don't want to

close parks because like I've said

before it's for a lot of people it's the

only backyard they have so but people

need to be super vigilant like I said

there's many many parks in much

we though we loved the mountain we don't

have to all go there this weekend please

and if you feel like there's a lot of

people you should maybe switch go

somewhere else

and we've also decided to close the the

stairs because a lot of people addressed

to me that the stairs on the maha yl

were super busy so we decided to close

those stairs serve for now so you know

the city adapts but the population

definitely needs to continue to take

those recommendation very seriously but

our police being told at all to stop

people in their cars to ask where

they're going where they're going no

we're not there I think it's if we see a

lot of people in a car I'm sure a police

officer would probably feel comfortable

to say the distance or like maybe you

know ask some question but we're more

into places outside like I said into to

do some to raise awareness that's

definitely what we we will continue on

doing but some if some people if the

police officers feels like some people

are just reluctant and don't want to

cooperate well they will be able to file

a find I find its Guillemot Sluman

trailers be able to continue taking

walks in the cities of the city it is

probably the last thing that we want to

take away from our elders right now we

wish for people to be able to continue

walking around

of course the more your respect the

distancing guidelines in the park for

example when you walk the idea is to you

know know not go out and walk with a

group of five people so the more you

follow the guidelines the more we'll be

able to not restrict that for us it's

really important it's already difficult

all the measures that we are requiring

right now spring is coming if we are

forced to ask and if omitting

restrictions on that we would be very

sorry for it so I believe that if

everybody makes the collective effort of

applying the rules we'll be able to

continue walking for a long time

you leak at this exam of the four tests

that you mentioned doctor why are these

all elderly people I'll be able to

confirm I do not have the numbers here

but I believe so I know that three are

but the last one I don't have the age I

have it in my phone sorry thank you

everyone
