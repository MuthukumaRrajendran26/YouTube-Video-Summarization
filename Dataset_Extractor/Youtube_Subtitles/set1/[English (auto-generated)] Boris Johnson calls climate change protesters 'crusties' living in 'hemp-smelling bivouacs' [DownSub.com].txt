my own team didn't want me to come to

this event tonight because they said

that there were some uncooperative

Krusty's and protestors of all kinds

littering the the road and they said

there was some risk that I would be

egged on my way in here and so I

immediately asked the faint hearts in my

private office

what would Margaret Thatcher have done

tonight

what would Maggie do and we are waylaid

in the streets as I'm sure we will be by

importunate nose ringed dreadlocked

climate change protestors we remind them

that she was also right before her time

about greenhouse gases and she took it

seriously

she took it seriously long before Greta

tunberg and the best thing possible for

the education of the denizens of those

heaving hemp smelling bivouacs that now

litter Trafalgar Square and an Hyde Park

and the rest of the best thing for them

would be to stop blocking the traffic

and buy a copy of Charles's magnificent

book

you
