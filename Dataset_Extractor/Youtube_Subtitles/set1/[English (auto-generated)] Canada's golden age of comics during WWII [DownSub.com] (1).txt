at 92 the paintbrush is still very much

a part of Jerry lazarre's life 45 years

painting 20 before that as an

illustrator and it all started when he

was given his first job drawing comics

as a 16 year old I was too young for the

war or I couldn't do the comics I'd be

at war so during the war I started a

career and it never ended in 1941 the

Canadian government implemented the war

exchange Conservation Act which limited

what could be imported from the US one

item that was banned comic books so with

no Captain America the door opened for

Canadian publishers to step in with

their own creations

that's when Johnny Canuck Brock Windsor

Nelvana and Canada Jack were born when I

first started I was doing someone else's

characters who had been drafted or had

come before me but after a while I

created I think it was about nine

characters of my own many of the stories

had the Nazis as the bad guys not a big

stretch for the time but it was

effective Johnny Canuck once took on

Hitler himself another popular character

was Nelvana

an Inuit half goddess who was not only

Canada's first super heroine she

predated the first Wonder Woman comic by

four months the worlds of Nelvana in the

worlds of Wonder Woman are very very

different

Wonder Woman for example was set in a

feminist utopia and had lots of S&M and

bondage themes to it and they'll Vanna

was pretty much just a chicken and

miniskirt who fought Nazis but the

Canadian comics of the Second World War

were much more than just heroes punching

Nazis and this page shows a boy sammy

kershaw from Sarnia aged 10 who in ten

months

rounded up 11,000 329 pounds of Salvage

kids could earn the honor of having

their likeness appear in print or join

fan clubs to connect with like-minded

readers coast to coast in many ways the

comics became the first social network

well that is the key of what these

comics were about for me not the

superheroes

but the fact that they brought kids

together with victory in Europe American

comics with their full-color pages were

free to flood the market and Canadian

superheroes largely vanished but not

before leaving a lasting impression on a

generation of young readers ready to

welcome the real-life heroes home
