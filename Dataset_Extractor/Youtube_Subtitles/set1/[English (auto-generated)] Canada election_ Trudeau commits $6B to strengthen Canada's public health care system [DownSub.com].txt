to be back in Hamilton alongside many

candidates particularly our Liberal

candidate for right here in Hamilton

center

Jasper tkachev ski Jasper has always

been passionate about social justice

from representing refugees as a lawyer

to fighting for the victims of

gender-based violence as a prosecutor

Jasper is ready to be a strong voice for

his community but first we've got an

election to win

on October 21st we all have an important

choice to make we have to decide what

kind of Canada we want to build together

and the choice could not be clearer

liberals won't reward big polluters gun

pollute gun makers and the wealthiest 1%

with the tax cut but the Conservatives

will they always do and the fine print

well they'll pay for it by cutting the

public services you and your family rely

on you can set your clock by it

exhibit a Doug Ford on the campaign

trail conservative politicians love to

say they're for the people but we know

what happens once they're in office

families here in Ontario have seen just

how far they're willing to go to help

the wealthiest few how quickly they will

make cuts to public health and to the

services people rely on most they don't

understand you can't cut your way to

prosperity Doug for threatened cuts to

Ontario's autism program he canceled an

out of country Oh hibbett program and he

cut Ontario's Pharma care program that

was focused on the needs of kids and

young adults rewarding the wealthy and

big polluters and making life harder for

the middle class

that's what conservative politicians do

and now and Beshear wants you to double

down on conservative politicians twice

the tax breaks for big polluters and the

wealthy and twice the cuts for you and

your family there aren't enough teachers

offering courses in Ontario this year

for grade 12s to put together the

credits

need to graduate think about that that's

what happens when the government focuses

on Bukka beer I'm not for doubling down

on the conservatives I'm for moving

forward with you that's why we decided

to invest in people and in their future

we're off to a great start but we also

know there's a lot more work to do

like many Canadians I'm proud to live in

a country where we have universal health

care but I also know that our system is

not perfect right now too many people

are falling through the cracks parents

and children who have to spend the night

at the ER because they don't have a

family doctor injured workers who can't

afford the medicine they need to get

back on their feet

teenagers struggling with mental illness

who don't know there are professionals

who can help widows who can't afford

home care the list goes on and in a

country like ours that's unacceptable

every Canadian no matter where they live

who they are or what they do should

receive the care they need to stay

healthy that's why during our first

mandate we took some meaningful steps to

close the gaps in our health care system

to help reduce wait times and improve

patient care we negotiated a new health

accord with the provinces and

territories we also brought in the most

significant changes to drug pricing in

nearly 30 years which will save

Canadians approximately thirteen billion

dollars over the next decade and we set

up an advisory council to lay the

groundwork for national Pharma care but

we know there's lots more work to do

people are tired of looking for doctors

tired of spending hundreds of dollars on

prescription drugs tired of fighting a

system that should be helping them so

today we're announcing what a reelected

liberal

will do to strengthen our healthcare

system now Amanda barrel a Masada

the last four years we've made

investments to improve access to

treatment and address the stigma of

mental illness but it hasn't been enough

not for the thousands of people who lose

their life to suicide not for their

loved ones their friends and their

communities right now there are people

in this country who are dying because

they don't live close enough to a

hospital others are struggling because

they're on a wait list to receive

treatment there are just too many

Canadians who can't find a doctor so

we're going to strengthen the Canada

Health Act so that the full range of

mental health services are available to

every Canadian in every province and in

every territory having access to the

right doctors and the right treatments

can make all the difference where you

live how much you make or who you know

should not have any bearing on living a

healthy life a reelected Liberal

government will also work with

provinces and territories to ensure that

all Canadians have access to a family

doctor or prepare a primary health care

team on a regular basis to have the same

doctor or nurse practitioner to do your

yearly checkup and monitor your health

over time and help prevent illness they

make sure you've received all your shots

and conduct routine tests so if

something's not right you can get the

right treatment right away and if you

have a family physician you may not need

to spend as much time in the ER which in

turn reduces wait times to do this we

will start with an investment of six

billion dollars over the next four years

to support a stronger Medicare system

financial burden on entire families

especially for those who are too sick to

work to lighten their won't load a

reelected liberal government will work

with provinces and territorial partners

to implement national pharmacare under a

reelected liberal government we will

work hard every day to make sure that no

Canadian has to choose between staying

healthy and putting food on the table

my friends in the future the federal

government will have to negotiate with

the provinces and

caracals as it's always been the case to

reach new health the courts when that

time comes who do you want at the

negotiation table standing up to Doug

Ford Andrew Shearer who follows Doug

Ford's lead or our liberal team that

will fight for you I got into politics

because I believe that all Canadians no

matter who they are what they do or

where they're from deserve a team that

listens to them cares for them and

fights for them a team that puts them

first together we have built that team

and we've accomplished a lot these past

four years but the truth is we're just

getting started on October 21st

Canadians have an important choice to

make will we go back to the failed

policies of the past or will we continue

to move forward

that's the choice it's that clear and

it's that important time for moving

forward for everyone is this working

sorry mr. David Ingram Reuters you made

clear that Pharma care is only gonna

happen after negotiations with the

provinces and the territories given the

fractious history of talks between the

federal government and provinces and a

whole bunch of topics including

healthcare y'all remember Paulo Martin's

experiences what gives you any

confidence at all that all 14 levels of

government are going to be on the same

page at the same time to even begin to

push this through we were able to

renegotiate health accords with all 10

provinces and 3 territories during our

first mandate with including important

investments in home care and in mental

health care but we know there's more to

do and part of that is moving forward

and making sure that no Canadian ever

has to choose between paying for

groceries and paying for medication and

we've taken many steps

on exactly that during this mandate to

bring down the costs of prescription

drugs but we know there's more to do and

that's why we're going to have to

negotiate with the provinces as

recommended and as recognized in the

expert report on the implementation of

universal national pharmacare so the

question becomes for Canadians who do

you want

negotiating with Doug Ford when it comes

to your health canadian key choisir Nike

Ford so that's all t but secondly how

does it serve your interests to smack

down mr. Ford as you've just done to

work with you I think it's very clear

that conservative politicians have a

track record of saying they are for the

people and then delivering tax breaks to

the wealthiest and cuts to everyone else

that is the choice facing Canadians on

whether they want to double down on that

conservative approach or whether they

want to choose forward we are always

going to stand up for Canadians stand up

for hardworking families who need help

getting ahead you deserve health care

and that's why when it comes to

negotiating with the provinces who do

you want negotiating with Doug Ford

that's the question people have to ask

themselves today CBC News

so the PPO has costed national Pharma

care program at 19 billion dollars a

year this is just six billion over the

next four years and it includes access

to a family doctor as well and the steps

towards the pharma care program these

are big lofty

promises that are very costly how can

Canadians trust that you can deliver on

these things that we've been hearing so

much about for so many years we promised

three billion dollars over four years in

the 2015 election and then went on to

negotiate health care accords with the

provinces that have made a significant

difference in healthcare outcomes across

the country particularly when it comes

to home care and mental health who we

recognize there's more to do that's why

we're putting forward a commitment of

six billion dollars over the next four

years to engage with the provinces on

these priorities that all Canadians

recognize needing to be able to find a

family doctor right across the country

needing to be able to afford medications

that are so key to health care in the

21st century a needing to know that

mental health supports and care are

there when people need them and yes that

will involve negotiation with the

provinces and the question becomes who

do you want negotiating with Doug Ford

on the future of your health care we

know that there is always much more to

do and that is why we are putting

forward concrete investments that will

lead Canadians to be able to find a

family doctor that will remove that

impossible choice between groceries and

medications for so many Canadians and it

will provide mental health care for more

Canadians right across the country in

times of crisis but we know that it does

require work with and negotiation with

the provinces and again that question

for Canadians is who do you want

negotiating the future of your health

care with Doug Ford at Glenn McGregor

CTV News mr. Trudeau I'm interested in

your starting point for that negotiation

philosophically do you believe that all

Canadians should have exactly the same

access to medicine they need or should

some Canadians

be able to get better access more

comprehensive coverage through employer

plans and essentially do you envision a

one tier access system in medicine or

two-tier we believe in universal

pharmacare as laid out in the principles

of the Eric Hoskins expert report but

part of that report recognizes that it's

not just the federal government that can

drop in a national pharma care program

across the country that it requires

partnerships and negotiations across

provinces and territories that's why the

question that we have to come back to in

this election on so many different

things is who do you want standing up

for you who do you want negotiating with

Doug Ford when it comes to your health

care I mean this is so good confusion

about this is this gonna be a system

where a government plan is replacing

employer health benefits right now there

are Canadians who are facing impossible

choices between their groceries and

their medications and that means people

choose to skip doses or they skip a meal

that is unacceptable in a country as

with as many opportunities and as many

resources as Canada that's why we need

to move forward in making sure that

everyone has access to the medications

they need unlike Andrew Shearer who does

not think that we need to help Canadians

afford their medications we know that

there is much more to do and that's why

we will be guided by the principles laid

out in the expert panel and climb on the

expert report on Pharma care in our

negotiations with the provinces in our

moving towards Universal Pharma care

which is something we have already take

taken tangible and concrete steps on but

again the question for Canadians is who

do they want negotiating with Doug for

Doug for it on their future

let's be extra clear here there's a

difference between national and

universal pharmacare national with the

PBO costed at four national because it

included co-payments from insurance

companies then there's the universal

guys are using this term interchangeably

we'd like clarification on what exactly

are you promising Canadians who would be

covered and who would be not by a farmer

care program under the Liberals the

expert report on pharmacare that we

commissioned that looked at different

models that looked at different

initiatives that looked at services and

options across the country made a series

of recommendations to move forward to

make sure that nobody ever has to face

those impossible choices between paying

for groceries or heating and paying for

the medication that they need or their

loved ones need and that is the report

that will guide us forward but we also

know that no federal government can

impose national pharmacare on its own we

need to negotiate with the provinces and

territories in order to do that and

those discussions will happen we have

already taken significant steps on

creating a Canadian drug agency on

moving forward with high cost

medications for rare diseases and for

lowering drug prices by thirteen billion

dollars over the next ten years these

are steps the federal government has

taken already and we are going to

continue to do that in partnership with

the provinces and territories to

determine that model that flows from

the expert panel the expert report but

the question when it comes to those

negotiations that are going to have to

happen is who do you want negotiating

with Doug Ford when it comes to the

future of your healthcare pharma care

it's understandable that you need to

negotiate with the provinces but can you

provide any kind of a of a timeline or

any kind of a cost of what this national

the cost of bringing in we are

announcing today a six billion dollar

down payment over the next three years

on implementation of national pharmacare

on making sure that more Canadians there

all Canadians have access to a family

doctor or a healthcare team and get

better access to mental health services

that we recognize are an essential part

of healthcare right now we know that the

Canada healthcare Canada Health Act

needs to include clear standards and

expectations for right across the

country around mental health these are

the things we will be moving forward

with these are the investments we're

going to be making in partnership with

the provinces and we were able in our

first mandate to sign landmark

agreements with every single province

and territory on moving forward on

renewing or help the courts on investing

specifically in mental health and home

care and this is the next step on that

and making sure the Canadians see the

right future for their healthcare system

and not as the choice that people are

facing whether we continue to move

forward or whether we go back to the

Harper years by doubling down on

conservatives who believe in cuts

we are going to be continuing to invest

in a better future for all Canadians and

universal pharmacare according to the

governing is about choices but in this

election aren't you just offering voters

all the candy in the candy store on the

contrary we have demonstrated over the

past four years that an approach that

invests in communities invests in

Canadians is exactly the way to grow the

economy for ten years job creation

economic growth was stalled under

Stephen Harper because he still believed

that trickle-down that giving advantages

to the wealthiest

was the way to create economic growth

well he failed Canadians with his vision

and we demonstrated that we could both

create over a million new jobs most of

them full-time and lift nine hundred

thousand Canadians out of poverty

including over 300,000 kids by investing

in communities by investing in Canadians

by investing in our future and we did so

in a way that remains fiscally respond

our debt continues to decline as a share

of our GDP and we continue to get top

ratings from the international credit

agencies we have an approach that has

worked for the past four years and

helped Canadians in an uncertain world

in uncertain times our approach is to

continue to choose forward and Canadians

have a choice between returning to the

failed Harper approach with Andrew

Shearer or moving forward with us

published a story showing some of the

founding signatories to the People's

Party of Canada have either current or

past ties to neo-nazi groups soldiers of

oden far-right groups in light of this

would you ask the debate Commissioner to

reconsider the decision to allow mr.

Bernier in the debate in the last

election Stephen Harper gained the

system around debates cherry-picked

which ones he wanted to do which ones he

didn't want to do we made a promise to

Canadians that we would create an

independent debate commissioner who

would make the determinations around

where when how the debates and who would

be part of it and we trust David

Johnston and his team of experts to make

determinations remove from politics

about who should be in the debates and

how they should unfold so that every

Canadian has a chance to watch their

leaders discuss contrast their ideas and

make clear the choice facing Canadians

right now I look forward to the

opportunity to call out mr. Bernier for

his intolerance and his approach that I

think hurts Canadians I mean I'm sure

going back to the video that was

obtained by Global News you mentioned

last week that it was during a rafting

during your time at the whitewater

rafting expedition and there was a

costume day what exactly was that

costume

continuing to be open with Canadians

about the mistake I made this is

something that I take responsibility for

this is something that I should have

known better but didn't and I will

continue to work every day to fight

racism to fight discrimination to fight

intolerance in this country answering

the question what was that costume I

have been open with Canadians that will

continue to be open with Canadians I

will continue to fight racism and

intolerance every day I take

responsibility for the terrible mistakes

I made in the past and commit to

continue to fight against racism and

intolerance every day

Kevin winner Hamilton Community News I'm

just wondering the Hamilton steel

workers are looking to unsee your

candidates they believe that you have

broken their prop broken you're sorry

can you speak a little closer certainly

a Hamilton Steve steel workers are

campaigning against your candidates they

feel that they've but they've been lied

to and with regard to the pensions what

do you say to them we faced a situation

as a country where our closest ally and

trading partner was imposing punitive

tariffs on our steel and aluminum

workers across this country while at the

same time threatening to rip up the most

important trade deal we have the NAFTA

Accord that assures jobs and prosperity

for millions of Canadians right across

the country and indeed underpins our

economy we renegotiated those Accords at

a time of American protectionism and

uncertainty and assured a good deal for

Canadian workers and for Canadians right

across the country have confidence in

their future and this time of

uncertainty and more than that we

brought in countervailing duties to

those steel and aluminum tariffs that

brought the Americans to lift

unequivocally those steel and aluminum

tariffs our approach worked even though

Doug Ford and other conservative

politicians said we should drop those

tariffs unilaterally

that's not how you negotiate with the

Americans we demonstrated that we are

standing up for workers that we're going

to continue to stand up for steel

workers and we were going to continue to

work with labor as an essential partner

in growing the middle class in this

country because that's what Canadians

need and that is the choice facing

Canadians right now do we continue on an

approach that has protected Canadian

workers right across the country or do

we go back to the Harper years you

talked about needing to redouble your

efforts to fight racism and intolerance

in light of these photos that came out

have you considered altering your

wait-and-see approach on Bill 21 in

Quebec in defense of young women or

monteri police officers want to be

teachers who are already leading to

leaving the province we have a situation

where Quebecers are taking bill 21 to

court they are defending the Charter of

Rights and Freedoms the way the Charter

is designed it is there to protect

Canadians from laws they feel or unjust

we are watching very carefully as that

process unfolds we will continue to make

determinations around next steps but as

I have said many times I am opposed to

any law that restricts Canadians

freedoms that tells someone what they

should or shouldn't wear I believe in

defending people's rights and I always

well yet see what they're not thank you

so much

[Applause]

you
