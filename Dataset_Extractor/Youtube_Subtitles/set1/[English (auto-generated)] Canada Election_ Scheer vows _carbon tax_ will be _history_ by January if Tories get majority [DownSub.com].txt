[Music]

good morning everyone festival food at

DC we are just four days away down from

Election Day and the choice Athenians if

you go conservatives you are voting for

a government that will put more money in

your pocket so you can get ahead we've

laid out a clear fully costed plan that

will make life more affordable for

example and this week I have laid out

exactly what we will do during our first

100 days to help you get ahead as part

of my 100 day action plan I've outlined

how a new Conservative government will

introduce the get ahead fiscal update

and we'll put our green home renovation

tax credit green public transit tax

credit children's fitness tax credit and

children's arts and learning tax credit

into law by January 1st I will tear down

the trade barriers between promises by

convening a meeting of Canada's First

Minister's on January 6

to kick-start negotiations for

aboriginal free trade deal creating more

jobs and more prosperity we will start

the work towards creating a signal tax

return and will bring in penalties H

equals a this week just true is

desperately trying to salvage by doing a

coalition deal with the NDP but this is

the coalition medians cannot afford the

higher taxes or deficits fewer jobs and

much

it is clear that Justin Trudeau will pay

any price to stay of power he's using

your money to pay and there is perhaps

no better example of Trudeau making

changes to pay more than his carbon tax

his carbon tax that there's nothing to

lower emissions but instead only makes

everyday essentials like gasoline or

traits of containing more expense and in

the NDP calling the shots and a trio led

coalition there's no telling how much

higher it would go we already know the

Trudeau is planning to increase the

carbon tax at a hundred and thirty two

dollars two times the price the

Parliamentary Budget Officer said is

needed to reach Canada's emissions

reduction targets the impact on families

working huge it will add 31 cents the

leaders with price of gas and four

hundred and sixty nine dollars for cost

of natural status all told families here

in Brampton and across Ontario be on the

hook for at least eleven hundred and

fifty dollars more in household costs

and that's the part to beat saying an

NDP have they're saved as Trudeau's

coalition partners and force him to hike

it even higher it is truly the coalition

you cannot

I've been consistent since I became the

leader of the Conservative Party of

Canada my first piece of legislation as

a prime minister will be repealed and

today I'm pleased to announce that as

part of my 100 day action plan I will

introduce and pass the carbon tax repeal

that there is no time to lose

we will use every available legislative

tool to overcome any obstruction and

delay is that we pass this legislation

on time materials carbon tax will be

history by January 1st 2003 cinco-fone

metals and other council is a topic

sentence under their presently

they adopt a that was soul evolution

alternate access will occur on the iPad

at all apparel with a two days until the

legislative update second legislative

the tax will occur on the closer shows

the pass ad see the premier Tommy

okay this means that families in Alberta

will never have to pay the carbon tax at

all and it means the families in

Saskatchewan New Brunswick and Manitoba

families right here in a turn we get

relief from the Trudeau carbon tax in

time for the quarter and $400 back into

your family's pockets starting next year

now in addition as part of our 100 day

action plan we will pass legislation to

remove the GST from Holland energy costs

[Music]

we know that rising home energy costs

are a particular burden on low and

middle class families Justin Trudeau

believes we should punish families for

turning up the thermostat on a cold

winter day I do not in Canada heating

your home in the winter isn't a luxury

it's a necessity and that's why we'll

take the GST off of home energy bills

before the cold winter weather truly

sets their crews not a casual internet

or contacts of the Sun Tzu's hello and

update increase your legislative well

eliminated ApS they created frottage

eliminated tibia de facto - Melissa

don't see how I long for the map say

stop this will save the Canadian

families over from $100 per year on

their energy bills for the average

family right here in Ontario these two

measures will start putting three

hundred and fifty eight dollars per year

back in your pocket right away I need to

be clear though only a strong

conservative majority delivered these

savings I am the only leader determined

to help lower and middle class families

keep their plans a Trudeau NDP perhaps

Green Party Coalition will act

immediately to drive up to carbon tax to

just start cuts we need to understand

how the carbon tax rates making filling

your gas tank or heating your home

unaffordable it's not a side effect of

the carbon tax which is the entire point

of the carbon tax but we know that you

don't have to hurt lower middle class

families by climate change

there are better alternatives to the

carbon tax that's why I will extract

official opinion implementing measures

to fight global climate change as

outlined in our real plan

this will include a displacing dirty

foreign energy sources Canadian cleaner

the exporting Canadian green technology

to reduce emissions around will deliver

the first step Center plan to take the

climate change by global starting in

year one and we'll do so working closely

with our provincial partners respecting

their constitutional right to make their

own a carbon tax it's not the only way

to fight climate and climate change it's

certainly not the best it's time to turn

the page of Justin Trudeau's failed

carbon tax and deliver a real climate

change the lowers total emissions

trading scheme or

[Applause]

coalition food osed keymap expose the

accident

Phoebe DFO amid all we don't know the

whole possible we see together so the

choice in this election is crystal clear

a Trudeau NDP polish that won't work

together the carbon tax or conservative

majority government news last night Lisa

Laflamme you said but party to gets the

most seats in election should be the

right to govern you are a former Speaker

of the House you know the conventions of

a Westminster Parliament and that allows

the incumbent party to have the first

crack at former government are you

saying that that precedent should be

thrown up obviously

[Music]

majority mandate it is the case that

party at the saving Honka Honka on that

[Music]

one in five Canadians of the age of 15

is living with a disability while those

people don't feel their issues with a

served in this campaign are you

committed to implementing in the

[Applause]

it's my job to do music you want to

create finally confession from super

lightweight hippity because only the

Condor me a common that a planet under

Tama our function to bleep

[Music]

[Music]

I've got my own style approach we run

writing parties chapter NeoGeo this

party I'm very excited by this platform

there are a lot of new innovative ideas

[Applause]

[Applause]

I think this is it here they see they're

pleased that this is you

[Music]

[Applause]

your plan finds a certain infrastructure

but you're sending the overall package

how are needing to know whether their

projects gonna be the ones that get

posted so if we made the commitment that

we will honor all existing agreements

and all projects that they greenlit by

all in addition to that we have

identified priorities that help reduce

commute times so we were that means the

massive tunnel replacement here in

we are the only parts that are committed

we're the only parts that is committed

I'm the only leader that has made a firm

commitment or the Ontario line as a

young expansion the other parties have

not made that commitment in fact the

Liberal Member of Parliament had applied

that hybrid the senior Liberal Member

comment continues to criticize that plan

so it's quite clear that only a

Conservative government will see those

projects I have to know that it's the

Parliamentary Budget Officer himself too

pointed out for the liberal

infrastructure plan did not exist and

after 40% of the price laughs every year

so we're saying is we're gonna have a

responsible plan

[Applause]

it's important to remember this is the

choice choice between communities is a

liberal ndq coalition that continues to

ratchet up billions of billions of

dollars worth of new debt and that means

that or or of your tax dollars will go

just to pay the interest on that package

that's dandy beautiful coalition

planners are plans to get back to bounce

but they're responsible to make

investments health care education social

programs and eliminating corporate

welfare in 25 eliminate 1.5 billion

dollars in corporate welfare 25% of

foreign aid spending and eliminate waste

in that government spending like

parchments that is a choice now I make a

clear choice on Mondays and I'm

confident they will shoot

fiscal responsibility that one

[Applause]

good morning Christopher cup with the

world of mail thousands of Canadians

have died as a result of the opioid

crisis and some public health experts

have warned that your specific policies

could potentially result in additional

deaths so specifically what would you do

to prevent a death toll from rising when

you're opposed to things like supervisor

congestion takes what you said father's

injection sites that there must be

community engage there must be

companies decided to put these types of

facilities that is something they're

Canadian

support robbery we are the only party

that's also talking self-discovery so

instead of just focusing on maintaining

addictions we want to start the process

to ensure that our services available to

help them get people specifically we've

also called for more inspection is out

of course for shipments goods coming in

from China and that would also send a

message to China I've heard some of

their actions against in our exports

also allow our Border Services Agency

how could you specifically talk about

recovery dying is the drug supply well

that's exactly why I had

what's a balanced approach that actually

all that was necessary or significant

some

and in a case of someone that felicity

sure so we are committed to making sure

that our police or the only party with

us he's talking about illegal games

there's no that a lot of black market or

different types of drugs are controlled

by gangs and we're the sake of

increasing penalties at bringing in and

[Applause]

but the excellence in the addictions

fields say that to tackle the opioid

epidemic the best way is to treat

addiction by the health issues an intern

or to the colonel one so I'm just

wondering what it is about the evidence

that is there's a choice I can even make

on Monday it's clear that justice you're

going

many of his MPs have this is something

many of their colleagues

[Applause]

treating addictions like health issue

that you see that can help more than

criminalizing are you trying to score

political points instead of saving lives

she shares stuff you love it's the

Canadian Press usual on me what do you

think is the single greatest

international threat to Canada there are

a lot of threats like please take

seriously obviously there

evidence mr. Ahmed gratifies

our cyber threats

so that's

that's the second question satrughna

government made a number of strides in

the area of gender equity they placed a

priority on ensuring diversity of

government appointments and federal

balance cabinet did you send women

captive and whether which among goes

they'll continue with don't you go back

will always fight for equality rights of

all Canadians

you know you will have a cabinet of

highly qualified candidates

[Applause]

meesa that's all about what this eye

conference on the department is that

good morning mr. chair Katie Simpson CBC

News you said at the start of your news

conference a response to one of my

colleagues questions that recently there

aren't examples of government being able

to hold the companies in a problem

somewhere if they are if they didn't win

the most number C but in VC that's not

the case of 2017

the NDP they don't hold most mercies but

they are they are in power so my session

to you is you're a former Speaker of the

House who know the rules of Parliament

so if you recognize that to these powers

depends on waiting and it is quite clear

that Justin Trudeau will try to do it to

stay what I'm saying and the other

context is that a Prime Minister and

enters into

comes out of that election with fewer

seats than another party of resins that

is likely election that more in this

edge then okay Patti Davis yeah SSA in

common and even though the rules allow

for it you see

I believe that we have put for to find

out what these very

a selection of a very strong man they

were asking opinions for majority

mandate to prevent an NDP document

coalition that have massive deficits and

raise their tax it is clear that in

modern Canadian history the party with

the most seats forms the government and

that a prime minister who comes out of

an election with fewer seats than

another party resigns in occupation

I have been focused on federal issues

putting for our platform or one thing I

can tell you is that the people of

Ontario understand the damage that the

very same people who are instrumental

remains governments are now working for

instance we go and are following the

same place massive deficits you've been

campaigning like Doug Ford is a

liability to do have you actually

reliability our are measures that will

leave more money in the pockets of all

Canadians we're talking about important

investments in things like you know tear

your line

expansion making our communities safer

by going after illegal gang members and

people who traffic illegal firearms I

had illegal drugs those are issues of

speed directly to the people of this

province we're going to continue to that

connects your that here this is event

very costly to this concert promise you

know exactly after they come on the

kathleen neither dr. le the director dr.

serve they men or

[Music]

we have the ng speed committed to the

University we have at least one concern

[Applause]

and one of my colleagues asked you what

sort of funding you said you also be

committed

to restore the downtown blue portion as

well having spent a lot of my summers in

Mississauga taking the number eight

[Music]

[Applause]

[Applause]

Oh
