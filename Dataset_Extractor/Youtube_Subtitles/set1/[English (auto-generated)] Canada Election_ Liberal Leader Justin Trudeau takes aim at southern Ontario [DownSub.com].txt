now to the federal campaign Liberal

leader Justin Trudeau turned his focus

to southern Ontario today

Trudeau's chief target in that region

isn't necessarily conservative leader

Andrew Shearer but another prominent

conservative our chief political

correspondent David akin is traveling

with the liberal campaign David well

Robyn Liberal leader Justin Trudeau was

in southern Ontario for the next couple

of days it's the first time he's visited

this region during the campaign and

you're going to hear him talk a lot

about the Conservative Premier of

Ontario Doug Ford any number of polls

have found the premier to be

increasingly unpopular

and those boos at the Raptors rally

earlier this year a hammered home that

point Ford did not show up for a massive

rally Sunday in Mississauga

lieutenant sation bianca and rescue but

tweto was there congratulations Bianca

Ford had won a healthy majority in 2018

then his campaign featured the slogan

for the people but then Ford's

popularity plummeted and now Trudeau is

throwing Ford's slogan back in his face

the Conservatives like to say there for

the people but then they cut taxes for

the wealthy and cut services for

everybody else that line is part of

Trudeau's standard stump speech liberals

also debuted a new video this weekend

aimed at southwestern Ontario that's a

region heavily reliant on manufacturing

the ad is narrated by Foreign Affairs

Minister Chrystia Freeland in which she

boasts about the way her government

handles NAFTA talks we stood up to

Donald Trump on trade when the

conservatives wanted Canada to back down

Trudeau is trying to make the point that

conservatives like Ford and Shearer

wanted Canada to back down in the trade

fight with Trump and that would have

cost jobs here in southern Ontario

Justin Trudeau completely failed to

represent Canada from a position of

strength during the NAFTA negotiations

Shearer said he would ratify the new

NAFTA even though he thinks Trudeau did

not get a good deal with Trump now we

wanted to ask Trudeau about US Canada

relations about his trade deal with

Trump but for the second day in a row

Trudeau is taking no questions from

reporters
