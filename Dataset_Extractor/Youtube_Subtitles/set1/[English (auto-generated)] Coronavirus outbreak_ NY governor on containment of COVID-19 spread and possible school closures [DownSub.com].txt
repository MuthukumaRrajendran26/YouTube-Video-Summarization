slow the spread of the virus to a rate

that the health care system can manage

you are not going to stop people from

being infected there are all sorts of

percentages about what percent of the

population will be affected 40% 50% 60%

you will not be able to control that

nobody thinks you can but you can make

efforts to slow the spread because the

real question here is can your health

care system manage the influx of

patients that's all this is about and

China South Korea Italy it's the same

lesson over and over and over again you

get into trouble when the health care

system can't manage that rate of intake

so try to slow the spread so it equals

your capacity in the health care system

what do you do to slow the spread

test test test test we've made great

progress on testing the president's

agreement to allow New York State to do

its own testing is very important we

need more federal assistance in allowing

what's called automated testing which

the FDA still controls Roche is a

company that does automated testing the

president made announced an announcement

with them but it can't just be a couple

of companies for the United States of

America doing automated testing we need

more automated testing what does that

mean automated testing manual you put

the test tube in the Machine automated

everything is robotics it goes from 30

tests per day to 1,000 tests per day for

a laboratory that can go from manual to

automated so that is a tremendous

difference and we need more help on that

how else do you slow the spread density

control this

court seating arrangement that we have

here today reflects two things number

one that the LCA doesn't work on the

Sundays

number two spacing out the seating

reduce the density so reduce the density

the best you can

those are both slow the spread

strategies okay what does it mean to

slow the spread this is doctor foul Qi

great New Yorker by the way you see

everyone in Washington looking at the

charts of the curve the curve flatten

the curve flatten the curve reduce the

rate so the high point of cases is

reduced so it can be managed by the

health care system that's what they're

talking about flatten the curve flatten

the curve why do you want to flatten the

curve because the curve is not a curve

the curve is a wave and the wave could

break on the hospital system that's what

they're talking about when they're

talking about the curve if you have too

high a number of people sick at the same

time when they descend on the hospital

system you will overwhelm the hospital

system that's the issue here it has

always been the issue here overwhelming

the capacity of the hospital system and

that my friends is important you know we

spent you listen to the cable news all

day well why didn't we start testing

earlier why were we more prepared that's

all about yesterday right

that's all recriminations that's blame

we should have done this we should have

done that we should have done this I'm a

governor I am here today

I'm focused on what I need today to

prepare for tomorrow and that's what

everybody should be focused on you want

to do a retrospective on who should have

done what when and who's the blame put a

pin in pin in it and do it afterwards

let's be constructive which is focusing

on today and tomorrow there's an old

military expression that management

officials use don't fight the last war

this is not about what happened

yesterday we are looking at a new war

that no one has seen before this is a

case of first impression for this nation

we have never fought a virus like this

with this potential consequence so plan

forward plan forward you see that wave

try to reduce the size of the wave

assume you can't reduce the size of the

wave and assume the wave breaks at a

higher level than the hospital system

can accommodate I believe that's what's

going to happen so what do you do New

York State Hospital capacity 53,000 beds

three thousand ICU beds is that a lot of

beds is that little beds three thousand

ICU beds presently about 80 percent

occupied okay so that means you have

several hundred ICU beds available why

are the ICU beds of a are important

because the people who come in

vulnerable populations older people

underlying illnesses respiratory

problems they need the ICU bed they need

the ventilators they need the machines

that breathe for them

those are the ventilators they are in

ICU beds the overwhelming crush is going

to be on the ICU beds not the 53,000

normal hospital beds because those are

basically going to be people recovering

from the flu you can recover from the

flu at home if it's really bad you go

into the hospital they make sure that

you are not dehydrated but the critical

people are the people who had underlying

illnesses and need those ICU beds and

those ventilators 3000 goes very very

quickly on any projection of these

numbers she reopens schools closed

schools a number of schools have closed

we've added Jim mellitus you all

remember Jim mellitus he used to work

here

he then semi-retired went to academia he

doesn't consider it semi retirement but

I like to perk him that way close the

schools it's not that easy it's not that

simple close the schools for many

families the school is childcare if the

student if they you close the schools

and the children are home a large

percentage of the workforce may say I

have to stay home and take care of my

children there are school districts that

are in wealthier parts of the state

where the family is in a position where

one parent stays home or where they can

hire a caregiver to stay at home but

then there's everybody else right I'm

from Queens Queens New York I grew up in

a very working-class neighborhood there

most families don't have a caregiver at

home if the children stay home one of

the parents have to stay home if there's

only one parent in the

that parent has to stay home yeah but we

have essential workers who need to go to

work

police people fire officers health care

workers again because we said this is

all about the capacity of the healthcare

system we can't have 1199 healthcare

workers not coming to work because they

have to stay home we can't have nurses

staying home because they have to stay

home and watch their child so it sounds

simple it's not simple you close the

school how do you feed the children

for many children the breakfast and the

lunch are the two main meals they get

and they get that at the school how do

you distribute food to all these

children who are now not in school so

those are very real concerns if you can

address those concerns address the

negatives of closing the schools then

yes close the schools why because it's

totally in line with our density

reduction etc these concerns can be

addressed and it's up to the locality to

come up with a plan to do it we're

speaking to Nassau Suffolk and

Westchester County Executive Laura

Curran County Executive steeple on

Suffolk County Executive George Latimer

in in Westchester they're interested in

closing schools we said closing schools

if you can you can reduce the negative

child care etc student meals then I

think it's a good strategy but we have

to address those two negatives the worst

negative is if we lose essential workers

police officers say I can't come to work

firefighters say I can't come to work

public transportation operators say I

can't come to work and most dramatic

impact hospital workers because remember

the hospital workers there will be

hospital workers who get sick that's

going to happen that will reduce

staffing in hospitals that has to be

factored in because you know that's

going to happen so given that you want

to make sure you're not artificially

making that problem worse

Jamal RS is going to be working with

these counties to try to put together

these situations that would take care of

the the negative consequences of closing

schools which would then facilitate the

closing of schools
