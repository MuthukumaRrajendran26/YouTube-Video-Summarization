okay hello again

so we're here today to give you an

update on novel coronavirus in Ontario

with a further update and I'm joined by

colleagues today the middle ear you know

dr. Barbara Yaffe this is dr. Chris

Mackay who's the medical officer of

Health for the Middlesex London Health

Unit and we have dr. Vanessa Allen who's

the lead medical microbiologist at the

public health laboratory at public

health Ontario and so what we want to

tell you mostly today is that we're

going to confirm our third case of novel

coronavirus in Ontario and just say this

is a little bit different than the other

one and that's why we're going to be

talking to you today

this newly confirmed case as a female in

her 20s who arrived asymptomatic from

the area of concern indirectly from that

and from Wuhan and I came back into

Canada on the 23rd of January and then

went to the community of London in dr.

Mackey's jurisdiction and at that time

she was asymptomatic and during her time

in her own location she noted some

symptoms and did the correct thing and

dr. Mackey's her to answer details about

that and I last was speak in a moment

that throughout this process that she

was seen she was assessed and worked

with the local health department was

admitted at the hospital under full

protection of the staff and that sono

staff were put at risk throughout this

process and throughout this time as you

can hear from dr. mackee protocols and

procedures were followed excellently

excellently in such a way that there's

been no risk at all to Ontarians or to

the health system in this process during

this time samples were submitted to the

public health laboratory at our one here

in Ontario and the testing had

demonstrated was negative and she was

part of our negative list on that one

there and part of we're gonna be talking

about today

is that in these this evolving situation

our laboratory systems are moving

quickly to keep upping the quality

insurance of the testing and they're

cross-referencing all the time and dr.

Ellen's here can answer some of those

questions so that during that time with

cross referencing with even more

specific and more different testing

different type and more specific one in

the National Medical Microbiology law

laboratory they contact contacted our

lab and said one of their tests came

back as positive weekly positive and

they had discussion on that basis there

and as med microbiologist do they'll say

well I think in this case on a

precautionary basis we should switch

this one from a negative to a positive

even though the level is very low and

the sense is that the viral load was

very low as well nevertheless to be

thorough and precautionary this one

should be switched to a positive case so

ID differs from some of our other ones

we've had so then dr. mackee was

notified as was the the person and they

continue to monitor the situation and

dr. Mackey is here to give a little

update on that as well and I'll hand

over to him in a second here so as a

result we've doing our testing and what

you're going to hear is that in this

rapidly evolved because remember we only

started this whole process two weeks ago

and shows you how fast the system is

moving how different it was from SARS in

that time our labs are really moving at

a quick pace to continually up the

aspects of their testing and comparing

notes back and forth and this shows you

the value of a level Oratory network in

canada which is known adjust ours and

Winnipeg but also we have our

counterparts in British Columbia as well

as that in in Quebec and they are

working back and forth to continue to

ensure a quality lab system in response

to this emerging infectious disease

issue in Canada so the majority of the

cases that were previously considered

negative have been confirmed as negative

by the national medical laboratory only

this one is the one so far that is they

had any question with and I said it was

just barely positive but they agreed

with our laboratory staff in Ontario

that we should switch that from a

negative to a positive case so

the risk continues to be very low for

Ontarians in this regard and in

accordance with a new case in london's

the same thing and i'm going to ask dr.

mackee

to comment a bit on his assessment of

the situation how it's occurred and

because he's the local medical officer

of health it as far as our protocol is

concerned it is his responsibility as

that along with his staff to deal with

any person under investigation and to

monitor cases and to ensure adherence to

reporting and find proper protocols and

assess any concerns and issues that he

might have had during this process so

I'll hand over things to you dr. mackee

thank you dr. Williams so we do have a

case here where both the system worked

well and also you had a patient who went

above and beyond to protect the public

and the people she was in contact with

this is somebody who actually wore the

equivalent of a surgical mask for an

entire travel from Wuhan to London even

though she didn't have symptoms at the

time she also went because of her

awareness of the risks associated with

travel to Wuhan she went straight into

isolation in her home when she returned

home the only time she's been out of her

home since then is to hospital for

testing and again wore the equivalent of

a surgical mask to protect others in the

hospital the hospital is well aware of

how to handle this sort of situation

took all precautions to protect their

patients their visitors and their staff

the the patient has been and continues

to be in isolation there are other

disease factors here which are very

encouraging as well first of all the

illness was very mild recovery was quick

within two or three days she was fully

recovered and also the lab parameters

indicating that there was very low

levels of virus in the sample so every

time she had contact with somebody in

Canada she was wearing a mask her

disease parameters are quite low and the

system took all precautions when she was

in contact with the hospital

Thank You dr. Mackey and so with that

that's why we wanted to make you aware

of that and the the aspects of why this

one was considered a positive and why

it's different than some of our others

in that regard and so we're here to then

answer questions that you would have in

regards to this now third case of of a

positive novel coronavirus here in

Ontario noting at the risk again as you

heard Ontarians remains low but we want

to be forthright and make sure you're

aware of that Williams can you expand on

how it can be that someone can test

negative for this and then it later

turns out to be a positive result that's

why we brought dr. Allen here and I'm

just saying that in this testing aspect

here as all our labs are working at

raising the qualitative in different

aspects it's a it's a dynamic discussion

or a saying but during that time there's

been no compromise in the positive cases

so I'm gonna ask dr. Allen if you can

comment what does that mean and how does

this dynamic process work thank you for

the question so we really had the

sequence for the virus on January the

10th and the Canadian lab system has

been working together to get very rapid

reliable tests the tests on this

individual was done a week ago and at

the time that was the very best test it

was the original test that we had all

been working on collectively and we

continued to work together to get the

very best test so the original test was

done well was done properly it was

appropriate and then the second test was

then laid on several days later four or

five days later and we all have new

tests that we've run it against and it's

picking it up so this is part of the

science of the way that we develop rapid

tests for a response to a new pathogen

that we're just learning more about and

really working lockstep together as a

National Laboratory system to make sure

that we get the best test at any given

time that we continue to work together

to get the best test and that we get the

we continue to work to improve that does

that mean that if people

test negative that they could then be

carrying this and not aware okay that's

how we've done with those ones that we

have tested negative and how you

continue to reassess that and to affirm

the status so we are continuing to run

all of those samples on the newer tests

both that Public Health Ontario and at

the National Lab and we are concurrently

having conversations with other

laboratories across the country to make

sure that the tests are the very best

tests that we can provide so these are

all being run in parallel as we speak

with the methodology as one can

understand with a very new virus is one

that rapidly advances and that's what

we're here to do is to rapidly advance

labrys a little bit more on the criteria

what you're looking at in this second

test that might be a little bit

different from the first that would deem

it a positive result yes so we are

currently at public health Ontario using

two tests and the National microbiology

lab applied several days later five

tests to this sample which we are

currently in the process of implementing

and so really it's about moving that

field forward together they actually

look at slightly different parts of the

virus and making sure that it's there

and and it wasn't positive on all of

their tests so again validating that

we're really trying to move together to

get the best answers for individuals in

their diagnosis committee else in the

household you mentioned was that it was

self isolation immediately where she

went they mentioned went above beyond

she went directly home stayed home so

anybody else in the house warm so there

is a roommate who moved out shortly

after returning home there was no

contact with the roommate at that time

the individual also has a an intimate

partner and they have actually worn

masks in all of their contact since she

returned home to Canada

I think just a confirm everyone who has

been confirmed negative so far are they

being retested so they already on a more

sensitive sensitive test and they are

all negative and they are in the process

of completing almost they have almost

completed all of them at the National

Lab as we speak and they're all negative

this would have been on a separate

flight as welcome the other that's yeah

lots of different flights is all the

tracking and tracing going on because

the let dr. Yaffe answer that is dr.

rocky and I said note said the person

was asymptomatic even back in Canada so

that flight in dr. Joffe may want to

comment on that the need for any concern

about that flight or knowledge of that

flight the bottom line is she was

completely asymptomatic on the flight

plus wearing a mask on top of it so

there is there's no risk to the other

passengers on the flights from her but

there was no need to follow up there

having there been in medical reports

regarding possible transferring of this

by a somatic patients I get there was a

case in Germany for instance where there

is a suspected person who did not show

symptoms that another person got the

virus so what does this tell us about

asymptomatic patients and the

possibility that they could potentially

pass this on we've had discussions with

there's various reports coming in even

with the German report there's more

investigation and it may not have been

asymptomatic so they continue to look

and review those materials so far as far

as the whu-oh and from also dr. Teresa

Tam said their assessment situation is

the information supporting that is still

very weak nevertheless we'll keep

looking and try to address it so that do

we keep to assess the quality of the

studies and the information to try and

understand that but so far their review

of the matter is and from any other

experts in our our network remains weak

information but we still want to see

what it is and be aware and as

that with quality information you've

also got two vectors in this case right

the case was wearing mouse which is

exactly what you would want even

somebody with symptoms to be doing

second the viral level was very low

wasn't even detected with the standard

PCR test PCR tests are excellent and the

fact that it wasn't picked up in our

tests means you know it's very likely

that the patient wasn't even infectious

at the height of her illness I think

that is that is the question that we

were dr. Williams was talking about the

evidence we're just learning more about

this it's a new virus there have been

some reports some of the reports when

they looked in the detail the person who

was supposedly asymptomatic actually had

some mild symptoms when they were

reinterviews so they were early in their

illness they were symptomatic so we're

still learning but at this point a

public health agency of Canada W hor are

saying that at this point we don't have

hard evidence of infectious infectivity

of an asymptomatic person and you

remember we said yesterday also that the

cases we see are very close family

connections person-to-person and the

that term they are not is is deemed to

be quite low so they're still trying to

understand that but doesn't seem to be

as widely transmitted at this time but

certainly person-to-person within family

contacts has been evidenced as in the

case we had here and in the Chicago case

as well and of course in back in China

can you speak to my wearing a mask in

this case was helpful I understand it's

not forever the difference is whether

you are sick or not if you are sick

wearing a mask helps stop the spread of

your infection this is why anyone who's

involved in the surgery is wearing a

surgical mask of a don't contaminate the

surgical field whereas if you're not

sick and you're just walking through the

community and also you know potentially

not trained on how to use a mass

properly not donning and doffing taking

it on and putting up putting it on and

taking off properly these are all

opportunities for contamination so

wearing a mask

when you're not ill in the community

doesn't make a big difference in stolen

home isolation or reporter she went

still in hospital so the patient is in

home isolation she's perfectly well now

she's been out well for several days but

she has she has continued to be in

isolation so those 17 cases that you

talked about have even I guess would you

categorize them is just still negative

or cleared I mean what's the simplest

way I guess yeah yeah we have absolutely

no evidence that there are negative and

we're repeating all the tests most of

that is complete all of it is complete

at public health Ontario and the vast

majority of it is completed nml so there

is no evidence you talk about whether I

was kind of flight Airlines flight

numbers than Hospital how long was she

in hospital which hospital was it

and what were the flights the individual

was at University Hospital in London

this this person is a student of Western

University but was not on campus still

has not been since returning from from

China the flight information will not be

released at this time because it wasn't

in importance doctor yeah he said

reading I guess so huh doctor yeah

answer that right nail we're going

through our protocols because now we

have cases and what is our guidelines

for releasing someone from isolation and

so I'll ask doctor you happy to talk to

that thank you very much

at the moment our criteria are that the

person has to have two negative tests at

least 24 hours apart before we would

release them but there's a lot of work

going on to figure out what is really

the best way to determine when they can

be discharged from razors but at this

moment until anything changes those are

the criteria for sure so she left

Wuhan on January 22nd arrived in Canada

midday on the 23rd it was the next

morning the morning of the 24th that she

developed symptoms on 24th she was not

admitted not ill enough to be admitted

in hospital they simply swapped and in

concert with Public Health sent her home

for monitoring there but this case I'm

the patient that was just discharged

from Sunnybrook Hospital and maybe this

is a question for you

are you considering this proven under

for her in London and what we just saw

at Sunnybrook I mean are you do you

think that this is a public messaging

here that the system is working and

they should take the fact that people

are self assessing and there they're

being running the hospital and now

they're being discharged and there ain't

no home isolation I mean it is kind of a

message to the public that the system is

working if you think this opportunity

for you to determine dynami most

definitely I think that gives evidence

of it and known as a system working as

we're doing in this case here we're

double checking on a number of things

because we want to know any insurance

working well but we want to even do

further steps on a precautionary basis

to make and to assure ourselves even

further so we're just not coasting on

that we continue to reassess and that's

part of our function working with all

our our partners in the system because

that's the difference announced ours

that they are all up on the topic they

all understand it and they're looking

for anything that maybe in their minds

weeks or gaps the system raising those

questions and so we have a lot more

monitoring lifetime assessing our

systems and that makes for a dynamic a

very quality response system in Ontario

dr. believe at a press conference last

week you said you were a bit surprised

that there were such a small amount of

confirmed cases outside of China and I'm

just curious whether or not you feel or

you're concerned whether the information

that's coming out from Chinese officials

is you know I think I said what I was

surprised that the number reported in

China was that that time so small

because I would expect it to be much

higher as I said I expect it to be well

over 10,000 and we're getting close to

that now because that's just in a large

oak break that in a large population

that had gone for a period of time it

takes a while for the testing

infrastructure to get up in place and

just doing they're just doing first the

most severe then they're going out wider

and wider and so as the Chinese

officials do that I was anticipating and

I was said I was reassured that they're

actually finding more and more and more

of them attend to be ones with milder

cases and so we'll get a better

epidemiological picture of how this

virus impacts of populous and large as

the system is enhanced and and building

up so we've seen that are in our own way

in other past ones it takes a while to

step up to that test so I wouldn't say

outside the country I said in the

country and especially in the WHO by

province in that area there

and so summer asked me why was I

surprised I was going up quickly I had

anticipated it's probably higher and I

will be not surprised it goes over

10,000 higher because it is a big task

and they're undertaking that I think in

a very aggressive and assertive way and

that is reassuring thus far - to us here

in Canada are you confident in the

numbers that are coming out from Chinese

officials that you believe that what

they are distributing is accurate our

information from WH on that they're

being very forthright on that

information I think the numbers they're

going to do a lot of catch up and that's

what they're doing now they're

identifying ones that where cases maybe

week or so ago so they're taking through

Anna's doctor Mac he has diluted with

his client sometimes the younger ones

may have a much shorter course very mild

but with the testing they'll come back

positive and so that only adds to the

numbers but it gives you a different

spectrum not just the severe cases that

are in the hospital

from hospitals is there anything that

you can add about the supply oh we have

a mean as regular ones with our

stakeholders including our hospitals

than that and we're looking at ensuring

that there is adequate supply both of

their current stock and then if there's

something in in a larger situation

so that's part of that feedback from the

sector if there's gaps in services we'd

like to know and if there's some

evolving new situations

we haven't heard that one in particular

but that's something they would report

back to us and then of course that's

something gonna have to deal with

internal systems that the hospital is

responsible for to maintain their

existing the stock and to handle it

judiciously according to policy and

procedures of our infection prevention

control practices so it's an a.1 that's

part of the dynamic and we I haven't had

that reported directly but it doesn't

mean it won't be and will be in concert

and discussion ongoing with our

healthcare providers

might have been a little bit older but

in this case we're hearing about someone

in their 20s to you what does that say

about the guessing transmissive miss of

this virus well it tells us that as we

said before even close in the area of

exposure in Wuhan where this person came

from the amount of contact should come

with it especially because you didn't

know who was who had and who didn't and

you have many close family contacts and

I think is that is the government

Fisher's going to find it's gonna be a

lot of young people who had as we find

some people said I don't think I was

sick I guess I wasn't had a cough or

something for a couple of days and I

felt like a cold and they get tested

positive and that may happen so some

younger people have a more robust immune

system and as dr. Mackay said in this

case the person turns around very

quickly as compared to our first case we

took a bit longer and it's still

recovering so I think you see the

spectrum of how the virus is impacting

the population so it's not the same

across the board and when people start

initially talking about transmissibility

rates and case fatality that kind of

stuff with a very small sample that can

be misleading and we're saying it's

early days let's see how the wider

population is impacted and we're

learning more as we speak and so this

one here gives an example of a different

spectrum presentation than our first

case this case really points out is that

you are a part of the system now the

health care system is doing as well as

we can in Ontario but it's also really

important for people who are ill and

have been to a place where the virus is

spreading to isolate themselves and call

Public Health that the the people in the

community can be a really important part

of the system in preventing the spread

of coronavirus uho yesterday declared a

global emergency I'm wondering how that

changes Ontario's response or alters it

in any way

so talking with the chief public health

officer of Canada on that who was at the

WH o table you understand is that when

the they declared a emergency of a

public health level on global basis the

main purpose was to ask the system writ

large to look at their preparedness for

their different aspects in dealing with

it as in what is your surveillance

capacity what is your response capacity

what is your infrastructure or

elaboratory testing of course Ontario is

in Canada is we have no problem that

we're not it's not named us it's so they

can do an inventory of some other

countries in that where if it did go to

those ones the infrastructure to deal

with a proper response like we're doing

here it may not be there so whu-oh has

to address that and saying what are we

going to do about that

especially if they already identified

one or two cases that have moved out

into the that area then you have to look

at infrastructure investment and so that

the WTO is assured that the globe is

ready to deal with it if it were to go

to spread to their other countries dr.

Tam feels and we know that can is well

prepared we're not one or concerned so

it doesn't impact us at all

but it's more that wider inventory on a

global perspective how would you

describe the province right now it's a

heightened state of alert of is it at a

highest level since SARS how would you

describe on a level of alert I would say

our system is on active monitoring and

containment type process monitoring the

people coming in as we're doing now it's

not widely spread in the area we have no

transmission occurring in Canada and

Ontario so we're not on the highest at

all we're but we're not telling

everybody be casual follow the

guidelines adhere as dr. mackee said

individuals returning do the right thing

in the right way at the right time we

have all those in place the education

things going out to the public and so

with that kind of assertion activity

it's not an apprehensive state it's one

of being aware knowledgeable and knew

what you need to do when you need to do

it and I'm happy to say examine here our

system is doing what it's supposed to do

the public and those returning are doing

what they're supposed to do and that's

very reassuring and so we're not in a

heightened level but everybody is aware

and becoming more knowledgeable and

I think the public discourse is that

they're becoming more informed on a

personal basis and we as a population on

that so that's our challenge right now

to make sure we maintain our public

education and they're aware of what the

status is so that a response and on a

personal basis community basis is

reasonable sensitive polite and yet

knowledgeable how many were a week or so

ago and now that our airlines are

scaling back place do you know how many

it's been reduced to I don't have that

offhand but I'm aware that some of the

airlines have stopped some of the

flights and we're asking as you asked

someone asked yesterday do I know the

reason I haven't been briefed and told

by those carriers why they're doing that

it may be yeah but I'm not pertain to

know that the regular flew a lot of

people go around their daily lives not

worried about the regular flu is this

that at this moment it seems to be

paralleling that and no of course people

have not been exposed to this novel

virus before some of the flu ones are

some cross reactivity at times I wish

people were as sensitive and concern but

Ontarians I've seen are pretty pretty

good about it it's still going on get

vaccinated we still like more to go and

get vaccinated especially the younger

adults and the children and making sure

that pregnant women are done so we

haven't given up on reinforcing that

message we still push every year on the

virus though young and healthy versus

people with compromised immune systems

it appears this fourth case bounced back

very quickly in terms of recovery is it

similar to the

early too early to say it seems to be as

we've seen the impact and in in China it

may be premature to say it's lighter

milder than influenza influenza is still

a very severe illness and people even

young people and it's more than just a

few days a couple of days it can really

be quite debilitating for some young

people to get it so it's not to be taken

casually is it comparable early to say

some of the things we're seeing and

that's why I was looking for the

population health data from the Wu hen

who by district to say on a population

wide what is the spectrum of disease in

your whole population just not on your

vulnerable ones and of course the

vulnerable ones that showed up first at

the hospitals of your illness and that

and they focused on that and as they do

more and more testing we'll get a better

picture just as you're inferring of

what's its impact on younger people

healthier people does it mimic our case

here it may be our one is not a good one

to sample and make a presumption on but

I think that's what we might see but

early days you made a comment earlier

about how this is different than SARS

and the way that the illness kind of or

the virus comes to light or close itself

differently and different people can you

expand on that a bit more is it less

predictable you made a comment early in

the press conference about how it kind

of I wouldn't turn my more the system

and the system's preparedness for it the

fact in the stars one we were well

through and we didn't know what the

organism was we had no laboratory

testing methodology the system was not

alerted not aware the infection branch

and control practices were not as

sophisticated anywhere near the surface

cases they are today so I was more

talking about the system preparedness

not comparing one organism to the other

in that and so if I gave that inference

that's not what I meant

and just to follow up on the question

about the flight information can you

explain why that you

revealing the flight number and

information as dr. Yaffe said because

the person are we have many flights

during this time came in because I said

there's a number every day where three

to two four thousand people coming back

from China we're worried about the ones

that were there someone who is

symptomatic on the flight and then we're

then we have a protocol of how to follow

with the individuals around that person

we have that's laid out with science and

understanding evidence this person was

not any so dramatic therefore we're

really not at this time we have no need

to know about the flight officially

because we're not going to any manifest

and I'm gonna check it out because we

have no evidence that anyone's been put

at risk if there was someone then we

would look at it as we did in our case

who we felt was symptomatic while on the

flight then we follow up with that one

appropriately so all the twenty maybe in

this time period 50 40 60 flights we

need to know that there was someone on

the flight that was symptomatic we need

to know the details of that then we need

to know where they are in the flight and

all that kind of stuff as the protocol

were undertaking with our first case

prove that you can be asymptomatic and

still carry the virus no because the

person might incubate but not

transmitting our evidence from the

double h on that is that people during

the incubation period are not

transmitting once it becomes symptomatic

they're showing evidence we have not

seen asymptomatic as we talked about

remember first question we the evidence

is not strong enough for that that

indicates and we haven't seen that the

evidence itself in that light so if that

changes will have to be in form of that

that's so far quite a bit along we have

not seen that being strongly evidenced

in the cases presented as far as you

mentioned that there's because she came

from Wuhan and who knows how many

contacts were tube enemy you're not a

you don't have any suggestion of exactly

who she may have got it from or how she

got it because there's

just jiminy got me a path dr. mackee

that's perhaps a question for you yes so

this individual had two parents who were

both ill in wuhan how they were both in

hospital but their illness was deemed to

be mild and in terms of triage with

Kuroda all just their illness was deemed

to be mild so they weren't tested so I

mean that's one of the reasons why she

was particularly alert to the issues but

just to add on the on to the question

around the the flights the message to

somebody who's been on this flight is no

different from the message to someone

who's been on another flight from Wuhan

you should be washing your symptoms you

should be staying home if you're ill and

contacting Public Health right away and

we would not change anything we're doing

with anyone who has been on this flight

compared to someone else who had been

off flight from Wuhan and this flight

was we have no flights from Wuhan

directly into Toronto they're all

indirect just to be clear what's the

advice and information that's being sent

to general physicians who on a daily

basis are seeing patients come in with

coughs respiratory illnesses or fevers

and aren't quite sure whether or not

these individuals need to be go to a

hospital for testing there's that kind

of bit of a gray area there what's

what's the advice I'm gonna ask dr.

Yaffe answer that question and then dr.

Mac you answer yes sir we we have the

Ministry has sent out some guidance to

primary care practitioners and it we're

recommending that they put up some

signage and if the patient has been in

Wuhan within 14 days and has symptoms

we're encouraging that they call first

to give the travel history or if they

show up then at least the physician and

their staff can put on masks and if

testing is required they would have to

have tested n95 masks or send them to

another facility under proper

precautions to get tested so the

information has gone out to primary care

you know we do get questions and it's as

as the information changes or evolves

we'll be keeping them up to date

just you know to avoid putting strain on

the healthcare system with people

showing up at the hospitals who just

quite frankly don't need to be there

that's kind of what what my concern is

is how are these general physicians how

do they exactly know which case is

symptomatic well yeah part of that is

the local public health is there across

the province as a resource any time

primary care needs advice and who should

go to hospital who shouldn't who should

go home how to manage them

we're there perhaps they're not as

vigilant and testing for this virus this

one would think they would be because

here a case has spread to Ontario where

the parents had symptoms so you wouldn't

have done anything different with this

individual she was well she still would

have travelled but I mean I think as dr.

Williams alluded to earlier it's clear

that the system in China is working at

capacity and so they are you know there

will be time before we know what the

full extent of the case count is and if

you look at confirmed cases versus

suspect cases that's a great example not

all those suspect cases will even be

tested because of the limitations and

testing resources and the number of

people ill so if they're in the hospital

today my guess the Chinese government

would attest them but early on as dr.

May said they're just rounding up

they're dealing only the most severe

cases they soon amount wasn't normal

chrono perhaps his only severe case but

as they find more mild mild day and they

get the capacity up I think they'll be

too far and wider and more at ease

testing and that's that's just part of

what the reality is when you're ramping

up a system under a stress situation you

know how the parents ended up in the

hospital

while in Ontario you're not gonna get

into the hospital of a mild you know

respiratory boat so how did they end up

in a hospital in China where the

hospital is supposedly jammed with

people again early this is this as weeks

ago at this point I don't have further

details unfortunately what concerns do

you guys have about people who may have

traveled from luan

to Toronto may have a low viral load may

be asymptomatic and may be kind of in

the community without the awareness that

they you should have been self isolated

because clearly there is a case now if

somebody who met all all of those

criteria but there may be other people

who may have arrived and not really know

and may not be taking those precautions

what concerns you have there may be

people out there like that and that

archidamus

the virus and it's a good question and

that's why we've been saying all along

we've seen that the returning travelers

have been very responsible in that

regard we haven't seen cases all of a

sudden show up and they didn't declare

didn't tell anything if they where and

we're getting the illnesses showing up

in our emergency departments and a

physician would you know elicit that

kind of information and test them and

say well this one didn't follow a normal

process at all as if yet we haven't seen

that it doesn't mean we won't pick it up

if we did but so far it's been very

responsibly handled and we haven't

identified any of those but again we're

being vigilant we're looking for those

cases primary care doctors detecting if

they think there's concerns that someone

has a travel history and of some

questionable level they can still feel

suspicious enough and saying I think

we'll get some testing done and send the

requisition to Public Health Laboratory

along with other tests because they're

wondering what if the diagnosis here so

it was that sensitivity and that alerted

awareness we haven't seen it yet is that

reassuring does that mean we are not

going to be vigilant we still have to be

I'm sorry and dr. Mackey the the woman

in her twenties she did she eventually

exhibit any symptoms yes

so she was symptomatic a boat he was she

arrived in Canada midday on 22nd she was

symptomatic the next morning so that's

when she went to hospital got tested and

went home into isolation yes she stayed

at home except for another trip to the

hospital get tested again with all

precautions it was just a last glance

what was the number of patients now

we're being monitored and the total

number at this point their patients had

happened

well we gave the numbers out this

morning at 10:30 and so were those ones

we have at the moment as you know us

that doesn't have the new confirmed case

in it so this is hot off the press for

you to know and so we're going to redo

those numbers and so we've got some new

stuff coming in more results coming back

from both from public health lab as well

as new cases coming in new PU is

personal investigation and the national

medical lab thing so once you bring that

data in we rectify the records and get

the cleared up and that's our process in

the future as these are getting more

that we then gives new numbers tomorrow

again because whatever give you within

an hour or two it's no longer up to date

and so we'd rather say as of this time

each day here's the numbers and so we

haven't changed the 10:30 we'll change

them again 10:30 tomorrow the woman in

this case is just moved from a person

under investigation to confirmed case

from a negative to a confirmed case in

terms of how long shot to stay in

isolation you said it's two negative

tests 24 hours apart and that's one I

guess from the moment that is the

criteria we're using two negatives at

least 24 hours apart any other tests

right now that are kind of flirting with

being a positive result there's none but

testing is ongoing day and night and so

these results are really committed

brought to you as soon as we have terms

take us through your testing so when you

guys get a swab I'm guessing yeah just

take us through that process in the

easiest way pal so first we get a phone

call at the lab usually in concert with

the local public health unit and we

request that they take two samples a

throat sample and a nasal pharyngeal

sample and the reason we do that is to

maximize the possibility of finding any

potential virus there we then run it on

several tests one is a test just for

other viruses right now we're in flu

season so to make sure it's not flu or

something else more common that's in the

community and then we concurrently run a

PCR the PCR then runs it takes several

six hours to perform and then we

basically do it an additional test

it looks like there's any RNA that's on

the results of the PCR and we spell that

out so we do a very clear confirmatory

test if there is any possible virus

there and so it's really it's a little

bit longer of a test and some of these

new tests are going to be much faster

and so we've concurrently been

developing with our partners much more

rapid tests which also have some of them

may be a little bit more sensitive but

we're running them all in parallel PCR

is looking for the genetic barcode of

the virus
