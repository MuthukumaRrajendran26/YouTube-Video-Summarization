good morning everyone it's great to be

here Nick Whalen our outstanding

candidate for st. John's East Nick and I

were at the st. John's regatta back in

August and I have to say it's easy to

see why people fall in love with this

part of the country the warmth the

friendliness the hospitality that's what

makes Newfoundland so special then

so other than Seamus O'Regan it possibly

can McDonald I can't think of a better

person to represent this video not

eleven it so when you never stops

working for this community and for the

people around you

it's so fantastic to have me here on the

team

my friends in every election we get to

make an important choice about the

future of hurtness we get to decide what

kind of kitchen we want to build

together in 2015 after a decade of

failed conservative policy Canada's

economy was flat each genomic growth job

creation wage growth all were stalled

thanks to a Conservative government that

believed cuts and austerity for the

answers to everything

Canadians chosen new team that was

willing to invest in people and in their

communities there's more work ahead of

us than there is behind us but we've

spent the last four years moving forward

when they need us that so many parts do

our best re thankful that that's why yes

they are not run Thomas sir your uncle

Sonny Beauty on the Fox television

departure basket was encounter dollar

become an ultra is a need that little

walkway and when he do he we reopen

veterans offices and invested in new

resources to support the women and men

who've served our country so bravely

these things are making a real

difference in people's lives this fall

Canadians once again it's a vote for the

kind of

Canada they want to live we've all got a

choice to make

keep moving forward and build on the

progress we've made we'll go back to the

politics of the harpooneers

conservatives like to say they're for

the people but then they cut taxes for

the wealthy and cut services education

and support for kids

the Canadians know that you cannot cut

your way to prosperity that's why we

chose to move Canada forward by

investing in families and workers and in

communities in four short years

Canadians have created over a million

new just we negotiated new health

reports with the provinces and

territories including the Newfoundland

and Labrador and with the Canada Child

Benefit we're giving parents the help

they need with hundreds of dollars

tax-free every month we know there's

still more work to do because right

across the country parents tell me that

they're worried about how they're going

to juggle a career and kids whether

you've got a toddler or a teenager it's

on people's minds and in those first few

months with a new baby when it's a

struggle to get enough sleep let alone

get to the top of your game of work it

can be an even bigger concern no one

should have to choose between their

paycheck and their family a choice that

frankly moms are still confronted with

more than dads people should be focused

on spending time with their baby not

worrying about how they'll pay their

bills so today we're taking another big

step forward we are going to increase

the Canada child benefit by 15% if you

have kids under the age of 1 that means

getting up to $1,000 more on top of what

you're already receiving and to give

people more money up front we're making

maternity and parental benefits tap

these tax exempt at source you'll get

every dollar right when you need it

since no taxes will

taken off the ER chat when new parents

receive it these new measures build on

what we've already done for families

that's whether that's the five-week

parental sharing benefits that help

people take time as a family or the more

flexible parental leave so people can

choose to spend spread the time off over

18 months grasses emotional these are

make paid leave terror for all families

for adoptive parents I'm going to bring

in a 15 week leave which means an extra

$7,000 for the average family claiming

we new adoptive leave this is progress

the parents like Chris who's here today

with your daughter can kill me and we're

not done yet because all of this is

laying the groundwork to go even further

within the first year of being back in

office we're going to start building a

national system of guaranteed paid

family leave

this will be an ambitious program to

make sure that no one gets left behind

we're ensuring that parents who don't

qualify for paid leave through AI

because they don't have enough hours or

whether they're an entrepreneur or

self-employed receive a guaranteed

income in that crucial first year of a

child's life

that means unprecedented option

prepare and it means cementing cannabis

global leadership in support of families

under a Liberal government we will

continue to invest in families like

krysta and Piper because at the end of

the days politics is about people it's

about you maybe you're a recent grad or

maybe you're living your golden years

out in retirement

whoever you are you deserve a real plan

for your future we've done a lot

together these past four years but the

truth is we're just getting started so

folks in st. John's and right across the

country you have an important choice to

make when we go back to the failed

policies of the past or we really will

we continue to move forward that's the

choice it's that clear and it's not

important I'm thinking forward for

everyone the families for the middle

class

[Applause]

we make sure that Corrections Canada

keeps the safety of all prisoners at the

top of mine every step of the way we do

that in a way that is consistent with

the Charter of Rights and Freedoms we

will continue to apply all the necessary

to keep Canadians and people in our

Corrections facilities hi mr. Trudeau

David Cochran with CBC News this is the

fourth policy announcement of this

campaign where we've only gotten

accosting from the Liberal Party of

Canada we do not have any independent

third party costing and the

Conservatives have done by releasing the

PBO costing you change the rules to

allow the Parliamentary Budget Officer

to do that costing why are you taking

full advantage of it by releasing

they're costing in real time so

Canadians can assess your promises we

have made use of the cartilage above the

defendant officers new new powers to

cost political parties platforms we use

them on a number of our platform

announcements that will be forthcoming

we know it's important for Canadians to

have objective review of the costs of

various platforms and I can assure you

that the Parliamentary Budget Officer

has been very much engaged by the

Liberal Party on a number of elements

within our platform

costing and when our full plastic flap

platform costing comes out in the coming

weeks that will be abundantly clear but

why not release estate today this is a

promise worth in excess of a billion

dollars a year when fully implemented

today to properly assess it it would be

good to have the PPO so we will have

been full costing of the liberal

platform with all the response our donut

casserole doctor she and included

stories about mr. Bernier is included in

the televised leaders debate both the

conservatives and rude Democrats have

very vigorously opposed this giving him

a platform for some of its more extreme

views your party's been relatively quiet

on this why do you agree with giving him

a national televised audience but then

we all remember that in the 2015

election Stephen Harper the

conservatives gained the system to

cherry pick which debates they wanted to

do and what that meant was there were no

national network debates in English the

Canadians could walk that was watched

that was part of the approach the

Conservatives had to try and and not

have Canadian see these debates we made

a commitment in that election that we

wouldn't let that happen again then we

would create an independent debate

commissioner who would organize national

debates official national debates and

make determinations about the format of

a who is included in an independent and

responsible way that is something that

we committed to and that is something we

are actually moving forward on that's

what matters

means that we have the right kinds of

debates and we are pleased that the

Independent Commission is doing its work

ask for mr. Burnett I look forward to

holding him to account publicly for his

intolerant views and I certainly hope

all of the leaders will do the same

column is you build me he knew working a

song on other birds when Jim Commission

we are continuing to work with five eyes

allies on this matter which the

authorities are taking extremely

seriously they'll understand that I'm

not going to make more comments on this

delicate situation good morning Teresa

Wright the Canadian Press there was

another shooting at a mall yesterday in

Alberta I know you've said that you're

waiting to announce your gun control

measures but don't you think that's a

little tone deaf

there was a 17 year old boy who was

killed last week

why not tell committees today what your

plan is like oh we moved forward we did

not wait for this election campaign move

forward concretely among strengthening

gun control vendors over the past four

years

we made significant commitments in the

2015 election platform on gun control

keeping communities safe and we

fulfilled those commitments

unfortunately the Conservatives have

already announced it does going to be

rolling back that strengthening of gun

legislation in a return to the Harper

years that I know nobody wants further

we are going to be putting forward the

next steps that a Canadian Liberal

government will take on keeping our

community safe and strengthening gun

control I look forward to talking about

that in the coming weeks but obviously

our hearts go out to all the families

who have been affected by its gun

violence that we've seen across the

country we need to do more and that is

what our political party is going to be

doing more and I encourage all other

parties including the Conservatives to

begin to take gun control and the safety

of our communities seriously instead of

promising to walk back the changes we

are

and not make further changes Prime

Minister we're here in Atlantic Canada

today you know there is a feeling among

many Atlantic Canadian side your

government has taken in the region for

granted after giving you all 32 seats in

the region what would you do differently

if reelected to show that we care about

Lana Canada has a priority and to not

just hide election time I think if you

talk to many Newfoundlanders and

Labradorians they'll talk to you about

the fact that we renewed the historic

Atlantic Accords just not a few months

ago that was something extremely

important Atlantic Canadians and they

remember well how stephen harper

betrayed atlantic canada and broke his

promises on that that's why we were so

pleased to work with at Whitehall and

they got my name in Finland to ensure

that we could move forward in a way it

was fair and supportive of all

Newfoundlanders and Labradorians why

we're going to continue to work on

priorities for different lenders and

Labradorians like rape mitigation we've

committed to continue to work with the

premier and his government to ensure

that cost of living in in in

Newfoundland Labrador remains affordable

we're going to continue to work right

across the Atlantic provinces our

Atlantic growth strategy has

demonstrated investments in immigration

and infrastructure in real partnership

with the Atlantic promises provinces

that has continued to make a difference

I am so proud of withstanding with such

strong Atlantic Canadians who have been

great places for their communities

inaudible

Hawaii avec the implementation see I'm

so livid about our own legally and I did

problem Commission

civically region TC news reports in

Hebei avec de Provence non-toxic so

repetitive Sameera see also a class on

systemic Joseph pressure delicate

external fuckin zero or Canada that

toxic you know constitute a very

irregular good morning Prime Minister

daily a poll question and not the

chemical question you're expecting

because I know the only poll that

matters is Louise we seen any number of

polls which show a trend over the summer

which is a pretty divided country you

and your party very popular Ontario in

eastern Canada and not a party very

popular in Western Canada sees be

hardening and it's reflecting in the

debate and you've really been going hard

to serve those and conservative premiers

and the last campaign you talked about

conservatives are neighbors we need to

reach out to them so how do we bridge

this east-west gap is urban rural

gambling what are your thoughts on once

the election is over taking it down a

notch on the very first day of the

campaign I was in Western Canada BC to

launch my campaign the very next day I

stopped in Edmonton to talk without

burdens about how important Alberta is

people in Newfoundland note that Alberta

has been an essential partner and

creative wealth for all Canadians over

many many years and as they face

difficult times as Newfoundland others

have faced difficult times with the

price of oil recently the rest of Canada

has stepped up and been there for

Western Canada as we are for every

corner of the country we're going to

continue to do that we stepped up in

meaningful ways like

trans mountain pipeline expansion to

ensure that it actually gets built

because that is something that matters

to Western Canadians and there were lots

of conservatives let me be very clear I

was praising a number of conservative

leaders former conservative leaders who

were essential as a part of Team Canada

when we successfully renegotiated NAFTA

you can know of it when Canadians speak

with one perspective with different

voices from across the ideological

spectrum but with a united message to

American Congress to American Governors

to American partners on what matters to

Canada the country comes together and

that was a great example of people from

across the spectrum working together on

something that matters for Canada

unfortunately we see a specific group of

conservative politicians now who deny

climate change who are dragging their

heels on infrastructure investments who

are playing divisive games and bringing

up the specter of Canadian unity once

again our Canadian disunity once again

for short-term political gain I will

make no apologies for standing up

strongly from unity in the country but I

will also do that in a way that

continues to invest in Alberta and

Saskatchewan in every corner of the

country because we know that this

country only works when we work together

there's a lot of high on Thursday go why

do I pay 45 lots of it across the

Federation bridge when Montreal is you

commute across a federally funded

champagne breaks don't pay a dime it

seems like a real double standard there

it's a free bridge for Quebecers I'm

going to be getting stuck with a big

bill every time

will you commit to eliminating the total

for Islanders Confederation at the

Champlain and Assembly of the Champlain

Bridge was a replacement bridge the

confederation bridge was a new bridge

that was built with the tools as part of

the financing good morning Michele

dillio with The Globe and Mail there's

been discussion across the world about

some countries including Germany

offering asylum to protesters in Hong

Kong would your government offer asylum

or permanent residents to Hong Kong

protesters we have 300,000 Canadians

first priority and our first concern is

for those Canadians who are very

concerned about the unrest in Hong Kong

right now that's why we continue to call

for peace we continue to call for

de-escalation for an end to violence and

positive dialogue between the

authorities and protesters we are very

concerned about everyone in Hong Kong

but particularly concerned about those

300,000 Canadians for their own cost

with all due respect you're not

answering the question Prime Minister

would you offer asylum to protesters in

Hong Kong we're gonna focus on the 300

thousand Canadians which is more than

citizens of any other country in Hong

Kong and we will always look as we do at

ways we can help can help people around

the world were fleeing violence and

persecution Canada is one of the

countries it takes in the largest number

of asylum seekers from around the world

and we do it because we have a strong

immigration system that Canadians can

rely on Canadians have confidence in our

immigration system we're going to

continue to the truth of our values and

make sure that we continue to be a safe

and welcoming country palmistry home at

further your comments on rape mitigation

the provisional government straight

mitigation plan specifically cost two

hundred million dollars annually from

the federal government are you committed

to providing two hundred million dollars

annually to offset our major we've had

excellent conversations with premier

ball on this we continue we're

continuing to work with them I can tell

the commanders and Labradorians that a

federal Liberal government will continue

to be there for you to be there as a

partner on the challenges you're facing

we were there to resolve the Atlantic of

cords we will be there to support on

rape mitigation and I can I can tell you

that we're working very hard on that and

will continue to work very hard on that

which way so specifically on the the 200

million did that a number like whether

it's to refinancing the loans or through

actual cash or maybe it's that number we

are committed to resolving the issue of

rape mitigation in a way that works for

the lenders and Labradorians

something energy economy not a doll for

the English obsessed Joseph S or is

equal to

four years ago without when you were

here are you committed to providing

money for the voiceless but he had other

ways power consumption projects in this

province four years later we're standing

there and there doesn't seem to be any

progress towards that what do you say

there there are there have been very

positive conversations going on with

local mayors there have been some

challenges from the municipal side but

we continue to be committed to working

in partnership with municipalities and

province to settle this issue we know

that investing in infrastructure

particularly in fields like waste water

is essential to growing communities like

cat like st. John's we're going to

continue to make that choice that

conservatives didn't make we made the

choice to invest in communities and

people in infrastructure when

conservatives promised cuts and

austerity well that's what they're

promising once again to balance the

budget at all costs which we know means

cuts to services and usually benefits to

the wealthiest Canadians that's the

conservative approach that was a Stephen

Harper approach we have a different

approach of investing as partners to

with municipalities in essential

infrastructure and we look forward to

continue to work on getting that new

wastewater facility for such a loser
