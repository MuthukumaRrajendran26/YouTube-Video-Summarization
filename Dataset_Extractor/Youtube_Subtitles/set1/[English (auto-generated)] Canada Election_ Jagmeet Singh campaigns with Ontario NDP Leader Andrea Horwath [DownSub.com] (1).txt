few folks that you're unfamiliar with

but let me introduce one to start but

first of all let me recognize that we're

on the traditional territory of the

honest nabhi and the hood nashoni

peoples we thank you very much

little fingers for being out in the rain

I gotta tell you I gotta tell you I feel

the love and the warmth in this room and

I do want to say thank you to Malcolm

Allen our candidate right here in this

writing during this federal election and

you know they gave me another job to do

it so I'm going to do that job because

it's an important one we have a number

of people here that need to be

recognized before the most important

person in the room is able to say a few

words that I'm going to start of course

we recognize Oh Malcolm already Jeff

virtues the MPP for this writing we have

days of the campaign right I mean it is

the homestretch and our momentum

continues to grow

why because Canadians know that they

have a real choice in this election a

choice for someone who is going to

always always stand up for them we've

had too many decades too many years of

liberals and conservatives whose

priority is the rich and wealthy

Canadians what we need is somebody who's

going to be standing up for everyday

people day in and day out as Malcolm

said fighting for working people

fighting for everyday folks

homestretch and a great community a

[Music]

[Applause]

Hey

[Music]

how's it going well in I didn't realize

you could pack this many people in a

diner that is pretty impressive

I guess gotta say before I go any

further thank you so much for taking the

time to be here it means a lot I know

you've got busy lives and lots of things

to do the fact that so many of you are

here today gives me lots of inspiration

and courage because we're here we're

here and fighting for all of you so

thank you and if I kid if you give me

just a quick moment I've got to say this

campaign has been really amazing we've

really enjoyed fighting for people a lot

of the reason why I'm even in this

position is because of a woman standing

right beside me she was my friend she's

not only my friend my mentor she was my

previous boss it's true and most

importantly in a couple years she's

gonna be your next Premier of Ontario

Brens we've got we've got an incredible

team of New Democrats with us here these

are folks that are out here fighting for

you and I want to talk a bit about

what's going on in this election I know

you you feel it when you talk to your

friends and your family but when I

probably cross this country I meet with

so many people that tell me that things

are tough they're finding it harder and

harder to get the the care that they

need when their loved ones falls sick

they're finding it harder and harder to

pay for medication the cost of

medication in Canada we're paying some

of the highest prices in the world and

we know that families make difficult

choices where they don't take the

medication they need because they can't

afford it and they choose between paying

the rent or buying groceries or barring

the medication they need and I've met

I've met I've met far too many families

that are paying they're in a way playing

roulette with their life because they

can't afford medication I met a man who

is working hard construction worker he

works on contract he doesn't have

benefits and he needs a heart care

medication but so does his wife and so

does this get his kidneys medication as

well so instead of buying his own

medication he pays for his kids because

he doesn't know what to do and and that

shouldn't be a choice of people making

shouldn't be a choice that people make

and then what-what are liberals gonna

say two families are making this tough

choice oh we'll do another study maybe

we'll sit down and negotiate with the

pharmaceutical companies maybe we'll

meet with the insurance companies but

they're not gonna deliver they're not

gonna deliver it's been it's been 22

years since the Liberals have been

talking about Pharma care

have they delivered for you

you know I mean so many families that

tell me that they either are not gonna

have kids because they can't afford

childcare or they are struggling because

childcare costs so much and liberals

have promised a national childcare

program for 26 years

they just haven't delivered you know

families can't afford to wait young

people who are worried about the future

of this planet and want to see real

action on climate change and the climate

crisis hey they can't wait

those those young kids they can't wait

they're worried about the future their

eyes are filled with fear when they

should be filled with hope and they

can't be told that what mr. Trudeau is

saying oh you know what maybe we'll see

what we do down the road he bought a

pipeline he's not committed he's not

committed to real change and so I think

you know that's what people are going

through people are struggling we know

that mr. Trudeau he's chosen and again

again and again when he gets a chance to

make a decision whether it's between

helping out people who need medication

or protecting the pharmaceutical

industry against him he chooses he does

it time and time again he chooses big

business he works very hard for the

powerful and wealthy and it hurts

everyone else he's choosing to hurt

everyone else when he does that and I

can give you an example of with

medication he promised in 2015 during an

election just like this he promised to

lower the cost of medication and would

have safe families thousands of dollars

it was a no-cost solution it just meant

updating the list of countries we

compare when we set our prices and he

didn't do it

four years later he didn't do it we're

all wondering well this would have cost

us nothing why didn't he do it well

guess what he did he met with the

pharmaceutical lobbyists him in his

government met with the insurance

lobbyists over eight hundred and seventy

five times and so he chose he chose very

clearly not by chance he chose to

protect the profits of the powerful over

helping families that needed it when

people tell me that they're having a

hard time finding housing housing is

really tough right now people can't find

a home to own they can barely find a

place to rent

right and now given this crisis

mr. Trudeau again had a choice he could

find 14 billion dollars for the richest

corporations in the last fall economic

statement so they could buy corporate

jets and limousines but one family said

hey we need help we need help with

housing he's spending 19 percent less

per GDP than the Harper government on

housing take that in he's spending less

than conservatives he's saying be afraid

of conservatives be afraid of their cuts

and he's spending less as a percentage

of GDP on housing than the Conservatives

here's a thing mr. Trudeau says a lot of

nice things in public but when he's

behind closed doors meeting with the

powerful and wealthy executives and

lobbyists he chooses them over people

that's the reality and now I don't know

if I need to make this argument in this

room but the Conservatives they're not

also gonna make things better and and I

got I got Andrew right here beside me

who can talk about how viciously

conservatives cut all the services and

health care that families need and I

know you've been feeling those cuts you

know the fact is conservatives will

promise you a couple dollars in your

pockets maybe they will and they might

do that they might get you a couple

dollars in your pockets but what they're

gonna do is they're gonna certainly cut

a little bit of taxes but what are they

also cut they cut education they cut

services they cut health care they cut

nurses they cut all the things that you

need all the things that your family

need and you know what it does it ends

up costing you a lot more it costs

families a lot more so they're not the

solution and now there's a thing

mr. Trudeau mr. schirra are gonna tell

you that you only have two choices in

this election you can only choose

between the Liberals who have let you

down and the Conservatives are gonna cut

services that is not the choice you have

in this election you have a choice you

don't have to choose between liberals

and conservatives there is another

choice in this election

[Applause]

you can choose someone that's in it for

you that's gonna fight for you you know

people often ask me well what's the

difference you promised to bring in

these big changes why do we why should

we believe you and I say let me tell you

why I'm any Democrat I don't work for

the rich and powerful I work for all of

you and so in this election you can

choose someone that's gonna fight for

you that was the cutest thing ever

that's so cute

ah I'm gonna give I want to give you the

microphone if you get a chance come on

up you can bring bring that young one on

up here we'll get it we'll get them on

the microphone that's a future leader

right there

in this election you can choose

someone's gonna fight for you it's gonna

fight for that little kid that's gonna

fight for your future and you know and

well and you know this really well

you've elected fighters before you've

elected Peter core most popular you've

elected Cindy forest or a fighter and I

hope you're gonna really like this man

here Malcolm Allen areas you woulda said

okay we're gonna do one time I'm gonna

break this railway NDP it's always a

gamble with kids it's okay it's good

you're awesome thank you he did it when

it counted with no other no attention on

him he did it when it counted you're the

best

there's the best and so friends so in

this election I want to make one one

thing really clear to everyone out there

you have a choice in this election mr.

Trudeau has chosen the powerful in the

wealthy he's not willing to do what it

takes

New Democrats are gonna fight for you

we're gonna fight for universal

pharmacare for everyone you're gonna get

that we're gonna make sure we're gonna

make sure if you need medication in our

country you use your health card not

your credit card

we're gonna bring in we're gonna bring

in a national dental care program that's

gonna mean that 4.3 million Canadians

who don't have coverage are going to get

coverage right away we're gonna take on

we're gonna take on those cell phone and

internet companies that are exploiting

you we're gonna put in a price cap to

make sure they cannot charge you more

than the average OAC country we're gonna

make real we're gonna make real

investments in housing and make sure

people can find a place to call home and

now now people gonna ask us how are you

gonna pay for all of this right that

comes up all the time well you know what

we're not afraid to say this we're gonna

make the very richest Canadians those at

the very very top pay their fair share

[Applause]

we're gonna do something we're gonna do

something that Liberals have never

talked about because they're afraid to

do it conservatives certainly won't do

it we're gonna tax the super wealthy

those who have fortunes of over 20

million dollars we're gonna ask them to

pay a little bit more our plan can raise

as much as 70 billion dollars that's

massive revenue increases to invest in

the services and the health care that

families need we're gonna close offshore

tax havens we're gonna close loopholes

we're gonna make sure that instead of

working families and low and middle

income people middle-class families they

don't have to carry the burden it should

be the very richest that are paying

their fair share to pay for the services

that we need

and so I asked you I asked you in this

election do not vote out of fear vote

for something

vote for fighters people who are on your

side New Democrats beat conservatives

New Democrats in this riding will beat

conservatives it'll be a new Democrat

and when I leave you I want to leave you

with this final thought you know we

talked about choices we're in this

position today because the choices that

mr. Trudeau made he chose the

pharmaceutical industry over families

that needed medication he chose the

wealthy corporations over families that

needed housing he chose the rich and

powerful I don't work for the rich and

powerful I don't choose them I choose

all of you thank you thank you my

friends

thank you very much I gotta give one

more time if you can all join me and

give in John from Blue Star diner a lot

of love a big round of applause for

letting us be here and John John ja ja

ja ja ja so John BC we took a picture

outside this is pretty incredible we

took the picture and it's already in

afraid I hope we did that for you

okay that is awesome

and so a beautiful picture I know this

is our nice man

you let us you let us use your space I'm

sure we can figure that out

that's beautiful Johnny from blue saw

everybody you know I think this might be

one of the first pictures I'll have up

on a diner wall so I'm pretty honored

that's pretty cool i'ma have to come

back here Johnny and have some food

maybe I'll do a tween I'm gonna take all

the whole bunch of outside with all you

guys but I'm gonna do what the thing is

the media is traveling with us we're

gonna move to questions from the media

they're gonna do a scrum and then I'll

come chat with all you guys you keep

saying that the Liberals are choosing

pharmaceutical companies over people but

how can you square the fact that those

same companies are literally taking the

government to court because they're

trying to lower drug prices well I mean

we wasn't clear evidence there was a

clear promise that was made by the

Liberal government by mr. Trudeau and

that promise was to update the list of

companies the countries used to set the

prices for medication over a period of

years for years

the Liberal government met with the

pharmaceutical industry and the

insurance lobbyists over 875 times and

they did not deliver that it was a

campaign promise costs $0 and they

didn't do it in four years and now right

at the end of their four-year mandate

during the election period they've

reanalysis they're gonna do it again the

evidence is clear they didn't protect

families they protected the profits of

the pharmaceuticals let me come back a

little bit on that you're saying that

they didn't protect families but in the

last budget too they did start putting

money towards a national pharma care

plan and it's something that has to be

done in order to get to the pharma care

plan so 35 million to create the

Canadian drug agency to get access to

drugs take Nash which would make a

national list for medications also 500

millions lower the

those rare drugs for rare diseases so do

you give them credit for that not at all

what they're doing is this way when the

first Commission came out the first

Commission back in the 60s when we were

talking about bringing in universal

health care in that commission and that

Royal Commission had said we need to

have pharmacare national public

pharmacare their own committee the

littlest Rucka committee with mr. Haas

dr. Hoskins and that committee found

that the healthcare the pharma care

system should be universal single-payer

and public the Liberals have not

committed to that to date their own

committee has recommended something and

they're not willing to say yes we'll do

it we can just put it in yes we can you

can you've got to have the courage

people can't but no and it's a really

good question I want to tell you the

thing is is that this is what liberals

ooh they kind of like the eat things out

they drag it out they give you a little

bit and they think that that's good

enough and I've met with so many

families and her heartbreaking stories

seniors who have coverage they've got

coverage but they tell me their coverage

means for each of the the couple my

husband and wife

their coverage is a 2500 dollar

deductible each so they've got how

they've gotten pharmacare coverage

medication coverage drug benefits but

each of them have to pay 2,500 first

that means a $5,000 for the family

before they get any coverage that's

practically no coverage and they're not

alone many people have these stories

where their co-pays and their

deductibles are so high it's effectively

not being covered so when we talked

about the millions of Canadians have no

coverage there's still millions of

Canadians that have some coverage that's

effectively no coverage and we know that

what what the Liberals are proposing is

to just drag this out for years in years

for families that spend thousands of

dollars a year on medication they're

asking them to spend tens of thousands

of dollars before they get any help and

that's just wrong we are gonna change

that

[Applause]

so they just asked me to do this in

French so I'm gonna do it in French one

to blow sure I said in my speech

yesterday that it's troubling that the

block has the certain revelations that

came out with certain comments they've

made in the fact that they've got

members there were fans of really

divisive groups and that makes it clear

that they're not really the progressive

option for Quebecers and I said if you

want a progressive option in Quebec for

those who are looking for a home we are

your home New Democrats are your home

yes Janice Dixon Global Mail hi Janice

I'm wondering what you think about

comments Andrew Shearer made last night

in a CTV CTV interview he said that he

hopes the other party's respect the fact

that whoever wins the most seats should

get to form government what do you think

about that I think that Canadians expect

that right now we've got a electoral

system that means that the the results

of elections have often been ones where

less than half less than half of

Canadians choose a certain party and

they get all the power that's wrong and

we were promised by mr. Trudeau that

this would change he said we would end

first-past-the-post systems because it's

so unfair and he broke that braum you

know in fact we counted how many times

he said it in the last electoral

campaign it was a longer one so he had a

lot of time to say this but he made that

promise

at least 1,800 times yeah

1,800 times he talked about the fact

that some form or other of saying that

this would be the last election under

last election under the

first-past-the-post system he said some

variation of that 1,800 times it is

unreal and four years later it's another

election under the first-past-the-post

system so so what I want to say the

Canadians is they they feel often that

vote doesn't matter they feel like their

vote doesn't count and they feel sad

because 60% of Canadians regularly

consistently vote against the

Conservative government or a

Conservative Party and so it's wrong for

the conservative think that

with less than 40% of the power or vote

they deserve all the majority of power

that's wrong and that's why New

Democrats have committed that's why I've

I've committed to bring in at the

federal level a proportional

mixed-member proportional representation

to make sure everyone's vote counts

she's gotta what was there

well that was Genesis that what you were

saying on Francie oh that's what she

said okay

I thought she had a follow up on from

awesome just to be clear you would not

respect a you know if Andrew Shearer

wins the most seeds you would not allow

him to form government you would oppose

that we don't respect conservatives now

no I I should i wanted i wanted the the

funny setup of the question what I mean

is that no I mean just because Mr

Shearer thinks that if he gets a certain

number of seeds that were gonna give up

fighting against conservatives no we're

gonna always fight conservatives because

we don't believe in their cuts to

services we don't believe in how they

could harm people we're gonna fight that

I know I continued a little chronically

peu difficile dong convert to Djibouti

Cointreau sir

I'm mr. Seng Kevin Gallagher in CTV

national news I just on this particular

topic because the questions not about

whether you're gonna fight conservatives

or not you made that clear the entire

campaign the question really is whether

this tradition or convention that the

incumbent government in a minority

situation should get first crack at

forming government this is what mr.

shear rejected last night in the CTV

interview so do you agree with mr. shear

that it's fine if the party that has the

most seats in a minority situation

should then have first crack at forming

government or should there be a respect

to this convention that the incumbent

government might have first crack to

either form a minority or a coalition

right at the end of the day I think then

what Canadians have like you to simplify

the situation at the end of the day

Canadians the vast majority of them do

not want conservatives to come in and

start cutting services so whatever we

can do to ensure that that doesn't

happen is what New Democrats are

committing to doing I want to be the

Prime Minister of Canada to make a

better future but

and I want to be Prime Minister to put

in place our programs and our services

and our investments are gonna make

people's lives better and I'm gonna

choose people but whatever Canadians

choose I want Canadians to win and so I

want them to know if you vote enough New

Democrats in New Democrats like Malcolm

alum here & Welland New Democrats across

Canada if you vote in New Democrats

you're gonna get the things that you

need because we're gonna fight for you

we're in it for you and we're gonna

fight for you so whatever the

imaginations are after the election know

this you've got New Democrats on your

side you've got fighters who are gonna

stand up for you I have a question from

my colleague in Vancouver melanine AG

should be accessible Canada act of

course that's a piece of legislation

brought in by the Liberals it's

estimated that one in five Canadians

over the age of 15 is living with a

disability and many within the community

feel there's little to no attention

being given to those issues this

election campaign and many feel that the

current Act doesn't go far enough to

protect the rights of disabled Canadians

so what would you do if you're into

government to take action on the

accessible Canada Act this is a struggle

that a lot of Canadians face not feeling

like they belong for what they look like

or their identity but then for their

abilities and the fact that Canada has a

long way to go to make sure it's more

accessible to people that are living

with disabilities is a real challenge

and something that really impacts a lot

of people but we're proposing and our

commitment and what we've called for for

a number of years both provincially and

federally is to have a strategy on

making sure we address the needs of

people living with disabilities so we're

calling for a national strategy on

developing a program and a plan to make

sure that all of Canada is accessible

where no matter what your abilities are

you're welcomed and you're able to be a

part of society and that's how many more

committing to

saying Teresa right from the Canadian

Press I asked you this question the

other day and I don't feel that I really

got some answer about you know we're

here again in Ontario we've spent the

day in Quebec yesterday you've spent a

lot of time on the west coast and that

seems to be kind of where a lot of the

leaders are spending their time in this

election what does that say to voters

who live in other areas of the country

in terms of the weight of their vote in

this election I think that everyone in

Canada should know that they count and

they matter and it's a it's a big

country and in a short election period

it's tough to get around the whole

country and for a lot of folks out there

that I haven't be able to see I wish I

could be able to connect with you and

spend time with you it's a it's a

challenge in a country as big as ours

but I want people to know no matter

where they live in Canada what we've

seen over the past number of years with

liberals and with conservatives is that

they've been choosing again and again to

put in place decisions and policies that

make it easier for the richest and

harder for everyone else I want to

change that I want to bring in policies

and commitments that are actually gonna

lift up people our plan to bring in

Universal farming care for all is gonna

lift up people our national dental care

program is gonna lift up people our plan

to invest in housing and affordable

housing is gonna help out families how

we want to make sure young people know

that we're fighting the climate crisis

like we want to win it we can do the all

these things and no matter where you

live in Canada you can count on New

Democrats to fight for you

I also have a question about some

comments that you made to the wind ped

Free Press in terms of that you

suggested that you might withhold or

have something to do with hold or have

conversations about the health care

transfers if they didn't reopen the ER

that is a provincial responsibility and

given the fact that you've said that you

will not interfere with bill 21 in

Quebec because that is a provincial

issue why are you now suggesting that

you might get involved in a provincial

issue in Winnipeg so we're gonna fight

for healthcare and just because

considerate of governments want to cut

health care doesn't mean we're gonna

give up we're gonna fight for healthcare

we've got a lot of tools that we can use

when we invest in things like Universal

Pharma care and our national dental care

program these are these are ways that

are going to make sure provinces are

gonna feel less burden on them we have

health care transfers that go towards

funding better health care those have

been cut over the years if we make more

investments we can encourage better

decisions we can encourage more health

care deliver to people we can encourage

with more funding more centers more

hospitals we can encourage better

frontline care if we deliver the funding

we can get the results and what we've

seen over the past decades is that

liberals and conservatives have been

cutting that funding it used to be 50/50

now it's 2575 so how can a federal

government really meaningfully be a

champion for health care when they've

been slashing health care investments

we're gonna change that we're gonna make

more investments and we'll have more of

a footing to make to push for better

health care for Canadians no matter

where they live

yeah so I mean we're not we don't the

power to force anything we have the

power to be persuasive we have the power

to encourage things we make investments

in healthcare we can encourage better

healthcare delivery when we negotiate

things like Universal Pharma care and

national dental care when we negotiate

and deliver these programs and these

services that help out Canadians we can

sit down with provinces and talk about

what we're increasing investments we

want to see better healthcare delivered

the Canada Health Act also has certain

requirements that the money is

transferred for publicly delivered

services and we've seen in some

provinces conservatives try to privatize

publicly delivered services and they've

been fine for doing that there are tools

that we have but we've not seen liberals

or conservatives willing to use those

tools to encourage better healthcare for

Canadians I'm different I'm gonna fight

for healthcare I don't care who's in

government I'm gonna work with them and

say we need better healthcare

Canadians are counting on it and I'm not

gonna give up fighting for that

I'm Shelby Knox from 6-10 CK TV news in

st. Catharines given that you're

appearing in Niagara just days before

the election

many would take that as a sign that this

region is important to you come Monday

can you tell me based on what you're

hearing from the people here in Niagara

including your candidates what are you

going to do to specifically help this

region well I've been spending a lot of

time chatting with Malcolm about this so

we know that and well in like like many

communities health care is incredibly

important our national farming care

program is gonna help a lot of people

here in Welland and folks across Canada

our plans to deliver national dental

care which is a publicly delivered

insurance program that we're gonna put

in place that's gonna literally help out

4.3 million Canadians immediately that's

gonna provide dental care services it's

gonna save families thousands of dollars

we've estimated for a family of four

with the average needs that can be as

much as twelve hundred and forty dollars

a year that's saved with our plan for

families that don't have dental care

services or or a coverage right now

so these are real things we're going to

do for health care we've talked about

manufacturing well and has a strong

manufacturing base we need to make sure

that that's strong and that's that's

growing so we've got a couple of

proposals to reinvest back into our

manufacturing sector one of our

proposals also helps us fight the

climate crisis is to make sure we

retrofit all homes and buildings and

that's gonna help yeah that's gonna help

that's gonna help create jobs in local

communities we're also going to invest

massively in housing and housing is also

going to create jobs I'm familiar

those are just those are just some of

the priorities I'm sure there's many

more but those are some of the top

priorities are going to work on right

away just when we're talking about Mr

Shearer and the fact that you know he

wants people to respect if he wins the

most seats he's making it sound like a

coalition is a dirty word what do you

think about that it's not you know you

know giving some fear about a coalition

because we've seen in the past that

they've made it kind of a dirty word I

can tell you this if you look around and

think about the things that we're proud

of as Canadians the things that make us

proud of the fact that we take care one

another our universal health care system

that came in because Tommy Douglas knew

Democrats and progressives push for it

if you look at if you look at our

investments and making sure seniors can

live and retire with dignity our old-age

pensions our CPP and our OAS these are

things that New Democrats push for in

minority settings we know that when New

Democrats are elected in big numbers

people win that's our message you elect

New Democrats people win

and and just and just to be fair I mean

whatever that looks like we're not I'm

not

bogged down on what the details are

whatever Canadians choose in any form if

you have New Democrats whether we're in

government which I'd love to be in

government please let that happen

whether that's in opposition whether

that's working together with others

whether that's in a coalition whatever

it is I want Canadians to know if you

vote new Democrat you get fighters you

get fighters you get people on your side

people who are gonna fight for you and

make your life better and that's what I

want people to know tonight you'll be

campaigning in Brampton your candidate

Jordan Boswell recently has come to life

that he's made some sexist and offensive

comments online years ago of course as

many of these things Doug but they're

about a former indigenous sex worker

where the time was speaking out against

human trafficking so he has apologized

now but have you spoken with this

candidate and is this something that you

can allow in your party

it's I've not spoken with them but it's

absolutely wrong the comments were

horribly wrong and harmful and hurtful

but I know that he is not only taken

responsibility but is committed to

behavior and a future where that's not

what he believes and he's absolutely

rejected that that he those comments

he's made in the past and I believe the

two things we need or three things we

need for someone to remain a member of

our team he's accepting something they

did that's wrong committing with clear

evidence that they've changed and that

they're moving forward in a new way and

that they believe in our values as a

party if those things are satisfied I'm

happy to continue to have people on my

team but it's it's clear that those

comments were absolutely wrong and they

were hurtful that I'm really yeah

yeah I'm really sorry that those

comments were made they should never

have been made they're very hurtful I

believe that every human being deserves

dignity and respect

there's lots of people that are being

marginalized that then are also on top

of that hurt with comments like that and

it's wrong we need to lift people up

make their life safer make their lives

better and they do not deserve to be

mistreated or insulted in any way okay

thank you so much

I'll come chat with all of you yeah I'll

come walk around we'll have a nice chat

thank you so much my friends thank you

[Applause]
