good afternoon and these are our daily

updates so they're gonna be bit briefer

we think more time for questions on that

and so since yesterday we continue to

work at a number things at our command

table issues they come forward ongoing

things around laboratory testing

capacity issues around that we continue

to look at ongoing reports of other

supply issues something's moving

something's moving slower but always

progressing in a positive direction we

continue to look at a number of aspects

related to the declaration and roles of

essential staff and other sites that are

maybe not specific and how to clarify

some of those we continue to deal with

some of those aspects and at the same

time we continue to get monitoring from

the global perspective from the United

States working again with our FPT

federal provincial territorial partners

from our special advisory committee and

of course talking to our local mo h's at

the local health units on how things are

going there and updates on the processes

working with our command table on

assessment sites hospitals other centers

and long-term care and retirement homes

and all those aspects there so there's

many things moving as we continue to

ramp up and deal with it

so from the numbers standpoint in that

so now we're pins of your target we

started with the school closures last

Friday Thursday Friday of course a lot

of the restrictions came in on Monday so

where are we one day you need to say

from one day it's a five or six and the

other that's day three and that and I

think that's important to note as we

track along so I trying to give a sense

of how we're doing yesterday you're

asking that we had just nine more cases

added that was at that time in the

morning

so dr. Yaffe is going to give you an

update of some of those numbers as they

are today and you were gave some more

numbers or updated the evening report

for you so we're trying to move it from

there so over to you dr. Yaffe for the

Ontario numbers

thank you so as of this morning we now

have a total of 212 cases confirmed

cases in Ontario still the five resolved

and as you know the one person who's

deceased we have over 10,000 negatives

and over 3,000 that are under

investigation so the number that are

going to the lab are going up is going

up quite quite quickly the good news is

the lab capacity is going up we have the

public health Ontario lab itself has

increased its capacity to test per day

and we have a number of hospital labs

coming on that will eventually increase

our capacity to 5,000 tests a day so

most the vast majority of our cases

still are related to travel outside of

Canada or contact with a case a very

small number where there hasn't been a

connection made with those and of course

the health units continue to do their

investigation so and we're working very

hard I have to say to figure out the

best way to present the data considering

that the numbers are going up quickly

and the situation is rapidly evolving

and of course seeing the international

numbers and right now we're mostly

watching to see what's happening south

of the border and their cases are 6330 -

as of this morning and 107 deaths so

those numbers are are changing

considerably each day and it's

interesting also to see that the

European total or the countries outside

of China equal China at this stage with

cases in that so the other ones are

working their way through with

especially the numbers are concerned in

Italy and the ongoing ones in other

countries in the EU as you heard some

messaging we're waiting to get some

definitive messaging on any changes in

border from the federal government in

there and get that Definity from our

chief Public Health Officer I haven't

received them as at the time

conference in that regard I know he had

questions on that yesterday and right

now we had left it with some Canadians

and Americans but we hear there might be

some updates and but I said I'm

officially waiting for updates from our

federal counterparts on that matter in

that so I think we get a sense or my

sense is that Ontarians have taken this

seriously

many are limiting activities there's

always some who do something different a

little bit but I think for the most part

I walked around and seeing the streets

because I have to get down to the

command center and I think people are

listening and taking care and I want to

encourage them to keep at that as they

were in day three of you may of the

total and from from the parents with the

children at home it's obviously seem

like a more in the long weekend and

they're trying to deal with those issues

in there and I really am encouraged by

all the different groups both volunteers

and companies and media that are come in

with ideas to help people I guess try

and make social isolation sociable and

liveable on that and because it is a

change for a lot of people it's not easy

and some face more difficulties than

others especially we're dealing with

limitations on certain facilities and

we're trying to understand work with

that as best we can and to maintain the

the controls we have in place the social

distancing as we wait for we hear

large numbers of Canadians returning

especially for himself at the border and

we hope to enter them into the

monitoring and isolation process and

keep them advised continue using our

self-assessment tool and our assessment

centers are the numbers of assessment

centers have been expanding and continue

to do so and we're having consultations

also with our partners in federal

government in that and with indigenous

and First Nation communities on how we

might strategize to deal with their

unique issues if and when they might

occur on a proactive basis so that's

been important as well in that so I

think there's many things happening and

planning and preparation in that and as

we said jazz of yesterday we still had

that one unfortunate death

and we're continue to monitor see if

there's any other ones of issue are

trying to get some databases clear on

can we have updates of how many are

hospitalized accurately and other kind

of information that so we keep trying to

look at our data report and how we can

make sure we're doing it in a timely

fashion that's informative to you in the

media and to the public at large on how

is the whole thing going so we're

working on that at this time so with

that looking for questions I think is

there a time limit yes go ahead

I just you mentioned the testing and

that we would shortly get to 5,000 tests

a day can you you say when that might be

will it be a week will it be two weeks

and how many tests are being done a day

currently you know I can't actually say

exactly when we'll be up to 5,000

hopefully soon I don't know the exact

date I think we're doing just under a

thousand right now a day and this this

five resolved cases it stayed at five

for quite some time now I think two

weeks what does that tell you and is

that concerning well actually we've been

working with public health Ontario and

looking at the literature as we learn

more and more about this new infection

in terms of when is a person no longer

infectious to others and looking at

criteria that hopefully will not require

lab testing because right now we very

strict criteria they have to have two

negatives specimens at least 24 hours

apart and we're looking at changing two

criteria so that I'm sure a vast

majority of our cases have recovered we

just haven't they haven't met the

criteria so we're looking at changing

that yesterday you say people who don't

have symptoms shouldn't get tested

but unless anything's changed you know

the people can still be positive but not

have symptoms and they can still be

infectious

sure isn't it just best to cover all

bases and test everybody or is this just

like an infrastructure that you don't

have enough to do that we keep asking

our experts at public health Ontario and

are also with public health agency of

Canada and the stance is still if there

are some people that are asymptomatic if

they are shed and it's not much at all

and so therefore they don't seem to be

of concern for infectious rates at this

time at least the science indicates that

we continue to be advised by those

experts as they continue to the research

right now if you were more concerned

when you develop symptoms then you've

obviously had general system impact by

the virus and you're probably

replicating quite a bit and you're

reproducing more and potentially

secreting a lot more so I think we'll

continue to be directed by our Ontario

and national and international experts

if there's any change in that

significantly I know there's many people

have some reports they think so but one

of the challenges they have there when

they think they found someone

asymptomatic is that you're looking at

bits and pieces of RNA in their nasal

pharyngeal tract it may be vibrant or

may not one or two because a very sense

of tests does that mean they're highly

infectious or you just happen to find it

and this may seem like wordsmithing but

that's what the science gets down to and

their interpretation and we have to wait

for the experts to come back and say is

there been any change in that right now

to test everybody just because they want

to get tested we don't have that

capacity we want to make sure that we

have the capacity to test those who

really do need testing and to do it in a

timely fashion because especially for

some in some clinical edie and inpatient

side they need to know fairly quickly

there's some other unique situations

that we do need to know because it

affects your public health response or

in the previous case the clinical

response so some have a need to need

more than others and they need to have

it not held up because there is

processing time they need to be

expedited through the process because it

has further impacts

dr. Williams actually I'm not sure if

it's for you or for dr. Jaffe but in

regards to I'm social distancing at

workplace is given at some of the

recommendations you've issued as well as

the emergency orders from the premier

and from cabinet our employers in

workplace is required to bring in some

sort of social distancing within their

workplaces if for instance they have

more than 25 50 people in a in a space

and what do you say to employees who

might be afraid to speak up about that

side of the situation

well we've asked and I know the

Primera's very pause about that

retailers and company and owners would

only want what's best for their staff

I think we're asked them to work with

that I found a number of employers have

already taken steps to do so try to work

from home school or virtual methods

distances you can do it will they be

ones that may not adhere to that there

could be and I guess we'll have to

understand how we might be appraised of

that or be aware of that and make some

suggestions we haven't gone to any

further extension to actual workplaces

per se it doesn't mean that the premier

with the order and the cabinet could not

go there if they felt as need to they

didn't go there yet but I guess they'll

have to be informed by feedback and a

situation that the government is

appraised of our employers who do not

provide social distancing at work are

they actually violating was not in the

order right now that the workplaces per

se were not in the order in that but as

the premier said and as the minister

said they can amend those and add more

on as they see the need to yes I think

it's free talking a through probably

about ten I've heard some concern from

family doctors in particular that they

simply do not know what they are

supposed to do with a patient who

presents to them with the symptoms

Kove in nineteen there it's unclear how

they get them referred for testing in

terms of the messaging that's being it

seems to be very inconsistent messaging

coming either from the health ministry

or the Ontario Medical Association or

their College Physicians and Surgeons

what should a family not for do in this

in that situation well that's not good

to hear actually I think the we have

been working very closely with the

Ontario Medical Association and I know

they have sent out many communications

to physicians and of course if the

physician is unsure they should be

contacting the OMA they can contact us

but I think the OMA would be able to

give them more of a clinical answer I

mean my husband's a family doctor and

certainly doesn't ask me for advice but

anyway you know I think that the bottom

line is that we want them to see less

patients they can do it more virtually

and if they're concerned the patient can

also do the self assessment tool online

but if they're concerned they can send

the patient to an assessment center and

I think that information is available to

them so hopefully they're not seeing it

money patients with a question of code

that they should be sending them a thing

about sending them to the Assessment

Center is seems to be the crux of the

concern that I'm hearing is that it's

unclear how you refer someone to

investment center is are you supposed to

phone the Assessment Center give them a

referral when how does a person get seen

at an Assessment Center well I'm

assuming the patient can call themselves

the doctor can call but you know we will

look into that I don't know this health

yeah you can go through and tell how

we're trying to look at we're staffing

up considerably with another 140 odd

nurses added to it so we're trying to

improve that we're trying to improve the

overall flow of that information so that

we'd like to use a self-assessment tool

first in that and that gives you advice

where to call is there loads an each

section that's slowing down is there is

is that acceptable no it isn't how do we

fix that and resolve that we need to do

that we're working at that as quickly as

we can because the people shouldn't be

left especially it was just returning

what am I supposed to do what advice and

that and the physicians of course if

they're not tied into the system they're

asking whether and what am I supposed to

recommend as you've alluded to we're

trying to work with you all May on that

one there so the flow of requests like

we said the self-assessment two went out

Sunday evening by midnight had ninety

four thousand hits

so the demand and request for

information is extensive overwhelming so

we have to keep trying to meet that and

because if they're not informed and they

won't be making the right decisions so

we're trying to look at all the system

improvements throughout to make it more

efficient effective and I would say

timely for people to contact so the time

delays right now in our minds and in

minds of telehealth noise is not

acceptable so we have to rapidly look at

trying to improve that and things for

colleagues yeah I just want to follow up

one thing here is if I feel like I have

to send somebody out there listening

watching has feels they have the

symptoms what do they do in terms of

getting to a self assessment center do

they just show up

do they have to see their family doctor

do they need some sort of well first

they should try if they can't get out of

this try to implement the

self-assessment tool which is on our

website which will help them direct what

to do and if it says call telehealth it

should call telehealth Asia they really

shouldn't call their own doctor and they

can call the Assessment Center and say

I'm coming I think the assessment

centers strongly prefer somebody makes

an appointment because they don't want

people lining up that's not a good

situation all right I had kind of a

tough question relates to some a lot of

emails I'm getting from readers

what do you do if if you've got someone

in your house who's come back from

foreign travel and it's asymptomatic and

a self isolating do you have to self

isolate too and then a quick follow okay

so we've got different scenarios so a

person who's traveled and during

symptomatic they've known they have to

limit their social activities that

isolate not go out except you know if

they had to go out and grab something

they could by supposed to stay in the

house and or out and around then go for

a walk if you're living with them where

do you have to self ice lake to know you

don't because you're you're not

connected now you need to monitor now if

that if your partner whoever's in the

house you're with develop symptoms then

they do they do the self assessment tool

so they then become potentially a person

under investigation because they have a

travel history or it could be a

personality case contact they know and

they develop symptoms then are they

going to be tested or they get tested

yes or no a case that to go through the

process while they're going on I have to

assume that person could be a potential

case that affects me that I have to do

then some more further monitor myself

because I could be a contact that case I

still can do my normal activities I'm

not really attached yet to a case but I

have to go on the pretense that they

could be a case and I'd rather say after

24 hours when I got the test wheeled

back during that time I did not go out I

didn't do this this this so I did what I

was supposed to do because I'm now

connected to a case I'm like my partner

was in that sense we're doing a

comparison because they had a travel

history now I have a case contact

history and I have a new status that's

at Sage just a quick follow-up to that

is what is the recommended for treatment

who think they're positive but have not

been tested I'm assuming treat yourself

as if for the flu and if you have

trouble breathing then that's when you

need to get to the ER is there anything

more well I mean bill is that a good

medicine because there's some debate out

there where at

good could have some side-effects or

some troubles well I mean it's

symptomatic relief right it's just like

if you have the flu or something so if

you're coughing it takes something for

your cough if you have a fever you take

something to reduce your fever you know

keep up your fluids get some rest you

know eat healthy all the things you're

supposed to do normally but if you're

starting to feel it trouble breathing

that that's quite serious or high fever

that's not going down with medication or

you're just feeling really sick and weak

you should you know either try the

online assessment tool or at that point

call your doctor or the telehealth I've

heard the report about the end Sitz

versus tylenol I've asked some people

are what's your view of that it's just

one article someone wrote on what's the

foundation of it so anything that's out

there we try to look into and see if

there's some merit to it this question

we're getting contacted by nurses it's

contact several times

ambulances pick people up they're

wearing full PPE or the full gown and

then they're coming to the emergency

room and they're wheeling the patient

into the emergency room wearing

everything the nurse that receives out

the staff that receive it don't even

wear a mask is that correct is that

protocol should that change and it may

be protocol but you can tear that you

can see the fear factor there so the the

protocol why the analyst drivers do it

if they go out and pick up someone who's

had supposedly but they don't know what

they had and it may be they've heard in

the report in there having a respiratory

issue so they have to assume they don't

know what the cause is

it could be airborne as in measles or

tuberculosis or things like that so

that's part of their protocol because

you have to assume the worst situation

if they feel an assess that they're

bringing in a person with unknown

respiratory infections case coming in

they have to call ahead of the hospital

they should receive that patient

accordingly with proper PPE for the

staff so that's part of the notification

if they think they're bringing in a

potential respiratory case especially

they think it might be Colvin or some

other respiratory infection then because

the hospital staff also can't be sure

what it is until testing is done those

staff receiving that patient or gonna

have that have to wear proper protection

similar and until they know once they

know it's covered then they can say well

the direction is it's droplet spread

then under the direction and given out

it would take certain steps at that time

until you know you have to assume that

you don't know and you have to take

proper precautions and make sure that

person goes into an isolation type set

up and the staff going to see that

person until the assessments done are

properly protected if not from several

nurses receiving a patient after the

the ambulance the EMS is wearing proper

PPE they shouldn't be taking in patients

whether you've been a master we have to

make sure the institution each one

except the protocol is properly and

they're following it those are standard

iPAQ principles Antonella then we have

to go to the phone lines I'm sorry are

there any exclusions to the

self-quarantine rule after traveling for

frontline workers paramedics anybody

long-term care staff anybody right now

we're reviewing that matter and the

various institutions are looking for

communications out from my office to

give directions on that matter

it'll be forthcoming ok this is why the

supply shortage I mean how equipped is a

terrace health care system to deal with

this because we know it's only sometimes

you're going to get worse with more

cases coming forward so how equipped is

the province for this okay so that's the

command table and with Ontario health

and with the reason was so how is each

region doing what's the status limiter

because each one is equipped differently

and so you're asking a variety of

different institutions are they equipped

to respond to a variety of different

things in a variety of different ways so

the each one has to do their own

assessment their own operation procedure

we call it coop plans continuity of

operations what are you going to do in

Scenario they B or C are you prepared

and then how we're gonna prepare the

system for that how we're going to

reallocate as the minister talked about

are we gonna look at some different

sites and locations this is all first a

institutional response then you look at

a regional response and then you look at

a system response so the answer is all

the above are important but H is as good

as the strengths of each small part

everyone has to do their part of Nonis

assessing their current status and what

are you gonna do in in a and B and see

if things progress and how's the region

going to respond and then how prevents

liver donors we have to get to the phone

lines

no just remember not to put your phone

on speaker one question one follow-up

next question is from Maura Warburton at

Reuters

hi so my question is is the testing

holdup syllabus vlogs or is about

something else

I'm sorry it's gonna answer dairy my

phone the setting yep

can you ask the question again please oh

sure can you hear me is the holdup about

swabs or is it about something else if I

understand the question is the testing

capacity about is that what you're

asking I think some hold up I heard

something sorry is the testing hold up

about swab about worried about something

else the testing well we the number of

tests pending is one of there's a load

issue and processing that's one aspect

the other aspect is the time we're

trying to open up our satellite centers

to take that load on and the other one

is we got to make sure all the different

components you've got your equipment at

your sites you got your reagents and

you've got your staffing demand those as

well as the swabs and we working with

our federal counterparts we understand

there's some potential large orders

coming in and they're doing distribution

but we're going to be informed on that

so we have been in dialogue because each

one of those is important parts of the

system performance in the labs okay very

quick follow-up please and do you have a

sense of when that capacity will be at

full volume the five thousand a day we

keep asking our Public Health lab people

on that knowings we get one part done

you have to get all the components so

when we have all the swabs we need all

the reagent we need and all the

equipment and other sites up will be at

that five thousand and there's a number

of moving parts there so I can't tell

exactly when that'll be

they had anticipated in two to three

weeks back a week or so ago so I'm still

interesting we moved up increased some

volume and we'll keep increasing that up

on there so there's a lot of moving

parts there but that's our that's we're

heading towards question is from Jeff

great at The Globe and Mail the Minister

of Health this issue of health care

workers who if they weren't healthcare

workers should have been self isolating

after they came back from travel

told not to you said you're working on

some new guidance about that and will it

involve some sort of tracking of where

this process took place to see if

there's any any problems that results on

it okay just the last part was the

tracking of well will you trap will you

be able to track where which hospital

did allow people to come back oh well

that's the thing we find different

hospitals have done different things so

there's a sense from the command table

we need to put out a communication doubt

ask everybody to follow the same

processes so that's we're hoping to put

together and send out so there isn't

this variation from site to site and

it's much more consistent so we're

trying to remedy that problem that's our

current stance and we're going to work

there a command table to say how that's

going to be affected because there's

different issues involved in HHR at the

hospitals we want to understand that so

again that's part of our communication

on a go-forward basis

next question from AB City News hi there

I'm wondering so recently a group of

health care professionals in Ontario

sent a letter saying or asking

governments for Kovac 19 protection

saying they don't have access to

necessary personal protective equipment

what's your response to that my response

that if they're in one of those centers

and that they should approach the

regional planning tables in that and or

through their organization I'm not sure

if you're talking about actual

institutional people you're talking

about private you're talking about a

clinical group there's a variety groups

out there we would ask that they

approach the regional table to see about

that issue per se if it is a system-wide

thing with a certain group that is a pan

Ontario group that needs a decision

that's something to look forward to our

command table but we've been trying to

work through at our regional tables to

look at those local needs and see how

they can be dealt with

a quick follow-up do we do we know how

many healthcare professionals including

nurses have been tested for the virus

yet how many healthcare workers have

been tested well because the lot of them

have come back as individuals and have

been tested personally in that if they

have we don't usually record their

professional where they're at if they

actually went through a workplace we may

know that so no we don't have that

distinct number at this stage next is

Alistair sharp at national observer I'm

just kind of someone related to that a

parent of a very vulnerable patient had

have told me that home health care that

her son requires she's she asked him to

use masks and they said that directions

were that it wasn't mandatory and quoted

something called equitable and managed

distribution I'd like to know what that

is and whether it is likely to change

too to ensure that the most vulnerable

patients are protected from their nurses

who could potentially be carriers

asymptomatic carriers okay

I think I got the context if I can get

it straight

vulnerable people if they're having I

assume the vulnerable person could be in

a home setting could be in a

institutional setting a retirement home

hospice or somewhere if it's the latter

ones

anyone who's come into there has to pass

a screening test of that without travel

history in the last 14 days contact no

one in known case in 14 days and they're

asymptomatic so therefore they should

not be in if they are a any of the if

there's symptomatic travel or case we've

already answered the question about a

symptomatic transmission and our stance

is still that well from experts we do

not have the evidence that they are

transmitting why they're asymptomatic if

you're talking about someone in a

private home

in that situation there I would ask that

the family we've asked them the the

vulnerable people especially a certain

agent over that they would continue to

stay in their home

I think visiting a family members are

visiting one you would want to make sure

you did your own assessment which is if

you travel last 14 days don't visit use

computer visit to a face time if you

have been in contact with the case don't

visit till 14 days after and you're

asymptomatic or if you're sick don't

visit either and so you're doing your

own assessment for the protection of

your loved one and your family member

and try and use other virtual methods if

it's really vital and you need to get in

there then you're gonna have to have a

unique challenge of how you might do

that in that situation on an

institutional setting that's one thing a

home setting is a different one okay

quick follow-up yeah separately the

Minister of Health has has talked about

a target of getting back the testing

results back to a 24 to 48 hour

turnaround it's currently at four days

given that there's an explosion of

requests for tests and there's at least

a week perhaps to it sounds from your

previous answer before there's gonna be

more supply how do you intend to bring

that down in the next week or so

right that's what we're trying to look

at there is as one of the other members

here asked already is that we want to

make sure we do first priority testing

so that those who need to know urgently

would still get it done in a timely

fashion for example if you have a

patient admitted in the hospital that

you think it is you need that test

result back as quick as possible

even quicker in six hours of you could

but you've got to get the sample in

there if it's a person in an ICU and you

don't know the diagnosis you need to

know that if it's something you're

considering admitting you need to know

that if it's a health care worker that

potentially is a problem has been on the

in some exposure you won't know that as

soon as possible if there's some other

unique ones and we're trying to work on

how that works with our first nation and

communities etc so they because the

unique circumstances should have a

turnaround rapidly the rest we can do

that because if I right now if I came

back traveling from somewhere and I am I

am

some symptoms sort of mild and that I'm

at home I'm coughing a bit and I get it

if I send a sample him I'm told it I

also isolate for 14 days and I'm symptom

free if I get a test result back on its

most isolated for 14 days time symptom

free so whether I know or not right that

day it doesn't change how I'm supposed

to behave but I think from a standpoint

if I got a test I should get informed

sometime what my result is so the

urgency is not as much but the need to

get the results back is still there we

only have time for one more reporter

Laura Gerson at CMA J hi my question is

that many family doctors are telling us

that they and as well as nurses and

people in the community who see patients

do not have the correct protective

equipment don't know how to get it don't

know when they are going to get it and

some patients are going to bypass or

somehow slip through and potentially

endanger both them and their other

patients for instance if they're

treating palliative patients and they

need to get in to see them so what are

you doing to ensure they have the perch

protective equipment okay I think I mean

what we've been trying to say all along

is that during the regular flu season

when there's people coming in to your

practice that you're supposed to ask

them it are they sick and do they have

respiratory symptoms whether it's

influenza or potentially Kovach 19

you're supposed to call ahead and make

that appointment and then you're

supposed to either decide whether going

to see them at that time or wait till

later in the day when the waiting room

is empty and assess if you think that's

combined with travel history and conduct

of a case we're saying I would be better

do you say go to either call the self

assessment tool called telehealth all

these processes we talked before I bring

them into your office practice you put

some pressure on the other patients and

your system and your staff that you

really don't need because you want

there's all those other patients that

still need to be seen and you don't want

to interrupt your practice on that basis

in that so we'd rather you not try to

test them there so it's part of your

pre-screening if they're as you say

other people who choose not

and that's always a challenge anyone of

course you hope your reception staff

pick it up that someone's coming in

they're quite hacking and coughing you

just say you know well you didn't call

it ahead of time put this mask on a

surgical mass and go and sit over in the

far corner or wait outside until we talk

to you later and so they have to be

fairly stringent and firm on that and

the people who didn't follow the due

process we've asked them to do that so

in that sense what kind of PPE do you

need you normally use what you normally

do in your practice there we're not

asking you get involved heavily in doing

covert 19 testing one is that we haven't

got all those kits out there to do we

have our sessemann centers up set up to

do that and so we can handle that that

way if you would need to wear a surgical

mask because you're looking at wound or

a site on a fall but patient you can

have your surgical masks that you can

use three or four or five times because

it's for you or for you to protect the

patient from you not the other way

around so there's ways they can deal

with it

we try to keep looking after those

supply issues whether it's gloves and

masks and depends what kind of your

practices what kind of prices you're

seeing and how you minimize those

exposures we're asking to do a lot more

with our new codes through virtual and

there's a methods to do that building so

you don't have to bring everyone into

the office so as many ways you can do it

to limit that and so we asked you to

talk to the OMA and others on that do

that if you have questions salt with

their respective authorities and we'll

try and give us best advice as soon as

we can in that regard open this is the

last question padding up please the

issue though I think you guys are not

are kind of skirting this issue the

issue is there doesn't seem to be enough

even mask people are running out of

gloves

they don't have personal protective

equipment and the doctors are concerned

about this okay they get it well again

if we may over aware that and feeds food

either through the Ontario Medical

Association or through our regional

offices we can look at that some people

get various reports some find it's easy

to get it some have more difficulty so

it may be an ordering problem there's

different things in there so we it's

varying familiarity areas so we have to

be dealing with that individual and how

they get tagged into one of our supplies

issues thank you that's it thanks

everyone q thank you
