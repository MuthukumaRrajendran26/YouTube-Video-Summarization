there remain a lot of unknowns about the

potentially deadly coronavirus since

word of it first began to emerge from

China on New Year's Eve dr. Michael

garden is going to help explain what we

know and don't know he's chief of staff

at Humber River Hospital and he's a

specialist in infectious disease dr.

garden China which is the epicenter of

this virus has shared the genetic

sequence of it why is that important

it's really important for a couple

reasons one that's what the molecular

testing is based on so if you have the

sequence then you can develop a rapid

test to be able to diagnose people with

it and the other reason is ready to do

more basic science looking at how

similar is this to SARS and MERS and

other corona viruses and also the tease

out if there if there's any genes that

relate to specific virulence factors so

things that make you sicker because that

that organism has that particular gene

so all that work will be going on in the

next several months what's the most

vital thing that scientists and

specialists need to know about the virus

in order to try to control its spread

first of all the most important thing

was to have a diagnostic test which we

now have so that's that's very good but

I think right now the most important

thing is exactly how how contagious is

this if this virus becomes as contagious

as influenza for example then all the

control measures we are we're taking

aren't really gonna slow it down if it

remains the way it is which doesn't seem

to be terribly contagious then I

actually think we have a pretty good

chance of actually stopping this

outbreak over there over the coming

month or so well let's talk about how

contagious we think it is now do we know

how long it takes for symptoms to

develop we don't have a good answer for

that yet but the the sort of the outer

limit is believed to be two weeks and so

that's what we're saying if somebody's

traveled to Wuhan City in the last two

weeks we would look at them for likely

many people it's going to be shorter

than that but it's likely not going to

be longer than that and do we know that

whether they are contagious possibly

before symptoms begin to appear you know

we we really don't know any of that yet

I'll say for other viruses we know that

people typically start shedding the

virus typically several hours maybe a

day

to the onset of their symptoms but the

amount of virus is usually pretty low

once they start to develop symptoms

typically the amount of virus increases

many fold and they also have symptoms at

that time so typically we think of

people being the most infectious when

they actually have symptoms and is there

a definitive test right now that can be

done to determine whether they have it

or not there is a definitive test and

that's really one of the remarkable

things about this before this virus has

even landed in Canada we already have a

test for it and if you think back to

2003 we went through most of the SARS

outbreak without a test and so this is

one of the reasons why we're miles ahead

today than we were back then okay well I

learned a lot from you dr. Michael Gard

I'm a specialist in infectious disease

thanks you're very welcome
