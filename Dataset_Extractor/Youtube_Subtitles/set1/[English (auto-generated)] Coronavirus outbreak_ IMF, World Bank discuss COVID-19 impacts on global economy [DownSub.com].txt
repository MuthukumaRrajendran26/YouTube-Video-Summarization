body the IMF see International Monetary

and financial committee representing our

189 members it demonstrated strong unity

of the membership in the face of a

serious threat to people and the world

economy clear commitment for action in a

coordinated manner before I go any

further my deepest sympathy to those

affected all over the world we are

determined to act to reduce the risk and

impact on people let me first frame the

objective of this call the IMF Seacole

first to place our scenarios about the

potential impact on the global economy

in the context of what we know and what

we don't know about coronavirus second

to concentrate on a framework for how to

think about the shocks and how we the

membership the fund the World Bank other

organizations can support those affected

by this crisis in an effective and

coordinated manner and third in that

spirit of collaboration to learn from

each other especially from the countries

that are on the front line of response

to the outbreak so what we know we know

the disease is spreading quickly with

over one third of our membership

affected directly this is no longer a

regional issue it is a global problem

calling for a global response we know

the outbreak will eventually retreat but

we don't yet know how fast this would

happen we don't yet know how the virus

would respond when treatment and vaccine

will be available on scale we know the

shock is somewhat as unusual as it

effects significant elements of both

supply and demand supply is disrupted

due to morbidity and mortality but also

the containment efforts that restrict

mobility and the high cost of doing

business due to restricted supply chains

and the tightening of credit demand is

also falling due to higher uncertainty

increased precautionary behavior

containment efforts and rising financial

cost that reduce the ability to spend

and these effects spill over across

borders what we know from experience in

similar a crisis is that about one third

of the economic losses from the disease

will be direct costs from loss of life

workplace closures and quarantines

the remaining two-thirds will be

indirect reflecting a retrenchment in

consumer and business behavior and a

tightening in financial markets in other

words the impact of uncertainty we also

know that we have a sound financial

system much more resilient than it was

before the global financial crisis

however what we are wrestling with is

uncertainty and that

defines our projections which at this

point lead us to state that global

growth in 2020 will deep deep below its

last year's levels but how far it will

fall and how long the impact would be is

still difficult to predict it would

depend on the epidemic and it would

depend on the timeliness and

effectiveness of our actions and I want

to focus on on dose number one priority

in terms of fiscal response is ensuring

frontline health related spending to

protect people's well-being to take care

of the sick and slow the spread of the

virus I cannot emphasize enough how

urgent it is for authorities to lean

forward in funding outbreak related

health spending and they need to match

demand with supply of the necessary

protective and treatment health health

products this is particularly

challenging for the countries where

health systems are weaker

where is ponds capacities weaker and it

calls for a global coordination

mechanism to accelerate matching demand

with supply of what is necessary for the

health system to respond and I can tell

you that we the World Bank and I'm

are stepping in taking our

responsibility for this global

coordinating mechanism number two there

are macro financial policy actions to

tackle the demand and supply shocks that

I mentioned before and the aim should be

to stress no regrets actions that

shorten and soften the economic impact

that are timely and targeted to sectors

businesses and households that are

hardest hit and I was very encouraged to

hear during the call countries stepping

up exactly that type of targeted

effective actions our role is to

accelerate the the the transmission of

practical practices so the global

community can act faster and more

effectively we are faced with a

generalized weakening in demand and that

goes through confidence and true

spillover channels including trade and

tourism commodity prices tighter

financial conditions they call for an

additional policy response to support

demand and ensure an adequate supply of

credit third adequate liquidity will be

also needed to offset financial

stability risks and a number of central

banks are also stressing contingency

planning for situations in which they

may be working from home and some

disruptions very encouraging to hear how

seriously this is being addressed so in

short it is a fast evolving situation it

requires a high degree of coordination

and we are determined to deliver on that

so let me finish with how can the IMF

help what is our response we can be a

a force of support for our members at

risk those with weak health systems

inadequate policy space to commodity

exporters that are exposed to terms of

trade shocks and to others that are

particularly vulnerable to spillover

impacts and I can tell you I both David

Malpass and I are particularly concerned

about our low income most vulnerable

members these countries would see their

financial needs rising rapidly as the

human and economic cost builds up we are

working to identify highest

vulnerability so we can be ready to step

up and for that we have three sources

one thanks to the generosity and

mobilization of our membership we rely

on one trillion dollars in overall

lending capacity to for low-income

countries and for emerging middle-income

countries we do have rapidly disbursing

emergency financing up to fifty billion

dollars that does not require a

full-fledged IMF program and three we

have catastrophic containment and relief

trust it provides eligible countries

these are the poorest of countries with

upfront grants to relief I map that

service we caught on our membership to

step up we now have 200 million dollars

we would like to increase this capacity

so we can respond to the most vulnerable

so let me finish by saying we are fully

committed to support our members we

heard their call today this morning we

have the tools to help and we are

coordinating very closely with partner

institutions thank you thank you

managing director president Malpass

thank thank you and thank you Kristalina

for the for the cooperation the

coordination the good working

relationship and I share your

expression of sympathies to the families

and to the communities that are being

affected and will be affected by this

tragedy and virus I you were talking

about the IMF C so yeah I want I want to

separate a little bit the governance

structure yesterday I presented to the

World Bank Group Board the policy

package and we announced a twelve

billion dollar package yesterday what

the World Bank is doing is working to

provide a fast flexible response based

on developing country needs will be

bringing virus related operations

forward in March the speed is needed to

save lives at this point and the breadth

of the response is key to its

effectiveness most effective if is if

it's broad and brings in many countries

that are working to reduce the

transmission of the of the pathogens

with the in order to do that we're

providing technical assistance also

goods and services so that will help

prevent and limit the local transmission

including laboratory equipment and

systems to ensure that cases cases of

the virus are promptly identified and

traced goods such as gloves masks

portable ventilators and also health

infrastructure such as the stocking of

emergency rooms clinical care quarantine

facilities and the actual building of

those so those are those are a core part

of the package we announced yesterday

and also the convening with the w-h-o

where the World Bank Group IMF are

working closely with whu-oh on on the on

on the on the cooperation with regard to

procurement and other important

technical matters we need a system for

real time community-based disease

surveillance and that's conceived in the

package that World Bank Group announced

yesterday it

so I won't go through all the details

with you but two core things it's a

twelve billion dollar package of which

six billion dollars is IBRD and Ida and

that enables and allows special

protection for poorer countries and then

there's also six billion dollars from

the International Finance Corporation

that's critical because it's private

sector financing it's fast-acting and it

takes the form of trade finance and

working capital finance which are one of

the most needed goods within this with

one of the most needed services that can

be provided during this crisis and the

the and there there can be additional

resources on a needs basis as of

yesterday there were 12 countries that

had expressed need I want to mention

also that pandemic emergency financing

facility it the pep bands that people

have talked about it may provide more

additional resources if it's triggered

so in the in the explanation of that

facility it's not money coming from the

World Bank but it's money coming into

the facility from capital markets and so

that's an important potential source of

new new assistance let me turn now to

the economics the health issues are very

are have uncertainty so do the economic

issues we're doing the World Bank

working with the IMF doing extensive

analysis on global value chains on

tourism on commodities the the decline

in commodity prices and also the

connection to corporate debt there

there's the clear need for financing of

small businesses and of innovation and

so that that is done through short-term

floating rate capital financing which is

exactly the instruments the World Bank

using in this in this it's important

that the fiscal and monetary stimulus

not shift resources away from working

capital we want to really find ways to

supplement and augment the availability

of working capital which is the capital

companies need to import goods to build

up their rebuild their inventories so

it's the short-term financing that's

critical during a crisis what we know is

that frozen the amount of frozen capital

in the world has gone up substantially

and so what we're trying to do from the

World Bank side is unlock that capital

and and allow it to continue into

working capital in some the speed and

breadth of the response is crucial to

its effectiveness that's what we're were

were were set out to do and then looking

beyond if we can take one

one moment beyond it's important to work

to increase the resilience to shocks to

improve health systems and to make

growth oriented structural reforms

within economies and also build this

system of working capital that I was

describing so that we can leave a faster

growing world after the crisis is is

passed through Thanks thank you very

much let's turn to your questions in the

room please identify yourself by name

and affiliation keep the questions short

and we'll try and take as many as we

possibly can let's start in the front

row here yes sir thank you very much

thank you thank you very much I'm

reporter from CCTV and CGT and Gabriel

yeah I got two questions first

it's that managed directly I mentioned

some updates on global economy and also

previously I'm a particular about the

corona virus situation presents a

reshape impact on China's economy and

recently a lots of economic activities

in China have been resumed so I wonder

if there is any general assessment on

the recent economic behavior in China

and also the second question is

regarding to depression malp has just

mentioned some structural reforms now

many countries are dealing with this

coronavirus situation some are doing

relatively well some are still facing

challenges I wonder from the perspective

of the IMF and

or Bank is there it has this epidemic

situation review of some vulnerabilities

in the global level that needs to be

talked on in the future thank you very

much and let's start the front row here

yes sir thank you very much thank you

thank you very much I'm reporter from

CCTV and CGT and Gabriel young yet I got

two questions first is that a

metamagnetic director you mentioned some

updates on global economy and also

previously I'm a predicted that the

corona virus situation presents a

reshape impact on China's economy and

recently lots of economic activities in

China have been resumed so I wonder if

there is any general assessment on the

recent economic behavior in China and

also the second question is regarding

suppressed Malpass just mentioned some

structural reforms now many countries

are dealing with this coronavirus

situation some are doing relatively well

some are still facing challenges I

wonder from the perspective of the IMF

and the World Bank as there has this

epidemic situation reveal some

vulnerabilities in the global level that

needs to be tackled in the future thank

you very much in terms of our

projections we unfortunately over the

last week have seen a shift to a more

adverse scenario for the global economy

we are working on updating our

projections and we will come up with

those in the next weeks in our World

Economic Outlook update as I said in my

opening under any scenario we see growth

in 2020 falling below the level in 2019

for China we have heard from the Chinese

authorities encouraging reporting on

restart of production

at this point they report 60% restart

and they expect by the next in the next

weeks to go up to 90% 100% this is

welcoming news for China and it is a

welcoming news for the world we would

like to get more specificity on

understanding of the epidemic before we

bring to you a assessment of what what

people what would be the letter to use

so bear with us we would take a bit of

time it is that uncertainty of the

spread of epidemics epidemic beyond

China that we need to carefully reflect

on and put our second question miss

Mabus as several thoughts on na and so

as far as lessons learned it's early one

thing we know is in previous crises the

World Bank was involved and did a

extensive evaluation of what tools

worked in what what until we're drawing

on that in creating the response to this

current crisis what we know is

information is critical during the

crisis and information systems and then

there there is the need for countries to

prepare and it where themselves for

disasters because they are not all that

rare and and use prevention as as the as

the best starting point and we do have

countries that are that are better

prepared for this crisis and I and

they're they're they're they're able to

respond to the crisis more quickly and

that's critical in avoiding the spread

also I'll take a note with regard to

sanitation and health systems and the

need for global expertise

is applied to those so a chunk of the

world bank's activity in countries is

aimed at the at the health system and

the sanitation systems that are so

important and we have the crisis

response window and other specific tools

for for disasters that are coming into

play now so key point is we evaluate

constantly as far as what tools and

instruments are going to work best and

then try to evolve that effectively

thank you but let me take writers in the

front row Andrea Andrea there's a mic

here thank you so much I understand that

there's quite a lot of uncertainty and

that you're unable to give us specific

projections at this point but can you

can you be a little bit more specific

and can you also explain what it was

specifically over the last week that

caused this great galvanization of

everyone in the entire financial

community I mean we saw a lot of action

yesterday the Fed lowered rates you say

a little bit more to about the monetary

response things the second part of your

question is more straightforward to

answer it is the sheer geographic spread

of the epidemic around the world as I

said in the beginning now we have one

third of our membership having

experienced cases of coronavirus it is

also the additional knowledge that has

been accumulated on how the virus

spreads and it is unfortunately

spreading undetected more than initially

was thought so the moment it became

clear it is no more just about China and

maybe small number of countries in Asia

surrounding China then the outlook

on what the impact could be change I

must stress that we have been looking at

different scenarios we made ourselves

clear that in a case that it is only

China and it is contained in China

rapidly there could be a milder impact

than we said it could be a v-shape

impact but it is no more the case and

that led to the answer to your second

question what we can say with certainty

is that we as we were spelling out we

have a baseline scenario that is

relatively mild impact and then we have

more dire scenarios we are considering

unfortunately we have moved in the

territory of this more dire scenarios

but we want to carefully assess before

we come up with a projections the two

factors that would be determining what

we would come up with shortly in the

next week's would be learning more about

the outbreak and learning more about

actions taken and their effectiveness

can I add one thing

sorry just just because you do you ask

to be specific the the best specificity

I can give you is that what we are

assessing now is a bottom up on a

country level what is the impact and how

that aggregates in our projections and I

want to I want to be very frank as long

as we do not know the duration of this

outbreak we will be in a higher

uncertainty space the positive result

today this morning

is a very high degree of mobilization

and cooperation very impressive and I'm

sure a president Malpass would have the

same take and measures that are being

put in place in a number of countries

that are well targeted measures and they

are going to be helpful to soften the

impact and hopefully shorten the

duration I just wanted to add the on the

economic side the global supply chain

and recognition of the of of the impact

and then the importance of the private

sector in that so as the as the as we

prepared our package this six billion

dollars from the International Finance

Corporation that private sector arm of

the World Bank is is important because

it directly addresses some of the supply

chain problems that we think are have

have are occurring thank you thank you

Alphonso FA please hello Alfonzo

Fernando from the Spanish newswire FA a

yesterday the Federal Reserve make like

a emergency rate cut do you think that

this cut was appropriate do you think

that that call has made the markets a

more confident or more nervous thank you

what is important to recognize is that

central banks are closely coordinating

with each other and the degree of

coordination over the last virtually the

last days across the world has increased

we do need to have measures that are

bringing a sense of confidence and in

that context different central banks

would act differently because they have

different space and different priority

in that regard we are keen to see

attention paid on the financial on

financial stability while at the moment

the financial system is in a good shape

and I want to stress again there has

been a lot done since the financial

crisis to put us on a better footing

today we do need to anticipate risks and

one of one of these risks would be

around access to credit not yet demo

demonstrably but we have to think about

it

in the court today there was a very

important message that came from one of

our members and it is at the time of

uncertainty it is better to lean forward

better to do more than to do not enough

and that that applies to health systems

and it applies to a policy measures and

to working capital so I enjoy underscore

and David was called it the the nibbler

for credit as you said and the

availability of that credit for for the

short-term growth needs that are out

there

Thanks thank you I'm going to take

Bloomberg in the front row Eric good

morning Eric Martin with Bloomberg News

I wanted to ask managing director about

the you've mentioned that there is some

degree of unpredictability in terms of

the exact levels for global growth with

the revisions in the economic outlook

are we in danger of seeing is one of the

scenarios being studied the possibility

of a global contraction and if you can

talk a bit about for both of you

President and Managing Director about

the thought process around the the IMF C

and the

committee meetings and we understand the

virtual meeting format for the for the

broader meeting but what are the

considerations behind what to do with

these two particular bodies thank you

yep thank you

thank you for the for the question and

with the risk of repeating myself

multiple times I would stress that at

this point what what we are confident to

state is that growth this year would

fall below the level of last year and we

would need to be carefully assessing

bottom up from analysis of

country-by-country data and of course on

a global level working together with

with the World Bank what are what are

these scenarios to present to the public

we again with the risk of being very

repetitive it is the duration of the

outbreak that is at this moment of time

difficult to predict and it is also we

are at the time when measures are being

put in place we will see demonstrably

the effectiveness of of these measures

over time what I believe that there is a

high degree of cooperation that is in a

moment like this is absolutely necessary

and it would help us to come through

this crisis in in a better in a better

way how we all talk again we will come

to this I'll answer on the virtual

question so the with growth below last

year recall it was already slow global

growth so it puts in a particular burden

on developing countries on poor

countries and we'll be addressing that

in the development committee meeting

which occurs in April uh and I expect it

to be virtual meaning

rather than people convening in

Washington

there'll be audio-visual and the bank

has substantial capability I think we'll

have a a useful Development Committee

meeting under this scenario but the the

a key point is if growth is slower from

an already slow level that puts a big

burden in I think it's incumbent on on

people not to have measures taken that

channel credit away from the working

capital that's so so importantly needed

so that that's a key a key criteria in

deciding and thinking about measures

could I just sat on the virtual meeting

two points one this morning we did a dry

run and it was a very effective meeting

we got all the business of the committee

done - as we move forward to planning

the meetings we are going to have other

focused discussions as well so I don't

want anybody to be left with the

impression that we are abandoning the

agenda we had for April we will just

change the modality and the format of

this agenda and for those of us who care

about fighting climate change we are

going to have a less carbon footprint

this spring unfortunate event but with

this benefit thank you

let me take the lady in the second row

yes ma'am thank you very much Gary and

I'm John she was trying to place too

tight a media all night first question

is the flat cut interest of Rebecca

percent yesterday and we met we see like

the market seems think it's not enough

do you still do recommend us to further

cut interest rate or to do more like

fiscal stimulus and secondly to those

countries without my

monetary policies based do you think

it's time for them to do a you know

fiscal stimulus thanks as I as I said in

in my opening comments we do prioritize

macro fiscal measures first and foremost

addressing vulnerabilities of the Health

System in other words we tell finance

ministers instruct the health

authorities to urgently finance those

measures that are critical for the

safety of people people first and that

means masks facilities for containment

if that is necessary as mr. mapa said

[Music]

respirators and the protective equipment

so medical personnel can do their job

this is a no regrets policy a very good

measure where we would be concentrated

on is to make sure that as our

institutions and countries themselves

provide financing to buy these goods

they are actually produced and available

and that is the point I made in the

beginning about global coordinating

mechanism for demand that is that is of

course going up to be appropriately met

by by increase of production repurposing

of production facilities if necessary

for so we can say the money is here

please produce it ASAP and the second

area of fiscal measures that we

recommend are those that are well

targeted to address the supply and

demand shock shocks and already measures

of that nature I'd be

being put in place in different

countries they they are around funding

social protection expenditures making

sure that people who stay home because

schools are closed they can have income

to support their families that there is

credit available for small and

medium-sized enterprises that there is a

restructuring of debt service

temporarily in other words giving a

couple of months especially for

companies in the sectors and the

physical geographic areas most impacted

and that is so very important to do we

and then mr. Malpass would say and we

need to have working capital so yes we

recommend those measures very strongly

yes and make sure that the central bank

actions don't take working capital away

from this very pressing pressing need

but I wanted to address you framed the

question in terms of fiscal and monetary

stimulus and I want to add in regulatory

stimulus and structural reform so one of

the most powerful thing countries can do

almost around the world is take actual

actions to improve their policies so

that the the prospective growth rate for

their countries can be pasture so rather

than think of it as a temporary stimulus

think of it as an investment by the

world in growth some countries are doing

that now and we're encouraging more to

take the important structural reforms

and regulatory reforms that enable more

supplied thanks thank you I want to go

online and take a few questions because

we've got very many journalists online

and I want to go to other parts of the

world the first question is for both MD

go-giver and president Malpass and so on

Africa

how much is from today news Africa how

much support can African countries

especially in sub-saharan Africa expect

from the IMF

the World Bank to counter this health

and economic impact of coronavirus we we

have done a quick assessment of

countries at highest risks because of

combination of four factors weak health

systems exposure to price shocks because

of commodity export orientation

vulnerability due to spillover impacts

from other countries and limited fiscal

space it is unfortunately clear from

this analysis that sub-saharan Africa

presents a particularly important area

of focus we do have up to ten billion

dollars available for low-income

countries to tap in with zero interest

rates and obviously we would prayer

prioritize countries especially

countries in Africa that have already

been faced with difficulties some of

them are programme countries of the fund

today and we have a trust fund that

allows for the lowest income countries

to pay their obligations to the IMF so

they can use this fiscal space to fund

priority investments only to add the the

World Bank has both either 18 and either

19 which are very large funds for poor

countries that are fully operational and

one of the things we're doing with the

package I announced yesterday is is is

of speeding up the reprogramming of that

assistance to meet the current crisis

it's based on the immediate that needs

of the countries themselves and also is

in the context of of

of reforms or of improvements in systems

that countries are making in order to

either meet their current health needs

or look forward at at new system so

there's substantial financing available

and we're accelerating that process

through the announcements yesterday

thank you again a question for both

principals this is we're moving to the

Middle East Al Arabiya what impact could

coronavirus have on your projections for

the oil-producing countries in the GCC

we recognize that all producing

countries have already been hit because

of the drop of demand for oil and all

prices crude oil prices have already

tumbled by more than 15 percent since

the beginning of the year and that

translates into some 10 billion dollars

of lost revenues across the men our oil

exporters what we are looking into is

what would that mean in terms of impact

on growth most of the countries do have

buffers and that is a good time to use

those buffers and we are like

recommending to everybody they also need

to focus on making sure that they

prioritize health expenditures first as

with the rest of the world we would come

up with our more detailed projections

once we we can sort out through the

uncertainty today but obviously growth

would be below our earlier baseline

scenario okay there's another question

it's coming from Jiji Press and Nikkei

but it's a broader question than Japan

and it's asking IMF you had indicated

growth for China would be zero point

four percentage points lower this year

does that still stand and how about

Japan and how about Europe and I guess

growth prospects against a question for

both both principals well we do go to

our earlier projection for the impact of

coronavirus on China within dropping

from six percent to five point six

percent growth that was our baseline

scenario with two very important

assumptions that the crisis is limited

to China it doesn't spread across the

world and that it is fully contained

that has not happened we have seen this

last week that our baseline scenario is

no more valid already then we looked at

adverse scenarios including for China in

which the impact on growth for China is

more significant the Chinese authorities

themselves are recognizing that there

would be a lower growth this year we

again we will have to work on the

numbers but it is very unfortunate that

I have to say that may that baseline

scenario no longer holds I'll just add

information is coming in and we're

assessing and monitoring the situation

in terms of growth but I wanted to make

the mention that the private sector is

forward-looking and so important in the

growth is is what what do what does what

do people around the world think will be

the outcome and so that gets into you

can

think of it as confidence but it's also

working capital it's also the structural

reforms and the regulatory reforms that

I mentioned so there'll be a dynamic

response from people around the world

based on what they perceived to be the

actions and coordinate the coordination

that we're doing I think is is intended

to show the the intent of the IMF and

the World Bank on that front and we've

seen the statement from the g7 and I

think all of that adds in to the

possibility of private sector beginning

to think about future investments even

even as the as we're learning more about

the extent of the crisis make a very

important point and it is we know from

prior experience with these kinds of

epidemic outbreaks that they eventually

would be retreating and there would be

eventually a treatment vaccine measures

that protect the world what is hugely

important today is to focus on building

a bridge between where we are and that

time when we would see a recovery to

make sure that the impact in meanwhile

is softened first and foremost on people

and also of course on businesses and the

economy and this is why I would urge

attention to concentrate on action that

is done in effective coordinated manner

thank you that gonna make that the last

response but I want to give president

mulpus an opportunity I thought that was

a good close agree we I just thank you

everybody for for in

is for being here and thank you

Kristalina for for leadership in

coordination in the IMF C this morning

that that body and we'll be focusing at

the World Bank on bringing forward

operations over the next just couple

weeks maybe three weeks to be very

responsive to the to the immediate needs

of countries as they as they are as we

work together on them Thanks thank you

president I'll pass thank you and Igor

Gotha thanks to all of you for coming

today and for our many friends who have

been on line today and we'll be in touch

in the coming days thanks very much
