when we forget what divides us and

remember what unites us remember repair

together

remember that 11 souls were taken from

us by an anti-semitic act of violence

repair our own brokenness and the

brokenness in our world together we feel

solace from the Solidarity of the Jewish

community people from all over Greater

Pittsburgh and supporters from around

the world it's just you know it's easy

to be hurt by all of this because of all

the pain and the shock that comes with

all of this but we just have to know

that this just like the love that we

need we need love we need it and it just

brings us all together as a community to

show that you know hate will not win you

know I'm not even from here like I'm

from Philadelphia I've lived here in

Pittsburgh for seven years now but even

though it's not my hometown that had

happened to it just hurts so much to

know that just know that if you know

that it's like I said it's easy to be

hurt by it but we just can't let it

happen you know we got to let love win

in these type of situations to show that

we're stronger than hate is is easier

than what you think you know let love in

just you know like anything like whether

it be like with a smile or with a hug

with an embrace just to show that you

know we will not let hate win that we

are stronger than hate that we will

always continue to be stronger than

we just let love in always so that we

are stronger than hate we will always

continue to be stronger than hate hate

is just like it's just an emotion that

could be easily you know beaten it can

be easily defeated by love we come every

day every every day all year we share

the same land the same physical space

we're neighbors so we live directly

behind we purchased our fence together

with the Tree of Life so our land is

theirs and we are a part of it as much

as everyone else in our community is but

yeah we're compelled to walk over every

single day well it signifies the fact

that we have to do better that we all

have to stop and recognize one another

now look at our phones and look at one

another directly have a conversation and

make the world a better place to prepare

sure how do we how can we continue to

live out that as we've seen in the

hoping to see how much I use that

message of Oh

random acts of kindness if you go to the

website for Achieva they have a campaign

love like the boys and you can actually

print off the token and and hand it to

someone and or not and just participate

in doing kind X for one another just to

remind ourselves that we are stronger

than hate them it's not a motto it

should be a lifestyle so the big picture

of today is that we're stronger than

hate hatred doesn't belong in Pittsburgh

and that like it can't we won't weaken

it city of Steel and stuff stuff with

the violence the violence does not show

anything it doesn't prove anything all

it shows is that evil and it won't bring

us down which shows that like again like

we're strong thirteen

it's just like I'm just I'm always for

like social work and I am a volunteer

and so I just thought that like about

what the big picture of today is and put

it down on paper just to pay respects in

the show people that it it's a it's a

really meaningful day and that it will

always be and that this is just it's not

fair to the people about Fitz Berg stop

with the violence and and just always be

kind and show people that you really

care because if you're evil it doesn't

show anything it just it makes it so

enough Evo in the world that we don't

need it anymore I do
