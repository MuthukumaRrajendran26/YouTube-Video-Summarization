copy that

I know you're trying to work on them can

is there any way to get the buildings in

the back or now any way to get the

buildings in the background okay

shop for death

that's bad as why does it get here but

we're trying here it's a bit busy

thank you

yeah

no worries thank you for that

you

together to make this happen

and so much more for New York City I

want to thank Governor Cuomo and

everyone in the state government who has

joined us in pushing from day one for

this kind of support

I want to thank from our administration

everyone who worked to get the dredging

done working with the military I want

everyone to understand and Admiral mustn

will affirm this this ship is here ahead

of schedule because the amazing work of

the military it's here ahead of schedule

because the dredging was done faster

than anyone knew it could be done to

allow this ship to dock I want to thank

everyone of the City Economic

Development Corporation our Emergency

Management team and also of course the

State Department environmental

conservation and the Army Corps

Engineers everyone pulled together this

was supposed to take two weeks to make

it possible for this ship to dock they

did it in eight days and that means help

has arrived quicker and we're going to

be able to do the life-saving work right

now

want to also thank from the military one

of the leaders who did the work to make

this moment possible Marine Corps

Colonel Brian de Plessis is with us

Thank You colonel

and from my team deputy mayor Raoul

parea Henson for Health and Human

Services and Commissioner James Hendon

Department of Veteran services Colonel

James Hendon thank you

so with this ship comes an extraordinary

complement of talented individuals and

service to our nation 1200 medical staff

and sailors here to help us all 750 beds

will be put into play immediately to

relieve the pressure on a hospital

system let me be clear that this is such

a crucial part of the plan we are

putting in place but I want to

understand the sheer magnitude of the

plan we need to triple our hospital bed

capacity in New York City by May the

number of beds we had at the beginning

of March have to triple by May as a

daunting task but we got a big big boost

the arrival of comfortness is like

adding a whole another hospital to New

York City it's like think of all the big

hospitals in New York City Bellevue and

all the other famous hospitals we think

of it's like another one of them just

floated right up to help us right now

and I hope New Yorkers know

that this is something we've been

fighting for him we're gonna be fighting

for a lot more help because this is just

the beginning

my job is always to tell you the truth

and I'll tell you when we get the help

we need and I'll tell you when we need

more help I'll tell you when we're

getting into the thick of the battle and

I'll tell you when we're coming out of

the battle right now the toughest weeks

are still ahead but we are grateful we

are grateful for every doctor for every

nurse for every ventilator for the

supplies for the beds for everything

that's come from the Comfort and

everything that has come from all over

the country I have to tell you it's the

federal government it's the state

government of course but it's also the

companies that have come forward

offering help people we've never met

individuals who come forward with

supplies health care workers who have

volunteered it's the United Nations

which came up with a quarter of million

surgical masks and got them to us right

away we're seeing amazing offers of help

and people are moving fast to get help

to New York City and we appreciate it we

need it

so let's look forward let's pray there's

to be a lot more days like this when

people can see our nation stand by us

and then I affirm to you when the battle

is done here New York City will stand

firm for the rest of our nation New York

City will be the first to donate to the

rest of our nation we will send the

ventilators the supplies we will ask our

doctors and nurses to go to the front

wherever it is in this nation because

our country was there for us and we will

be there for our country a few words in

Spanish este Barco es un symbol o para

los ninos

no estamos solos en esta lucha haremos

todo lo posible para tener la capacidad

que necesitamos ultra ciudades Estados

vamos a estar I eat para ustedes como

usted es an estado IE para nosotros

without if I want to turn to a guy who's

been a hero before for this city and we

need him to be a hero again and I know

he is already rising to the occasion he

helped lead New York City through our

darkest hour on 9/11 he was then our

fire commissioner and he did an

outstanding job under the most adverse

circumstances our fire department had

ever known when he became the regional

administrator for FEMA he could never

have imagined this day nor could any of

us but I said to Tom earlier thank God

he is where he is now I think God had a

plan for him because his city needs him

again my great honor to introduce the

Regional Administrator for FEMA Tom Van

Essen Donna sit my politic that kind of

man

[Applause]

[Music]

Thank You mayor yeah it's

it's it's really seems to have gotten

real personal for me this morning about

two weeks ago we moved our regional

response recovery coordination team down

to a naval base in rural New Jersey

where we have an operation center and we

were able to get people off public

transportation we have all our equipment

down there oh set up there it's really

good set up it was built during sandy at

a naval base so we have about 3035

people working there every day late late

into the night working to try and

accommodate everybody we can in New York

City New York State New Jersey Puerto

Rico and the Virgin Islands that's what

region two is at FEMA so I've been down

there the last two weeks and I came back

for this today and I was driving on East

River Drive and I looked across by 14th

Street and I had a flashback to the

morning I was driving in and they told

me a small plane had crashed into the

Trade Center and life changed at that

time and I remember having a comfort

come then you know a couple I don't

remember when a couple weeks later

whatever and we didn't need it for what

we needed for today we didn't need it

for people who needed hospital care it

wasn't necessary but we brought it in we

needed it for crisis counseling for a

lot of fire chiefs and police officers

who were really really overcome with the

grief and a debt that they faced with

their friends and people that they

worked with and we needed it to house

federal workers and give them food and

everything

and we got it out of here and we start

putting them in hotel rooms but I'll

never forget the feeling and I talked

about it this morning the names are

perfect the comfort and a mercy I was

told they were here in 1918 for the

pandemic we had then not these

particular ships but their predecessors

so the federal government has always

been here the army the Navy the Marines

that they've always been here for us

when we needed them and they here again

for you now and for me too the

flashbacks I get knowing that the city

is under such stress now it's it's real

personal for me the fire department I

spent 30 years in it so when September

11th happened it was personal it was

friends it was leaders people who had

worked with everybody was affected by

September 11th and that's what's

happening now everybody you know is

affected by the corona virus in one way

or another a friend the relative a loved

one that you can't go and see because

they're in quarantine or you don't want

to I mean I stopped to see a 100 year

old lady

last week and just you know talked to

her from 6 feet away and I know

everybody's doing that and it's

important but this this is a big time

visible sign of what our government is

like when we put it into action and the

mayor said it and it's really I'm really

proud to be part of it now

I know how tough the people of this city

are and I've seen us take on some

seemingly unsurmountable insurmountable

challenges once again we need to do it

once again we need to be together

six feet apart I saw the mayor taking

pictures with some of the military folks

I never noticed it before taking a

picture with someone it was 2 or 3 feet

away it's weird it's really strange what

we're all going through but it's

necessary and it is gonna make a

difference the more we separate the more

everybody stays away the better off

we'll be in the faster we'll get out of

this so thank goodness now help is

arrived it's going to make a big

difference

FEMA's working with the city with the

state to supply everything we possibly

can working with HHS to get as many

medical people here as we can people

help us with the forensics and the

mortuary problems that we're going to

have because we are going to have an

awful lot of folks that aren't going to

make it but we're doing the best we can

and it's it's an honor to be back in the

middle of such a such a tough tough

battle that we have in front of us but

September 11th it seemed like every day

we were fixing stuff and it was getting

a slightly better the grief of course

was was enormous but the operation seems

to get slightly better every day with

this it seems to be we're not there yet

weeks maybe a month I hope not I don't

know I listened to dr. Fauci on here

ground models and worst-case scenarios

best-case scenarios we just don't know

so we are preparing for the worst case

and that's all we can do at this point

and we're doing a good job and we're

here for you thank you

thank you so much Tom now of such an

honor to bring to you the military

leader of this effort he comes from a

family long connected to the US Navy he

is someone we're thinking about right

now as one of our saviors one of the

people who led the forces who came to

help us in our hour of need but his day

job

his vice commander of u.s. fleet forces

so he has a big big job and a lot to

think about but right now his mind his

heart his soul is focused on New York

City and I'm proud to say he is also a

resident of Manhattan it has a family

here and understands what we are all

going through and I just want to express

on behalf of 8.6 million New Yorkers my

gratitude for your leadership and for

all the men and women who serve under

your command an honor to present to you

Rear Admiral John Mustan

mr. mayor mr. administrator commissioner

thank you for being here today to

welcome this great ship to the officers

the crew the medical professionals of

USNS comfort thank you for the vital

mission that you've undertaken I'd also

like to recognize and thank the many

many contributors who work tirelessly

behind the scenes to make this day

possible each of those who helped to fit

out and prepare this ship in record time

from the maintenance community to the

dock workers to the ship's company to

the doctors to the dredgers thank you

all of you for the agility and

professionalism that you have all shown

over the past few weeks that focus

collective effort will save American

lives today I also want to recognize

that not all of our nation's heroes wear

military uniforms

especially today we acknowledge that

many wear scrubs let us not forget nor

failed to recognize that the doctors and

nurses across America those who are

treating patients in these unprecedented

times they are all heroes and like those

heroes the unmistakable white hull and

Red Cross of this great ship have been a

welcome sight around the world standing

at the forefront of our humanitarian

missions overseas this ship ship

represents all that is good about the

American people all that is generous all

that is ready responsive and resolute

like her sister ship the USNS mercy was

recently moored and is already serving

patients in Los Angeles this great ship

will support civil authorities by

increasing medical capacity and

collaboration for medical assistance not

treating Kovac 19 patients but by acting

as a relief valve for other urgent needs

freeing New York's hospitals and our

precious medical professionals to focus

on this pandemic so now this great ship

will serve and support our fellow

Americans in this time of need

providing critical surge hospital

capacity to America's largest city

as a resident New Yorker myself I can

attest to the invincible spirit of New

York from the ships that she built in

World War two to her unflappable

determination following 9/11 and

hurricane sandy I have great confidence

that New York well weather today's storm

as well this time with the support of

another great American community the

naval families on board and supporting

the crew of the USNS comfort words are

incapable of expressing the depth of my

gratitude for those on this mission and

for the families that they leave behind

the men and women on board comfort our

mothers their fathers their sons

daughters sisters and brothers and while

our lives may look drastically too

different today than they did even a

month ago the circumstances for these

men and women are no exception

they left their families during this

uncertain time in our nation's history

knowing that they can make a difference

that is what the u.s. Navy does and this

is an example of Americans helping their

fellow men I know that for our military

families social distancing is not a new

concept but rather a frequent reality

and I remain grateful for all that each

of them do for our nation and for our

communities every single day as you

heard from the administrator the last

time this great hospital ship all 70,000

tons of her was in New York was in the

wake of 9/11 where she served as a

respite and comfort for first responders

working around the clock today like then

we bring a message to all New Yorkers

now your navy is returned and we are

with you committed in this fight mr.

mayor

every sailor every marine and every

civilian on this mission stands proudly

stands ready to serve the people of New

York City we have not yet begun to fight

and we will not give up this ship thank

you

beautifully said Admiral and thank you

so much all right we're going to take

questions now from the media and just

please project your voices so I can hear

you well go ahead it's even better yes

Thank You mr. mayor so what's your

what's your message to President Trump

after the Comfort docked here to help

New York City and when it came in here

to the pier

what was your emotion and what was your

reaction overall it's a very emotional

moment I went up on the roof here to

watch the comfort come in and I had this

incredible feeling of peace actually

that help was finally coming that we

were not alone and I just have a

reverence for the military I come from a

family that had a deep involvement in

the military I have a reverence for the

military feeling the presence of the

United States military here it just gave

me a sense that things were going to be

ok

and just as such a moving sight the ship

is so impressive

it just looming there in our harbor you

know was like a beacon of hope and it

really felt that way to me

my message to the president is thank you

and we need more help and that's not

because any of us likes to have to say

that but because it's true that the

toughest weeks are ahead we are bracing

ourselves for something we've never seen

before in any of our lives and and the

federal government in many ways is the

only force that can help us to reach the

level of preparation we need to to save

every life we can save so I'm going to

keep calling the president and I'll keep

appealing to them to get us all the help

we need for these really tough weeks and

then again we will turn around and help

everyone else in this country right

after I'll go on this side yes mr. mayor

as you know normally this time of year

we'd be very busy and focused on the

state budget at Albany I just want to

ask I know it's kind of a secondary

issue now but there is a lot getting

crafted up

do you have any concerns in terms of

what you've been hearing in terms of how

the city will be affected I have real

concerns I have deep concerns because

what's being discussed is essentially

health care for people needed when you

you know we can talk about the Medicaid

budget but that's I think the wrong way

to think about what it equals is

healthcare for people who need

healthcare right now and need it more

than ever because of the pandemic I

spoke at length last night with speaker

Karl hasty and Majority Leader Andrea

stewart-cousins I let them know that

from the perspective of eight point six

million people in New York City we

cannot afford Medicaid cuts healthcare

cuts at this dire moment the state must

accept the Medicaid funding that was in

the third stimulus bill we need that

money to be accepted and we need to make

sure that the healthcare so many people

are depending on is not disrupted so I

understand that the state has a budget

challenge we have a huge budget

challenge I mean I'm right now in the

middle of cutting a huge amount out of

this budget for this city right now but

what I will not cut is healthcare and I

said that the other day we're going to

find some really tough cuts we have to

make but it will never be about health

care it will never be about the fight

against kovat 19 so I urge the state

accept the federal money do not cut

Medicaid do not cut health care for New

Yorkers who need it let's get okay well

just keep going back and forth whoever

is at the microphone go ahead tell us

what the services the ship will be

providing and who will have you decided

what patients will be going through SIPP

and which patients will stay at the

hospital I'm going to start and I'll let

the Admiral join in obviously what I

have to explain to everyone I think is

such a shock to hear this that people

are still kind of adjusting to it the

intensive care units in our hospitals

used to be a small part of our hospitals

again a beginning of this month we had

about 20,000 working hospital beds in

New York City what we have to do is

convert as many as possible potentially

almost all of those traditional hospital

beds into ICU beds we have to make whole

house

into intensive care units to get through

these next week's that's how dire that's

how tough this situation is if we're

going to turn a hospital

I mean think of Bellevue think of NYU

Langone you go by these huge buildings

they're all they're gonna be all ICU if

we can bring all the pieces together the

staff and the equipment and everything

well what happens to everyone else who

doesn't need intensive care we have to

have hospitals for them too what happens

to people who've been infected with

covin but are not at the point where

they need intensive care hopefully on

the way to recovery they need a hospital

bed in many cases - but we can't put

them in the intensive care unit which

has to be reserved for those we're

trying to save so what the USNS comfort

allows and Javits Center and so many

other places being developed right now

is the ability to take all those other

patients and give them care and each

location will be different but it will

allow us to keep a healthcare system

going while we convert the core

hospitals into something we've never

done and this is beyond anyone's

imagination I asked ahead of our public

hospitals dr. Mitch Katz I said have you

ever heard of any place where they have

to turn hospitals into all ICU he said

no no one's ever come near having to do

that in the last hundred years in this

country but because the comfort is here

because of what's happened at Javits

Center we're gonna have the ability to

do that and save a lot of lives Admiral

you want joint in just in terms of the

specifics and the mechanics we've been

working very closely with the local

healthcare officials to determine what

that process looks like so so frankly we

are prepared to receive and we trust the

screening process that is in effect at

the Javits Center so that we will

receive advance notice so that the ship

can prepare to receive the patients but

but in terms of what the health care

providers determine are the best

patients for us those are the ones that

we would expect to receive

how can you take us to the mechanics of

this transfer of patience how are you

communicate this to the patient what

kind of situations are these patients

experiencing and are they family is

going to be able to visit them onboard

of their comfort all right I'm going to

start and I gonna give you the

disclaimer right away that all of this

is being worked out in real-time so I

guarantee you we're not going to have

all those questions and all those

answers today because we're literally in

a wartime situation building it as we go

along dr. Raul Pedraza Henson Oh deputy

mayor if at any you want to jump in on

any of these questions about procedure

please do or Admiral as well I think the

common-sense basic answer is we're gonna

work out the protocol between all the

players how to get the right patients to

the right locations again reserving the

hospitals for ICU to the maximum extent

Hospital and actually it's impossible

some places will specialize in

convalescent kovat 19 patients meaning

patients on the way to recovery no

longer intensive care some places will

specialize in all sorts of other medical

needs that require hospitalization

because remember all the folks with

heart disease all the folks with cancer

there's still so many people that will

need hospitalization for other things

that are not kovat 19 so we're working

out those protocols right now as to

things like visitation I think a fair

statement would be the normal rules will

not apply just going to I'm the non

doctor telling all New Yorkers right now

we're going to always try to respect

families but we have to be clear that

the normal rules of going to a hospital

just aren't going to exist in this kind

of wartime environment and people should

get used to a different set of standards

it will be determined for each location

what that is but there's going to be

such urgency dealing with a huge uptick

in cases that we can't do all the things

we normally do Admiral you want to add

or

okay never mayor

yes as the mayor outlined we have stood

up Hospital Executive Committee which

includes all the public hospitals the

voluntary hospitals the independent

hospitals in the command from Comfort

Inn Javits there's a screening mechanism

very complex in order to allocate who

goes where as the mayor pointed out we

are prepared to convert as many of the

regular beds in all hospitals in the

city into ICU beds hopefully we'll get

the ventilators so the most severe cases

and I've been taking care of there the

visitation piece will require a

screening like we're doing for everyone

right now so if there's any risk that a

patient that has no kovat 19 that is

being taken care of here the comfort has

a relative that could be potentially

infected of course there will be

screening for them not to come in

you had said that Saturday you would

decide whether or not to close the

playgrounds why have you left the

playgrounds open when for example

Hoboken has closed its parks in Bergen

County has closed its parks why do we

not have consistency on that guideline

for social distancing this is an issue

that obviously we're working with the

state on and the states have all been

working together and there is not one

uniform standard that's just the truth

we are very cognizant look eight point

six million people in a very small space

I don't think taking away parks is a

great idea unless we have evidence that

people are not following the rules in a

really substantial way I have had this

conversation daily with our police

commissioner

he says overwhelmingly they are seeing

compliance we know warmer weather is

coming not today but warmer weather is

coming

we're gonna watch carefully what I said

yesterday is this right now the police

and all our agencies are authorized to

use fines we've given enough warning

enough education anyone who if you

Andrew we're in the park and officer

said sir you're not practicing social

distancing I need to move and you said

I'm not gonna move they're gonna say sir

you're about to be given a fine this is

your last chance and if you don't move

or you don't follow the instruction

you've gotta find if we see any

basketball courts where there's games

going on and we've warned people to stop

we're going to take down the rims we're

gonna take out tennis nets we're going

to take out soccer net whatever it takes

on the playgrounds if we see individual

playgrounds where there's non-compliance

we can close the playground if we see it

broadly all the playgrounds will be

closed but to date based on the sheer

facts coming back from the police

department Parks Department

non-compliance is limited you will find

some instances I'm sure you will Andrew

but not enough to tell eight point six

million people they cannot have parks

and that's the balance we're trying to

strike

Thank You mr. mayor yesterday we heard

the British carrying numbers from the

federal government do you have any

particular forecasting scenario for the

city I mean the particular for New York

City

I've been real honest with New Yorkers

at this point we assume at least half of

all New Yorkers will contract this

disease again consistently receive for

80 percent that means thankfully a

fairly mild experience that they get

through okay recover quickly but right

now at least 50% it could be

substantially more we see this horrible

increase in the number of deaths and

I've been honest I think the weeks ahead

will be

that the worst is not going to be April

but actually the beginning of May but no

projection is perfect I guarantee you

and I wish I'd couldn't but I guarantee

you that

April is going to be exceedingly tough

and we have to understand that any

projection of things being all okay by

Easter there's just no way that's true

for New York City this is a question I'm

sure for the former fire commissioner

von Essen High Commissioner can I ask

you a quiet here

hey welcome back to New York thank you I

never left well great to have you here

now

I'm wondering you mentioned mortuary

logistics what are you working on right

now what's the current city capacity to

hold the deceased and is there any

consideration of turning places like MSG

Madison Square Garden into a mortuary

facility

fortunately we not thinking of anything

like that but we are sending

refrigeration trucks to New York to help

with some of the problem on a temporary

basis I was speaking to Commissioner

Chris well this morning we've sent the

military has sent 42 folks to the

Manhattan medical examiner's office to

help over there and we need you have a

desk New York City has we in New York

City have a desperate need to help over

in Queens and we're working on that as

we speak there's folks trying to put it

all together there's only so many of

these teams that the military has we

have 50 states in a couple of

territories and Commonwealth's that

we're trying to not hold back resources

but trying to make it make a plan ready

that works for the whole country so it's

it's it's difficult but everybody's

trying and we will get more help here

for New York Thank You mayor it's a very

visual representation of the help that's

arrived but can you give us a clearer

sense of how much more help is going to

be needed I mean if you will how many

equivalents of the Comfort does New York

City need to get through the worst of

this sir yeah it's a great great way of

thinking about it

think of this ship which is 750 beds to

begin as a capacity potentially of a

thousand beds so here's the way to think

of what we're all working on right now

we started with around 20,000 working

beds in New York City we have to get

over 60,000 by the beginning of May

according to what we know now like

adding 40 us comforts and that's the

magnitude of what we're talking about

and the amazing thing is that we believe

with enough people working together that

we can get there as hard as that sounds

you know here's this extraordinary

contribution from the federal government

here's a Javits Center we're talking

about up to 3,000 beds right there the

surge capacity in the hospitals where

every hospital is adding 50% more beds

that's on top of that original 20,000

they're all finding additional beds to

add in their facilities you know

creating new spaces Mitch Katz said a

long time ago he can turn the cafeteria

into an ICU if he needs to he can put up

a tent in the parking lot turn into ICU

and then the hotels and the other

buildings that we'll be moving to so

it's our human task it's never been

attempted in the history of New York

City we believe that's the number we'd

love to find out it's a lesser number

but that's the number we're shooting for

and I believe with enough work and

enough creativity enough teamwork we can

get to it last night your administration

made an announcement about all of the

supplies and the ventilators you've

given to the pub to the hospitals

throughout the city

I'm wondering how your administration is

handling supply distribution to private

hospitals a lot of it has been focused

on going to the public hospitals

rightfully so but I'm wondering if any

of these supplies and ventilators have

gone to the private hospitals on Staten

Island yes absolutely and I've had this

conversation daily with borough

president otto to make sure that

supplies are getting where they're

needed yes

the city has provided supplies to Rumsey

and in substantial numbers and will

continue to do so

the supplies for Staten Island

University Hospital come from a

combination of sources state city north

well the north wall hospital system but

I'm keeping an eye I and my team is on

all of it we really don't see a

separation between public hospitals

voluntaries independence in this kind of

situation we're all working together

remember the other day we got in 400

ventilators from the federal government

we sent a hundred to the public

hospitals three hundreds of the

voluntaries and independence so that's

going to be the pattern of not

necessarily that percentage but that

approach we're all sharing to make sure

at any given moment a hospital has what

it needs go ahead go bid patients from

the outer boroughs to the comfort places

like Staten Island again the idea the

idea is to keep folks who need that

urgent care that ICU care in hospitals

that will be converted increasingly to

ICU care folks who do not require ICU

care but do need hospitalization for Co

via 19 the goal is to keep them as close

as possible of course to their home and

in their home borough so we're

continuing to build out capacity in

Staten Island and we will continue as in

every borough

can you hear me yeah with rent due

tomorrow for many people wanted to ask

about our proposal from some local

officials who want to allow people to

apply their security deposits to next

month's rent do you support that are you

doing anything to make that a reality

I do support that and I think the my

understanding is that we need some kind

of state action to allow that to happen

but I think that's exactly the right

approach look everyone's hand-to-mouth

or so many people at least are

hand-to-mouth right now their income has

just been blown away federal help is

coming but that will take time people

need help right now

applying the security deposits actually

it helps the renter to pay the rent it

actually helps in many cases landlords

especially smaller landlords because

that money is in escrow right now and

the smaller landlords need money to get

by as well so it frees them up for them

there has to be some process to

eventually restore that deposit you know

over time maybe an installment plan over

time but immediate relief is needed so I

think it's a great idea we're working

with folks at the state level to see how

to make that happen okay go ahead mr.

mayor

in terms of you've talked about the

ventilators in the hospital beds where

you at in terms of the PPE for the

hospital workers nurses doctors where

where we stand on so on on personal

protective equipment this week and I'm

always giving you this update week by

week if it ever turns into needing to

tell you day by day I will this week in

terms of personal protective equipment

for our hospitals we do have a

sufficient supply we have sent it out

and continue to send it out around the

city hospitals this is something dr.

Katz said yesterday everyone has to keep

in mind

hospitals are teaching their

professionals their health care workers

a new way of handling this equipment

because until there is a truly ample

supply like there used to be in

peacetime folks are being trained to

handle a supply differently to stretch

it out to reuse it whenever safe that's

a whole different way of life

and instead of seeing in the supply

closet you know a month or two supply

people are seeing less they're seeing

days or a few weeks and I think is

understandably unnerving to the

healthcare professionals but we're all

working together to help everyone

understand a new reality for this moment

in history the supply today is

sufficient it will take us into next

week the thing I'm worried about right

now is ventilators overwhelmingly I've

asked the president the White House or

400 more we will take them from any

source if four hundred more come in some

other way that's great

but we need that to make sure we will

get to April 5th okay

as we approach April 5th which I've said

is a very day I'm really concerned about

in terms of equipment and in terms of

personnel I will update New Yorkers as

to whether we have enough to get through

the next week but that's how tight it

has been number one concern ventilators

right behind it the need for more

doctors nurses respiratory therapists to

actually handle ICU capacity and give

some relief to these health workers who

have gone through so much yeah go ahead

said 1.3 billion dollars you were

looking to cut from the budget but that

number it might need to update we'll

give you an updated number shortly but

it's definitely gonna go up Thank You

mr. mayor

and we'll patients treated on the

Comfort have to pay their medical bills

as usual or will this be paid for by the

federal government well I don't know

Admiral I mean first of all insurance is

insurance so whoever has insurance I

assume that's the go-to but Admiral or

role do you know the answer day what it

does when the president declared a

national emergency the implication from

the Department of Defense is that we

provide this service and we are not

looking to check insurance cards or or

send any invoices or bills this is an

investment by the government on behalf

of the people of America so there there

is no additional cost of the patient

Admiral that's a great plan we thank you

for that Thank You mr. mayor you

mentioned that 750 beds are available

immediately on the Comfort does that

mean that patients will start being

moved today and if so or if not how many

patients will be moved in what sort of

time frame I want to make sure they're

fully Doc's before any patients and

they're still they're still securing it

but between the Admiral and deputy mayor

who wants to speak about the timelines

you want to start so as the mayor

mentioned obviously we want to take care

of all of the regular husbanding

services required once the ship comes

into port we're prepared to begin

receiving patients tomorrow I won't open

the box to say while we may be ready

internally to do that sooner we want to

use a very methodical process that's

been developed in conjunction with the

local health authorities which is

predicated on starting tomorrow so a

quick point we're gonna do that the

assessment that I talked about before

with the hospital committee going

through the Javits Center and as the

patient start Connie coming from the

hospitals the screening will happen

today in probably in the next day or two

you'll start seeing patients here

you missed Thank You mr. mayor did you

get any results any outcomes of the drug

test which was started last week wait

which one I'm sorry clarify I mean last

Wednesday you were supposed to tell to

start the drug test of the new kind of

medications regarding this problem yeah

there's several different approaches

that are being tested now in certainly

in our public health system but I want

to make sure we give you a fully

accurate answer so I'm not updated on

that I'll make sure our team from Health

and Hospitals get you that answer okay

everybody thank you very much good day

for New York City thank you everyone
