the fire exploded in Los Angeles while

most people were sleeping it was really

scary because um I thought what if the

fire could catch on our house and I

could literally see the flames up in the

sky 10,000 homes and buildings including

the famous Getty Museum are part of the

initial evacuation zone in Southern

California the only thing you cannot

replace is you and your family

so get your loved ones your pets and get

out already about a dozen homes have

been destroyed or damaged interstate 405

the busiest Highway in the United States

was closed in one direction at one point

because flames were jumping the road

classes at UCLA canceled schools in

Malibu and Santa Monica closed every

resource is being thrown at these

thirsty flames but firefighters are

getting whipped by hurricane-force winds

it's a dangerous season right now the

Santa Ana winds pick up historically in

September and last through April we have

not had any significant rainfall for a

period of time in Sonoma County

California's wine region the erratic

fire is getting the upper hand over the

4,000 firefighters involved in this fire

fight any progress has gone backwards in

24 hours

containment efforts went from 10% to

just 5 to say that conditions are a

tinderbox is probably an understatement

because when you put an offshore wind on

it it literally only takes one spark

close to 200,000 people in this part of

Northern California were told to get out

driving through blowing embers that can

spark new fires let's get out of here

but some won't budge I didn't want to

take a chance on losing everything

you know one guy came in he was telling

me to leave it's just hard it's hard to

leave you know the state is calling the

situation a red flag event the wind may

be dying down for now

but it'll pick up again this week making

it the enemy
