I thought I could make a difference here

in making our community our great

country and the world a better place for

generations to come

I like so many of my colleagues ran for

office because I believed that our

political system was broken controlled

by the powerful and the wealthy ignoring

and failing the regular people that it's

supposed to serve I came here to give a

voice to the unheard in the halls of

power I wanted to show young people

queer people working people imperfect

people that they belong here

because this is the people's house I

fell short of that and I'm sorry too

every young person who saw themselves

and their dreams reflected in me I'm

sorry to those who felt like I gave them

hope in one of the darkest times in our

nation's history I'm sorry to my family

my friends my staff my colleagues my

mentors to everyone who has supported

and believed in me I'm sorry to the

thousands of people who spent hours

knocking doors in the hot Summer Sun who

made countless phone calls who

sacrificed more than I could ever know

to give everything they could in every

possible way so that I could be here I

am so so sorry

and to every little girl who looked up

to me I hope that one day you can

forgive me the mistakes I made and the

people I've hurt that led to this moment

will haunt me for the rest of my life

and I have to come to terms with that

ever since those images first came out I

barely left my bed I've ignored all the

calls and the texts and went to the

darkest places that a mine can go and

I've shed more tears than I thought were

possible I've hidden from the world

because I'm terrified of facing the

people that I let down but I made it

through because the people who love me

most dragged me back into the light and

reminded me that I was stronger than

that to those of you who were by my side

in my worst moments you know who you are

I love you I'm so grateful and I will

never forget and I'm here today because

so many of the people I let down people

close to me

supporters colleagues people I've never

even met told me to stand back up and

that despite all of my faults they still

believed in me and they were still

counting on me and I realized that

hiding away and disappearing would be

the one unforgivable sin

I will never shirk my responsibility for

this sudden ending to my time here but I

have to say more because this is bigger

than me I am leaving now because of a

double standard I'm leaving because I no

longer want to be used as a bargaining

chip I'm leaving because I didn't want

to be peddled by papers and blogs and

websites used by shameless operatives

for the dirtiest gutter politics that

I've ever seen and the right-wing media

to drive cliques and expand their

audience by distributing intimate photos

of me taken without my knowledge let

alone my consent for the sexual

entertainment of millions I'm leaving

because of a misogynistic culture that

gleefully consumed my naked pictures

capitalized on my sexuality and enabled

my abusive ex to continue that abuse

this time with the entire country

watching I am leaving

because of the thousands of vile

threatening emails calls and texts that

made me fear for my life and the lives

of the people that I care about today is

the first time I've left my apartment

since the photos taken without my

consent were released and I'm scared I'm

leaving because for the sake of my

community my staff my family and myself

I can't allow this to continue because

I've been told that people were angry

when I stood strong after the first

article was posted and that they had

hundreds more photos and text messages

that they would release bit by bit until

they broke me down to nothing well they

used my faults and my past to distract

from the things that matter most I'm

leaving because there is only one

investigation that deserves the

attention of this country and that's the

one that we voted on today today I ask

you all to stand with me and commit to

creating a future where this no longer

happens to women and girls yes I'm

stepping down but I refuse to let this

experience scare off other women who

dared

risks who dare to step into this light

who dare to be powerful it might feel

like they won in the short term but they

can't in the long term we cannot let

them the way to overcome this setback is

for women to keep showing up to keep

running for office to keep stepping up

as leaders because the more we show up

the less power they have I'm leaving but

we have men who have been credibly

accused of intentional acts of sexual

violence and remain in boardrooms on the

Supreme Court in this very body and

worst of all in the Oval Office so the

fight goes on to create the change that

every woman and girl in this country

deserves here in the halls of Congress

the fight will go on without me and I

trust so many of my colleagues to be

strong on this front

well I move on to one of the many other

battlefields because we have an entire

culture that has to change and we see it

in stark clarity today the forces of

revenge by a bitter jealous man

cyber exploitation and sexual shaming

that target our gender and a large

segment of society that fears and hates

powerful women have combined to push a

young woman out of power and say that

she doesn't belong here

yet a man who brags about his sexual

predation who's had dozens of women come

forward to accuse him of sexual assault

who pushes policies that are uniquely

harmful to women and who has filled the

courts with judges who proudly rule to

deprive women of the most fundamental

rights to control their own bodies sits

in the highest office of the land and so

today as my last vote I voted on

impeachment proceedings not just because

of corruption obstruction of justice or

gross misconduct but because of the

deepest abuse of power including the

abuse of power over women today as my

final act I voted to move forward with

the impeachment of Donald Trump on

behalf of the women of the United States

of America we will not stand down we

will not be broken we will not be

silenced

we will rise

and we will they make tomorrow better

than today thank you and I yield the

balance of my time for now but not

forever
