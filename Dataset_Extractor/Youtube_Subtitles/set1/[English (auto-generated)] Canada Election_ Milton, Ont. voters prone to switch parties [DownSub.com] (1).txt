hi bar for the train at the crack of

dawn she's out fishing for votes

this is conservative Lisa rates fourth

campaign and she's taking nothing for

granted I believe that the jury is out

that she knows it's a tight race but his

convinced many voters are looking for

change

I think the ballot questions going to be

about affordability but the motivation

is going to be to get rid of the Liberal

government change is constant in the

sprawling communities around Toronto

where commuters rush to ride long

distances to work and flock home to

houses that are cheaper than in the big

city from housing to childcare to

transit voters are feeling tight on cash

and are prone to switching their vote I

bought it for conservatives with Harper

and for to them many we talked to are

grappling with two issues the

environment is the issue for me because

that's not very clear from my point of

view they contradict themselves but the

other thing is the economy yeah

not liberal this time why not this woman

tells me she's leaning conservative but

not sure if you get a little bit more

money in your pocket at the end of the

day that makes a huge difference but

also you don't want to live in a society

which is so conservative so let's see

how different is and we share from

Deptford Milton has evolved from the

dirt streets a century ago to a thriving

increasingly diverse community

attracting lots of immigrants and young

families I never hear about Andrew sure

nobody talks about industry people talk

about Doug Ford all the time it's going

really well

this is the first campaign for Liberal

candidate Adam Vancouver Dhin he won

four Olympic medals in canoe kayak and

believes he can triumph in politics -

I'm proud of the party and I'm proud of

I'm proud of the progress and what I

hear back from neighbors here in Milton

is that they feel the same way but for

some voters at the local curling rink

the Liberals are on thin ice this man

voted liberal last time but now I'm

totally disgusted with the leader right

now so you weren't happy with how he

handled the SNC affair and letting the

two members of his party take the

backlash and everything can any ends up

getting rid of them I've decided how I

won't vote liberal why not I don't like

I don't like judo was the way he had

though here two views diverged I think

Shearer has not really said what he's

wanting to do all he seem to do is run

Justin Foucault the concrete fill each

other we heard it everywhere we went

voters volatile and less than

enthusiastic leaving liberals and

conservatives hoping the vote in this

part of Ontario swings in their favor

because it could mean the difference

between winning and losing
