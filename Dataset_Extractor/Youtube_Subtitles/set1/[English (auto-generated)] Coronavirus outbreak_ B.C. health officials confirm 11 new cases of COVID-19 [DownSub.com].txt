good afternoon my name is Adrian Dix I'm

the BC Minister of Health beside me when

I left dr. Bonnie Henry the provincial

health officer were honored to be here

on the traditional territories of the

Musqueam of the Squamish of the slave of

tooth people just to give you an update

on the next day we will be providing a

briefing to median the public tomorrow

at noon Saturday at noon and then we

will at that time bring you up to date

on the times of next week's briefings

and with that I wanted to introduce dr.

Henry thank you good afternoon and so I

want to start off by telling you than

the new cases that we have for today

there are 11 new positives so far today

- a total of 64 as we are increasing

seeing increasing numbers and it the

challenge and the time it takes for the

investigations we won't be able to give

you as much details on each individual

but we will make sure that you have the

information that you need to understand

what is happening as this pandemic

progresses so with respect to that we

now have an additional outbreak or a

cluster of cases in a facility in the

Vancouver coastal region so as they

announced earlier today there are three

administrative staff at Lions Gate

Hospital who have tested positive and

obviously the investigation is ongoing

to make sure we understand where they

got this and also to ensure that the

rest of the hospital is safe they are

not people who had patient contact and

there are measures been taken at Lions

Gate Hospital to ensure that everything

can be done as safe as possible there we

also have an additional case related to

the Linn Valley care center and it's a

close contact of one of the health care

workers who is identified earlier and we

have five more travel related cases and

it's a reflection of what we discussed

yesterday the increasing risks and

countries around the world

that we continue to have people who come

in from those countries and now we have

the additional ones that we know are

from today are from Iran Egypt again as

well a tour and cruise on the Nile the

Philippines and Mexico and these are

areas that are more newly identified as

as having issues with transmission in

communities in those areas two cases are

still under investigation and I don't

have details on them yet all of the

cases from today are in the Vancouver

Coastal Health Region in terms of the

cases existing cases we have two people

who are hospitalized now when we talked

about yesterday and somebody who was

newly hospitalized last night six have

recovered and the rest are in isolation

at home and are being supported by

public health teams did want to talk a

little bit about some of the measures

that we introduced yesterday in

particular the advise against all

non-essential travel outside of Canada

and people have been asking about why

why outside of Canada and and

particularly we know a lot about what is

happening within Canada and it is still

safer although as we understand across

the country we are starting to see

increased numbers of cases and it's a

reflection of how we are part of a

global community and a global pandemic

and we also need to talk a little bit

about essential and so as I mentioned

yesterday we felt it really important

that we get the message out particularly

as many of those schools are starting

March Break as of today so we wanted

people to be forewarned about these

issues and we know that the Government

of Canada has now put a travel advisory

that's very similar to ours and the

requirement for people to self isolate

on return so we have we have deemed

essential people who are involved in the

movement of goods and people across our

international borders so we are not

including

all truckers for example people who

provide bring manufacturing goods into

into and out of the country flight crews

etc and we've had some discussions about

that today and would have provided and

will be providing more specific guidance

to industry but the important thing is

not that they're free and clear but we

do know these are risky and these are

risky travels and so aircrew for example

people who truck back and forth across

the border they need to have an active

monitoring program self monitoring they

need to have access to the ability to

clean their hands regularly enhanced

infection control in in on trucks on

ferries on airplanes and those are all

measures that are being put in place and

they they need to be supported to check

themselves daily for symptoms when they

come back and stay away from others stay

away from mass gatherings during that

period of time having said that you know

there are many things we can do we're

not talking about shutting down society

here we are it's still very safe today

in BC all across BC to go out to go

shopping to go to restaurants and in

particular we have a lot of things that

we can do outdoors which are very safe

things to do this virus does not

transmit when people are outdoors so go

outside and play with your family go up

to our ski hills go up to whistling you

know go out and experience what we have

there in in British Columbia right now

in terms of public gatherings you know

I've talked to vote yesterday making it

not allowing gatherings over 250 people

and the rationale was based on

practicalities not science but it's a

number that we can work with to ensure

that distancing measures are put in

place I am saying that today I'm going

to make a provincial health or officer

order to make that mandatory and I

understand from the the investigation

that we've done into this that that

allows people to trigger insurance and

other things for for events that have to

be canceled because of this direction

so we're going to do that as well so

really I think it was a bit of a shock

for people and we talked yesterday about

how this was of such a rapidly evolving

situation over the 24 hours leading up

until yesterday and now that we're

getting into the details and we're

realizing that these are important

things for us to do and the reason why

they're important is because we need to

stop and slow the spread of this virus

in our communities here in BC to buy us

the time to ensure that we can flatten

that curve and May and protect the most

vulnerable people in our society the

people who are in our communities who

are more likely to have severe illness

or to die from this virus and to allow

our health system to be able to to build

up and account and accommodate people

both who have this virus and safely look

after their everybody else who needs

health care in our system so this is the

time where we all need to do our part we

need to stay away from others when we're

sick in particular we need to cover our

mouths when week off we need to clean

our hands regularly we need to enhance

our cleaning in our environment and then

these are the things that we do to

protect ourselves from getting ill but

also we know that this virus is most

likely to be to spread to the people who

are closest to us so we need to do this

to protect our families and our close

friends and our communities and not

everybody who comes back from travel and

gets sick needs to have a test and we'll

be providing some work items to support

people if they have an illness mild

illness that doesn't require you to to

seek medical care to support themselves

at home and I you know we've been tested

on our testing in the last little while

and we now and I've said this before for

people who don't have any travel history

for people who have milder illness and

there that we need to prioritize the

people who need to have a kovat 19 tests

and you may not need to have a test we

clearly do not need to have tests for

people who have no symptoms so if you've

come back from travel and you've gone

through your 14 days and

you've not got sick there is no need for

a test and so employers I know we've had

questions why can't we just test

everybody and and you need to have a

test before you're safe to come back

this test is not necessarily valid for

somebody who is not sick so there is no

reason to test anybody who's not sick

and there's no reason to require a note

for people who've been off we don't want

people to have to go see a practitioner

or medical practitioner if they've been

off on quarantine because they've been

traveling or for other reasons so we are

requiring requesting people not to

request physician notes for people - for

people to be deemed safe to come back to

work and no you don't need a test either

so we can do things to stop the spread

of this virus in our communities it is

not inevitable that we're going to have

a major surge in a short period of time

but those are the things that we need to

do now to protect our communities to

protect our families to protect our

seniors and elders and I'm calling on

everybody in DC to work with us to do

that thank you very much dr. Henry and I

think that's been the key of really

everything that we've been asking people

to do and say in the last wha do and in

their own lives and for the health

system to do we should do everything we

can to to contain but also to slow down

the growth the growth of the number of

people who have the Cova 19 virus in

british columbian so all of our actions

are designed for that and everything in

our plants including the challenging

days and weeks ahead and perhaps months

ahead is about ensuring that we do just

that as as dr. Henry has said that's 11

more cases today that's 64 cases in

total all 11 in Vancouver Coastal Health

today so for those of you who are

looking at the distribution of that

that's 39 in Vancouver coastal help 23

and Fraser Health one in island health

and one in interior health six

those people have now recovered with two

consecutive negative tests and of course

tragically one person has passed away in

North Vancouver I wanted to pay tribute

again and I know dr. Henry will join me

in this to all the people at the BC CDC

and all the people in primary care

across the province

we the bc CC cdc posted this morning the

number of individuals tested this week

previously we've done individuals a

number of tests they're approximately

8,000 tests but were focused on the

individual numbers as you know as of

last week that number was 2008 this week

at six thousand three hundred and

twenty-six that's forty three hundred

and eighteen tests in a week which is an

extraordinary achievement by everybody

involved everybody involved in the

system and we are focusing on those

tests and i want to re-emphasize what

dr. henry has said because as we develop

other models for tests to be and for

samples to be taken from people from

swabs to be taken from people that the

people who need to are the people who

have been referred to have a test done

based on their health information it's

not for everybody and it would not be

useful for people who are not

symptomatic to have tests at all i want

to note that some people out there are

still proposing promoting tests that may

or may not have any validity for a cost

there's no cost to test the british

columbian nor will there be ever for

Cova nineteen i wanted to note that we

are starting to build out that network

of testing facilities and we'll have

more to say about that over the weekend

i think what's important than that is to

know that that is some people will go

for referral so that they can address

things more safely it's not a place for

people to go without referral or without

recommendation i want you to know that

as part of that a part of our work with

the doctors of bc to improve that we're

working in fact meeting as we speak as

if you Minister of Health and others are

meeting with the general practice

services committee on this working

together to see how we can improve

things how we can improve referrals and

how we can allow doctors to make

referrals and make assessments

more simply both sometimes in person but

safely and sometimes at a distance

yesterday we had a number of requests

for information about different health

equipment and so I'm going to read off

some information as requested yesterday

number of acute care beds by Health

Authority 1447 an interior 2577 in

fraser health 1928 in Vancouver Coastal

Health 1770 in Island Health 571 in

northern health 309 at the provincial

health services authority that

children's and women's we were also

requested information around ventilators

and in addition I should say ventilators

are being extra and ventilators are

being ordered by the province and we'll

announce them upon arrival so that we're

not we're telling you when things

actually arrive when things actually

open not what we are we've requested and

and the number of ventilators in the

interior health is two hundred and

twenty-nine in Fraser health is four

hundred and nine in Vancouver Coastal

Health is 216 in island health is 155 in

Northern Health is 116 and in the pH si

that's the provincial Health Services

Authority

there's 147 for a total of 1200 and 72

I'll give you a further breakdown on

that that critical care surgical

ventilators using the hospital er 956

their transport ventilators 164 home

ventilators used to manage chronic

patients in their homes 120 and there's

a fourth specialized machine the ECMO

and their 32 of these machines which

pump and oxygenate a person's blood

outside of their body I just wanted to

say so that's the information we

requested yesterday and as I said we're

happy to respond to requests for

information as was made by a number of

reporters yesterday I wanted to say a

couple more things just about eight one

one that we have done in the last three

days more than

and thousand calls completed calls on

eight one one we understand that there's

significant pressure and lots of people

have trouble getting through but I think

the main message we're saying today and

every day is that if you're sick stay

home and helping help yourself get well

and be patient with these services eight

one one has done an unbelievable job in

the last week essentially tripling the

number of people that it talks to every

single day that's the incredible

addition and service and we're going to

continue to work to see that that

happens with in addition to bringing in

more nurses and so on

and we're going to provide more

information about additional numbers

people will be able to come to relieve

some of the pressure on a one-one in the

coming days and so I wanted us to say in

conclusion that all of this is to say

that we know what we're facing here in

British Columbia we are part and we're

dealing with our share our element of a

global pandemic and that is going to

challenge us and put tests on us and I

think the response if you look at the

response of the BC CDC to date the

response of dr. Henry and her team the

response of health authorities has been

extraordinary and expanding service but

we're going to be tested in the coming

days as well currently we have I believe

it's two people in acute care today two

people in acute care with Kovan 19 we

know that that number will grow over

time as the number of cases grow but and

it tells us though it tells us that we

have to focus on our focusing that care

right now in the community things such

as 8 1 1 things such as providing better

access to care and testing and

information in the community and finally

we're all part of this and if we want to

push the curve along as has been said if

we want to avoid a spike we're all part

of it and so when we ask people not to

travel outside of Canada that's playing

out playing our part when we ask people

to stay home with their sick that's

playing your part when we ask people to

wash their hands regularly and on

between 40 and 50 today I think myself

that's playing a part you ask you to

throw a clean X's and not touch your

face that's playing

when we ask you to support other people

in the community that's playing a part

all of these things we have agency here

to help one another to assist one

another to protect one another as a

society as a community as a place this

is happening in the world and it's

coming towards us and we have been

dealing with it I think very well up to

now that the challenge is in the next

four weeks dwarfed the challenges in the

last four weeks and how will do it deal

with that best is to deal with it and

for everybody everybody in British

Columbia to play their part thank you

and more happy to take question mr. Dix

and before we launch into the Q&A

segment of the event I would like to let

the media know that the government is

launching a joint information

coordination center or gic to manage

covert 19 communications across

government and perhaps media may already

be receiving some correspondence from

members of the government governments

jic team government will also have phone

lines available for the media in the

very near future in the meantime please

continue to contact specific ministries

with any media requests and the jic will

work closely with each ministry to

respond to your requests and we're

changing the format of the presses the

daily presses a little bit we request

the media to ask just one questions so

that we can accommodate a large number

of questions we will take questions from

the room first and then go over to the

phones at time permitting we will be

able to take seconds but for now I

request the media to please ask one

question each we'll take questions from

the room first any questions here

CBC go ahead can you hear me Andrea with

CBC News we're hearing that urgent care

centers like the one on Hornby Street

are overwhelmed with people who are

wanting to be tested what is being done

to ease the pressure reduce wait times

and keep staff safe as well yeah so

these are some of the initiatives that

we're working on and part of it is

people to understand that not everybody

needs to be tested for this we know that

it's not spreading widely in our

community yet and at some point if it is

spreading quite widely we won't be

testing most people will only be

testing people who are in hospital or

where there's a cluster or where there's

an outbreak potential so that we're able

to to manage those effectively and the

advice for everybody is if you're sick

stay home

there's care guides for how to look

after yourself if you're sick at home

how to look after your family and when

to seek care if you start to get worse

so I know Vancouver Coastal I know

actually across the province they're

working to try and manage some of these

issues they've done a tremendous job at

the UPC seas and in particular that one

and they've arranged things so that the

personal protective equipment is

available in those sites and that people

are coming in at various times when

there's not other people there so it's a

lot of logistics to try and support that

and to make sure that only people who

are prioritized and need to be tested

are are able to do that safely and

quickly in the case of the CMR medical

clinic who are partners in these both in

North Vancouver and in Vancouver that

the the team there has done an

outstanding job it's a challenging

circumstance what we're trying to do is

to provide ways by working with doctors

all over BC

trying to find ways to improve the

situation I'd also note that we've had a

very positive response we've asked

people who are recent retirees both as

doctors and nurses if they're prepared

to come back and we are will report on

this with details later but we've had to

date an excellent response and it shows

I think the commitment of the medical

community to people to people here so

we're doing work right now with the

doctors on all of these issues from how

we'll be able to deal with more people

remotely how we'll be able to deal with

people on sites and and facilitate

testing for those who ought to be tested

budget but just so everybody understands

when we open such sites or if we were to

open such sites it's not for people to

go yeah if they're if they haven't been

referred there by anyone we have to make

we have to have tests for people who

need tests and those decisions will be

made by medical professionals thank you

next question hi I'm Sam fan with

crackdown podcast our editorial board is

made up of people who use drugs on the

downtown

side many of whom are immunocompromised

our board members have to go to the

pharmacy every day because the

restrictions not allowing them to get

methadone carries others top-up in the

black market we don't understand how

they are supposed to do is socially

isolate will you change rules the rules

around opiate agonist therapy to allow

people to have caries and carry a supply

with them more than one day and will you

give our editorial board members and the

other vulnerable people in Vancouver a

safe supply of drugs thank you yeah you

know my my views on safe supply and

pharmaceutical alternatives to street

drugs and I'm obviously a very much

supporter for that and I know we have a

number of initiatives ongoing that we

want to increase I will also say that we

are actively working with with

organizations in the downtown's the east

side in particular but in other

communities as well to support means and

ways of protecting people from this

virus but also allowing them to not have

to congregate in certain ways including

ways to safely provide them with the the

medications they need absolutely I don't

have the details that's one of the

things that we're looking at yeah and if

you remember as we did the plan last

week I mean one of the challenges up to

now is this has been the Cova 19 cases

have been largely linked not exclusively

linked to international travel and

that's a different community obviously

than people were struggling with

addiction issues of all kinds but there

are a lot of vulnerable communities

we've seen seniors in care and other

communities and that's a key focus of

what we have to do now in this phase

should the virus become more generally

distributed to people around BC next

question I am guys from CTV question is

other provinces are opening standalone

dedicated testing clinics in Ottawa

won't open in hockey arena today some

clinics are doing drive-thru tests what

are we doing we have a variety of

different models that are

being designed for different communities

so we have as I mentioned before done

the drive-thru thing in some areas we

are looking at you know I was at a

meeting today where we've been talking

about some of the strategies that we can

use in different places and it's a

challenge it's been it's we've had

methods that have worked really well in

some communities and in the last couple

of days many of them have been whelmed

if not overwhelmed so we need to address

new strategies and we need to focus and

make sure we can prioritize the people

who need to get tested and I mentioned

that we get a lot of I've been getting

quite a lot of complaints from employers

that want somebody to be tested who's

not safe before they'll let them back to

work so we need to disabuse people of

that notion that that is of any value at

all yeah

and just just and just to start I mean

we we believe we do have seven operation

including one in Victoria today we're

not going to tell you what the plans are

we want to open them rather than say

we're going to open them so once they're

open we'll be briefing here about the

details of those things but yes let me

say first of all that we've done more

testing by I think a significant margin

than any other jurisdiction within the

existing circumstances we face and I

think you've seen that the numbers

demonstrate that we did we tested well

over well 4,300 additional cases this

week have after having done more in the

previous five weeks as well at 2008 so

we are succeeding getting a lot done and

as you point out there are some

pressures in that and some primary care

providers and so we're gonna address

that in different ways in different

health authorities but all of the ideas

are on the table that you've heard

elsewhere and once they're in place of

course we'll announce them but only when

they're in place

thank you next question radio Canada

Boogedy Samba at Zoo Canada I'm all be

asking the English and maybe a French

statement afterwards there are a lot of

British Columbians who are abroad right

now what is the recommendation for them

should they return and if so how should

they plan their travel yeah so

we are asking everybody who's abroad I

was going around outside of Canada self

isolated for 14 days on the return we do

recognize that there are some essential

workers and we've made some provisions

with individual groups for example we

know that there's health care workers

that if we had everybody who was off not

being able to come back to work would

leave us in dire straits so we've made

some provisions for safely coming back

to work in certain circumstances for

people who provide direct patient care

but we are requiring them to actively

self monitor and then to be in isolation

at home not to go out and about in the

community during their business like

everybody else so those things will be

in place for four critical workers in

the community as well but we're working

through the details of that but the

bottom line is we're asking everybody to

come back to self isolate thank you sip

next question Vancouver Sun I was

worrying about the funding what sort of

guidelines they have gotten from the

Pharaoh government and also if there is

an emergency since the apartment seems

to be suspended for a while

wow you got to get that funding if

there's an emergency that you really

need that well as you know foresaw the

federal government has offered its

support to us as part of its 1 billion

dollar plan which has a number of

elements but one of those elements is

providing support for provinces clearly

British Columbia and Ontario and Quebec

are the three provinces with the most

cases although Alberta has has quite a

few now and so what the Government of

Canada said is those provinces that need

the resources and most will get some as

a government we haven't put any

financial restrictions on our need to

address this question it's a question

that is required for everybody so we are

providing the resources that are needed

to deal with this because in fact the

more we're able to push the situation

into the future the were more able to

protect people the the less the

financial implications will be so all of

that money although the money we spend

on testing on resources on bringing

doctors and nurses back on set on on

ensuring that people are safe supporting

them in their homes supporting them in

their communities all that is money well

spent

thank you my last question from the room

before we move to the phones and that's

CP thank you I appreciate it yeah

brento with Canadian Press I'm actually

just wondering about how concerned you

may be about folks who might be

asymptomatic people who are displaying

minimal symptoms and just given the

escalating numbers yeah so um we still

have a relatively small number and if we

look at which I have and the people that

I work with are watching very carefully

particularly those countries that have a

lot of cases so China Korea Italy now

and it really shows that a symptomatic

spread is tiny it's not what what is

driving this outbreak around the world

it is when people have symptoms and when

they're close to people and when they're

coughing and when they're sneezing and

when they have fever that's when your

most infectious having said that we do

know that early on people may not

recognize their symptoms so particularly

young healthy people may not realize

that they're feeling unwell and that's

why we've been emphasizing any symptoms

even if it's just that I feel like I'm

fighting off something that tiredness

that fatigue that means that you need to

get away from others self isolate let

your body heal see what happens and so

it's really really important that we

start that early thank you we'll go over

to the phones now and another request

please one question each we have a lot

of media lined up on the phones and the

first question is from Richard Sussman

Global News please go ahead

dr. Henry what is your buddies the

snowbirds who are currently out of the

country out of British Columbia should

they return back home to British

Columbia earlier than planned yeah

that's a very good question and you know

we've been saying all along that this is

evolving very quickly and people need to

judge their own risk about being caught

up in in quarantines and now it's a

quarantine here so people need to

understand the risk in the place that

they are

and many snowbirds and parts of of the

US may be in places that are not having

a lot of this so if they do come back if

people do come back home then across the

country now they'll be asked to self

isolate when they get home and we'll

need to monitor them carefully because

we know the risk in the United States is

also very variable and is moving thank

you next question Shannon Patterson CTV

hi dr. Henry and Minister Dix so if

eight one one decides a test is needed

if somebody calls they meet the criteria

where are people being sent for that

test is that urgent care centers or is

it still hospitals and if we do open

standalone clinics like they are in

Ontario that one in Ottawa today are

you're concerned about a lack of

supplies because we're hearing from

doctors that masks are running so low

they don't have the right supplies so

and you'd think a standalone clinic they

would need a lot of supplies yeah so a

couple of things one we have always been

directing people to community to get

their testing not to hospitals and we've

actually very successfully mostly done

most of the tests in various places in

the community so eight one one does

refer people to clinics to the urging

primary care centers it depends on where

it is in the province so each of the

health authorities has identified the

areas and the people and the practices

that will provide these testing where

the challenge has been is providing

supplies to across the board and that's

why we're becoming more focused now and

there's some assessment centers there's

some the urgent primary care centers

some of them are in standalone places in

public health centers for example and

sometimes we actually send people to in

their cars two parking lots and a nurse

will go out and test them so that allows

us to make sure that we have that the

places that are doing the testing have

the appropriate supplies and we have not

had a shortage in the key areas there

has been a challenge in providing all

primary care providers with the PPE that

is necessary and that they need in their

offices and that's been a supply

challenge around the world so that's why

we're we're focusing on specific areas

that people can be referred to and those

are exactly the issues and that we've

been working on with with doctors in

various forms this week to make sure

that a and because this is very

important that they're safe and

protected and B that we can provide the

maximum service but I would say that the

the numbers tell a story of a system

that's produced a lot of tests and that

reflects the extraordinary work at now

five sites the in terms of processing

the tests around British Columbia

especially led by the BC CDC and then by

the work of primary care providers

around the province has really been

exceptional when you consider all of the

issues involved and the amount of

testing that's taking place in this

province but we know that we have to

support people even more and that's why

they're going to be even more options

for that in the coming week as testing

increases I just didn't want to say

there was some concerns about this the

swath being in short supply across the

country and we've been working on that

and we believe we have a solution for

that it's not been an issue here and

we not been an issue yet we were getting

close but we think we have a solution

for that so that's good news and

hopefully be used across the country

Thank You Angela junk now that

everyone's coming back to Hannah's being

asked to self isolate what are some of

the best practices especially for people

who live in apartment building should

they avoid shared laundry Suites so what

exactly does self isolation look like

yeah so self isolation means staying in

monitoring yourself for symptoms the you

know the trying you can go out in areas

where there's not other people around

avoiding mass gatherings avoiding going

out to communal areas with people and

yes if you need to do your laundry

that's fine as long as you're not having

any symptoms so it's been very careful

about how you interact with others try

and go at a time when nobody else is

there if other people are there go back

and come another time there there's

guidance that we have about how to do

this effectively on the BC CDC website

and we have some details but what to do

but the big thing is to to limit your

interaction with others during that

period of risk and there's many things

that we now have that allow us to get

medications online to get people to drop

off food and communities have been

coming together to support people in

that and that's what we need to do now

all of us because it protects all of us

and we don't have a treatment for this

we don't have a vaccine for this virus

so the best that we can do is keeping

people away from others during that

incubation period and that's why the 14

days period is so important we want

people to stay away from others so as

soon as they develop symptoms they're

not passing it on to anybody else and we

can break those I say it again we can

break those chains of transmission so

that they're not passing it on to

somebody else and that's the best that

we can do right now and that we all need

to do it collectively and it's the way

that we keep each other safe thank you

next question Mike Haggar Globe and Mail

go ahead please I wanted to know as they

cover coastal health on anything to

reinforce Gopnik caring

I've been balancing faith and as a

precarious nation nature sort of the job

in many nursing homes exacerbated the

risk because that often work across

several facilities sometimes in the same

day yes and and that is something that

we're very aware of and has been a large

part of the outbreak investigation and

the concerns that we have and we know

that the two care home operates that we

have and Holly Byrne and in the Linn

Valley care center that staff were

working in both of those areas and we

know that the contracting out of

services means that people can work in

multiple different ones in terms of

dealing with these two outbreaks people

are restricted to working in those

facilities only and we've put in

provisions our Vancouver Coastal has put

in provisions to support health care

workers in those two facilities and to

ensure that that doesn't leave other

facilities that are relying on those

workers as well in the lurch so it's

been a lot of Human Resources and

juggling and ensuring that we can do

that and I will say we are looking at a

broader strategy particularly in the

care homes that we have because we know

that once it gets into a long-term care

facility it can be a very challenging

virus it can make people who are elderly

very severely ill and we don't want we

want to do our best to protect our

long-term care home so we need to look

at a strategy at least for the next

while to try and better protect them and

that could include looking at how we

manage staffing for each of the care

homes and not having as much

transmission of staff between them thank

you next question Cindy Hartnett times

colonist hello dr. Henry you were you

were talking reassuring people about you

know being able to go shopping and to

enjoy restaurants and and outdoor

activities I'm seeing conflicting

studies now about how long the virus

lives on hard surfaces stainless steel

plastics that sort of thing do you mind

going over the science of that of how

long

the virus lives in in different

conditions yeah so this is a droplet

respiratory virus which means it's in

the saliva that we breathe out and it

can last on surfaces and depending on

humidity and temperature and sunlight

sunlight is a very effective UV light is

actually quite effective at killing this

virus it can last on surfaces for hours

sometimes maybe days that's why it's so

important that we enhance our cleaning

it's very susceptible to all of our

regular household cleaning products and

if we don't have a regular household

cleaning products that one in 10 leach

solution works very effectively as well

and it's also why it's so important to

clean our hands and you know we don't

get infected by touching the virus so if

we're on the bus and somebody is

coughing and there's gunk that we get on

our hands from touching something that

has been contaminated that is not how we

get infected we get infected by taking

that and touching our face and eyes and

inoculating ourselves so we that's why

we talk about how important it is to

clean our hands regularly and

particularly when you're out in a boat

if you're and high-touch areas then you

want to make sure you have alcohol hand

sanitizer with you or you hit the sink

with the soap and water and soap and

water plain soap and water is your the

best thing that we can do to remove the

germs from our hands so that's the

really important piece about it and

we've been working with businesses we've

been talking about this with transit

with BC Ferries enhancing the cleaning

that we do the routine cleaning in those

high-touch areas the places where lots

of people are because that also kills

this virus and gets it off those

surfaces thank you next question Amanda

Follett's dyi

go ahead

I'm and are you there okay next question

Marcello Bernardo news 11:30 hi there

I'm hoping to ask about we've been

hearing some reports that we're gonna

have some drive-through testing centers

can somebody clarify about when that

might happen if it might happen over the

weekend or how soon can we actually see

it well we're looking Myrcella at a

number of options to have testing

centers around the province and will be

once we're ready to go and they're

established we're gonna let people know

I think what we've tried to do

consistently is say here's a service

that's in place and it's in place here

and now or will be in place on this date

at this time and so when we're ready to

make announcements you'll be amongst the

first hundred reporters to know thank

you next question Jane side Northshore

news

that's hello dr. Henry I am wondering

the outbreak into to care homes here on

the North Shore have people asking a lot

of questions so I guess I'm wondering if

you are actively looking at the

possibility that there are other care

homes here on the North Shore that may

have been affected and also whether you

have any idea how this was spread by the

workers between these facilities

especially if people were hand washing

and disinfecting properly how did that

happen yeah very good question and these

are absolutely paramount for us in the

investigations and I have to say the

team at Vancouver Coastal Health has

been on site the public health team has

been doing detailed investigations and

tracing back who touched who when so we

can find out exactly how it was

introduced into Linn Valley and Holly

Byrne and which one came first you know

those are the things that are

challenging to understand is it related

to travel and I don't have the we don't

have the definitive answer yet but it's

becoming clearer and it's becoming

clearer how people may have transmitted

to each other so we know that this is

transmitted through close contact and we

know that workers have close contact

with each other they also have close

contact with the residents and prior to

the outbreak being recognized there was

not people who were not wearing masks

and things like that in the in the care

home as is the usual so we do have

really sensitive protocols for

identifying when there's an outbreak in

a care home or respiratory outbreak and

we have been investigating all of the

care homes in the Lower Mainland and de

Fraser Health and Vancouver Coastal have

been messaging to all of them we put in

measures to reduce the number of people

going in and out of long-term care homes

in in the Lower Mainland to make sure

that you're only going to see your

family member to clean your hands to not

come in when

and that's the really really important

part but yes the detailed investigation

of every single staff member and where

they worked and making sure that that

care home is protected is the first

order of business in the oak break

protocol thank you next question

Michael Vancouver courier yeah hi good

afternoon dr. Henry Minister dick heard

today that the federal government is

going to restrict some of the airports

that people can land at who are abroad

have you heard anything more from the

federal government on that and what that

looks like in terms of a provincial role

when plane lands in British Columbia

well we will be hearing more from the

federal government as you know with the

prime minister and premiers met today by

teleconference I think we'll be hearing

more on that issue in the near future it

would be of course our expectation

inevitably that one of those airports

would be YVR in any event we are engaged

always with why they are so the Canadian

border service agency and the public

health agency quarantine service are

based there and we have an ongoing

relationship with them so when we know

which airports are involved we'll make

sure that the protocols are in place to

identify anybody who sick and make sure

they're assessed appropriately thank you

next question Graham wood glacier media

please go ahead hi to transmission is

being announced they claim to consulted

with public health officials but of

course here BP directly barely the BP

continued to operate under your

guidelines are you aware of what advice

DC Hockey was giving is this or is this

an evidence of an overabundance of

caution or an unbalanced approach or do

you think recreation facilities are on

the verge of closure I'm sorry you broke

up a little bit but I think what you're

asking is you know what advice was BC

hockey given around

the the interventions that are

appropriate and I I have to say that I'm

actually incredibly disappointed that

the NHL was cancelled because I had

tickets for Tampa Bay on Wednesday but

but I think is the right thing to do and

it was the appropriate thing to do so

what we've provided advice is around

gatherings that have more than 250

people and it's not talking about

day-to-day things we're talking about

one-time events or events that happen

periodically

so there are ways that the hockey teams

and players can continue to play there's

event there's some games that can still

happen but they need to be undone with

appropriate precautions in place and

same with gym same with recreation

centers so you want to make sure you

have space between people you want to

enhance cleaning you want to make sure

there's availability of of hand hygiene

or soap and water for people to use on a

regular basis you want to make sure

there's signage and that people don't

come in if they're sick and that you

allow for people to cancel out or to not

come in if they're not feeling well and

then within teams there's things that

are important to do like not sharing of

water bottles not having that close

contact in in the locker room in ways

that are that you can do that safely so

that's the advice that we've been given

if people feel that they're that they

can't do it within their setting then

then they may make the decision to close

down or defer things thank you next

question is from Arthur Williams Prince

George citizen please go ahead there

hasn't been a detected case in northern

Health yet but I was hoping to get some

census has it been any active testing

done in the Nha area is there and does

you know do some of these rural northern

communities have the infrastructure to

even handle it administer tests yes

there has been testing in a number of

areas in the north

you're right there's not been as much

people who've been at risk from travel

or other

contacts there have been a number of

people who have been under observation

in self-isolation because they had been

in contact or had traveled to an area

that had been that had been a high-risk

area so we do know that they are

watching carefully there that we're also

testing from the north for people who've

getting a test for influenza for example

they are looking at you know how do we

support smaller communities where the

testing volume is not that great and

really our focus in planning has been

how do we ensure that we keep people who

might be at risk of having this virus

outside of many of our small communities

or remote communities or communities

that don't have a lot of healthcare

support or in our indigenous and First

Nations communities around the province

where we know that there may be a higher

proportion of people who are elderly or

people who have underlying chronic

conditions so that's been part of our

focus as well and I think these measures

that we're talking about around travel

around self-isolation

around doing the things in our community

to best protect our seniors and elders

are really important in the north and as

they are everywhere and just say

northern health 30 has its own

emergencies operations center there and

they're making their plans and the First

Nations health authorities which is also

very active in the region is fully

integrated into those plans as well

thank you and one last question from the

phone it goes to Phil McLaughlin Black

Press please go ahead a published report

in the Okanagan state says upwards of 50

800 people will die in the Okanagan I'm

just wondering if the province is aware

of this and yeah

well I think if we look at the number of

people who've died around the world and

the number of infections that doesn't

doesn't ring true to me and so people

may have been doing some blue sky

back-of-the-envelope estimations based

on things like we talked about yesterday

on some of the models that are based on

the early phase in in Wuhan for example

where there was a rapid increase in in

people who've been infected but even

then once you put in measures that slow

things down drag things out make sure

that we do our best at prevention and

and detecting cases and clusters and and

preventing spread from people we know

have the disease we can affect that so

that we don't see those types of numbers

and we are absolutely committed to doing

that

thank you and that was the last question

thank you all for participating thank

you
