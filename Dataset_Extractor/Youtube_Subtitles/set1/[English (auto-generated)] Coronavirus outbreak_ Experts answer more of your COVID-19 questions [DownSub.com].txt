the first case of kovat 19 was confirmed

in Canada two months ago since then a

whole lot has changed throughout this

crisis we've been trying to ease some of

your fears and your confusion by putting

your questions to the experts Geoff

simple has more answers for you tonight

Jeff Donna Canada's health minister says

she expects between 30 and 70 percent of

Canadians will become infected with

kovat 19 and of those cases around 20

percent will be serious and may require

hospitalization with the average stay be

Global News took a tour of this

intensive care unit where hospital staff

are bracing for a rush of kovat 19

patients some may need to be

hospitalized for months the sickest

patients with covin 19 have what looks

like a pneumonia on both sides of the

lungs that require a lot of oxygen to be

given around 200 Canadians who were

infected with kovat 19 have now

recovered released from hospital leading

some to wonder whether they might now be

immune from Fort McMurray if someone

recovered from Kovan 19 there's a chance

to have bars again that's a really good

question that we just don't have the

answer to yet there haven't been any

confirmed cases of someone catching

kovat 19 twice but some viruses such as

influenza mutate rapidly which is why

people can catch the flu again and again

you know every year is a slightly

different virus that we're talking with

and we don't know enough yet about this

new corona virus if it mutates as

quickly as influenza hi my name is story

I'm calling from Vancouver I have some

questions about the corona virus I want

to know how long it lives on services

such as cell phones tablets a recent

study found that kovat 19 can survive on

plastic surfaces like a smartphone case

for up to three days while similar

viruses have been known to survive on

glass surfaces for

two four days your phone is about 18

times dirtier than like a public

restroom toilet seat this Toronto

company is scrambling to supply

hospitals with these smart phone

sanitizers the microwave like devices

blast bacteria and viruses with intense

ultraviolet light they've sold twice as

many units last month than all of last

year now if you can't afford your own UV

machine you can also clean your smart

phone with one of these a wipe with at

least 70% alcohol and if you don't have

one of these Donna you can also just wet

a cloth with some soap soap and water
