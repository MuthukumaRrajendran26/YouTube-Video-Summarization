[Applause]

thank you

the eyes to the right 322 the nose to

the left 306 so the eyes have it the

eyes have it unlocked but the question

is colleagues that the motion as amended

be agreed to us when is other abilities

a I love the country now I think the

eyes of it the eyes have it but we now

come to motion number two our man the

house that I'm selecting the manuscript

amendment to the name of Peter Carlisle

others Minister or whip on duty to milk

normally not moved thank you order order

the Prime Minister speak um thank you

[Applause]

I'm very grateful to you I'm very

grateful to every between the House of

Commons staff everybody who's put

themselves out everybody who's come to

give up their time in this debate today

it's been a very important debate and

exceptional moment for our country

except a moment for our Parliament alas

the opportunity to have a meaningful

vote has effectively been passed up

because the meaningful vote has been

voided of meaning but I wish the house

to know that I'm not daunted or dismayed

by this particular result it probably

became likely once it was obvious that

the amendment for me my right honourable

friend the member of West Dorset was

going to remain on the order paper I

continued in the very strong belief that

the best thing for the UK and for the

whole of Europe is for us to leave with

this new deal on October to anticipate

the questions that are coming from their

benches of it I will not negotiate a

delay with the EU

and neither does the law compel me to do

so I will tell our friends and

colleagues in the EU exactly what I have

told everyone in the last 88 days that

I've served as Prime Minister but

further than they would be bad for this

country bad for democracy so next week

the government will introduce the

legislation needed for us to leave the

EU with our new deal on October the

30-person I hope I hope that our

European Union colleagues and friends

will not be attracted as benches

opposite are or rather I should say the

front bench is by delay I don't think

that they will be attracted by the way

and I hope that then honourable members

faced with a choice of our new deal our

new deal for the UK and the European

Union will change their minds because it

was pretty close today I hope that they

will change I hope that they will change

their minds and support this deal in

overwhelming numbers since I became

Prime Minister I've said we must get on

and get brexit done on October the 31st

so that this country can move on mr.

speaker that policy that policy remains

unchanged no delays and I will continue

to do all I can to get brexit done

on October the 31st and I continue to

commend this excellent deal mr. speaker

to the house

[Applause]
