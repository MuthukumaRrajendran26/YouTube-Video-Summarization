Dom are not anymore so as we announced

late yesterday afternoon the Government

of Canada has secured the services of

the plane to repatriate Canadians on

board the Grand Princess which will dock

later today in the Port of Oakland in

California this decision was made

following a request from the government

of the United States to repatriate

foreign nationals aboard the ship which

has experienced an outbreak of corvid 19

we have been working in close

collaboration with our American partners

to ensure the return of our Canadians as

quickly and as safely as possible the

aircraft will transport passengers from

Oakland to Canadian Forces Base Trenton

where they will be assessed and

quarantined for 14 days passengers will

be screened for symptoms before boarding

the aircraft if they exhibit symptoms

they will not be allowed to board and

will instead be assessed further to

determine next steps this illustrates

the commitment and mobilization of the

Government of Canada in the face of CO

vide

19 crisis as well as our close

collaboration with the US government to

limit the spread of the virus in North

America I would also like to take this

opportunity once again to thank

officials and partners including those

from our consulates in San Francisco and

Los Angeles

for their work over the past few days to

support the repatriation of Canadians

aboard the Grand Princess in closing I

would like to remind all Canadians which

are watching us today and who are

considering traveling of the importance

of taking the time to consult our travel

advisories and to register with the

registration of Canadians abroad service

in order to receive the very latest

updates from the Government of Canada

regarding kovat 19 the health and safety

of Canadians both at home and abroad

remains our priority Thank You Minister

repatriations passengers will be

the plane if they exhibit symptoms of

kovin 19 they will not be permitted to

board they will be cared for by the US

healthcare system and our consular

services will remain in close contact

throughout the duration of their illness

all returning Canadians will continue to

be assessed for symptoms of Koba 19

through a 14 day quarantine at CFB

Trenton and of an abundance of caution

and to ensure the health and safety of

all Canadians each repatriated Canadian

or family will be housed in separate

accommodations to reduce potential

exposure to other quarantined

individuals and if quarantined

individuals remain asymptomatic

throughout the 14-day quarantine period

they pose no risk to others and they

will be able to return home we will

monitor their health and we will make

their stay as comfortable as possible

I'd like to thank the Canadian Armed

Forces at CFB Trenton the staff of the

help health portfolio the province of

Ontario our partners helping on the

ground as well as our chief Public

Health Officer dr. Tam for all of their

hard work and dedication and I now like

to invite dr. Tam to say a few words on

the public health assessment of Kersey's

Thank You ministers and good morning

everyone

as usual I'll begin with a brief update

on the evolving situation globally

and cases in Canada globally there are

now over 110,000 confirmed cases in over

100 countries in Canada as of right now

we have 71 confirmed and presumptive

cases of kovat 19 reported nationally

including 34 in Ontario 27 in British

Columbia for in Quebec and 6 in Alberta

most of Canada's cases include travelers

from an affected area or their close

contacts in addition colleagues in

British Columbia have identified two

cases of Kovac 19 in residence of a

long-term care facility as part of their

investigation into an individual who

contracted kovat 19 in the community new

cases in Canada also includes six

individuals connected to the first leg

of the Grand Princess cruise ship voyage

who were on board between February 11th

and the 21st given that cases of covin

19 have now been identified amongst

passengers currently onboard the Grand

Princess any asymptomatic individuals

repatriated to Canada will be

quarantined for 14 days we are also

aware of a Canadian work Ovid 19 in the

Dominican Republic this individual was a

guest at a hotel where one other case

linked to Italy have previously been

reported as a result we have identified

travelers who stayed at the same hotel

from February the 22nd to March the 7th

and I've asked them to self isolate for

14 days as a precautionary measure

I've asked Canadians to think twice

about going on cruise ships today the

public health agency of Canada is

recommending that Canadians avoid all

cruise ship travel due to Cove in 19

cruise ships have passengers from around

the world who may be arriving for areas

with known or unknown spread of the

novel coronavirus the virus can spread

quickly on board cruise ships due to the

close contact between passengers all the

people and people with awaken the

immunes

or underlying medical conditions are at

a higher risk of developing severe

disease because of the ongoing expansion

of kovat 19 outbreaks worldwide for the

time being the rest of the general

population within Canada is still low

but this could change rapidly we are

most concerned for Canada's vulnerable

populations it is very important for all

travelers coming to Canada to

self-monitor

for symptoms of kovat 19 for 14 days and

avoid places where you cannot easily

separate yourself from others if you

become ill stay home if you're sick

and call ahead to health lines or public

health authorities before seeking

medical care we must all do our part to

reduce spread of kovat 19 and protect

our most vulnerable groups including

anyone in long-term care facilities and

our hospitals

as well the risk of infection is

increased for certain settings such as

travel to the most affected areas

international conferences large

gatherings in enclosed spaces so we

continue to work closely with health

authorities internationally across

Canada and at all levels of government

to assess the risks and keep Canadians

informed on what we can or do to keep

healthy and protect the most vulnerable

question for dr. Tam the situation in

the state seems to be developing quite

rapidly you have a lot of people from

Quebec coming back last week from March

Break in the States next week as much

break in Ontario undoubtedly a lot of

people we go into the states at what

point given what's happening down south

do you think about a travel advisory

parts of the states well we continue to

monitor the situation you know on a very

much an ongoing basis right now if you

look at our advice it would include all

the areas in the United States that are

currently experiencing cases as well so

as I've just said that all travelers no

matter where they come from including

the United States should be aware of

this kind of information on which is

linked to our website and as I've said

that everyone who comes back into Canada

should self monitor for symptoms

administer champagne there's no doubt

that if Canada did issue a travel

advisory warning against travel to

certain parts of the states that would

upset the white house

how complicated is it for your

relationship with the states to have a

potentially unhappy president Trump for

Europe when you're working through these

issues may be clear I mean it's science

first and from day one in Canada

thanks to dr. Tam and Minister hadoo and

the whole of government we have been

guided by science we have been guided by

the World Health Organization advisory

and we're continuing to work with our

five ice partner in the case of the

Grand Princess as you could see we have

been in touch with our us colleagues to

make sure that not only we protect the

health and safety of Canadians both at

home and abroad but we also are mindful

of how we can protect North America from

the spread of the virus I would say our

relationship and our interaction is

going well it's it's almost daily at all

levels of governments to make sure that

we protect the safety of all Canadians

dr. Tam Buddha a jutsu

vodka Co why did it take so long before

giving advice against cruise ship travel

because we saw what happened in that

cruise ship in Japan it's been weeks so

why just today I think we provide advice

to all travelers no matter what setting

but as you know that the global

situation changed quite rapidly even

from the time of the Diamond Princess

cruise ship to now many more countries

and they're affected was at that point

in time there was not as many but we

always have to learn continuously from

the experiences that have taken place

including that of the diamond princess

which is why I think the moment that

something was noted in terms of cases on

this particular cruise ship

international communities acted rapidly

so I think is really a constant learning

from the very rapidly evolving situation

and I think that this is a precautionary

measure that we absolutely support from

a public health perspective

joycie one huh thank you about the

passengers on that on the latest ship

you said that those who present symptoms

will remain in the States and be treated

in the United States so do you know if

they're going to a military base in

quarantine is it a civilian hospital and

what kind of agreement do you have with

the Americans how many days will they

keep them there how will they be treated

do you have specific agreements with the

US about that so yes so in terms of

passengers that are currently

symptomatic those passengers will not be

allowed to board this plane we're

working with the US authorities right

now to determine the severity of illness

that people might be experiencing

whether or not they can isolate self

isolate for 14 days or longer depending

on their symptoms how will how will work

through supporting those folks and I

know that consular services is working

very closely with the individuals that

are affected and we'll have more to say

as we work through those details with

the Americans but we have been very

clear with our American partners that we

expect that those Canadians receive the

appropriate level of care and of course

we'll be in touch with them as well on

the health side and about you know a

canada's critical care facilities so we

know by covering federal provincial

conferences the provinces have told you

in mississauga lately that their health

care system is in need of more funds

from the federal government so I'm

wondering if our critical care

facilities across the country are ready

to receive should there be a big

outbreak in Canada do we have enough

respirators do we have enough capacity

or for testing or kits testing kits or

whatever it is that we do have and do we

have enough beds do we have enough

people do you feel really confident that

your healthcare system as it stands

today will be able to handle this so two

parts that question I think it's very

important that we don't confuse the

requests of provinces in terms of

general health transfers with what we

are facing right now which is the

potential surge on demands it is a

significant

difference so secondly I think it's

important to know that these are the

conversations we've been having both

through the health ministers and now

with the prime minister and premier we

are very alive to the fact that some

provinces are indicating that they have

they have deficits and we are gathering

that information and we have said all

along that we will be there as a federal

government to support them with the

resources they need whether those are

financial resources or practical

resources you mentioned kits personal

protective equipment ventilators dr. Tam

can speak a little bit about the

components of the testing kits so we are

in the process right now of ensuring

that we understand where those potential

deficits will be from province to

province and we obviously have supply on

hand of some of the materials and are

doing the assessment right now with

provinces in terms of what their

particular needs are as it relates to a

surge in capacity related to kovat 19

did you want to add anything director -

we have a federal provincial territorial

special Advisory Committee on covert 19

and as part of that the discussions

there we facilitate and coordinate

discussions on supplies from the

provinces and territories including

laboratory networks as well so all

provincial laboratories are connected

together with our national microbiology

lab and they have not indicated any

issues with supplies right now but that

doesn't mean we shouldn't proactively

plan for what the escalations are up and

coming

so this is a very sort of ongoing

ongoing assessment in terms of supply

requirements but as you see in provinces

have done an incredible job in expanding

their testing in Canada we blue wires

certainly true in English I'd like to

know if the level of preparedness from a

province to the

is the same at this point and was there

any requests that were made by the

provinces at this time that is underway

right now and I have a regular weekly

meeting with my counterparts health

ministers and this is a standing item on

our agenda we've also sent out formal

letters as you know to the provinces and

territories to let them know that we are

here for them and that we are preparing

federally in terms of what our

anticipated demands might be and also to

advise me in terms of what other needs

they have as dr. Tam mentioned this is

happening at the technical level as well

and I know that the Prime Minister has

written to the Premier's and has

reminded them that this is going to be

very useful information as of this time

provinces and health ministers have said

that they are grateful for that support

that they feel confident that the

federal government will be there to

support them if they see an anticipate

an anticipated surge or if they have

specific challenges around needs that

they may feel that they have a deficit

I think what I'd like to tell Canadians

is that your officials and your

to be ready should we see a surge in any

community this is top of priority for

all governments including local

governments and so I want to thank all

of those professionals and the leaders

political leaders that are taking this

so seriously and doing that hard work

this is the work that has to happen

undoubtedly and it is

happening and Canadians can be assured

that the people that are in charge of

these various health systems are

extremely hard working and working very

yes not many reporters good morning

Christie Kirk will put The Globe and

Mail you mentioned off the top that the

travel advisory specifically to the

United States that there's no no plan

change there can you just help us to

understand why that is is it because

Cova 19 knows no borders and is that

kind of part of the approach that you're

giving the the public health advice

because you know this can can go

anywhere at this point advice or travel

notice is based on the existing data

so of course we will be monitoring every

part of the United States like we would

any part of the world and but we will

our advice would be focused on specific

area of the United States as opposed to

the whole of the United States that that

would be the most appropriate approach

so right now none of them are an

increased level of travel health

advisory but that doesn't mean that it

couldn't happen it's just that it's

right now I mean if you can't compare

you know maybe another country with much

higher cases than what is happening in

the United States but we are taking the

precautionary approach to warn all

travelers as I've just said and dr. Tam

I heard what you said on Friday that

people should think twice about getting

on a cruise ship today you're saying

public health agency is your you know

kind of going further to warn Canadians

against cruise ship travel the

government obviously announcing this

weekend your Patriot and Canadians that

are stuck on the Grand Princess if

Canadians decide to maybe not take the

advice of the public health agency are

you still going to order up a plane and

to go get those Canadians what's the

policy in place specifically around also

taxpayers are involved in dealing with

this very sensitive situation

now that the advice has been issued to

not go on cruise ships are you still

gonna gonna go and get them if they're

in a situation where they need some help

well first of all let me be very clear

for all of those watching at home this

is going to be done at a cost recovery

basis so I have talked to the CEO about

in America and we have agreed that that

the cruise line will be will be assuming

the costs of the plane to repatriate

Canadians so this is done on a cost

recovery basis and the cost will be

borne by the cruise line in the case

that we have obviously as people

watching at home we have to look at the

situation case-by-case this is a very

exceptional circumstances first of all

we had a specific request from the

United States government we are dealing

in a cruise ship environment and

everything we have learned as dr. Tam

said so far suggests that we take

measures which are exceptional and we're

also acting to prevent the spread of the

virus in North America

so these circumstances I've led us

obviously to take a specific set of

actions if you compare the case what do

you learn in Italy for example in Iran

there is still a number of commercial

means for Canadians to get out of these

regional areas where obviously there's

an outbreak of the coroner virus but

you're quite right to say that as we

have said the Canadians now that the

advice from the public health agency of

Canada in ministry and the whole of

government is for Canadians to avoid

travel on cruise ship people would be on

notice obviously of the danger

associated with getting into a cruise

line at this stage and therefore we will

look at cases on a case by case basis

because all of them depend but I would

say on this one there were a number of

exceptional circumstances which have led

us to work with the u.s. Authority to

secure a plane and this is being done on

a cost recovery basis in accordance with

our discussions with the cruise line

wada quaza on the question of Canadians

who are symptomatic that you can't

travel first I will say that every

situation will be different and we're

assessing right now what people's

personal situations are how ill they are

whether or not they will need to be

hospitalized whether or not they will be

able to self isolate you know

potentially in a hotel but I will remind

Canadians that when they travel and

adverse events happen that that is why

we have things like travel insurance and

other kinds of precautions that we put

into place when we travel because

unanticipated events can happen

regardless of whether it's an illness or

other kinds of events obviously the

consular services will work with each

particular individual to assess their

their circumstances but our anticipation

is that those individuals will have to

you know work with the consular services

and and hopefully draw on the resources

that they have put into place as

travelers my other question is sort of a

technical question maybe it's for you

Minister I do in in a situation where

the it would become an epidemic where is

the jurisdiction is it federal or

provincial to decide if there were to be

a quarantine for a city or for an area

so I'll answer briefly and then I'll

turn to dr. Tam

we work very closely with provinces and

territories and local municipalities to

help them do risk assessments in terms

of the kinds of social distancing

measures that they'll take including the

potential of quarantine or cancellation

of events for example we now have we've

had obviously documents that are

available to all provinces but there's a

link now on our web site on the front

page that includes access to the risk

assessment tool that local communities

can use if they're considering canceling

events are closing down public spaces

but that is largely in at the discretion

of the jurisdiction and in which the the

event is being held so whether it's at a

local level or provincial level and I'll

turn to dr. Tam to just add a few words

about that no that's correct

I think at the federal level and the

public health agency we provide guidance

and technical support but every level of

government have their own acts Public

Health laws which allow them to enact

any number of these range of public

health measures and it is important I

think that you do look at the situation

from the ground up and the measures have

to be balanced against what's going on

on the ground and you can't sort of

blanket a whole geographic area for with

without really paying attention to the

details on the ground so I think the key

is that at the local level they need to

understand they're happy demillo jaques

situation if you like and then act

according to that data so I get dr.

I'll urge them to do that thank you for

bringing it to my attention I'll make
