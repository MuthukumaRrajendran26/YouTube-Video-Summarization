thank you very very much merci beaucoup

purrs at my shadow it's great to be back

I know you've all been working very hard

in your constituency since the last time

we met and now we're going to roll up

our sleeves and get to work here in

Ottawa as well now I for one can't wait

to get back into the house to show

Canadians why perhaps more than ever our

country needs a Conservative government

but first I would like to take this

opportunity to acknowledge the horrible

atrocity committed by the Iranian regime

57 Canadians lost their lives their

friends and families woke up to the

realization that they would never see

their loved ones again I would like to

take this opportunity to thank the Prime

Minister for keeping me fully informed

about developments and I know that many

of our shadow ministers have had

conversations with their counterparts as

well and while tragic it is heartwarming

to see Canadians of all walks of life

coming together during trying times like

these and we as conservatives are going

to continue to push for justice for the

families and to ensure that the Iranian

regime is held accountable

Canadians can be United when we face

external threats we have to stay focused

on the best interests of Canadians here

at home

and coming out of the election campaign

at the top of everyone's minds was the

issue of national unity though Trudeau

liberals were shut out of Alberta and

Saskatchewan where anxiety is running

higher than perhaps we've ever seen

before in Quebec we saw the resurgence

of the separatist block québécois now

while Trudeau has said many of the right

things over the last few weeks we

haven't seen him walk the walk billions

of dollars in investment is still

fleeing the energy sectors in Alberta

and Saskatchewan and forestry Mills

continued to close down in British

Columbia and we will get to the

opportunity to see where Trudeau stands

when it comes to the development of the

tech frontier project in northern

Alberta will he stand with hard-working

energy workers will he stand with local

indigenous groups who support the

project or will he stand with the

activists and celebrities who want us to

shut down our energy sector

tomorrow we've made our choice in this

room we stand with Canadian energy

workers all across

and we will continue to make the case to

Keynes that the world needs more

Canadians more Canadian energy and that

Canada needs more Canadian energy and we

must continue to show Canadians that the

Conservative Party are the only ones who

can keep our country United and strong a

the house is sitting for the first time

this session on Monday the parliamentary

work has already begun I'd like to thank

the members of the Special Committee on

Canada China relations who held their

first meeting this past week as many of

you may remember this committee was a

result of us working together with our

colleagues in the opposition to hand

Justin Trudeau his first defeat of this

minority Parliament a Canada's

relationship with the Chinese government

will help define the 21st century

unfortunately every step of the way

Justin Trudeau has been pushed around

and has failed to stand up for Canadian

interests whether it's the status of the

two Canadians being illegally detained

widespread human rights violations at

the hands of the Chinese government

Canadian farmers losing billions of

dollars getting shut out of markets

the tudor liberals also recently

indicated their proposed firearms ban

will be coming in the next few weeks now

let's be clear about what this is this

is an attack on law-abiding responsible

firearms owners

on hunters on farmers and sport shooters

honest Canadian honest Canadians who

follow all the rules already making

law-abiding members of our communities

follow even more rules will not help

solve gun crime it's easy lazy

government to force people who are

already following all the rules and all

the laws to just follow a few more it's

much harder and much more difficult to

go after the gang members and the

illegally trafficked firearms but that

is the difficult work that conservatives

have always been her hair

just a short time ago our whole member

of parliament Glenn Watts launched a

petition on this issue and and just in a

few days it is already the second most

signed online petition in history so

let's not give up let's make it the most

scientific finally the Trudeau liberals

will table their first budget of the

upcoming session in the next couple of

months and quite frankly I am very

worried about the future of our economy

Trudeau is going to try and buy the

votes of the NDP in the block in order

to pass it and when that and when the

time comes he's going to try and buy

back his majority - and what does that

mean it means more wasteful spending

more sky-high taxes and more reckless

borrowing all of this as there are

worrying economic signs on the horizon

more and more real but the Conservative

Party will always be the party of fiscal

responsibility will always be the party

of the taxpayer and as the pre budget

consultations continue let's remember

that our party is now undergoing an

exciting leadership contest and where

candidates are going to be traveling

across the country and sharing their

vision for the future of the

Conservative Party so I of course would

like to offer my best wishes to everyone

running while that's going on the

Trudeau liberals might think that our

leadership race will give them a free

ride they're wrong

we're all we're all going to continue to

be here in Ottawa and the House of

Commons is on the committee floor every

single day fighting for our vision for

the country minority Parliament's can

end abruptly and unexpectedly so we

can't afford to waste a day we've got to

make the case every single day for why

our country needs a Conservative

government for a stronger position on

the world stage for respect for

taxpayers dollars and for a united

country from east to west to north
