I've been looking for freedom I've been

looking so long I've been looking for

freedom still the search goes on why do

people still believe that I had

something to do with bringing down the

wall I had nothing to do with bringing

down the wall I I say a song called I've

been looking for freedom it happened to

be the right song at the right time and

I capitalized on that because I realized

the severity and the horrible

dehumanization of these people because I

went there and they were singing my song

and they looked at me as a hero and I

became a hero because I had to become a

hero it was God gave me Knight Rider

God gave me a lot of good things God

gave me a lot of bad things but God gave

me the power to help people have hope

and that's what that song is about it's

about hope and I'm still singing a 30

years later and it's still very

pertinent but nobody in America knew

what was really going on they didn't

understand I understood because I'd been

there and I saw the people hugging and I

saw everyone crying I saw keep it on the

wall people on the wall we're singing my

song and there was a band on the wall

I'm singing I like this and there's a

bangor da da da

horns playing looking for freedom it was

just a completely magical night that I

remember every moment about it because I

knew that they would never come again if

something like this will probably happen

only once in a lifetime

that that night was families were

reunited that night everybody got along

and it would be really nice if um we

could go back to New Year's Eve in 1989

and get the world to look at it
