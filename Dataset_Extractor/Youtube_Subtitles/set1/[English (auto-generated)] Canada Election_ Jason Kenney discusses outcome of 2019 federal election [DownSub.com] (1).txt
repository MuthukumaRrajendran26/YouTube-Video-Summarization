so good afternoon I think you heard my

remarks upstairs

and I'm happy to take your questions

well we will continue to dispute that at

the first of all through judicial

reference to the Alberta appeal court

and also by supporting the Appeals of

the governments of Saskatchewan and

Ontario to the Supreme Court of Canada

we will be asking that the Supreme Court

to delay their consideration of those

appeals until we've been able to get a

judgment from the Alberta appeal court

that considers the unique fact pattern

here in Alberta quite frankly I know

that Justin Trudeau is not going to back

up on his policy on that our first

effort was to get a democratic decision

from Canadians that didn't happen on on

the carbon tax yesterday our backup plan

or Plan B is to go and assert our

provincial rights through the courts

that's what we'll be doing on these for

the transplant pipeline just don't need

for it to go back to Parliament or to be

prayer so are you concerned though that

what happened last night I think there's

always been some concern in Alberta that

the federal government is not completely

committed to its completion and one can

imagine a scenario in a minority

Parliament where parties that hold the

balance of power might try to negotiate

their support for confidence measures

such as a budget contingent upon federal

withdrawal from TMX what I'm saying is

that would be totally unacceptable and

if the Prime Minister means what he said

last night about listening to Alberta

and Saskatchewan the clearest way he

could do so would be to unequivocally

commit this new government to the

completion of the pipeline that the

federal government owns I also did raise

with the prime minister during our call

earlier today my hope that we could work

together in pursuing the least partial

sale of that pipeline and I think it

would be a big boost for its a potential

completion if there was at least some

level of Aboriginal financial

participation in the pipeline

we've extended as you know through the

indigenous opportunities corporation the

possibility to facilitate some of that

so the bottom line is this with a lot of

issues on the plate here and a lot of

anger and frustration in Alberta I want

people to keep their eye on the prize

focused on our most important economic

imperative which is the completion of

that pipeline it was a brief

conversation we didn't get into detail

about that well Dean when we first spoke

the day after Alberta's April election I

indicated to the Prime Minister then and

three days later at our in-person

meeting in his Ottawa office that that I

want to find a way to work together and

I've always said it's no secret that I

have been opposed to most of his

policies because I think they heard

Alberta but at the same time I'm a

Democrat and I respect any elected

government and I will seek to work with

any elected government and and that

includes for example I said to him in in

April that we would be willing to be

flexible on the price of our tier levy

the technology innovation and emissions

reduction levy that we would be willing

to to be flexible on for example the

emissions cap on the oil sands if we

could exempt oil sands projects from the

the disastrous new bill c69

and I said generally you know I'm

prepared to to try to find a way forward

with this federal government that I

reiterated that today our approach is

not to be dogmatic our approaches to

defend our vital economic interests and

that may require some give-and-take with

the federal government I would also

point out that

to the Prime Minister that on many of

the issues I've spoken about we have the

support of all our most of the provinces

at nine of ten opposed to bill C 69

several problems as opposed to the

application of the carbon tax nine of

ten provinces in favor of energy and

resource corridors including oil and gas

pipelines so you know it together with

trying to have taken a constructive role

with Ottawa we've also tried to build a

pan-canadian coalition that reflects our

interests well III guess I would say the

flexibility is in our implementation of

the levy on major emitters which will

capture over half of the emissions from

the Alberta economy Justin Trudeau and I

disagree about the utility of punishing

seniors for heating their homes and

people driving to work I just do not

think that is effective environmental

policy and and albertans spoke very

clearly on that last April so but you

know I would on this point Dean I would

say like the the the carbon the the the

levy on major emitters through the

tirtir levy is a very significant piece

and we'll be setting that at $30 which

is where the federal government wants us

to be in 2020 and we are actually

working very closely with the federal

Department of the Environment on the

technical application of the tier levy

to industrial emitters so there actually

is a fair degree of cooperation there

but we will not see eye to eye when it

comes to punishing people for heating

their homes I would remind you that

premier Pallister and the Manitoba

government tried they were actually

committed to a retail carbon tax they

didn't agree on the price point and they

couldn't find any flexibility from the

Trudeau government which was unfortunate

or rework well we we did I mean we this

was part of our platform and we've

expressed this consistently I've raised

it with the Prime Minister

before and the position of Alberta is

well-known on this that we believe the

equalization formula is fundamentally

unfair but but let me point something

out here

first of all of the twenty billion

dollar net annual contribution that

Albertans make to the rest of the

Federation through their federal taxes

only about three billion of that is

three equalization that's important you

know why be in part because it's

insulting to us that we have to

subsidize provinces that choose not to

develop their own resources with the

resources that we develop we think

that's that's a perverse incentive for

other provinces not to develop their

resources and we think it's

fundamentally unfair that it keeps going

up and up there's no ceiling there is a

ceiling on the fiscal stabilization

program there's all sorts of ways in

which equalization is unfair but it's

the entire twenty billion dollars of net

transfers out of this province that as I

say we don't object we don't object to

sharing some of our wealth what we

object to is Ottawa and some provincial

governments expecting us to pay those

bills without allowing us to develop the

wealth to do so so all we're trying to

do is connect the two you want us to pay

the freight in the Federation fine that

helped us to pay the bills by selling

our oil in global markets let's go to

the phones can we wait just one second

all those bones operator can you please

put through the first color just a

couple quick questions one in the

supplementary number one why should

Trudeau listen to Alberta to get

reelected he doesn't need Alberta his

father was able to stay in power without

Alberta and history showed us there's

little likely that the Liberals will

ever ever win a lot of seats in Alberta

and he's got a lot of other things on

his plate dealing with the bloc

québécois and the NDP why why should

turtle even listen to anything the

Alberta government has to say for two

reasons Rick firstly because if the

frustration and alienation in Alberta

continues to mount it will pose a very

serious challenge to national unity

secondly because Alberta plays a

hugely oversized role in national

prosperity and the finances of the

federal government and so if he wants to

strengthen national unity and the

Canadian economy then he needs to listen

to the provinces that produce a

disproportionate amount of the wealth

and the Federation last yesterday

Albertan spoke with a louder voice than

they have ever done in federal electoral

history in fact I believe I haven't been

able to confirm this 100% but to the

best of my knowledge last night was the

single largest mandate for one federal

party in a province since 1867

that is pretty power that's a pretty

powerful statement that was a very

diverse spectrum of Albertans who sent a

powerful message last night and many of

them are saying they don't feel at home

in their own country which i think is

tragic and and so as I said to Prime

Minister Trudeau when we first met in

May of this year in his office

I said Prime Minister that the first

obligation of anybody in your position

is to strengthen national unity but it's

actually being undermined in the

province that has contributed more than

than any other in our modern economic

history so that's why Rick because if

you care about unity and prosperity you

should care about how Alberta's doing

your follow-up serious challenge to

national unity and I agree with you lot

of Albertans are bein poppin serious

today and many of them are talking about

separatism and many are talking about a

nation within a nation and all of that

stuff we've heard that before we heard

that in the in the reign of this

particular prime minister's father why

should why should they even react to to

the possibility of a serious challenge

to national unity when it's not really

at least outwardly as serious a

challenge as when Quebec challenged

national unity and they have a

large separatist movement and a

separatist party and a referendum in a

they almost left I mean why should they

take that seriously why should they not

think that Alberta is just the boy who

cried wolf and that there's lots of them

hangar now there's fury people are

apoplectic in many cases but in the end

it won't it won't matter a lot well Rick

it matters a whole lot to this province

that is essential to national prosperity

when I go and meet the the top financial

leaders of the country on base Street

they are desperately interested in what

is happening to Alberta's economy

because our ability to generate returns

on pensions on on people's life savings

federal revenues all of these things

depend in a very large bedroom what

happens here in this province so I would

hope that no Prime Minister is is as

cynical as you suggest and becomes

disinterested in a huge and growing

share of the population feeling

alienated from the country I would hope

that's not the case but I would I would

equally hope that any federal government

cares that that you know this is the

goose that laid the golden egg in modern

Canadian economic history and this needs

some tending this relationship needs

some some good faith from Ottawa and if

it doesn't get that I I fear that the

alienation is going to go in a very

problematic direction but Rick this is

also why we have built into our platform

commitments some real leverage points

including forcing a serious debate on

the Constitution that I don't think

Justin Trudeau wants to have which is a

full open referendum on equalization two

years from now if we can't get fairness

if we don't get a pipeline built and so

we built things like that in as leverage

and Rick I announced earlier today that

our

government will be launching a panel

made up of eminent Albertans to consult

more broadly on other ideas of how to

get a fair deal in the Federation we are

going to force our fight for a fair deal

onto the national agenda come hell or

high water it's actually Michelle's turn

well to two things first of all an

opportunity for Albertans to express

themselves in their their view of their

role in the Federation in the

particularly in light of this brutal

election when our province was being

targeted for attacks by by federal

parties and secondly to canvass every

idea that's out there about how more

effectively to us to get a fair deal for

Alberta within Canada so there are a

whole lot of ideas that have been

floated about constitutional amendments

non-constitutional approach is a greater

assertion of provincial jurisdiction

many of these ideas go all the way back

to for example ideas that Peter Lougheed

floated in the late 1970s and since then

so are the mandate we will give to this

expert panel will be to look at all of

those ideas and say what would be the

most effective ways to assert fairness

for Alberta in the Federation and to

listen to our burdens in doing so

definitely have public hearings and I I

want to get this going as quickly as

possible I've already spoken to a couple

of very prominent Albertans they're just

checking with their families and

employers to see if they can secure the

time this fall to spend on the road

talking twelve Burton's I would just put

it this way eminent people whose names

you will recognize Tyler so you talked a

second ago over this frustration going

into dark

Prime Minister has a responsibility what

is your responsibility to keep it from

the dark place

well my responsibility is to offer

constructive alternatives and that's

what we're seeking to do we did this in

our platform in the fair deal for

Alberta section which includes a number

of constructive ideas I I think the

solution to frustration that's

expressing itself in separatist

sentiment is a positive ideas about

reforming the Federation for a fair deal

for Alberta and that's what we're

focused on doing that's what we have

been doing very well first of all it's

an emotional one

because I really believe at heart most

Albertans are patriots and we've we've

had a higher number of young Albertans

enroll in our military at times of

crisis and we're we are proud of what

we've done together is Canadian secondly

I would say that we should not let

Justin Trudeau and his policies make us

feel unwelcome in our own country and

thirdly I would say we have allies

across Canada we have provincial

governments who have got our back on a

number of these issues including a fair

deal for a resource sector and our and

our oil and gas workers so we're not

isolated we're not alone

people shouldn't draw that conclusion

from last night we have we have as I say

not attend provincial governments that

say they're for oil and gas pipeline

corridors across the country they're

against bill c69 so those three points

first of all an emotional attachment to

this country secondly we shouldn't let

Justin Trudeau make us feel unwelcome

thirdly we have allies and fourthly my

view is this it doesn't land locking

ourselves through separation is not a

solution to the problem of a campaign to

land lock Alberta the green left has

been leading a campaign to land lock our

energy why would we give them what they

want by land locking Alberta within

North America as a jurisdiction that has

no argument for access to co2 to our

coasts or for that matter a jurisdiction

that would fall out of Daft

so I just think from an Alberta it

doesn't make for me it's not it doesn't

accord to my own emotional attachment

I'm not gonna let sure to push me out of

my country

we've got allies across the country and

we're not going to get one inch closer

to a pipeline by closing in on ourselves

as a landlocked jurisdiction well I

think they did a lot that was right they

picked up 26 seats they won the popular

vote they won seats in every region of

the country and uh I think Andrew

performed it commendably both before and

during this election under an

unbelievably vicious attacks I think you

know there's always a challenge for a

new opposition leader especially at the

federal level to become known and now

he's had a chance I think to demonstrate

that he's capable and even-tempered and

likable and and now he has a chance to

build on the progress that he thought he

has made I think you know if you look at

last night's result it's clear that

there was a particular challenge in the

seats around the metro toronto area so

if I were to give you any of any advice

it's a it's up it's fairly obvious

advice it's to focus on on working hard

in those areas of particularly amongst

the new Canadian communities with whom I

spend so much time over over 10 or 15

years in federal politics

I truly believe those new Canadians are

naturally conservative in their values

and aspirations their belief in Economic

Opportunity low taxes strong families

law and order and immigration reform as

well as well as strong immigration

policies that ensure fairness in the

system I'm not sure that the federal

conservatives always got that message

out and they just need to redouble their

effort to do so but but listen that was

you know let's put this in perspective

mr. Trudeau is forming a government with

a low

level of popular vote of any government

majority minority in Canadian history

since 1867 Mr Shearer won the popular

vote that in itself is is is an

important achievement and it's certainly

a base upon which to build think it

would be a big mistake

I think parties that that do that are

very short-sighted I think Andrew has

earned the trust of Canadian

conservatives and certainly the right to

contest the next election he's grown as

a leader as a man under enormous

pressure that is something of great

value when it comes to running in a

brutal federal election environment and

so I can just tell you this Andrew

Shearer is a good friend of mine and he

has my unequivocal support in staying on

his conservative leader and I believe

that most Alberta conservatives feel

that way let's go back to the phone

hang on Kieren well I was never going to

do it full-time obviously I've got a

full-time job here but I did pitch in

when they requested and certainly shared

the views of Albertans and what can I

say

last night 1.5 million Albertans voted

for the federal conservatives election

33 of 34 MPs nearly 70% of the vote I

think that demonstrates that what I have

been saying about the views of Albertans

bears out as having I mean you don't 70%

is just about as close as you get to

unanimity in a first past the post

electoral system that is an massive

majority and I think it confirms that

albertans are behind what our government

has been saying about the need for

fairness in the Federation let's go back

to the phones operator can you please

put through the next color I think I

heard you say that how you would there

would be public hearings I just wonder

how you keep the lid on or even if you

want I'm just watching the

comments go by the chats go by on your

Twitter feed yeah that's running pretty

hot you haven't even started yet I'm

just wondering how you how you handle

the prospect of these becoming very

emotional almost pro-separatist rallies

do you plan to just invite the public or

do you that's absolutely do this yes Don

these will be wide open public town

halls and you know what for exactly that

reason there's two approaches that

leaders can take in an environment like

this in Alberta today one would be to

dismiss and ridicule the sentiment of

frustration that is palpable and refuse

to listen to those people that is the

worst mistake possible that would just I

think create even more frustration

the other alternative done is to

actually listen to people and respect

what they have to say and I think that

is the much wiser approach and so that's

exactly why we'll be appointing this

panel because I sense you know don't let

me be blunt about this there are a lot

of people who might be characterized as

the Laurentian elites or certain opinion

elites who don't take that sentiment

seriously but they should and so the

hearings that we will hold will be an

opportunity for people to speak out and

I do expect to hear a lot of frustration

and people have a bloody right to be

frustrated in this province Don they

have every right there are people look

there are people who have lost their

homes lost their jobs their families

that have broken up we've seen it as the

University of Calgary confirmed last

month a spike in suicides in Alberta in

the past four years this has had very

real real-life consequences on people

and we must give at those frustrated

Albertans

an opportunity to speak their minds

Donna I have heard from not you know the

people who I'd never expected to who

would have characterized themselves

before his political moderates talking

to me in the

last 24 hours about separation now I

don't know how many of those people are

just finding that language is a way to

blow off steam and articulate their

frustration but we we darn well better

get to the bottom of it and listen to

people with respect and that's what we

intend to do a follow up to that bomb

on an equal per capita basis it's not

about I hope it can it never becomes

about some sort of like Banana Republic

divide the spoils you know kind of

system so whatever whatever programs the

Fed but what we will be demanding I got

to say as part of our fight for a fair

deal is to the greatest extent possible

moving from federal cash transfers to a

tax point transfers for areas that are

within provincial jurisdiction because

we think that's a smarter and fairer way

of allocating federal support for policy

areas that are within provincial

jurisdiction and that's something where

we are aligned with Quebec for example

your relationship with mr. Trudeau you

being very outspoken of course before

the campaign will not lay Trudeau

Alliance fighting and trying to defeat

mr. Trudeau not you have to work with

him it's still your intention to trying

to feed him because we're a minority

government situation they don't last

very long and you have two years you're

thinking that it won't last

well I don't know I I don't think any

preferable party's going to be in a rush

for a second election a gram a second on

but on your main question look in

politics you have vigorous disagreements

and then you try to get things done mr.

Singh

has spent the last 18 months trying to

defeat Justin Trudeau but now he'll be

presumably working with them in this

Parliament and then trying to defeat him

in the next election so you know this is

democratic politics where you make your

case you respect the results and then

you try to serve the public as best you

can and my job is to serve the public of

Alberta who clearly agreed with me that

mr. Trudeau and his policies were

damaging his province I think yesterday

was a massive confirmation of the

critique that I have been making about

this federal administration for the past

three years it was a huge confirmation

of that so I feel actually I feel

validated by what Alberta voters said

with their ballots yesterday Graham it

looks to me like about two-thirds of the

provincial NDP vote migrated to the

federal Conservatives yesterday they

went from 32% in provincial election to

11% yesterday this is a big coalition

that I think agreed with my take on this

federal government still in power well

that is why I've been very purposefully

trying to build a pan Canadian coalition

of like-minded provinces I've been

attacked by the NDP for spending a bit

of time outside the province but there's

a reason why I've been to virtually

every provincial capital there's there's

a reason why I've spent a lot of time

trying to we hosted that Stampede

premiers me we've done other things to

identify a common interest that were

expressed at the western premiers

conference at the Council of the

Federation at this of these court

challenges that we're we're supporting

one another so I would say to all burns

we are not isolated to the contrary on

most of these issues that matter to us

we have most of the provincial

governments onside and that is

meaningful and and and and I'll go step

further Graeme and say that you know I'm

a bit of a student of history and I

observe very closely in retrospect I was

just a kid at the back in the day how

Peter Lougheed dealt with a different

very problematic sure Doan astray ssin

on many similar issues and one way was

precisely to for Alberta to play

it's its historic role as a leader

amongst the provinces I think we're

doing that again

and I'll be on the phone throughout the

balance of the day with a number of by

provincial pre premier colleagues on

exactly that you know island of orange

in the sea of blue in some ways a

microcosm reverse what do you say to

those voters and those people who might

kind of feel like maybe they are the

ones who are ended well as I understand

it even the NDP newly elected NDP MLA

dammit in Strathcona I ran on a pro

pipeline platform so I think you've got

34 for 34 Alberta MPs who agree the

trans mountain should be built who agree

who are opposed to C 69 I wish her luck

in her federal caucus because I don't

think she's going to find any

sympathetic years there based on the

intemperate views of jagged meat sing on

these questions so I'm not sure I think

if those people were really the voters

in Edmonton Strathcona felt dramatically

differently than Albertans on these

issues they would have elected a green

MP as opposed to a net new Democrat who

says that they support pipelines and

with that it's been half an hour I've

got a chair cabinet meeting thanks very

much

okay
