good morning good evening

and good afternoon hello and welcome

everybody to the world health

organization

press briefing on covet 19. we have uh

with us as always the who director

general dr ted ross

also dr mike ryan executive director of

our emergencies program

and dr maria van keckhoff technical lead

for covin 19.

dr ted ross will begin with an update

and then when dr tedros has finished his

opening remarks

i will open the meeting to questions if

you've connected via zoom

please raise use the raise your hand

icon to get into the queue to ask your

question

if you've connected by phone please hit

nine

on your keypad to indicate that you want

to ask the question

i'm going to apologize right now to all

those who miss out we have

more than 260 people on the line already

connecting and asking questions so we

have to

restrict this briefing to an hour so

that our speakers

who are all leading the response can get

back to the many other demands on their

time

i will now hand over to dr ted ross

thank you thank you margaret good

morning

good afternoon and good evening wherever

you are

the pandemic continues to take a massive

toll not just on health

but on so many parts of life

yesterday the government of japan

and the international olympic committee

took a difficult but wise decision

to postpone this year's olympic and para

olympic

games i thank prime minister abe

and the members of the ioc for making

the sacrifice to protect the health of

athletes spectators and officials

we look forward to next year's olympics

and para olympics

which we hope will be an even bigger

and better celebration of our shared

humanity

and look forward to join we have

overcome

many pandemics and crisis before

we will overcome this one too the

question is

how large a price we will pay

already we have lost more than

sixteen thousand lives

we know we will lose more

how many more will be determined by the

decisions we make

and the actions we take now

to slow the spread of covet 19

many countries have contributed or intri

introduced unprecedented measures

at significant social and economy cost

closing schools and businesses

counseling sporting events and asking

people to stay home

and stay safe we understand that these

countries

are now trying to assess when

and how they will be able to ease

these measures the answer depends

on what countries do while these

population-wide

measures are in place asking people to

stay

at home and shutting down population

movement

is buying time and reducing the pressure

on health systems but on their own

these measures will not extinguish

epidemics the point

of this actions is to enable the more

precise

and targeted measures that are needed

to stop transmission and save lives

we call on all countries who have

introduced so-called

to use

you have created a second window of

opportunity

the question is how will you use it

there are six key actions

that we recommend first

expand train and deploy

your health care and public health

workforce and second

implement a system to find

every suspected case at community

level third ramp

our production capacity and availability

of testing fourth

identify adapt and equip facilities

you will use to treat and isolate

patients

fifth develop a clear plan and process

to quarantine contacts and finally

number six

refocus the whole of government

on suppressing and controlling covet 19.

these measures are the best way to

suppress

and stop transmission so that when

restrictions are lifted

the virus doesn't resurge

the last thing any country needs is to

open schools and

businesses only to be forced to close

them again because of a resurgence

aggressive measures to find isolate test

treat and trace are not only the best

and fastest way out of

extreme social and economic restrictions

they are also the best way to prevent

them

more than 150 countries and territories

still have

fewer than 100 cases

by taking the same aggressive actions

now

these countries have the chance to

prevent community transmission

and avoid some of the more severe

social and economy costs seen in other

countries this is specially relevant

for many vulnerable countries whose

health systems may collapse under the

weight of the numbers of patients we

have seen

in some countries with community

transmission

today i joined united nations secretary

general

antonio guterres under secretary general

for un ocha

mark lowcock and unicef executive

director

henrietta ford to launch the global

humanitarian appeal

to support the most fragile countries

who have already suffered

years of acute humanitarian

crisis this is much more than

health crisis and we're committed

working as one u.n to protect the

world's most vulnerable

people from the virus and its

consequences we also welcome the

secretary general's call for a global

ceasefire

we are all facing a common threat and

the only way to defeat it is

by coming together as one humanity

because we're one

one human race we're grateful

to the more than 200 000 individuals

and organizations who have contributed

to the coveted 19 solidarity response

fund

since we launched it less than two weeks

ago

the fund has raised more than 95

million u.s dollars

i would like to offer my deep thanks to

gsk

for its generous contributions of 10

million us dollars today

although we're especially concerned

about vulnerable countries

all countries have vulnerable

populations

including older people

older people carry the collective wisdom

of our societies

they're valued and valuable members of

our

families and communities

but they're at higher risk of the more

serious complications of covet 19.

we're listening to older people and

those who work

with and for them to identify

how best we can support them

we need to work together to protect

older people

from the virus and to ensure their needs

are being met for food fuel

prescription medication and human

interaction physical distance

doesn't mean social distance

we all need to check in regularly on

older parents

neighbors friends or relatives who live

alone

or in care homes in whatever way is

possible

so they know how much they are loved

and valued all of these things are

important at any time

but they're even more important during a

crisis

finally the coveted 19 pandemic has

highlighted

the need for compelling and creative

communications about public health

last year who announced our first

held for all film festival

the volume quality and diversity of

interest

far surpassed our expectations

we received more than 1 300

entries from 110 countries

and today we're announcing a short list

of 45

excellent short films about vital health

topics

we're also announcing a distinguished

panel of

jurors who will judge the shortlist

with the winners to be announced in may

we will be showing all the shortlisted

films in the coming weeks

on our website and social media channels

in this difficult times film

and other media are a powerful way

not only of communicating important

health messages

but of administering one of the most

powerful medicines

hope i thank you

thank you dr tedros we'll now open the

floor to questions

as i mentioned before a little

housekeeping if you've connected by a

zoom

please use the raise your hand icon to

get in the queue

if you've connected by a phone please

hit

nine on your keypad please restrict your

questions to one question

please try to keep them as short as

possible because there are so many

people

who need to ask their question

in fact we had so many questions left

over from monday

i'm now going to read a question from

simon attaba

because he has been waiting i think

three times to ask this question

i cannot see him in the queue so i'll

read it out for you simon

simon i hope if you're there on twitter

you can hear this question

so this is from simon o'tabor from today

news

africa simon asks dr tedros

the coronavirus pandemic is fast

spreading across

africa and is threatening to overwhelm

our weak healthcare system

the center for global development in

washington dc

is warning that if developed countries

do not support africa today

this pandemic will not be defeated what

type of

concrete assistance can who drive

to assist africa now before it's too

late

i can begin and i'm sure that traders

will supplement

who has country offices in

in every country in africa and our

country representatives and the teams

there have been supporting countries for

many many years

in addition to that our regional

director dr muetti

has urged many many staff from the

regional office and teams to support

countries and allow

better support to be provided in

planning we've supported the process

of national action planning sent ppe

sent and dispatched lab tests we've

worked with the africa cdc to train lab

technicians from all over africa

and we're currently working on

increasing all of the capacities in

surveillance

in clinical management and trying to

work to

provide more support in terms of supply

chains it's a challenging

situation for all countries in africa

and the international community

uh i think uh and for all countries of

the south

and and low and middle-income countries

need support

and the north must while dealing with a

massive crisis in its own regard

must move to protect the south because

nobody is safe until we are all safe

thank you so much thank you mike um

the number of cases in sub-saharan

africa

is around around 1 600 as we speak

and if you take the number of cases

this is actually an opportunity to use

the six

recommendations i just made

meaning to be able to cut it from the

bud

they can test they can isolate

quarantine

cases while still the number of cases

is is low so the first thing is

um they should believe that this thing

is in their hands

they can do something to to stop it as

early as

as possible but then of course

we have global responsibility as

as humanity and especially

those countries like the g20 we will

have the g20

summit tomorrow they should be able

to support countries

all over the world not only from

sub-saharan africa

but all over the world were low income

or middle-income

countries because it's only through

solidarity

that we can support those countries

from wh side we have started

as as early as possible to support

countries

by providing test kits and we have

provided already test kits to

more than 120 countries and a good

number of them are from

the african continent and also ppe to 68

countries

and most of these countries are from

from from

africa and who will continue

to support countries who need our

support

and we are negotiating with many

stakeholders to build up

our especially logistics capacity

to continue to supporting countries as

we have been

doing

thank you dr tedros the next question is

from jamil

from brazil somebody else who's also had

been waiting to ask his question for

about a week

please go ahead jamie yes mr terrorists

this is jamil schade from uol

in banderance tv um my question is again

on president bolsonaro and apologize for

insisting on this

but uh his remarks uh last night and

over the next

the last days are they actually putting

the lives of brazilians

at risk would you ask him to change his

position

and take responsibility thank you so

much sir

um i i think we've

we've spoken on on on this issue and

issues

like this before we we trust that all

governments will

take the appropriate actions that

that manage the public health risks here

that which are real

but we also understand the terrible

dilemmas that countries face

in protecting economies and social

systems but

we must focus first on trying to stop

this disease

and stay saving lives

so um it it may be just

repeating what i i said but our advice

to all countries is of course many

countries are already taking

community wide actions

closing schools restricting

movement and asking

citizens to stay at home and

all possibilities to

have physical distancing

that's very important but at the same

time

we have proposed six actions

and that will also apply to

any country and that's what we said

um there are countries 150 countries

with that

with less than 100 cases

and they have to be very serious

actually at this

stage when they have less number of

cases

and the first thing they should do is

they should expand

train and deploy their health workers

health care and also public health

workforce

and they should implement a system-wide

approach to find suspected cases

at community level and this is for all

countries even

countries with no cases we have some

countries who have not reported cases

and we we even suggested that countries

should

actually ramp up production and

capacity and availability to do

more testing and the

fourth recommendation we made is

identify

adapt and equip facilities we have to

prepare actually the facilities because

for any eventualities

in some countries the number of

cases have really jumped and overwhelmed

the system

and they were not prepared so it was

very difficult to give service to

patients who are coming to the hospitals

to get service

so preparing the system is

very important for any country including

those countries who haven't reported

cases or

countries who have reported less than 10

cases or countries who have reported

less than 100 cases or more than 100

cases or 1 000 cases

and cases

confirmed cases should also be isolated

and this is

the same recommendation for for every

country

and the other very important

recommendation we have made is

we need to have a whole of government

approach

because this pandemic cannot be arrested

by just the health sector alone

we need to have all relevant sectors

working together to suppress and control

this pandemic

and not only the whole government

approach we are also saying

we need the trust of the community and

communities should be mobilized

to do their share because this is

everybody sit business and

every citizen has a responsibility to

take

part so these are our recommendations

which we believe

apply to all countries this virus is

very dangerous and we have already

counted more than sixteen thousand days

if you remember we have been saying for

more than

two months now this is this virus is

public enemy number one

it's a dangerous virus and we have been

saying to the world that the window of

opportunity is narrowing and

the time to act was actually more than a

month ago or two months ago

that's what we have been saying but we

still believe that there is opportunity

i think we squander the first window of

opportunity but we are saying today in

my

message i made it clear that this is a

second opportunity

which we should not squander

and do everything to suppress and

control this virus

and this is a responsibility for all of

us

especially the political leadership is

key

and it has to be able to communicate to

mobilize

communities also to take ownership

and do the right things to suppress and

control this pandemic

thank you very much dr tedros now we'll

move to

italy we have dewelio diamia maria

from rai italian public tv

leo are you there

duilio can you hear us are you there

please go

yes

[Music]

that's bad feedback do we

try and say your question again if not

i'll read it out because i

do have some text on your question

it sounds like we can't hear i'll read

out your question julio

duilio wanted to know uh what who

thinks about testing and active

surveillance in italy

at this stage what should italy be doing

in terms of

testing and active surveillance

i think our italian colleagues and we

actually

spoke with our italian colleagues today

we have a very

senior member of our staff currently

embedded

in italy and providing high-level inputs

and advice

and our regional director hans kluge is

also in constant contact with the

ministry of health

easily is breaking down its problem uh

it's looked at each and every single one

of its provinces

uh and trying to to look at those

provinces in terms of where they are

um i think many of you will have seen

tony fauci and others speak about this

in the us we need to start looking at

the data we need to start breaking the

problem down

you can't look at a whole country as one

entity you break the problem down

you look at your local geographies you

see what the situation is in each and

every administrative level

and then you decide what the best

tactics are there are some parts

obviously where transmission is very

intense and it's very difficult to get a

handle on testing all cases on doing

contact tracing

there's a real attempt to save life at

this point and the lockdown measures are

there

in order to try and suppress infection

but there are parts of italy in which

transmission is not that intense

and where there's a real possibility of

avoiding the worst

that has happened in many of the parts

of northern italy

so i believe that our italian colleagues

are trying to

scale up as the director general has

just said train the workforce train

public health workers

get out and do community detection to

detect suspect cases

to isolate suspect cases to trace

contacts but we fully understand

that in certain areas right in the

center

epicenters it is difficult to do that

when you're dealing with the heavy wave

and dealing with the health system under

huge

pressure so uh we really do admire our

colleagues

in italy uh they're heroes

they're putting up a courageous fight

against this virus

on behalf of their own people on behalf

of the world

and we like and support the way they're

breaking the problem down

they're working their way through the

problem and we will do everything in our

power and the world health organization

to support them

and their efforts

thanks if i could just supplement what

mike has said um

beyond italy i think there are many many

countries that are

looking at the situation that they're in

the transmission situation that they're

in and

the situation seems completely

overwhelming

and that testing with us saying test

and how important that is as part of

this comprehensive package is

is a fundamental aspect that needs to be

enhanced and we hear you we we are on

the phone with our colleagues every day

who say to us this this seems impossible

this is not something that we can do how

what what should we do

we've been very clear that it's it's

critical that you test to find where

this virus is so you know where you're

fighting it

to find all of your suspect cases test

those suspect cases

find those contacts test those contacts

who develop symptoms

and by doing so you are able to actually

break down those chains of transmission

but when the situation is such that you

have community-wide transmission and

there are some areas of very large

outbreaks

there's ways in which you may need to

prioritize some of those actions so that

you could break down the problem like

mike has just said

find those boundaries of where that big

outbreak is so that you could bring it

more under control and in taking those

temporary making those tough decisions

temporarily

will help you bring you back to being

able to actually find all those suspect

cases

as the director general has said these

so-called lockdown measures that many

countries have implemented

and more and more we're hearing about

countries implementing these so-called

lockdown measures

this is buying you a little bit of time

and that time

needs to be used appropriately

and that time must be used to

build up again your work forces to be

able to find those cases

to be able to break down a much larger

problem into something that becomes more

manageable

we have guidance that we have on our

website

which works through with you with all

countries

which transmission scenario you may be

in outlines

some of the considerations that you may

need to take if you're in

clusters large clusters of cases or if

you're in community transmission

with the overall aim of bringing you

back from community level transmission

to clusterings of cases down to

individual chains of transmission

so that that transmission can be

suppressed and you can bring those

outbreaks under control

we hear you we understand that this is

overwhelming in many cases but there are

things that you can do to suppress

and slow transmission and save lives

i just uh two lines

um you know the commitment of the

italian government

is really really incredible and we we

can see on the ground how it's moving

now

and not only that the cooperation from

the citizens of the country from italy

is also

amazing and i think

this will bring result and that's what

who believes and as mike said

we will do everything the to support

and there are some good signals now

we had a discussion with some of the

senior experts from

italy today and we hope this positive

signal and progress

will continue but i

am really happy to see

that italy is doing all it can

thank you dr tedros the next is from

catherine

fiancan bakongo bakonga

sorry catherine catherine can you hear

me

yes do you hear me yes please go ahead

okay good afternoon dr tedros

mike and maria my question

is relating the testing

as people and most of the countries are

saying that conventional equipment is

not available does who

advise them to turn to tech as

an innovation as south korea is doing

by using interactive websites

apps that permits self-diagnosis

backtrack movements of infected persons

and for that are you actively

collaborating with itu if it's the case

could you please elaborate a bit

on that thank you

yes i would say this is probably the

the first epidemic of the pandemic of

the 21st century in which the

the full power of information technology

social media artificial intelligence

is being applied to almost every aspect

of this response

both in terms of risk communication with

communities and targeting information

and avoiding misinformation encountering

misinformation and that's probably been

one of the most

powerful uses of information technology

in this response and we thank

all of those agencies both public and

private

who have joined with us and with our

partners to to really enhance

the way in which we can communicate the

best information to people

beyond that there are a huge number of

collaborations around

surveillance applications modeling

predictive modeling analytics in

decision support tools and many of these

other applications and

[Music]

korea china itself

and other countries have developed apps

that have supported them in case

detection case reporting

um uh case follow-up tracking tracing

and many other things and we ourselves

have uh deployed our godata platform

which is a platform for contact tracing

and follow-up and linking to lab results

to over 50

countries now and there are other i.t

applications like epidemic intelligence

from open sources which we use we've

built that over the last five years

with a consortium of international

partners which tracks

electronic information in multiple

languages from all over the world using

ai engines and it allows us to stay one

step ahead

in terms of information around the virus

and other epidemics around the world

we are working with the itu our chief

information officer bernardo mariano

is coordinating a huge partnership

across the world with many institutions

including the itu

to develop the best possible solutions

there is a tremendous amount of

innovation a huge amount of enthusiasm

but we need to turn that innovation and

enthusiasm in a really structured way

into products that work for frontline

workers that work for frontline systems

and that's what we're in the process of

doing now

we do always have to have in the back of

our minds especially when it comes to

collecting information

on individual citizens or tracking their

whereabouts or movements

that there are always very serious data

protection

uh human rights and and principles that

are involved and

we're very very cognizant of that and we

want to ensure

that all products that are developed are

done in the most

sensitive way possible and that we

never step beyond the the principles

of individual freedoms rights

for for individuals and and for society

but

yes there are tremendous amount of

collaborations ongoing

i could probably speak about this for a

lot longer

um and maybe maria might want to speak

about the modeling work and predictive

analytics and other work that we're

doing specifically but again i would

just like to thank our partners from all

over the world

and the power of innovation the power of

ideas

and we've had ideas for apps from people

as young as 14 or 15

from individuals from small startup

companies from huge

globally based companies it's been

the most outstanding uh and most amazing

outpouring of support and collaboration

that i have seen in my career

and just add a couple of things what

we've seen particularly in this pandemic

but we've seen in other epidemics you

know the use of telemedicine

so many people who need care who can't

go to

hospitals right now or can't go to their

regular routine appointments are

utilizing telemedicine and having

interactive chats and conversations with

their

with their doctors so that they continue

to have care

from the comfort of their home without

having to go into a health care facility

and we're seeing the application of that

across many different types of medicine

we're seeing innovative ways in which

children

and university students can continue

their education even though we have a

large number of children

and young adults who are out of school

right now because of this pandemic

there's interactive ways in which

they're continuing their education

and learning through this pandemic even

if they're not physically in school

we see interactive ways in which

technology is helping us do trainings

where we can't do face-to-face trainings

um because we're not able to move around

the globe we're finding ways in which we

can

provide these materials either online

through our open who platform

where we have more than half a million

people up to 600

000 people who've enrolled in our

courses in more than

two dozen languages but we're also using

technology to find more interactive ways

to have

one-on-one conversations with those

frontline workers to answer

and work through some of those very

difficult questions that they may be

having

as they treat patients or care for

patients or set up

treatment units et cetera and

we're also using technology in many

different ways for these predictive

analytics that mike has mentioned

we work with a large number of modelers

you've heard me say this before

to work through scenarios to work

through predictions

um but of course these predictions are

not realities and so

what is important that is that we take

all of these measures that we've been

outlining

from the start to make sure those

predictions do not become realities

and lastly technology and i.t

and apps have completely changed the way

we think of

social distancing we're saying physical

distancing now because we're actually

talking about

separating physically people but keeping

them socially connected

and we have ways in which we can do this

now like we've never had before

so we keep people connected so that they

feel that they're still part of this and

we're all in this fight together

even while keeping them physically apart

thank you very much dr van kerkov

the next question is for from ankit

kumar from

india today but before ankit comes on

i'd like to

remind everybody to use the raise your

hand icon

and to apologize for saying hash9 it's

star9

on your keypad for your telephone ankit

are you there can you go ahead with your

question

thank you margaret uh good evening

everyone my name is ankit umar

i represent india today and ask doug

in india there is three weeks long

lockdown

which means 1.3 billion people are

currently inside their homes right now

but we keep hearing about a possible

second and a third possible wave

of outbreak in near future a country

like india cannot afford many such

lockdowns

after this one ends what is wso's best

advice to indian policy makers what they

must do

during this lockdown to ensure that

there isn't an outbreak

and such a lockdown again in near future

also if you could please tell us

how far are we from a possible vaccine

or a medicine thank you very much

thank you mr kumara your question

is uh a very good one and i think the

director general

uh uh answered that question

very much uh in his in his address

and he mentioned the the six things that

every country needs to do to use this

window of opportunity

and as i've said in previous uh in

previous press conferences india has

incredible capacities

to leverage accelerate and expand its

capacity

but it must do the things it must it you

must have a system to find cases

you must test you must have expand your

capacity to treat and isolate

you must be able to quarantine your

contacts and

you must bring in all of government

approach to the response

and if those things are put in place

and and i know they are being put in

place but if we can accelerate that

and india is a vast country you could

never look at india

just as one single entity from an

epidemiological perspective and

if you remember those of you who in

india

who were involved in the process india

got rid of polio by breaking it right

down

india got rid of polio by breaking it

down to the village level

all the way through the system it broke

down the problem

it went after the polio virus district

by district

by district by district and india one

if india does the same thing breaks down

the problem puts in place the measures

that are needed

both surveillance and healthcare

measures and does that systematically

then there is a way out there is a

transition

from lockdowns into

a public health-driven response in which

people don't have to stay locked in

their homes for more time than is

absolutely necessary

without implementing the necessary

measures and without putting in place

those protections

it's going to be very difficult for

countries to exit and when they do they

may have resurgence

and i think that's the challenge now we

have time

very little as the director general said

a second

but small window opportunity what

countries do

today tomorrow the next day is what's

going to matter

if i could add to that so we we have

seen countries that have gone through

these so-called lockdowns have gone

through these public health measures and

distancing measures

and we need to learn from from all of

these countries who have applied these

measures at different levels of

intensity

we know what measures were taken in

china

and in particular in wuhan and in hubei

and we know that we these measures are

being lifted now

and the reason that they can be lifted

is because these systems are in place to

actually

quickly identify and isolate any cases

that are ident that that pop up and now

what we're seeing in china is we're not

seeing cases

indigenous cases cases that are being

locally transmitted we're seeing new

importations

there are more importations that are

going to china than are than are

actually being detected from local

transmission we haven't had local

transmission i think in a number of days

now

but what we my point is bringing up

china is saying

they have looked at a staggering

approach of lifting these measures

it wasn't all at once across the whole

country

um and in different parts of the country

they applied

different intensities of levels of these

measures so it wasn't a total lockdown

in all places across china

we know in singapore they used different

approach they did have some application

of

social distancing or physical distancing

measures but they didn't close their

schools and so it's really important for

us to take the examples of all of these

countries

and look in detail about what they did

as it relates to the epidemiology in

their country and learn from them

and we are doing that now we are taking

very detailed looks at what every

country is doing

what countries have done and the levels

of success that they have had

so again we can come back and say these

are the things that really

have worked we know the things that

we're telling you these are the things

that work

we know that they're incredibly

difficult but what we don't want is to

get into a situation where you have

a lockdown then you lift it then you

have a resurgence and then you have a

lockdown and you have this endless cycle

we need to break that cycle so that

these measures that are put in place are

temporary

and we know that these are incredibly

difficult and we we thank you

for for playing your individual part in

this outbreak

but we know that these things work they

are temporary we will get through this

but those measures to find those cases

isolate those cases find and quarantine

your contacts

treating patients who require treatment

is really really critical

and i think for

india with

606 cases i have already outlined the

six

steps doing that now

will help india to stop from

you know the virus spreading to more

places

or you know getting getting bigger

and as mike said india has the

capacity and it's very important and

good to see

that india is taking early measures

and this will help you to

suppress and control it as as

soon as possible before it gets

serious so

it's very important like what's

happening now india which we really

comment

to cut it from the bud when you only

have 606

cases only

thank you dr ted ross we now have

camilla from

the financial times a question from

camilla camilla

are you on the line hi yeah can you hear

me

yes please go ahead i'd like to take my

question

um the dj has taught before about

possible risks to

essential medical supply chains um are

there any specific products or regions

or parts of the supply chain

that are under particular strain at the

moment

hi there yeah i i think you'd have to

say that all

um all uh elements of the supply chain

for many many different products are

under

extreme strain at the moment that's from

raw materials through to production

distribution and delivery

and there are different reasons driving

some of that

production in some cases for example

a lot of the rubber that that's used to

produce rubber gloves is produced in a

very small number of countries

if those countries have difficulties in

their general supply chain or

have a problem of pushing things into

the international market then the place

that makes the globes

may have a difficulty in actually making

the gloves not because they lack the

production capacity but they lack the

raw material so there are problems

in the supply chain all along that chain

the the simple

issue is demand because our current

production of

protective equipment and ventilators was

obviously

pretty adequate to meet global demand

before this event began

but unfortunately the world has not been

is not ready for a pandemic

and then not being ready we don't have

the security stockpiles in place

that are immediately deployable in order

to

scale up our capacity to protect our

frontline health workers and others

there are shortages of ppe shortages of

ventilators

and and other products that are

for the for the medical response to

covet

we also have to avoid shortages in other

medical supplies

as supply chains come under come under

strain

and that may be because of secondary

effects of the virus which is the

shutting down of

air corridors cancellation of flights

all around the world

many of passenger flights around the

world also carry cargo

difficulties in shipping and shipping

even cargo shipping

with crews are finding it some shipping

agents

are finding it hard to move materials

around the world so there's

strain on the whole system we're working

very very closely

uh the director general is uh in even

after uh the the launch of the

humanitarian appeal had a further

uh uh very uh uh fruitful

discussions with the secretary general

on on

dealing with this issue and and the huge

commitment of the un system

to do everything possible together under

under director general's leadership

to improve scale up and deliver

to the extent possible the essential

supplies that help workers

and frontline workers need around the

world in terms of

ppe ventilators and and other supplies

and there's been a huge scaling up of

that capacity

and we will make further announcements

in the coming days

of further scale ups in that capacity to

deliver

but what we also need is a ramp up in

production

and a ramp up in funding for that

material and

i believe the directory general he may

speak to this will be raising this issue

very much at the g20 leaders meeting uh

tomorrow

and if i could just add that you know

it's mike has outlined

what we're doing to address this problem

and how we're working with so many

different partners but

we need to be clear the the world is

facing a

significant shortage of ppe for our

frontline workers

including masks and gloves and gowns and

face shields

and protecting our health care workers

must be the top priority

for the use of this ppe we're working

with technical partners across the globe

to identify ways in which we can manage

this current shortage while we try to

find solutions

but some of these options are not ideal

and this is not acceptable

so we have to all play our part to make

sure that we prioritize the use of ppe

we use ppe appropriately and that is for

our frontline workers who are caring for

patients

thank you very much dr van kerkov we now

have a question

from vera ochiango from my apologies

vera if i've got your name wrong

from nation media africa vera are you

on the line yes i'm on the line can you

hear me

yes very well please go ahead

all right so i'm just gonna rush through

it i would like to know in the modeling

that

uh you guys have done and i've talked

about i'm not very good in statistics

is there any um indication of how this

thing may affect

african countries and just quickly on

top of that

we have the africa cdc and i would like

to

a comment from the director general how

they plan to support it uh it was being

funded by the au

but the last time i talked to the deputy

director

money seems to be drying out there and

the work that they're doing now

is very critical given the health

systems that we have in africa very

fragile

thank you

so i get started and mike uh i will

we'll supplement so i can start on the

first part of that with the questions

about

the the the use of mathematical models

to look at what may happen

so we are working with a number of

groups that are looking at um

these types of scenarios in terms of

using available epidemiologic

information about

how this virus is transmitted

the rate in which it has has moved

through populations in china and italy

and in other locations

to use those parameters as we call them

to estimate what may happen

in a new population in africa for

example

and in using that information you can

you can estimate what case numbers and

deaths may look like

if we don't do anything if we don't have

any interventions

um and some of those numbers are very

high some of those numbers are quite

scary

but what those models can also do is

they can also look

at what may happen as you implement

certain interventions

and these are the interventions that we

have outlined

which are public health measures which

are you know physical distancing

measures which are

making sure that you have testing

capacity improved and finding all of

your cases

and when you look at those scenarios

those those case numbers reduce

um so that's what is important

in those models they also help us plan

they also help us estimate case numbers

based on what level of severity they may

have if they may have mild infection

moderate infection

may be severe and require oxygen

may need uh ventilatory support

respiratory support

those models help us estimate what kind

of supplies we need and we're using

those right now

to estimate what we would need to supply

for for countries

and so they've been very helpful we can

look at the country level we can look at

regional levels and we're working with

with modeling partners to create tools

that countries can use

to help prepare

and just on africa cdc actually the

director general

and i uh spoke with

john and kangasan uh john is the

director of africa cdc and in fact has

taken on a role as a special envoy of

the

director general and for our kobit

19. africa cdc is a very important

institution in africa who supported its

creation

director general was one of its founding

members before

he took his role as as director general

and dr

chidi moeti our director for the

regional office for africa and

and john work work very closely together

to ensure that member states and

countries in africa

get the best possible public health and

health advice inputs and support from

from both our

organizations we've worked together with

the africa cdc

on training lab technicians and kobe 19

diagnosis from all over africa we've

worked together on the distribution of

laboratory

tests and we're currently working

together with colleagues in china

on the procurement and distribution of

ppe

across africa so i would characterize

very strong operational

growing technical and operational

relationship with their colleagues in

the africa cdc

and obviously in future who in itself

is not a funding organization we will

always be advocating

for further funding and support to

strong

african institutions to provide support

all across the continent

and and i'm sure

through this response one of the

benefits

if there is anything to be seen and

benefit

at the moment is we need to build

stronger public health systems

at sub national at national and at

global level

if any lesson is to be learned from the

current pandemic

is that we need stronger public health

systems and we will work

very hard with our regional office for

africa with john at africa cdc

under the leadership of the director

general to deliver stronger

public health and health systems on the

african continent in the coming years

thank you very much dr ryan so the next

question is from

takuchi from kyodo we've only got time

for

for two more questions so i'd ask very

much that you

keep your question as short as possible

gucci are you there

hear me yes we can please go ahead

yeah hi this is tomohiro deguchi with

kyodo japanese news agency

a question to dr ryan on the tokyo

olympic games

what was the advice that who have given

to

international olympic committee and

japanese government

before they made the decision thank you

thank you for your question uh we've

been working over many years with the

international olympic movement

in providing them with risk management

advice for many many

of their events going back to rio and

previously and we do not

take any final decisions when it comes

to the staging events or not

but we advise organizing groups and fifa

in

ioc in people organizing huge events

like the hash

and the kingdom of saudi arabia on how

risks biologic risks

can be managed how they can be

identified how they can be minimized and

how any residual risk

can be managed so that games can be

carried out successfully

and mass gatherings can go on without

excess risk to public health

both in the country of the gathering or

subsequently after in other countries

in the same regard we've had many

conversations with our colleagues

in ioc and with the tokyo 2020 committee

and the japanese government over the

last

two months in advance of their decision

yesterday

and we continued to provide them up to

yesterday

with advice on the developing and

escalating pandemic

the likely situation that may pertain

later in june and july and

uh notwithstanding the excellent efforts

of japan

in containing the disease uh there are

other factors

that had to be taken into consideration

which would include

potentially the situation in many other

countries that might pertain at that

time

the difficulty of movement and the risk

that might be associated

with disease arriving in and potentially

subsequently moving from

japan to other areas so many many issues

were put on the table

we stick to our job which is to provide

public health risk assessment and public

health advice

the decision to uh to postpone the

olympics was made wholly and solely

by the ioc and by the japanese

government but as the director general

said in this statement we fully support

that decision

so dr ryan said two of the people who

were in the queue have

put their hands down but we have a

question from

associated press uh please go ahead

it looks like we don't have that

question from associated

oh there you are please go ahead hi

this is uh jamie from ap um just wanted

to ask you very quickly

um uh dr tedros about um

the the tweeting that you did yesterday

um

you you were pretty praiseworthy of

president trump's

efforts um and i'm just wondering um

you said he's doing a great job and

i'm just wondering you know that

president trump has

from the beginning sort of minimized the

importance of this

um at the very start and then is now

talking about um

churches that might be packed in the

united states come easter time

um how concerned are you about some of

the decisions that he's making are

do you really think he's doing a a great

uh job across the board

thanks

yeah i i stand by what i

said as you know

one of the recommendations from who is

the hall of government approach

involving all sectors and the principal

which is the head of state taking

responsibility and leading

the whole response and that's exactly

what he's doing and which we appreciate

because

fighting this pandemic needs political

commitment

and commitment at the highest level

possible and the president's commitment

you have already seen it and the world

have seen it

and that kind of leadership is very very

important the whole of government

approach

to mobilize all sectors and

stop or suppress the pandemic

so i know he is doing all all he can but

not only the whole of government

approach

but the other like expanding testing

and also the other recommendations we're

we're making are also um

in play and he he takes that

seriously and that's what we see and i

i had a conversation i had a chance to

discuss with him and that's what he

said and his his he's doing

so i believe that

that kind of political commitment and

political leadership

that can can bring change or can

stop this pandemic which is supplement

again just to say earlier today we we

spoke with uh with bob redfield and with

with tony fauci and

and we're very impressed to see the work

that their

institutions and other institutions

technical fabulous

public health research and other

institutions are doing in the united

states but also supporting

on the international front and we've had

the benefit of having having

having had secandies from cdc atlanta

present here in geneva for

more than a year and a half now between

ebola and between

19. our colleagues at nih

are the ones who have innovated and have

managed working with others in the

united states to start the first trials

of vaccine

nih and ourselves are working very

closely together on trials of of

of existing therapeutics the fda

have been exceptionally helpful on the

regulatory side and are working with us

on everything from animal models for

vaccine development

and and much much more we rely heavily

on the scientific uh innovation and

public health prowess

of of of the united states and and very

much appreciate the way in which

dr fauci broke down the issue yesterday

when he spoke about

the data he spoke about getting down to

the state and the county level

and working through the problem and

working through the issues

and again we remain impressed by the

work being done at state level by state

and county uh public health departments

now is the time to support them now is

the time that help workers

all over the world need to get the

support to do the jobs they need to do

they are our heroes and we are all there

to support them

thank you very much dr ryan and on that

inspiring note we'll close this press

conference thank you very much everybody

for attending

we will send the audio we will send the

transcript as usual

we'll also send you information about

the w.h.o film

festival thank you again and we'll

reconvene
