early morning the day after the federal

election and in Calgary the

post-election hangover is evident hoping

for a different outcome but it is what

it is

the West is sort of feels like we wrote

on a how to limb by ourselves again the

block of blue across the prairies was

just not enough to stop the Liberals

from winning a second term but as the

results rolled in Monday night

Westerners began expressing their

frustration online we've been saying all

along Justin Trudeau gets elected again

the separatist movements going to

explode and it did Peter Downing's

Facebook group vote websitcom grew from

a membership of about 2000 on October

20th to more than 135,000 Tuesday while

the hashtags wag sit and wags at Alberta

were trending number one nationally

Tuesday on Twitter though the hashtag

was used both in support of Western

independence and in opposition to it I

think what people are looking for is a

new deal with Canada and they're also

looking to sort of express their

frustration so that the rest of Canada

takes it seriously there is a fire of a

conversation in the prairie provinces

and what I am offering the prime

minister here today is a fire

extinguisher and please don't show up

with a gas cap Saskatchewan premier says

what his province needs now is a new

deal with the federal government one

that would include a canceled carbon tax

a renegotiated equalization formula and

new pipelines to Canadians in Alberta

and Saskatchewan know that you are an

essential part of our great country the

PM did reach out to Western Canadians

during his victory speech but as the

calls came into this global news radio

talk show Tuesday we wake up with the

realization that federal politics and

Confederation do not work for Alberta

and Saskatchewan well it became clear

words alone won't be enough to quell the

discontent Heather your ex West Global
