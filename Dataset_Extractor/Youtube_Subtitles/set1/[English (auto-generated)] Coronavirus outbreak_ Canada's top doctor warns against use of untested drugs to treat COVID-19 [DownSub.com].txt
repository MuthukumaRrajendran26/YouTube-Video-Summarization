I mean should we be sending malaria

tablets into the hospitals if the

evidence to support their use is weak

yeah so absolutely we need the evidence

before you can provide medication to

people we've got so many ideas from all

over the world many researchers saying

well this drug might work or another

drug might work I think Canada is part

of an international effort and at the

whu-oh and and other international work

networks where they've identify really a

very vast suite of potential drug

therapies and combinations of drugs are

already in existence but being

repurposed if you like for covert 19

treatment so the trial that I've just

talked about which is called solidarity

ran by the WTO was stood up really

really fast and one of the key drugs

that they will be doing a randomized

clinical trial on is the malaria anti

malarial drugs hydroxychloroquine or

chloroquine so that forms one aspect of

that and I think given that Canada is

now part of that network there are

actually appropriate ways at which

Canada can be engaged and make sure that

our patients who are receiving these

drugs are doing it in the most

scientific and safest way possible so

there are mechanisms I also know that

the regulatory authorities have Canada

the researchers cihr they are all

supporting these kind of efforts in

different ways as funders of research

but also as regulators it is absolutely

essential that you do science base

treatments because there are so many

therapies in every single pandemic

everybody has hundreds of solutions that

they think might work we can't rule out

the fact that it they they don't work

but unless let's just prioritize the top

ones that the world scientists think are

important and then do proper trials well

I'm really impressed with is that this

mega trial if you like globally where

numerous countries

join in is set up in such a way that it

makes it that really really simple to

join and then the results can be

analyzed in real time so I'm really

excited about that

and one follow-up if I can they're also

reports that Canadians are trying to

horde these tablets much the way they

did with Tamiflu during the bird flu

outbreak again dr. Tam could I get your

thoughts and whether this is a wise

thing for Canadians to be doing my

message is that you should not take

medication without the scientific

evidence it can be quite dangerous these

drugs are not without side effects in

fact they're quite significant side

effects and so that people have to be

really really careful about this don't

don't do it from a national health

canada perspective they are the

regulators but they also maintain a very

close link to the manufacturers and the

supply and where that supply is going so

there are mechanism to actually monitor

to see what the distribution looks like

and then be able to actually do

something about it so I think if there

were signals of certain massive buyouts

etc the manufacturers are actually being

really really responsible if they're

spotting some signal that supplies are

going in a certain direction there's a

mechanism set up to ensure that that

doesn't actually happen
