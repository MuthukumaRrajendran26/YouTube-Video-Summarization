about one in five Canadians experienced

a mental health problem in a year and

roughly seven and a half million

Canadians are living with a mental

health problem or illness with the

amount of people in need wait times to

see a mental health professional through

the public sector are becoming a problem

so how is Canada responding but overall

wait times are way too long it is not

uncommon for somebody and even a youth

who shows up for who wants to get help

and told they have to wait 12 to 18

months that simply isn't acceptable and

and leads us to have our mental health

system very very fragmented and a huge

gap between the delivery of mental

health services and physical health in

Ontario wait times for publicly funded

counseling and treatment for seriously

mentally ill service recipients has

increased to a 56 day wait and an

additional 16 day wait to be eligible

for the services in British Columbia the

rate of depression among youth nBC has

increased by 50 percent from 2013 to

2015 and anxiety has increased by a

hundred and thirty five percent but the

ministry doesn't report on wait times

for these services because they say

there's no standardized definition or

process for collecting this data across

jurisdictions yet the province currently

spends 2.5 billion dollars every year on

mental health and substance use services

most of which goes to hospitals in

Alberta wait times over the last five

years for youth addiction residential

services has gone from 24 days to 47

days the province has very limited data

on wait times Manitoba was also not able

to provide data on wait times as it is

not tracked by the provincial government

so how can this gap across Canada be

filled the real gap is funding and

funding in the right places a point that

many advocates of mental health are

trying to make to the government

especially with the federal election

coming up how are we measuring that

money how are we ensuring it's getting

to the right places

what kind of indicators are we

leveraging it has to be coupled with

innovation if we're going to invest in

doing more of the way we have always

done things

we're going to continue to do more ways

of doing it wrong

Hosseini says that allocating funding

towards community mental health services

can be Canada's biggest tool in solving

this issue ensure the community mental

health supports are getting that

investment because that's where we're

gonna get the biggest bang for your buck

that's we're gonna get to help the

majority of the people in Canada and

that's the area that's been chronically

underfunded mental health advocates are

keeping a close eye on this election to

see what solutions might be put forward
