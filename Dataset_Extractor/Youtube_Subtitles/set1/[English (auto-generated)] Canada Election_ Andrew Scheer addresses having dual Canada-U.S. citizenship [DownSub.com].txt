yet when you how do you explain your

criticism of Michelle John's dual

citizenship when you hold dual

citizenship who asked a question at the

time about about the fact that she held

it asking my constituents what they felt

about that it was just asking questions

of my constituents what they thought of

that at the time I was born in Canada my

mom was born in Mississauga my dad was

born the United States I grew up my

whole life from Canada and and that's

all I was on that on that blog post it

was it was a question I asked my

constituents

- I met pacification calmly limini on

the Canadian penny was it as me at the

hoedown Sinatra pay a reunion back Larry

Basanta DeLong posad motto you J because

you can also sit on the American I made

the decision after I became leader the

party to do this and focus on other

things

rebuilding the party getting rid for the

election working on the platform it was

always my intention to do it before the

election well so English is to the prior

question no one's ever asked me before

about it

like millions of Canadians I have a one

of my parents was born in another

country and I met with representatives

from the embassy in August announced

that I was pronouncing my citizenship

and I've submitted the paper to start

that process

of Jerusalem on a donkey on de l'affaire

they deploy tape or preparing a party

police elecci√≥n a base to the platform

nations customary to draw still a few

German intentionally fail

well it's I'm waiting to hear back

confirmation from from the US Embassy

but that is certainly the intention as

is required by alive I filed and so it's

apartment the u.s. the US government has

I was born in Canada I've lived here

I've moved to Saskatchewan and raising

my children here and it was a personal

decision

I haven't I'm sorry what is a speaking

it's I was never asked about from

Canadians I've actually been very honest

about it my father's always been very

open about where he's come from and

that's and I haven't I haven't been

asked the question so as I said I like

millions of Canadians have one parent

who happened to be born in another

country born in Canada lived here my

entire life raising my children here in

Canada and made a decision to renounce

my US citizenship and start the process

look I've always made it known about how

what I feel about about this issue and

people who hold dual citizens with with

my colleagues well there are lots of

seats all across that went to Canada

that I am confident are going to turn

conservative we wanted to hold an event

where we could be accessible for as many

writings as we possibly could given

given geographic locations

considerations and where we can get some

space so the message to Atlantic means

is we we are working hard to earn back

the trust of voters in this region we've

got a great set of policies that is all

focused about leaving money in the

pockets of teens lowering taxes balance

in the budget let's get a resonate in

every part of that well our real plan

for the environment has many different

components that will apply to people in

Nova Scotia including the putting it

into the practice of dumping raw sewage

into our rivers lakes and oceans as well

as incentivizing innovation research and

development here in Canada so I'm

confident people Nova Scotia are going

to see a real plan for the environment

so provincial are the the beauty of our

plan is that we allow provincial

governments to have the flexibility they

need there are some provinces that will

decide to have a cap-and-trade some will

decide to have other mechanisms we

respect that where were things that

we're not going to impose a federal

carbon tax or doing anything in any way

that would increase the cost to

consumers hard-working families

for Canadian look as I said I've started

the process to I met with officials in

August to said I was renounce to my US

citizenship and submitted the forms and

waiting for finalization he's very much
