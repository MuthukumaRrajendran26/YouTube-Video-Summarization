introduce my colleague Bonita azarello

the NDP candidate for the writing of

Port Moody Coquitlam hi my name is

Benita Zorrilla and I've been out

knocking on doors for months and what

I'm hearing over and over again is how

bills are mounting and how households

are having more difficulty paying those

bills I hear about the frustrations they

have about politicians speaking about

solving problems but really it ends up

being empty promises jug meat jug meat

is different he knows what it's like he

knows what it's like to struggle and to

overcome obstacles where other

politicians are taking us for granted

jug meat is listening to us he's

listening to the residents of this

province

I know Canadians across the country in

this campaign he's the leader who is

taking on the ultra-rich and the

well-connected he's standing up for

powerful insider lobbyists and is

putting forward ideas that will make

life better for all of us I'm inspired

by his leadership and so proud to be a

candidate for the NDP

Thank You Vinita thank you so much thank

you Vinita thank you to the entire team

for being here you're an incredible team

of candidates I'm honored to have you on

the team and I'm honored to know that

we've got people passionate they care

about their communities fighting for a

better Canada thank you

I also want to acknowledge that we're on

the territories of the Coast Salish

people and that beyond just recognizing

the territories we also want to commit

to acknowledging the historic injustice

ongoing injustice and our commitment to

remedy that and one step would be to

implement the United Nations declaration

on the rights of indigenous peoples so I

want to talk a bit about what's going on

here in BC and and the struggles that

people are faced with we know that we

live in a beautiful province we live in

a beautiful country but there's a lot of

challenges and we've got to tackle those

challenges people are faced with a lot

of cost of living it's getting more and

more expensive salaries aren't keeping

up but costs are rising cost like

cellphone bills

we're paying some of the highest

cellphone bills in the world here in

Canada we know that money-laundering and

speculation are driving up the cost of

housing and it means that it's simply

unattainable unimaginable for far too

many Canadians to ever own a place leave

owning a place many people can't even

find a place that they can afford to

rent we know that money laundering has

pumped 7 billion dollars through BC a

hundred million dollars into drug sales

is fueling crime

it's endangering Public Safety and of

course it's driving up the cost of

housing we know that right now a 29 year

old millennial who wants to buy a home

would have to wait 29 years before he or

she had enough money to be able to

actually put down a down payment now

while we're seeing this economy that

seems rigged more and more

to help out those at the very top to

help out the powerful the

multi-billionaires wealthy corporations

the result is that economy is hurting

people and BC is struggling with over 16

years of BC Liberals who have continued

that same trend made it harder for

everyday families and easier for the

rich and wealthy and on top of that

we're faced with one of the the most

urgent crises that's that means that

young people are are worried about the

future you know young people instead of

having hope and optimism in their eyes

are are filled with fear and despair

because they're worried about what's

gonna happen to the planet the climate

crisis that is gripping the entire world

is felt here in BC in a tremendous way

we know that in the past forest fires

have become more and more severe more

and more extreme and it's meant that on

many days people like that young young

kid can't even breathe the air and that

is that is serious no gas kiseop sec

when i flew some pollution economy ki

probably purush mean a key function bad

poker machine madam to element a la

estancia no LM crazy um Kelly shows

nanban spa new Puglia missive on spooly

bluefish now Trudeau is that I said a

lot of pretty words and a lot of empty

promises he said that he's going to

tackle the climate crisis he gets that

there's an emergency that he's gonna

defend our air and our land and our

water but what does he do he meets with

energy lobbyists in the past four years

he's met with them over 1500 times and

as a result the outcome of that is he's

bought a pipeline for 4.5 billion

dollars and he's failed to and fossil

fuel subsidies something that he

promised is you he said he would make

medication more affordable but instead

of helping people out he would rather

protect the profits

of the multinational pharmaceutical nice

he'd rather protect Big Pharma that how

people and that's why that young man's

crying it's fair it's unfair and now mr.

Trudeau makes another phony promise with

a fake Pharma care plan that's not gonna

actually address the problem

there's no we've no confidence that he's

not gonna just listen to the

pharmaceutical lobbyists when they come

knocking on his door again and you know

to build that there's no it's no

surprise that mr. Trudeau has recruited

is one of his star candidates Terry Lake

in Kamloops now you'll know that Terry

Lakes was one of Christie Clark's

ministers Minister of Health Minister of

Health when the BC Liberal government

was fine

sixteen million dollars because they

they've essentially violated the Canada

Health Accord the Canada Health Act by

allowing private services fee for

services to exist in the province

violating our public commitment to

public health care now at the same time

when the Minister Terry Lakes was

allowing private clinics to charge for

services that should have been covered

for free as a part of her health care

system the Christy Clark Liberal

government gave a billion dollars to the

wealthiest 2% so on one hand fee for

services for health care and the other

on the other hand massive tax cuts for

the wealthiest that's what Christy Clark

liberals did and that's Terry Lake Miss

Minister past Minister of Health and

that's mr. Trudeau's star candidate and

we see the connection here what we're

gonna announce today is is our plan to

tackle all these issues starting with

the health care system not only do you

need to expand an invest in our health

care system we need to ensure that

medication is covered under a new

democratic plan if you need health care

if you need medication you should use

your health card not your credit card

now no no other issue shows the the pure

neglect of the Liberal government to

tackle the crisis we talked about health

care we've talked about the environment

no other issue speaks directly to the

pure neglect of this government than the

housing crisis mr. Trudeau calls it a

housing crisis and says that it's

something that he needs to invest in and

expectedly is investing 19 percent less

than the Harper Conservatives as a

percentage of GDP that's no investment

and on top of that one of the areas that

is deeply concerning we talk about money

laundering the BC government is doing

its part they're tackling the concern

there they're fighting back but at the

federal level

not a single RCMP officer in the

money-laundering unit is actually

working on money laundering this is

because the Liberals have not made it a

priority they talked about increasing

some investments but they haven't talked

about how that's actually going to

tackle the issue of money laundering now

this is a direct issue that the federal

government can play a massive role in

flagging and identifying and an ending

yet when we asked the Liberal government

to enact something that BC is done a

beneficial ownership registry which

would effectively allow us to combat

money laundering mr. Mohn oh the finance

minister said oh that would be too

difficult for corporations you put too

much burden on them again mr. Trudeau

and his government want to help out

those at the very top want to help out

the oil and gas sector and they want to

help out the powerful corporations and

not help out families recently Idabel

mr. shears know better while mr. Trudeau

spent 4.5 billion dollars on a pipeline

as we can see over here Mr Shearer has

just presented a plan to tackle climate

change which was written by and for the

big oil companies really it's a plan

that's going to help the big oil

companies continue to make massive

profits they also fail to take on

money-laundering when they were in power

which has contributed to the problem

that we're facing right now and Harper's

health care cuts that were put in that

were presented by mr. Harper and the

Conservative government were infective

Lee enacted by mr. Trudeau so the

Conservatives aren't going to tackle the

healthcare problem they don't think it's

their problem to tackle and I'm a

non-housing just the same as health care

they don't think that they have anything

to do with the problem just like Stephen

Harper just like Christy Clark

conservatives cut services that your

families need they talk about tax cuts

but really it's gonna cost families more

it's gonna cost everyone more and the

services that families won't be able to

access now despite the Conservatives cut

to services the fact they continue to

cut essential things like health care

and education

the Green Party under MS me despite the

track record of the Conservatives have

said they're willing to make mr. sheer

Andrew Shearer the next prime minister

of Canada I don't believe it has to be

this way I don't believe it has to be

the way we're government's in Ottawa

make life easier for the wealthiest

continue to give billions of dollars to

the powerful corporations I want to

change that and I'm confident with my

team we can do that we are in it for BC

we are in it for Canadians this is a

beautiful place in a special place and

that's why I'm proud to announce today

our new deal for BC

our New Deal beef for BC means

investments in healthcare turning back

the cuts under the Conservatives

continued by the Liberals our plan is to

invest back into health care to make

sure we expand to include Pharma care

for all and also to ensure that the 4.3

million Canadians right now

that are in less than 70,000 that have

no dental care plan receive dental care

plans a dental care program immediately

and on the the most pressing crisis

that's affecting people in their lives

right now on on housing we've got three

measures that we're announcing today

three bold measures to tackle the

housing crisis here in BC first off

we're gonna make sure we work with the

RCMP and to ensure that there's a

dedicated fund and dedicated resources

to tackle money-laundering this is gonna

be we're going to put in place a 20

million dollar investment and a specific

targeted approach to tackling

money-laundering and half of that

investment would go specifically to BC

to make sure we tackle that crisis and

the money-laundering that we know is

going on right now and secondly we're

gonna put in place the beneficial

registry beneficial ownership registry

which would effectively do this it would

ensure that those criminals that are

using numbered corporations to hide

their assets to hide their ownership

they would be tracked and we would be

able to clamp down on it we put that in

place unlike mr. Morneau the Finance

Minister we don't believe in making life

easier for the corporations we believe

in making life easier for people and

that's why we put this in place

and building on the great work that BC

is doing already they've also put in

places beneficial ownership registry

moon and build on that great work we

acknowledge that it's working it's

helping them crack down on money

laundering they've also done a bold

thing with the foreign buyers tax we

know that that's driving up speculation

that's driving up the cost of housing so

to build on that at the national level

we would add an additional 15% foreign

buyers tax to tackle the out-of-control

skyrocketing price of housing New

Democrats would take the climate crisis

seriously we would listen to the

thousands and millions of kids that are

taken to the streets and demanding that

leaders listen to them demanding that

leaders acknowledge that its young

people that are gonna inherit a planet

that if we don't make the right choices

now will be a planet that is

uninhabitable so to those young people I

say to you we take the climate crisis

seriously and we are committed to taking

bold action not just pretty words but

real action including immediately ending

the fossil fuel subsidy investing into

clean renewable energy and a host of

measures to tackle this crisis meza me

puts people at the heart of everything

we do that puts the climate crisis as a

serious crisis and we will respond to it

with all of our force that I'll tackle

housing the housing crisis and we'll

invest in our health care we can do this

thank you we'll take some questions

hi mister Sagan's aunty Bertrand Oliver

with CTV national news the Green Party

has just come out with a PBO costed plan

for what they're proposing and in it

includes pharmacare they say a

first-year Pharma care plan will cost

twenty six point seven billion dollars

your pharma care plan is estimated

around 860 million I'm wondering how

what you think about the differences

here that seems like a major contrast so

our plan to build a Pharma care program

would require a ten billion dollar

investment from the federal government

and then it would use the resources that

are already being spent in each province

so each province already has a farming

care program and so we would ask to pool

our resources together so all of the

funds that currently provinces are

spending with what we're spending the

ten billion dollars that we'd put

forward that would provide a farmer care

plan that we could do in one year

now other parties we're talking about

doing it in ten years making families

wait I've met families to spend

thousands of dollars a month in case

thousands of dollars a year on

pharmacare to ask those families to wait

ten years is to ask them to feel the

crushing weight of thousands and

thousands of dollars for their

medication

they can't afford we want to do it right

away and you mentioned the 856 million

that's for our dental care program that

program is a plan that we want to put in

place in one year and that would cost

856 to cover 4.3 million Canadians a

very big contrast with the billions that

conservatives and liberals spend on

corporations we want to spend in on

people in the plan they also talk about

universal dental care Universal

pharmacare universal day care they also

have a plan to tax the wealthiest you

heard yesterday at the town hall a voter

said she wasn't sure to vote green or

NDP how do you differentiate yourself

from the Greens given that there are

very many platforms not just on the

environment but now social platforms

that are extremely similar my plan is a

tackle mr. trudeau our target is to form

government in this province we're not

running for third place we're running

for forming government in Canada on top

of that what's really clear is the Green

Party does not have a solid position on

a number of issues that are very

important to Canadians we believe very

strongly in national unity you know what

you get when you vote for a new Democrat

that is not the same for the Green Party

they do not have a solid position on

national unity they say they're gonna

prop up conservative government they say

they're open to working - the

Conservative government it's made it

clear that they cut services for

families and they don't have a solid

position on a woman's right to choose

these are things that you know when you

choose a new Democratic MP you have

someone who will fight unequivocally to

always protect and expand services for a

woman's right to choose that'll always

fight for social justice people believe

New Democrats when it comes to expanding

health care here's New Democrats that

put in place national pharmacare our

national Medicare it's going to be New

Democrats to take the next step the next

bold step forward to ensure that

everyone in our country has access to

medication

mr. Singh Mercedes Stevenson Global News

as you know we've done a lot on money

laundering in our network I particularly

here in BC but one of the strains for

the RCMP is resourcing the federal

policing so I'm wondering if you can

give us a breakdown of where some of

this money is going to go to when it

goes to the RCMP because you can

establish the unit but if there aren't

the officers to staff it you still have

a problem you're absolutely right and

there was a question that I asked in in

the house of in the House of Commons

directly to the Prime Minister that

there's a department that set aside but

there's no staffing and that no-one has

given the mandate so we want to make

sure that we are putting twenty million

dollars specifically to an anti money

laundering department that is funding

staffing so the RCMP officers at the

federal level to track and to tackle

money-laundering and we're gonna

allocate specifically ten million

dollars to BC and that's gonna be

focused on anti money laundering

activities working and investigating

here in BC to tackle the crisis but does

that address the issue of staffing

inside the RCMP if there's still a lack

of officers yes well we're saying we

need the funds to hire the officers and

we're gonna establish funds specifically

for money-laundering that has a specific

mandate to tackle that issue and the

money would go directly towards staffing

up and making sure the resources are

there

Ashley Burke CBC News where would the 20

million dollars come from again we've

got clear choices that we make we can

look at last year give you a clear

example of what mr. Trudeau spent money

on

mr. Trudeau spent in the last year as

government spent 14 billion dollars on

the wealthiest corporations to buy

corporate jets and limousines we

wouldn't do that

they bought a pipeline for 4.5 billion

dollars he rode off corporate loans to

the tune of six billion dollars these

are just some of the decisions that mr.

Trudeau is made that have accumulated

almost 25 billion dollars in spending

none of that spending is what we would

do is New Democrats we make better

choices with our limited resources we

know that those resources are limited

but if you make better choices with them

we can actually prioritize things like

money laundering we would dedicate 20

million dollars to fighting money

laundering it is a bare minimum and

necessity to do to tackle something so

important he already has this registry

so how is what you're proposing gonna

actually help people in DC drive down

the price of

housing here when it comes to the

registry specifically well we know that

at a national level there's a lot of

corporations that move between

jurisdictions that numbered corporations

don't have to be limited to one province

what we're proposing is to tackle

money-laundering the best way to do that

is to tackle it nationally there's no

way that you can control the flow of

money money launderers don't recognize

boundaries they'll move between

jurisdictions and we've seen that

already happen when attempts were made

to clamp down on money laundering in one

jurisdiction the criminals moved to

other jurisdictions

so we're taking a national approach

that'll build on the work that's already

being done provide more assistance and

with our foreign buyers tax that'll

ensure that people that are investing in

one community don't just move down to

the down the road to the next province

or down to the further province we're

going to tackle this at the national

level French please sure the last

came Canadian Press on the foreign

buyers tax the BC tax still faces a

proposed class-action lawsuit filed by a

Chinese citizen who both lived and

worked and studied here who scraped

together the money for a down payment

and then was hit with this unexpected

enormous tax she and others have said it

discriminates against people based on

where they're born I'm wondering if you

think that's an NDP

value well what we're saying is that

housing shouldn't be used as speculation

and we know that foreign buyers foreign

investments are coming into Canada to

drive up the cost of housing so if

someone is a permanent resident someone

is a citizen someone has made Canada

their home

no matter where they're from they're of

course should be able to buy a house

home without any barriers but if someone

is not chosen to make counter to their

home not a permanent resident and not a

citizen then we want to make sure we're

preventing the the astronomical rise in

housing and we're seeing it's driven by

a lot of foreign investment and that's

hurtful to Canadians that's hurtful to

the people of BC because people can't

afford a house that way so we know we

need to get act speculation which is

unsustainable and that's what we are

proposing to do hi mr. sang Martin

McMahon with News 1130 we've heard from

the the Conservatives that they are are

going to do an inquiry into this if

they're elected and excuse my ignorance

does your plan include an inquiry into

money laundering absolutely we believe

we need to do an inquiry we need to

clamp down on a number of things one is

why there hasn't been and been

sufficient investigation into something

that is so widespread and so commonly

known there's also been some concerns

about a recent investigation and in

court case that was one of the major

cases that crackdown on money laundering

but through to them some errors in the

prosecution the case failed and we want

to make sure that never happens again

money laundering is is a crucial issue

here in BC it is driving up the cost of

housing people say at least 5 percent of

the increase in property prices has been

attributed to money laundering it could

be a lot more we need to take it very

seriously I think the dollar figure the

Conservatives are talking about is

something like 20 million dollars for

that inquiry do you have a cost on on

what you estimate your inquiry would

what would cost we haven't launched a

cost on the inquiry we know it's

important to do we need to get to the

bottom of why that hasn't been

investigations to this point but we're

also committing real dollars to tackling

money-laundering with a 20 million

dollar investment in the RCMP to assure

that they're staffing to tackle

money-laundering at the federal level

there has not been anyone working on

this file we want to stop that and we

particularly want to make sure that

people are working on the file here in

BC and that's why we're attribute

half of the money that were committing

to BC to tackle a problem here can you
