all right thank you a big thank you to

the team that's here and our incredible

candidates we just had a conversation

about housing something that is very at

a crisis stage across Canada something

that we're seeing is an issue that comes

up everywhere across Canada and

particularly amongst young folks that

can't ever imagine owning a place is

kind of a no longer even a dream they

can't even imagine renting a place

that's affordable and so hearing the

stories of the folks that we spoke to

today really drove home how hard it is

for people to find housing and how

difficult it is and how worried they are

and how afraid they are because if they

have housing the word about losing it

and then worried about being able to

find something they can afford in the

future so it's a it's a real fear we

want to change that don't wanna leave

de mezzo yo si vous Ferez ooh

Blanche Amanda junkie Oh

of monokuma zone so that's why today

when we talked about these these

problems there are some real solutions

for the past thirty years the federal

government has an invested in housing

hasn't played a major role in building

new affordable non-market cooperative

housing that's why it's incredible to be

here at the molehill a housing

neighborhood an example of what we need

to build more of something that we need

to expand and something that the liberal

and conservative governments have

neglected for the past thirty years

we're gonna change that

we're gonna build half a million new

affordable homes we're going to make it

easier for people to buy their first

home we're gonna make sure that people

have an affordable rental option that's

a real safe quality place to live we can

do that it's a matter of choices and

we're prepared to make those choices

thank you and I'm ready for your

questions we're not totally ready now

ready morning

we need to be ambitious we are in a

crisis and when we're in a crisis we

can't respond with half-measures and

what mr. Trudeau and the Liberals have

done is say a lot of nice words and not

really follow through we're not seeing a

bold commitment in fact their housing

announcement is 19% less funding per GDP

than the Harper Conservatives so they're

not taking this seriously and what I'm

committing to doing is this that we need

to act boldly it is an ambitious target

it is an ambitious goal but we need to

set ambitious goals if we want to do

something to solve the problems that

people are facing sure

so we've got a solution that includes a

host of measures when it comes to

tackling the housing crisis we know that

it's one thing we've got to build

affordable units for people we also need

to tackle some of the root causes so

we've got a plan to tackle speculation

by putting in place at 15% foreign

buyers tax to drive down the the

pressures that are driving up the cost

of housing we've seen it work here in BC

we want to build on that and have a

national foreign buyers tax the second

thing we want to do is tackle

money-laundering which is driving up the

cost of housing there's evidence here in

BC where money-laundering has increased

housing and the cost of housing by at

least 5% so those are some of the root

causes we want to tackle we know that

we've got to build massively we're gonna

put up the money we're gonna partner

with cities municipalities NGOs

cooperatives and build housing we've got

to do that but for families that are

struggling right now they need a little

extra help

the rental subsidy is a way to help

those families out that are just on the

edge that you know look they need a

little extra help and we're proposing as

a rental subsidy of up to $5,000 for

those families that are just on the edge

those couples where those those those

individuals that are just on the edge

you need a little extra help to stay in

their home we can help them with the

rental subsidy

so with with respect to you know having

a the plan to subvert another party paid

for by another party that seems all very

troubling I mean Kenny's would be

troubled by that those are things I

think the Conservative government's

gonna or the Conservative Party is gonna

have to respond to respond to what why

they they did that what they thought

were thinking when they did this I've

made it clear that I don't believe that

someone like mr. Bernier should have a

platform to spread hateful messages

because I think his messages were wrong

and so I made that comment very clear

but at the end of the day people should

be able to discuss in express their

opinions as long as they're not hateful

and divisive and be able to have the

forum to do that don't G Sapolsky Sookie

from simpleton

I haven't applied since at the time when

it was reported I was told it was

because of my human right stance on the

rights of women the subjugation of

minority communities and my criticism of

the treatment of minority communities

and I was asked to two no longer have

those opinions and I said I'm gonna

always speak up about human rights and

that's why the reason I was keeping

well Canadian should expect transparency

from from leaders they should be able to

answer those type of questions if

there's evidence to suggest he was

involved in the hiring of someone for a

certain task he should be able to answer

those questions and I think Canadians

expect that from their leaders and our

with all countries I think it's

important for us to have a dialogue and

a conversation and a relationship with

India an important world economy that

we've got to be communicating with and

having open dialogue with and I be

encouraging that with countries around

the world including India and it'll be

I gotta say pre-eminently showed

Canadians and showed Albertans what you

get with a new democratic government she

fought fearlessly for healthcare for

education for university students for

farm workers she fought for people have

made people's lives better

and now we're learning and premier

Notley or now his law he has said is

that with mr. Kenney premier Kenny he's

putting out a whole bunch of massive

cuts are gonna hurt education and hurt

health care and so we know what what you

get with conservatives and what you get

with New Democrats I'm I'm thankful for

the support but I don't take anyone's

vote for for granted I know the people

of Alberta need supports they're in a

really difficult time and I want to

ensure the people a number I know I

don't want to see any worker left behind

we've got a real plan to make sure

workers have a real future with an

economy that's diversified and that's

long lasting that creates good jobs for

them I was in New Zealand and in Alberta

before the auction just before the

election me get began and I was honored

to have a great support there lots of

folks in in those provinces want to see

universal pharmacare want to see

investments in housing care deeply about

our national dental care program it's

gonna make their lives better and we

know that New Democrats help out people

across this country so no matter where

you live if I have mail to get there I'm

sorry I wasn't able to make it out to

your province but I can tell you this

New Democrats are gonna fight for you if

you like more do that New Democrats

unlike conservatives they're gonna cut

services and I like mr. Trudeau who

likes to say nice words but doesn't

deliver on them New Democrats will fight

for you for all the things that you need

in your life to make your life better

yes we are very confident of our our

campaign and what it's done in Norrell

mainland here in BC in general we see a

lot of excitement because people are

seeing that we're solving the solutions

that they're facing we're talking about

real solutions that are going to make

people's lives better we talked about

housing today housing is one of the

biggest concerns in the Lower Mainland

one of the biggest concerns for people

across Canada and we're the only ones

that are proposing real concrete

solutions to tackling the root cause

speculation and money laundering and

real commitments to build more

affordable housing that's gonna make

people's lives better

we know that people care about health

care here in the Lower Mainland and

across Canada and our commitments for

universal farming care and a national

and dental care program are going to

make people's lives better and we know

that people in in BC are going to see a

NOS Campion's are going to fight for

them yeah I want people to know that

they shouldn't feel trapped they should

not feel like they have to settle for

Less that they have to choose between

liberals or conservatives you don't have

to choose between someone who let you

down and and fail to deliver on real

action and you don't have to choose

certainly someone who's gonna cut the

services that you need there is another

choice you can elect new Democrats if

you elect enough of us we will form the

next government but either way I want

Canadians to win to me it's not about me

winning it's about Canadians winning if

you elect enough new Democrats we will

fight for all the priorities that we've

laid out that is that's going to make

people's lives better we know it's gonna

make their lives better so I'm asking

for their their trust and their support

don't vote it out or your vote for hope

won't you

Cajun a pepper table avec le conservator

yeah so for me it's a question of value

values and the conservatives have made

it really clear that they have no

alignment with me on important things

they've made it clear mr. shears made it

clear with his actual words that he

doesn't support a woman's right to

choose

he's personally against it is what he

said and to me that's that's not a value

that I can I can support in any way I

believe we unequivocally have to protect

persons right to choose that is

something that's fundamental I believe

in in making sure that we invest in

services and he's made it clear with his

platform that he wants to cut services

mr. Trudeau is very problematic he is

not gonna do what he says and that's why

I'm asking people to elect more New

Democrats if you've got more New

Democrats in place we will actually

deliver on the services that Canadians

need we will deliver on what people need

I've only ruled out working with one

party and that's the Conservatives but

if you liked enough New Democrats we can

get all these

things done we can invest in housing and

health care and everything that families

need on fetch a syndication apotropaic

bacteria cause de montebello correctly

thought co Nellie please neo Democrat on

this one I see some water BC I'll be

good now it's gonna great give me one

sec here you can talk though we didn't

continue doing what we've been doing we

know that people are seeing in us real

champions are seeing in us fighters for

them and I want people to know that's

what you get with your Democrats so New

Democrats can be conservatives keep that

in mind as well in ridings across this

country New Democrats be conservatives

also want folks to know the more New

Democrats you elect you will get the

things that you want we are we are not

in it for the rich and powerful it's one

of the big differences the Conservatives

and the Liberals have shown again and

again that they work for the powerful

they work for the big corporations I

work for the pharmaceuticals the big

polluters we don't work for them we work

for people and so everything we say

we're gonna deliver because we deliver

it for people we're gonna make sure we

invest in healthcare and deliver

universal pharmacare we're gonna make

sure we deliver a national dental care

program that's gonna help out millions

of Canadians 4.3 million Canadians at

least will get dental services that

weren't able to get it before with our

plan we know that we need housing and

one of the one of our guests our leader

today Alex said it's as simple as just

building affordable housing we're gonna

do that there's been 30 years where we

haven't we're gonna do it if you need

something if you need action on climate

crisis which we know young people are

desperate for action New Democrats are

going to cancel all subsidies to the

fossil fuel sector your Democrats are

gonna make your life better

vote for us and you'll have a brighter

future

I think we've captured the imagination

of the country because we've asked

Canadians to dream bigger we say you

deserve better

and we've rejected the notion that

Canadians should settle for Less and we

believe in people we believe that they

deserve great things in their life they

deserve to live a bright life I see a

young person and I see them sometimes

their eyes filled with fear and I want

to replace that with hope and I believe

they deserve better and I'm fighting for

them and I'm fighting with him for them

with everything I've got

and my team is fighting for them because

we know that they did sort of so much

more and we can deliver it that's the

positive thing on all this we got here

because of choices that were made by

conservatives and liberals we can get

out of here with choices that are made

by New Democrats for people so let's do

this I was a pretty cool ending though I

thought yeah yeah I was repeating drunk
