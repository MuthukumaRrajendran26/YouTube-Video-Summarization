municipal leaders are the ones to see

and hear and feel it first when the

hundred-year-old water main crumbles the

bridge fails the storm sewers overflow a

major transformer blows or the public

transit system

well fails and with the changing climate

of new challenges flooding droughts

wildfires extreme key that's impacted

citizens especially our new song remote

infrastructure must respond to and be

more resilient to climate change but

also be part of the solution

now see you Canada fund we brought up

new buses and light rail and we built

new community and recreation centers so

let me just be clear about my priorities

this is very nervous when it comes to

infrastructure funding so that we all

understand one another one my first

priority is getting things built quickly

fit matters the lives of Canadians but

there's another priority equal

importance ensure you better jobs and

economic outcomes for Canadians wherever

they live that goes through faster more

efficient transportation like the Gordie

Howe International Bridge underway in

Windsor Ontario it comes through

indispensable 21st century

infrastructure such as high-speed

Internet what is it the farm of Colin

McRae just north of Winnipeg last year

where I saw and heard about the

importance of broadband access to

precision agriculture the third public

priority

a challenge and an opportunity we will

be putting in our pudding at climate

lens on everything we do an

infrastructure has to be at the top of

that list
