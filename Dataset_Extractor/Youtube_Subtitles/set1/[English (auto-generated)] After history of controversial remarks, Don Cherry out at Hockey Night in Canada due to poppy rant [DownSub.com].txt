a big name in Canadian hockey

broadcasting has been turfed at age 85

Don Cherry has reached the point where

his outrageous comments crossed a line

on Saturday cherry implied immigrants

can't be bothered to wear poppies for

Remembrance Day the complaints flooded

in the broadcast standard council got so

many they said today they can't accept

any more and then Sportsnet announced

cherry is stepping down effective

immediately it says he made divisive

remarks that do not represent our values

or what we stand for

Eric Sorenson reports on why cherry

lasted so long and what was the final

straw he is an iconic figure in the

world of hockey and one of the most

popular TV commentators in Canadian

history and I'm wearing their tie right

now all right let's go

he has blurted controversial comments

throughout his broadcast career but this

went too far you people love you you

they come here whatever it is you love

our way of life you love our milk and

honey at least you could pay a couple of

bucks for poppies or something like that

his reference to immigrants you people

did not prompt an immediate response

from his colleague Ron MacLean but

MacLean soon realized he should have

intervened I owe you an apology that's

the big thing that I want to emphasize i

sat there I did not catch it did not

respond Cherry's comments triggered a

tsunami of criticism and an outpouring

of support for the contribution of

immigrants people from all over the

world came together to fight alongside

one another it was a two demonstration

of diversity because no one cares about

what you look like

finally it forced the hand of his

employer Sportsnet which stated

following further discussions with Don

Cherry after Saturday night's broadcast

it has been decided it is the right time

for him to immediately step down cherry

himself did not issue an immediate

apology in an interview with one

newspaper he's quoted I know what I said

and I meant it he has said what he

wanted to say for years and is not back

down I mean what do you see I mean come

on cherry has made derisively Spiegel

the French Swedes

Russians and generally people he just

didn't agree with I've put that in your

pipe you left-wing Kooks I would suspect

that his sponsors also found out from

their clients that they could no longer

support

Don doing these kind of messages cherry

was also controversial in his promotion

of fighting at other aspects of hockey

but he seemed to revel and stirring

things up even about his own job so I'm

asking you guys do I have a job

dead now he doesn't have to ask anymore

ironically Cherry's final broadcast drew

attention to his comments about

immigrants overshadowing his own intent

to honor Canada's military veterans Erik
