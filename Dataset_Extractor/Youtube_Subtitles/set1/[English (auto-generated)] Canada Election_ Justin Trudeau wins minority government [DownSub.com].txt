Global News is now projecting a liberal

minority government and Eric was talking

about it they reached the threshold

where no one else can beat them we

believe Mercedes your take on this well

obviously they would have liked to keep

their majority but this was certainly I

think what most liberals thought was

going to happen if you talk to the the

insiders on the campaign and we were

traveling with them throughout this

campaign we were on the plane we were on

the bus and they were consistently

saying that they thought they were going

to get a liberal minority that is what

it looks like and of course at this

point we look at the numbers at the

block though instead of the NDP being

right behind them in terms of the third

party pardon me of obviously the

Conservatives are in second but that's

not going to prop up a liberal

government any time soon so it'll be a

very interesting dynamic if we have the

block remain in third party status

depending on what happens when we get

out on the west coast and whether or not

the NDP comes in now and you could see

Justin Trudeau having to give up things

like the trans mountain pipeline having

to do a lot more on the environment but

certainly Liberal minority I think was

the gut feeling of a lot of people

around Ottawa
