new body cam video is showing an

interview with the security guard at the

center of the disorderly conduct charges

against leaf star Austin Matthews the

video comes as the team continues to

show support for the troubled player

Camila Kamali is live in the newsroom

right now with the latest Camile that's

rightfully my the body cam footage

published by an Arizona news station

showing the security guard talking to

police about Leafs star up forward

Austin Matthews alleged behavior that

night in May the woman is now pressing

charges against Matthews for disorderly

conduct here's a bit of what she told

police they drunk out their freakin

minds but I asked them to leave me for

hello and they still thought it was fine

you know let me know what just won't get

in your cars you know you'd react and

pull into Panza what pissed me off is

own up to what you did and it would be

easier for you but do not call me a liar

this is the video from a police body

camera the security guard being

questioned by police says Matthews

opened the security guards car and sat

down inside while she was doing

paperwork Matthews was with his friend

outside his condo complex the security

guard then exited the car when she

claims Matthews dropped his pants left

his underwear on and grabbed his

buttocks as he walked away now the

security guard in the interview here

also goes into detail about how Matthews

friend tried to persuade her to not tell

property-management about what happened

surveillance video of that incident

itself has not yet been released

meanwhile Leafs GM Kyle dubis said he

didn't learn about the incident until

Wednesday over Twitter while Matthews

responded to the video that has now been

released and subsequently we have to use

it as an opportunity to continue to

educate our whole organization every

player every staff member but the way

that we expect our organization to

conduct its business here at the rink

every day in the weight room in the

community and how they interact with

every citizen that they they come into

contact with because when they are doing

so they're representing the Toronto

Maple Leafs you know I think that was

just an error in judgment to be honest

with you you know when we received the

complaint I think you know got with the

legal you know try to map out a plan on

how to handle the situation and you know

that's just an error in judgment on my

part

and so this leaf seemed very much

off-guard about that video that has now

come to light it does run about 30

minutes or social EEMA and you can find
