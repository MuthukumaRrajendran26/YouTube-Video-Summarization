now to a global news investigation over

the past few years about 130 Canadians

have left the country to join terrorist

groups such as the so-called Islamic

state or al-qaeda some have died others

have been convicted for their crimes and

served time in prison the parole board

reports obtained by Global News suggests

that when some Canadian terrorism

offenders are released they're still

radicalized and as Jeff sample reports

they still pose a threat the rise of the

so-called Islamic state a few years ago

saw a number of Canadians join their

fight Carlos lar Monde from Ottawa was

convicted in 2016 of attempting to join

Isis in Syria sentenced to seven years

and transferred to Canada's highest

security prison last year his parole

board said lahrman had not shown

significant indications of change

attempting to radicalize other offenders

and posed a high risk to public safety

but despite those concerns last December

lar Monde was released from prison we

have somebody who has shown no signs of

having a band in the ideology that got

him convicted in the first place

and he's not alone lar Monde is one of

five terrorism convicts freed from

Canadian prisons last year four of whom

according to parole board's still posed

a threat we haven't been really good at

developing any kind of real du

radicalization programs inside the

prison system but it's unclear whether

their prison time would have been long

enough for D radicalization most

terrorism sentences in Canada recently

have been seven years or less they're

pretrial custody counts for

time-and-a-half and they're entitled to

statutory release after two-thirds

meaning that most are getting out much

sooner it tells us that the course

system 1:40 does not take terrorism as a

serious offense

this Canadian just served 14 years in a

US prison for sending money to an

extremist group since his deportation to

Canada a couple of years ago he's

received no contact from police nobody

nobody even contacted my attorney

legal experts note that Canadian

terrorists are typically released under

strict conditions lahrman for example

must live at a halfway house and allow

police to check his phone you're still

being sentenced in that the system is

still watching you but

gives you an opportunity to sort of

reintegrate but in rare cases that

reintegration backfires two recent

terror attacks in London England were

committed by convicts who just got out

of prison

the British government responded by

banning early release for terrorism

offenders adding new urgency to the

debate here in Canada with three more

terrorism convicts up for parole this

year Geoff sample Global News Toronto
