dramatic new developments are shaking up

an already volatile situation in the

Middle East including some stunning new

video that might be disturbing to some

viewers reports suggests this is the

explosion that killed Iranian general

Qasem Soleimani the targeted strike

yesterday sparked this new escalation in

the dispute between the u.s. and Iran

Redman Shannon reports on that and a

dire new warning for Canadians

travelling in the region thousands of

mourners in Iraq paying their respects

to an Iranian military general killed

alongside Iraqi militia members this

display of grief and anger for the

killing of Qasem Soleimani is an

indication of his status across the

region even Iraq's Prime Minister was in

the crowd he has declared three days of

mourning matching Iran it's one time fo

local but America was aiming to weaken

the resistance but the resistance will

be victorious says this man this new

video purports to show the moment solemn

Annie's convoy was hit in Baghdad the US

has not yet given any details of the

intelligence that led them to believe he

was planning to kill Americans some

Iraqis are glad Soleimani is dead but

many of these mourners are supporters of

Shiite militias backed by the commander

in Iran the anger at the u.s. is

stronger still we're Soleimani is now a

martyr Iranian president Hassan rouhani

visited his family again

promising revenge they made a strategic

mistake he said they will see that more

difficult days are awaiting them what

exactly revenge will look like is

uncertain on Saturday missiles landed

inside the fortified Baghdad Green Zone

but not close to the US Embassy more

rockets hit a u.s. airbase north of the

city there were no deaths one

iran-backed militia group has indicated

more attacks are to come but in the wake

of the anti-government and

anti-iran protests in Iraq this past

fall Tehran's future influence in Iraq

is in question

Iraqi protests you hear the same Iran

barabara militias out so that's what the

Iraqi protesters are saying in other

words these militias that could have

been used against the US are now

paralyzed as a result of lack of popular

support this middle east analyst says

Iran may simply want to save face by

humiliating your on in this way Iran is

not going to come to the table but Iran

doesn't want to risk all over the US so

what I think what Iran will do is they

will want some sort of skirmish a minor

skirmish that the u.s. won't mind as in

it won't cause the war it could be a

mass cyber attack it could be a

temporary hostage situation before for a

ship in the in in the Gulf Strait that

will let the Iranians parade it in front

of their people then there are hundreds

of Canadian troops in Iraq at the moment

what do you know about their status as

this crisis deepens Chris Canadian

forces are currently leading the NATO

mission in Iraq and are also taking part

in operation impact to counter the

so-called Islamic state but in the wake

of Soleimani scaling all NATO operations

have been temporarily suspended as a

precaution and defense minister Harjit

Sajjan says all training missions have

also been suspended too but sources tell

global news that doesn't necessarily

apply to all aspects of operation impact

Chris alright Redmond Shannon in London
