good morning everyone it's great to be

here in Delta today I want to thank

bindi for welcoming us to her home

whenever I'm back in BC I always get a

feel like I'm getting a glimpse of our

future as a country because there's no

doubt DC is ahead of the curve that

didn't happen by accident

it happened because people decided to

move forward and that's the choice we

all get to make as a country on October

21st moving forward means fighting and

adapting to climate change because

Canadians are already seeing what this

new reality means for their lives floods

and wildfires that threaten their homes

heat waves that claim lives and droughts

that wipe out crops we know climate

change is here is real and is happening

today and you need support

just take your home for example people

are proud of their homes and rightly so

you've worked hard for a place to set

down roots raise a family and retire but

as any home owner knows the work on a

house is never really done maybe you

notice that the poor ceiling around your

windows means it's drafty in January or

that your old furnace means the heating

bill goes up every year and as much as

you'd like to invest in a retrofit you

just don't have the money on hand

add to that with a changing climate

your costs of adapting are rising

Canadians need a government that will be

there for them and today I can announce

that we're moving forward to make those

retrofits affordable for Canadians for

people like bindi we will introduce a

new interest-free loan of up to $40,000

for homeowners and landlords who want to

make their homes

more energy-efficient now people will be

able to replace those leaky windows or

that old furnace not only making their

home more comfortable and lowering their

monthly bills but also keeping our

environment health it's a win win win

and if you're looking to buy a net zero

emissions home we're creating a new

grant to make environmentally

responsible living more affordable than

ever

of course we need people to make all of

these improvements happen whether that's

doing energy audits retrofits or

building new Net Zero homes there's

going to be a big demand in the field

which is why we'll invest a hundred

million dollars in skills training to

make sure we have the workers to fill

these good jobs it's another example of

how a healthy environment and

middle-class jobs go hand in hand for

homeowners and for workers this is real

progress but we can't stop there because

in the face of extreme weather people

aren't just worried about their leaky

windows or their old furnace they're

worried about being left alone to deal

with the very real effects of climate

change in the interior people are

worried about their home being

threatened by wildfires again next

the face I think at Astra if you've just

been through a wild fire or a flood you

should be focused on rebuilding your

life not on how to pay for the damage or

how to pay the bills after time away

from work so we're going to make sure

family

have the support they need from a

National Flood Insurance Program to

designing an e I benefit for people who

lose paychecks after a disaster

now not all politicians agree that we

need a real approach on climate change

and real support for families after all

the Andrew Shearer conservatives have

the same do-nothing approach on the

environment

the Canadians remember from Stephen

Harper with a so called plan that will

do less and cost more that shouldn't

come as a surprise

even when conservative politicians do

admit that climate change is real which

lots still try to deny they take the

approach of the last conservative

Finance Minister Joe all of them insist

that it's a good thing for Canada

Canadians know that just isn't true my

friends we are taking real action to

protect our environment and to put more

money back in people's pockets under a

Liberal government we will continue to

invest in Canadians and in their future

a new Liberal government will increase

access to before and after school care

will ensure that all Canadians can take

paid family leave when they have a baby

will ban military-style assault rifles

and strengthened gun control will make

it easier to buy your first home and

give more money to seniors for

retirement will create a fairer tax

system and cheaper cellphone bills and

will make sure that everyone has the

care they need to stay healthy me chef

we've done a lot together these past

four years but the truth is we're just

getting started so folks here in Delta

and right across the country you have an

important choice to

will we go back to the failed policies

of the past or will we continue to move

forward that's the choice it's that

clear and it's that important

I'm for moving forward for everyone for

families for the middle class and for

all Canadians nocebo good morning so

there's a debate on whether it's fair to

ask to ask taxpayers to keep paying for

homes that flowed repeatedly since

you're talking about a national plan are

you in favor of capping the total aid a

homeowner can receive before they're

asked to move whether they want to or

not we recognize that people are facing

increased flooding because of the

effects of extreme weather events and

increased impacts of climate change I

have personally been to communities

around Fredericton and Gatineau

elsewhere across the country where

people are facing very difficult choices

we recognize first of all that many

people can't get insurance flood

insurance anymore and we know the

government does need to step up and

that's why we're gonna help honam on

homeowners access national low-cost

flood insurance but we also know there

are going to be difficult decisions to

make about whether to rebuild and where

to rebuild that's why we're making sure

that communities and homebuyers have

information around mapping of flood

plains right across the country and that

we lead a very real conversation about

whether to rebuild where to rebuild and

how to support families whose homes are

under threat because of changing weather

patterns these are things that we are

committed to doing together and we will

work with communities and with families

to ensure that we're giving people the

support they need faced with the

challenges of climate change

conservatives still don't think fighting

climate change is a priority climate

change is already costing Canadians we

need to act and that's exactly what

we're doing and that's a choice facing

Canadians

come ons if you see a become a man

Global News I understand that you have

to commit to flood mapping first and

that you're committing to 150 million

dollars to do that today before you can

move forward but talking about

relocating people and it is a huge

expense what exactly are you committing

to in terms of the idea of moving people

in flood zone and a low cost national

insurance plan well we're beginning with

the low cost national insurance plan and

better flood mapping but we recognize

that there are many communities and many

families that are facing extremely

difficult decisions about whether to

rebuilt where to rebuild whether to

relocate and those are conversations

that are being had amongst individuals

and families and their municipalities

and the provinces and indeed the federal

government and this is a conversation

that we we know is only going to become

more difficult and more acute for more

people over the coming years with the

very real impacts of climate change our

commitment today is that we will be

there with people supporting them

through these difficult moments in their

lives as we fight climate change and

that really is the core of the choice

that people are facing a conservative

party that refuses to admit the climate

change is a problem that needs real

action or a liberal party that has

recognized that we have done a lot on

fighting climate change but we need to

do much more and that's exactly what we

will do

it's her recollection of her

interactions with you correct decisions

regarding potential candidacies for the

Liberal Party are always processed in an

independent and transparent process

according to the rules of our party we

have a green light committee to do that

we are I have continued to engage with

all our MPs and encouraged them to go

through the independent process and I

trust the independent process that has

done its work in as a green light

committee you didn't answer my question

I'm gonna give you the opportunity to

try that again did she or did she not

recollect her interactions with you

correctly and I have another question

for you

was she denied the nomination because

she refused to praise the from your

feminist credentials on social media

following this as he'll a bland affair

the process around a green light

committee is conducted independently

according to the rules that we have I

had many conversations with madam Nassif

and with other candidates who were going

through that greenlight process and

every time I expressed hope that it

would be successful but I trust the

processes we've established as a party

and I know that those processes are

properly followed not gonna comment on

the specific decisions of the green

light committee but those determinations

are made on a fair basis according to

the rules of the party but in in this

case that was not the issue that ended

ratification of us MCA in a way that

tries to go beyond the partisan

differences in the United States right

now our focus remains on ensuring that

this deal which is good for Canadians

but also good for Americans and Mexicans

moves forward and that's what our what

we're gonna remain focused on a new

level in regards to specific concerns we

have right now a NAFTA in place that is

securing our access to the most

important partner and our most important

renegotiated a new NAFTA that will

continue to secure those until the new

one is brought in the old one remains in

place and Canadians can be assured that

we have solid access even at a time of

unpredictability and protectionism from

the United States last night CTV News

reported on a case of a BC man who was

given a medically assisted death despite

pleas from his family that he was

mentally ill wasn't capable of making

that decision and didn't actually have a

terminal illness

what do you think that case needs to be

investigated further and moreover do you

need a second look at the guidelines

versus two that

I can't comment on a specific case but I

can assure you that I we understand that

the decision to go ahead with medical

assistance in dying is a deeply personal

one a deeply difficult one for

individuals and their families and as a

government our responsibility has always

been to make sure we're getting that

balance right between protecting the

most vulnerable and respecting people's

return to your comments yesterday saying

that we will exceed our 2030 Paris

targets at a time when the United

Nations is talking about our oceans

getting worse I'd like to know why

you're not saying how we'll do that we

know that we need to not only meet our

2030 targets but exceed them we know we

need to get to net zero by 2050 climate

change is real it's a pressing challenge

for Canadians and unfortunately we have

a political party in the Conservatives

that do not take it seriously and have

no plan we've announced yesterday and

today two key elements of our plan to

move forward and yesterday is about

investing in and drawing in innovators

in the zero-emission industry where

there are going to be trillions of

dollars worth of opportunities and

profits as people develop the kinds of

zero emission technologies that the

world is going to rely on to get to Net

Zero by 2050 today we're announcing more

money upfront for families for

homeowners and for renters and landlords

to be able to make the changes in their

homes it's going to save them money and

fight climate change

we know that conservatives do not get it

and are not acting on it our plant which

is bringing us to reaching the 2030

targets and surpassing them and more

announcements to come throughout this

week is going to make sure that people

know that we have to fight climate

change but we can do it in a right way

that is responsible and helps homeowners

announcing will not get you above

seventy-nine megatons we know that we

are going to reach our 2030 targets

we've gotten three-quarters of the way

there in just four years

and over the next 11 years not only will

we meet those targets we will surpass

them and we will be well on our way to

Net Zero by 2050 the Conservatives

simply don't get it and that's the

choice the Canadians are facing right

now

do we take climate change seriously do

we help families with more money up

front to retrofit their homes and

renovate or do we do what the

Conservatives are saying and give them

less money in a tax credit

once they've spent the money it doesn't

make sense because conservatives don't

get it new Volkl Sol point set apart on

optimist are you likely talked with

Carla about this but the George Massey

tunnel replacement project is a pretty

big issue in Delta is this on the

federal government's radar and are you

going to be or have you talked with a

province yet regarding some sort of

funding arrangement on whatever option

is chosen

we made the decision in 2015 that the

federal government needed to be a

partner investing in priorities for

community

right across the country we also made

the determination that Ottawa wasn't the

best positioned to determine what

exactly a community's needs were and we

have been there with billions of dollars

on the table to work in partnership with

provinces and municipalities on their

priorities that's why we are working

with the province alone their priorities

and I'm very much listening to both

local representatives municipal leaders

and and the province on where and what

they need to invest in for the future of

these communities the federal government

will be there as a partner but we will

not determine what the right choice for

Delta and for a PC is we will respect

the province and the municipalities in

their decisions Chris le from the

National Post and your Global News

interview you said that we're not

looking at decriminalizing hard drugs at

all why would you not at least consider

a measure that could ensure that addicts

have access to a safer supply of troye

but safer consumption safer supply

harm-reduction these are all

science-based approaches that we fully

support we have moved forward on safe

consumption safe supply harm reduction

in ways that is having a real impact on

this terrible opioid académica Demick we

know far too many families individuals

people from coast to coast to coast but

particularly here in BC have suffered

from the loss of loved ones from

devastating losses in their communities

and that's why we have a broad and

serious approach on this but the

contrast once again and the choice

Canadians are facing is clear the

Conservatives have continued to stand

against harm reduction and safe supply

they continue to not understand that a

science-based responsible approach to

fighting addictions is needed to help

these communities and these individuals

who've suffered why not even consider

decriminalization we are always looking

at the science and the evidence on the

best way forward and as I've

said we're not looking at

decriminalization as part of our plan
