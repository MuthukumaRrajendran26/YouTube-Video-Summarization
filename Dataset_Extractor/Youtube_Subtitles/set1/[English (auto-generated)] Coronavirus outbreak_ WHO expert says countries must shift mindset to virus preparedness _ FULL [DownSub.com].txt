course thank you so again a really

apologies for keeping you all waiting

but I just got off the plane and been a

rather frantic a little bit of time

trying to get a few things finalized

before I spoke with you so what I wanted

to do today was as you saw yesterday I

gave a press briefing in in China it was

rather long and and would have taken you

a little time to listen through I'm not

sure everyone saw it so what I'd like to

do is summarize some of the big points a

little more quickly than I did yesterday

but if there's specific points people

want us to dig into after I'm happy to

do that but what I thought might be most

useful for the press today is up I spoke

to three big questions which are around

the issue of you know what has China

actually done in terms of the response

and how have they done it which is a

extremely important to where we go next

with this let's say the second thing I

want to talk a little bit about is what

the impact of their approach has been

and then finally to some of the

implications as we go forward so I'm

going to touch those three big questions

I might spend a little bit of time on

each just before jumping into that I

think as most of you know the genesis of

the mission it was a request or a

decision actually by the president of

China in a meeting with dr. Ted Rose

with a joint feeling that China had done

a huge amount of work and it would could

inform let's say both the global

response as well as China's own response

to have an independent mission come in

and have a review and an assessment of

what had been done and lessons for the

way forward so we put the team together

and and the ended constituted 25 people

there were 13 internationals headed by

myself and then there was a team from

China I shouldn't say a team there was a

group from China that were part of the

team because it was very much an

integrated team

so 12 from the China side people maybe I

just I know there's been a lot of

interest of who was actually on the team

there was in addition to myself from the

side of China leading the response was

dr. Liang wanyan who anyone involved in

the response there will will will know

he's the actually the head of what's

called the expert group in China for the

coronavirus response he was my

counterpart and then we had from the

international side I'll just run through

we had Tinicum Ekman's who's with the

Robert Koch Institute in Germany we had

Dale Fisher from the who's actually the

chair of the Gorn Group right now and is

a professor at the University of Natal

University of Singapore we had chick way

a heck Raisa who many of you will know

is the director-general of the Nigerian

CDC cliff Lane who's a clinical director

at the at NIH in the u.s. we had John

Cooley from the National Solar

University College of Medicine and dr.

leave some of you may remember from the

MERS outbreak and in in Seoul he

actually led that that response and then

we had Gabriel lung of course the Dean

of Medicine from the University of Hong

Kong and China we had two participants

from Russia Alexandre seminoff who's the

deputy director of the st. Petersburg

Pasteur Institute and Natalya shank

Anaya who is the head of international

the International Department and

infectious diseases in in the National

Medical Research Center in Moscow I'm

trying to read in from this to make sure

I don't forget anyone actually hey Toshi

Takahashi from the National Institutes

of infectious disease in Japan

Maria Van Kirk Kove who many of you know

usually sits to the left of dr. Ted Rose

I believe during the briefings at w-h-o

does on the evolving epidemic and then

we have from the International side also

weigh gong zu from Center for Disease

Control in Atlanta

and if I remember correctly that was it

from the International side and we'll

put the list up of the internationals as

well as the national experts from China

side so that everyone has access to

those maybe just a couple of words about

what we did as you may have seen in the

press conference yesterday we started in

Beijing I was there for a week

beforehand arranging the mission looking

at a lot of preliminary data etc and

then the full team arrived on Saturday

we spent Sunday and getting ready and

then kicked off Sunday evening and just

to give you a sense of how the work is

being done in China right now

much of the team and the ministries we

needed to work with were very very

engaged actually on Sunday and so the

meeting actually kicked off at 7:00 at

night and we worked till about midnight

and just after midnight with multiple

ministries and we had Wuhan and a video

conference for a couple of hours of that

as well and that was quite typical of

the working days quite frankly so if I

ramble a little bit in various

directions folks it's because of some

pretty severe sleep deprivation right

now so so apologies for that so we

started there and then we spent about a

just a day than in Beijing meeting with

some of the national institutions as

well as the Beijing municipality to

understand how they worked

we looked not only at the you know

national level the municipality level

but they were right down to the

community level to try and understand

how things actually operated in terms of

case fighting in contact tracing and

also to speak to a lot of physicians

contact tracers really to get a feel for

what was working what wasn't working how

things had evolved over the last last

six or seven weeks from there the team

went in two different directions one

part of the team went to - Guangdong

Province and then that's a very large

industrial problems you may know just

bordering hong kong and then another

part of the group went to Szechuan and

then from Szechuan join the Guangdong

group and then part went to whoo-ha

myself included for a day and a half

just word the end of the mission prior

to the wrap-up and then the press

conference in Beijing so we actually

covered a fair amount of territory in

every place we saw facilities we saw

contact tracing we even saw markets in a

couple of places we saw the railway

stations the airports the gosh what did

we see annex but we really it was quite

an exhaustive and exhausting schedule

and and and as I as I go through this I

really want to pay tribute to the people

in all of those places because we asked

hundreds and hundreds of people probably

thousands of questions and often the

same ones again and again from different

directions to try and triangulate a lot

of information or really understand how

robust it was and this is really

important in a crises like this one

because as you'll understand it were

only when I started there six weeks into

this so they've been moving very very

fast people were exhausted huge amounts

of things have been done things were

changing very very fast so trying to

accurately build what had happened and

and how what it looked like took a fair

amount of time and I just want to pay a

tribute to the team yes but especially

to the people who spent so much time in

the middle of this doing it because they

were they were really shattered and and

and doing and had the important you know

life-saving work of running a Crisis

Response I also want to clarify by the

way just as we kick off and I'll get

into the issues right now I promise I'm

speaking for the mission here as the

team lead for a mission that was

independent of w-h-o I've actually not

briefed dr. Ted Rose he's actually not

seen the report this report is from the

team and represents work done by the

team together the last three a couple of

days was the Chinese our Chinese

counterparts our internationals working

very very closely together in small

groups on a lot of different issues to

to nail a lot of this down and so the

reports just being submitted I had to do

some final edits so that's what took me

late now just being submitted right

so let me run through those three big

issues that I said so the first was what

did China what what have they actually

done and what what they've done is they

as I mentioned in the press conference

yesterday they've approached a brand new

virus has never been seen before that

was as you know escalating and and and

and and quite frightening in January and

they have taken very standard and what

some people think of as old-fashioned

Public Health tools very basic Public

Health tools and applied these with a

rigor and and innovation of approach on

a scale that we've never seen in history

basically they have taken case-finding

contact rationed social distancing you

know movement restriction and used that

approach to try and stop a new emergent

respiratory borne pathogen and as most

of you know for you know flu planning

etc most of the you're thinking is

buying enough time to get your vaccine

rolled out to try and reduce morbidity

mortality and here there was no vaccine

there was no therapeutic and the Chinese

took a very pragmatic approach and

decided we are going to go after

containment of this virus using that set

of of tools and a lot of people in the

world and I have to admit myself

included and certainly a lot of people

on the team would have been very cynical

wrong word but maybe concerned as to

whether or not you can truly stop that

kind of a pathogen because it runs

counter to thinking or respiratory

pathogen you could actually find the

cases isolate the cases do the contact

tracing and and and and achieve that

kind of an outcome but what China did

was they they took a very as we dug into

this and it took some time to understand

it properly they took a very systematic

approach and there were five key things

that they did in applying this that were

some of them different but all of them

impressive and critical

making it work so the first thing they

did was they took a differentiated

approach because they realized

immediately if you try and do and when

you think of China people often think

about the lockdown in Wuhan right but

which is a giant city of 15 million

people but that was just mu Han in other

parts of the country the the

fundamentals were always the same but

then the degree of application was

different and it was tailored to the

context of setting the intensity of

transmission etc so the first key thing

was this differentiated approach if

there are zero cases sporadic cases

clusters of cases or community

transmission like they had in in Wuhan

the approach was differentiated and that

was important because a lot of people

say you can't do this at scale because

you will exhaust your response that I've

heard that a number of time people

saying who we have to switch to another

mitigation approach or whatever because

you'll exhaust but the Chinese

pragmatically said not if you tailor

this properly the second thing that they

did was they mobilized a phenomenal

collective action and cooperation by the

people of China to this response and the

interesting thing is that people have

commented on that and say oh that's easy

in a society or a political system like

China it isn't it's never easy to get

the kind of passion commitment interest

and an individual sense of duty that

it's our duty to help stop this virus I

mean we spoke to hundreds of people in

hotels on trains and planes who are

quite outside the system and they all

shared the sense of responsibility

accountability to be part of this and

the most stunning demonstration of it

was when we pulled into the train

station at night in and it was a special

train because right now I mean it's the

saddest thing in Wuhan the trains roar

right through the station I mean

continually now for a month the big

intercity trains they roll right through

with the blinds down and if you're

living in the building surrounded

watching him and people accept that

there but you know we're the only train

that stopped so that you know six of us

could get off that train and be be part

of this and as I got off by the way

another group got off and I said well

hang on I mean I thought we were the

only people allowed to get off in Wuhan

and this was a group that have these

little jackets on and a flag it was a

medical team coming in from Guangdong to

be part of the 40,000 health care

workers from other parts of China that

have come in many of whom volunteered to

go into Wuhan and help with the response

but the the level of collective action

and the striking part when you pull in

is you pull into the city of skyscrapers

and massive boulevards and this is not a

village there's a city of 15 million

people a modern city and as you as you

drive into the city you know in the dead

of night with the lights on it's a ghost

town but behind every window and every

skyscraper there are people cooperating

with this response and you know people

have said yeah but you know there's a

big presence forcing them there isn't

invisible it's it's it's it's staggering

and every person you talk to there has a

sense that they're mobilized like in a

war against this virus and they're

organized so that's the second big thing

this collective action the third big

thing is they've repurposed the

machinery of government and I often hear

people talk about in all of government

approach and I never know what that

means but then when you see and you hear

from China they have repurposed

transportation does this they've run the

trains this way they manage the roads

that way as part of the response than

the toll booths and the checkpoints Dada

the the agriculture does this the the

forestry folks do that but everyone has

a role and it's been repurposed to fit

into this machinery and it works through

a prevention and control task force that

answers straight to the State Council

and president to run the whole machinery

of government in in support the third

thing that was really a fourth thing

pardon me was it's it's a technology was

freight turbocharged we're

phonce they are using big data in a I in

places I guess people have got a sense

in China nobody uses money I couldn't

pay for anything I took money out and it

gets difficult to pay because everybody

pays with with WeChat on their phones

they used to pay for everything and the

life has lived online big chunks of it

and from a distance I hadn't appreciated

that but what they've done is when it

came to the response they had to manage

massive amounts of data massive numbers

of contacts because remember they were

trying to find every case trace every

contact of 70,000 cases across vast

areas and know where they were follow

that up so you manage all of that data

and then you've got to be able to map

that Lincoln to to to other sources of

data etc so that was one piece of it but

the second thing they had to do was

because of the sheer numbers you had to

take whole hospitals and take them out

of general service and make them

basically response hospitals for kovat

19 cases which means you know you've

taken major hospitals in in a city and

you've repurposed them multiple ones for

this response because there are so many

cases and and people would would ask

then well what about all the regular

patients so they kept some designated

patient hospitals obviously for regular

services they delayed a lot of things

like elective surgeries etc but then a

whole chunk of work and and and and

someone in one place that 50% of their

consultations are now done online they

just moved a whole bunch of what was

normally done physically online to be

able to keep the regular health services

going prescriptions turned over etc in a

very orderly manner and then the final

piece of course was just everyday life

you have to feed 15 million people

you've got to keep the food moving all

done through deliveries all made online

etc little I talked to some people and

said well how does that work and they

said well every now and again something

missing from a package but you know

we're I haven't lost anyway that's what

she actually said to me one of the

people I asked and in one of the well in

in in in

and then the last piece of this which

was was equally impressive was how

science-driven the response is there as

well because remember we've known if

kovat and and it sounds like we we've

been living this forever but this is

eight weeks we're eight weeks into this

and the science has evolved so fast that

China has had its issued while we were

there they issued the sixth set of

clinical guidance how to take care of

the cases and imagine that I mean you

know how long it takes for whu-oh to

generate a guideline right then you try

and get it out and get people using

these things the same in every country

here they had turned over the national

guidelines how to take care of these

severely sick patients six times by six

weeks every single one of the places we

went we asked them how they're managing

patients we're using the six guideline I

mean how is that it came out yesterday

but and and so there's a speed of

turnover to try and stay on top of the

of the learnings on this so it's a

science driven very agile response as

well at a phenomenal scale so what they

did again it sounds so easy right oh

they did case finding in contact tracing

well they did this in an extraordinary

way with an extraordinary rigour of

application and discipline and

differentiated approach incredible

collective action repurpose the

machinery of government to make it work

technologically powered and science

driven and they applied that then to

what was an escalating remember the

exponential growth of the disease that

you were seeing and in places they

remember every place that's hitting

these days you're seeing exponential

growth again right and so and most

people you keep hearing the debate on TV

about and and everywhere which

fascinates me you know is this a

pandemic or not folks this is a rapidly

escalating epidemic in different places

that we've got to tackle super fast to

prevent a pandemic I mean it's it's

actually what China demonstrates is

where this goes is within the control of

our decisions to apply this

kind of rigor and approach to to to this

disease and it's outbreak and you saw

yesterday some of you have seen this and

I brought it along again today because

we get to the second question then of

okay great we understand the approach

now and and that took some time to

understand it and understand how does it

actually work at you know each level and

that was another big learning I'm

interested in the differentiation apart

but what was interesting as they went

through this was that there was a lot of

latitude like the big rules of the game

were in place but provinces counties

you know towns they could adapt it as

they needed to be able to make it work

for them and so as you went from one to

another the fundamentals were all was

the same you know you're tracing

contacts not cats right I mean the

fundamentals are the same but they were

adapted to be able to work for for for

for that specific area um by the way

someone asked me once he said okay we've

seen the big cities but what about the

rural areas what was happening there and

what we're in Sichuan we looked at that

and this comes back to the technology

part went to the operation center and

said well how is that working and so

they had teams out there all over the

place that we're doing the case fine

investigations contact tracing but well

that's great but how do you know how

it's working etcetera and they have

standard indicators to trace all that

stuff but they they said well we made a

decision in in in Chengdu right at the

beginning the governor explained this to

me that as we rolled out our 5g platform

we were not going to prioritize Chengdu

we were going to use this to make the

connectivity with the rural areas work

so we could run the kovat response

basically in real time and so when we

were in one of these place you went to

the operation center and they'd had a

new cluster and they had mapped out so

they've one big screen on the wall that

had the the transmission chains that

mapped out and and there was a problem

with it and I asked something about that

and they said we can speak to them and

they pulled up on the other side the

operation center in this county and so

we talked to them about what they're

finding in the red

we just took a while and then again

there was a question so they said well

hang on a minute and then they pulled up

another screen and there was the team

that was out in the field actually

trying to do this but the whole thing is

linked up and they're in constant

contact trying to make sure that

together they solve the problems of of

trying to sort out the the transmission

so so the question then was okay well

what's the the the impact of this

because because there has been you know

obviously we this is happening elsewhere

there's exponential growth and and as I

said yesterday it's it's the you know

unanimous assessment of the team that

they have changed the course of this

outbreak what was a you know a rapidly

escalating outbreak has plateaued and

then come down faster than one would

have expected if we had looked at the

natural dynamics of of an outbreak like

this and and that's that's you know

striking and and and so what I showed

yesterday was this graphic here which I

think is really helpful because what you

can see here you know notwithstanding

this reporting spike here

but what you're looking at here is you

know what you what you call a you know

exponential growth right growth rate

here at the beginning of this curve

going up like that and if you look at

this side you can see it's actually

coming down more slowly because what

happens the normal what would happen

with an exponential growth is we go up

and up and up like that and then you

would see a normal distribution and it

would come down like that but that's a

normal I mean you've seen these normal

distributions right that's what would

happen if it runs through community but

when you start doing all of this which

are the interventions then you can you

know ideally try and change the shape of

that and that's what China has actually

done to my surprise as and it was one of

those things that you know and spent 20

30 years in this business it's like

seriously gonna try and change that with

those tactics and and yes and and it was

successful or it is being successful

because look where the cases are driven

right now and

one of the things we looked at was okay

well if that curve will go like that

you know big question mark how many

cases have been prevented or at least

delayed as a result of this action and

you know rough back of the envelope you

know we look at it it's hundreds of

thousands of people in China did not get

Kovan 19 because of this aggressive

response and anytime you pull down the

force of infection from the epicenter in

an outbreak like that you are gonna

reduce the probability of it going

elsewhere as well that was the other big

thing we heard again and again from

anyone in China was it's our

responsibility to do this for the world

not just for them so we heard that quite

a number of times so the question then

became okay because we'd heard before

getting there of course are the is this

real and you know one of the comments I

made yesterday was we know the numbers

have bounced around as they've gone down

people have asked questions what's going

on today how come the numbers have gone

up etc and you know what we as

epidemiologists are interested in it's

not the exact number on an exact day

we're interested in the trend and you

want to know is that trend real is this

going down is it stable or is it going

up because there were questions about

things aren't being shared etc and so

when we dug into that we looked at you

know multiple different there's multiple

different ways you can try and get a

sense of where the trend is going and

one thing you can do is you can talk to

doctors who are seeing patients who are

running these massive hospitals and you

know everywhere you were hearing the

same thing that you know we have open

beds then in Wuhan it was like we have

open beds we can get people out of you

know isolation centers into a proper

hospital bed we're able to you know the

system is opening up because the number

of cases are going down you know one

indication another one we looked at was

they've established what they call fever

clinics and these are places where if

you have a fever you go and they assess

you and they do a CT scan very quickly

they do to see whether or not you've got

the tell-tale marks of kovat 19 disease

and

which is amazing story and self but and

then and then at these fever hospitals

and a decision is made they do the test

whether whether or not you need to test

and then they do the test and then

whether or not you need to be isolated

in a facility etcetera so the another

thing we looked at well how many people

are getting tested because what's

happened is as people have you know this

mobilization of the community has

happened there's been more and more

people who want to be tested quite

frankly and so they've been going and

getting tested the numbers have been

going up and um and up in terms of

people getting tested initially and at

one point it peaked at about I think

forty six thousand people were being

tested almost daily across the country

huge numbers and then it's down when we

looked at about a week and a half ago

down to thirteen thousand was going down

like that and when we went and talked to

the people at the fever clinic you know

they were sitting there not scanning

people or not testing people and they

said you know this is a change we had

lines and and they aren't there anymore

that's the second indicator that that is

real it's coming down and then a third

indicator which was interesting I I

spoke to again I mentioned this

yesterday so sorry be redundant a

fantastic researcher a man called Chow

Benton who is running a remedy severe

trial severe and mild cases in Wuhan and

it's being done in Wuhan of course

because that's where you have the

highest number of cases you get the

fastest enrollment and we try and get an

answer on this interesting drug as

quickly as possible and so what I was

talking to him I said so how was Roman

going and he said it's a challenge it's

slowing down it is slowed down because

there are not enough new patients that

we can actually recruit into the trial

so you know this all comes back to that

question of is this real is what I

described you and you know there's

extraordinary mobilization to implement

fundamental Public Health principles and

approach in the absence of a vaccine or

a or drugs you know in the presence of a

respiratory disease can this bring this

down and it can and that's the core

message right we're we're

we're getting new reports daily of new

outbreaks and new areas and people a

sense of oh we can't do anything and

people arguing is it a pandemic or not

well sorry

why don't you go look at have you got a

hundred beds where you can isolate

people if you have to have you got a

wing of a hospital that you're gonna

close off have you got 30 ventilators

because you're gonna have to help keep

the severe cases alive for you know

they'll recover but they're gonna need

to be ventilated for four or five days

or a week you know do you have those

pieces do you know who you're a thousand

case you know contact tracers are these

there's really practical things you can

do to be ready to be able to respond to

this and and that's where the focus will

need to be so we looked at this and said

okay the first question I talked about

what was done the second what was the

impact and and and the impact was was

striking oh I showed yesterday another

graphic which might just be useful for

people because in some ways this is more

striking than the national one so what

you see here this is the same as when

you just saw these are the data for all

of China right so going up fast fast

fast like that abrupt flat toe and then

the skewing as it goes down rather than

up like that a bell curve and down out

like this but then if you look at and

you can see this is this is Wuhan right

here which was really driving the main

shape of that and these are the other

areas of who Bay and this is China

outside and who Bay and remember there's

a lot more people who live outside of

the province of Hebei than live in whom

Bay but this is a much smaller curve

number one the other thing the shape is

a very flat curve as well part of it's a

scale but this is not the shape of a

normal epidemic and that happens when

you do something to try and change it

which is what China has managed to do

and what's striking is how far down

they've gotten it if I remember

yesterday someone told me I've heard so

many figures I think I've heard more

figures than there are people in China

over the last two weeks but I think one

of the figures I heard yesterday was at

zero out of 20 or sorry 24 province

has had reported zero cases for a day

and and that's remember there were 31

provinces infected only only three weeks

ago again evidence and all of these are

as big as any one of the countries that

have been you know in the news recently

with their outbreaks and and that's a

very hopeful thing which brings us to

the third thing that we were looking at

is okay where do you go next with China

where do you go next with the with this

in terms of the global response and and

and and one thing to mention first is

that you know China were not acting from

scratch China had had the SARS epidemic

or an outbreak rather remember in 2003

and they realized they had to set up

surveillance for a typical ammonia's and

and other surveillance systems that they

needed to be able to do case finding and

contact tracing you know at a much

larger scale etc so they had had time

and experience to build a system but in

terms of where they go next in China and

and you know having seen so much of what

they were done it was a little bit

humbling to be asked for opinions about

okay where we go next and a lot of it

was really reinforcing what what China

is already doing and the first piece of

it is you know the vigilance cases are

down but they're not zero there is still

a lot of disease in in in the country

that that's got to be dealt with and

remember the people who get sick they

remain in hospital or in an isolation

center for anywhere from two to six

weeks so it's a long period of time so

if you have all of these people that got

you know thank you let's use this so if

you have all of these people let's go

back a few weeks so if we go back two or

three weeks right so you're back here if

you have all of these people that were

sick at that time and you've got to add

some of the ones who are saying cuz

that's just who are sick on that day or

that week remember so then you got to

add the ones before so an awful lot of

those people are still in hospital or a

holding center

holding Center for me you know in

isolation Center so right now the number

if I remember correctly yesterday was

was just over 50,000 people are still

recovering from kovat 19 across across

China but one of the other things we

learned though is the spectrum of the

disease you know there's been a lot of

question about okay what is really the

spectrum of disease that this causes

what's the natural history of it we got

a lot of information there because of

just the sheer numbers now and and as

the epidemic or the outbreak goes

forward and they start to get control

there's time to analyze a lot of that

information more clearly so now they can

generate and this I take absolutely no

credit for just this nice piece of work

but this was done by the Z control for

the report and what they've done here is

try to help people be able to visualize

well what proportion are mild or common

when they're when they're found what

proportion are severe what proportion

are critical critically ill patients and

I think you have a sense now like the

mild cases may just have a fever and a

cough and and and by the time you get to

the common they usually have a pneumonia

nor a bit sicker but frankly they're

still mobile and and and in good shape

the severe are the ones by the simplest

way to say that is the next step is they

usually have respiratory insufficiency

of some sort like their oxygen

saturation is going down their breathing

rate is going up etc and then the

criticals usually have by then often

multi organ failure and what we are able

to see from this is okay what proportion

fall into each group and you can see

eighty percent are mild and of those and

a really important insight from china's

well how many of those will go on to

severe disease or even death you can see

from the miles and the commons very

small proportion this is really mild

with pneumonia with severe a larger and

the worst outcomes of course and the

critical but now we're getting to the

sheer weight of numbers that help us

understand

that that's really important because

you've got a plan how many beds might

you need how long are you gonna need

them for one of the outcomes gonna be

like how many are gonna become severe

and you're going to need possibly

ventilation etc these are really

important things to be able to plan that

also if you want to plan a clinical

trial you need to understand well would

they get worse without the drug or not

would they go for it so you need this

kind of information is so important and

China right now are the only ones who

have been able to generate with the kind

of numbers to be able to to help us on

under understand that but what it means

is they still have fifty thousand cases

as we mentioned the thing is any new

cases now they generally know where

they've come from they can link them

epidemiologic a or link them to a

contact and that's when you know as

you've heard from a bola de that that's

when you know you're getting control of

a situation you're not getting cases

from out of the blue and you can't link

them back which is what's sometimes so

concerning so that's the first thing the

second big thing which is a really

important message from China is every

governor we talk to you you know that

most of them they had an epidemic curve

that was going down like that and what

were they doing in response building

hospital beds buying ventilators and

being prepared that's what they were

doing they were saying okay look we just

repurposed hospitals that should be

giving general care if these cases go

back up again and that was always what

they came back to we don't know this

virus people are talking about SARS

or they're talking about flu and as soon

as we get stuck with those that - binary

you know approaches and ways of thinking

we're not preparing for the novel clone

of writers we're comparing preparing for

that or preparing for this but we're not

using all the evidence that we have and

and one of their key points they made

again and again was we don't know what's

going to happen next in China we've got

it right down like this we think we can

manage him there will not be another

Wuhan we know how to manage this disease

now in all the parts of the country if

it went to zero and disappeared that'd

be

right but that's not what they're

planning for what they're planning for

is this could remain for some time maybe

some time to lose a vaccine so we will

have the capacities to be able to manage

it and run society and economy and

everything else the way we need to and

not lock people down to try and and and

and and manage this so that's the second

big thing there do them it's a good

message for the world right how many

countries are you planning hospital beds

planning ventilators planning you know

Oh to supplies and and and the lab

capacity to be able to manage this and

then the third thing that you know he we

said an ass of China you know at this

point the world needs the experience of

China China has dealt with the most

disease in the world 31 provinces have

managed this everyone we spoke to they

knew what they were doing and they've

clinically managed huge numbers of cases

now and you know one of the points you

heard me mention yesterday is countries

are building barriers between themselves

and China and new barriers are going up

in the last days at a time when the

cases and the risk from China are going

down and you need access to that

expertise that much more you also need

China and it's it's getting its

productivity going as you've heard

they're getting they're doing a phased

restart of everything so they're getting

the you know the factories going then

eventually they'll they'll get the

schools going and then they'll but

they're taking a phased approach to try

and manage the the the startup now as

they go forward and so for China there

were a number of suggestions about how

to move forward and a lot of it was

reinforcing some things that were

already happening but then for the rest

of the world and that were those were

the bigger things that you heard me

speak about yesterday perhaps but the

first thing in the response is there has

to be a shift in mindsets again around

the world people are thinking oh gosh

how do we live with this and manage all

this disaster etc instead

of gosh this virus has got to come it's

going to show up in our country we're

gonna find it within the first week

we're gonna find every case we're gonna

go after every contact we are gonna make

sure that we can isolate them and keep

these people alive so they survive the

case this is the way we've got to be

think it takes a real shift in mindset

and it's not a preparedness mindset

we're usually thinks about how you

prepare for eventual disasters this is

going to come soon potentially you've

got to be shifting to a readiness rapid

response thinking and you know in China

one of the interesting things was not

only did they designate a whole Hospital

and these are big modern facilities have

hundreds of beds as okay that one's

gonna manage it when you go up and think

okay how do you actually do that in

practice how do you keep it safe so you

go to a ward you know if you go to hug

here or to the tour I'm sure most of you

have unfortunately had a visit one of

those places you know you've got your

oak boards right with some doors at the

beginning of the ward well what what

China has done rather than have some

beds that are isolation beds is at the

start of that ward they've built a wall

with a window on it they sealed the

whole thing and said the whole ward all

that whole 40 beds Hunter beds is now an

isolation unit

it's just everything at scale very very

fast

they've taken a stadium which which I

saw they put a thousand beds up 72 hours

you know the it's it's you've seen these

hospitals being built over a week but

they went from they would convert a

training center or a stadium in between

24 and 72 hours that was a time frame

they took a move on to increased by a

thousand their capacity and it was it

was such a disciplined approach to put

to put that in place but again a good

lesson it's okay we're gonna try and not

have wounds and deal with lu han's

obviously but you may have to deal with

sporadic cases definitely we're seeing

that in many places they get sporadic

cases we're also seeing clusters of

cases and as soon as you start seeing

that in places you have to be ready to

manage this at a larger scale you have

to be ready you know in your mind

to stop the transmission change have to

be thinking that way and and and so

there has to be the mindset shift number

one and there's got to be the readiness

planning and capacity building and it

has to be done fast so yesterday when I

said you know second big conclusion for

the world is it's simply not ready but

it could get ready very fast but the big

shift has got to be in the mindset about

what we're gonna how we're gonna manage

the disease the third big thing you know

the rest of the world and and probably

this is the first one is you've got to

get your population ready and bring your

population with you and your populations

you know they should be washing their

hands now they should be proper you know

hygiene now those things that we should

be doing anyway

should be at scale in countries because

they will make a difference to the

spread of a respiratory borne disease

but you've got to bring your population

with you and your population you want to

bring them with you early because things

are gonna change rapidly and they've got

to have a trust in a way and a machinery

to keep people up to date yes we said

that we have new information now we do

it this way because it's we have known

this virus for seven weeks so we are

going to have to adapt as we get the the

strategy rolled out and and and the you

know the fourth thing I would say if as

we look at okay the rest of the world

would be access the expertise of China

and the you know they've done this at

scale they know what they're doing

and they're really really good at it and

they're really keen to help even though

they are still working in their own

areas and this was another message that

you heard all the time in China it was a

fantastic story of the human side it was

always about the people and the

individuals everywhere you went

front firm from any anyone you spoke to

and there was a sense of responsibility

and cellent

sense of you know collective action and

this war footing to get things done but

the the the other thing that was

striking was the Solidarity between

provinces because remember every

province in in China has been

by an unknown pathogen that started to

do this in the province their response

was to get on top of than their own

provinces but to send medical teams PPE

everything into Wuhan you know when I

met with the governor's they said yeah

we just sent two thousand people into

Wuhan and to-to-to to work and you

wonder how does that even work right so

you go to the stadium and say wow how

does that work and there's you know one

of the physicians says well I'm from and

from from Henan or bomb dong or River

was and he says we run that you know

that one I told you that was boarded off

we run that one they just bring a whole

team and run the whole thing and they

bring all their own PPE all their own

equipment they pull it out of that

province and remember what we're seeing

in the rest of the world

well we better build up our stocks and

keep it over here oh we better keep this

here we better keep our you know

whatever but there's this sense of you

get the resources where they're needed

it's in our common interest to get this

down and and you saw the provinces

operating that way it was really

fascinating so those are the big

findings you know what China did the

real impact that it had the implications

are you can actually affect the course

of this disease you can change the shape

of this but it takes a very aggressive

and and and and and tough program it it

was a striking thing to see as you know

in 30 years of doing this business I

I've not seen this before and nor was I

sure it would work so we saw a bunch of

other things as well as I mentioned

there are a number of technical things

that we learned about disease severity

the natural history of disease how its

transmitted by the way even some of the

work being done on the amyloids and very

interesting but then also operationally

how do you run a response like that

right so talking that through with top

leaders how do you set up a stadium in

you know 72 hours walk through you do

one two three four I mean that makes

sense and then and then how you run

these kind of containment measures at

this scale so a lot of really good

learnings that

inform other parts of what we're trying

to do with this with this response I

would say let me one point because I

know they're big questions and I will

say as long as we need to try and help

with any of those but one of the big

questions that we keep hearing about and

you will have heard is about you know

how much transmission is going on in

communities right and you keep hearing

the tip of the iceberg and we can't see

this thing and you know there's millions

people infected and all this kind of

stuff so we tried to look at those kind

of questions as well and we again you

know you're you're at war here and

there's a huge fog and any war you're

trying to find those little bits of

information that can add up and give you

some confidence in what you're saying so

we tried to look at what where was their

sampling of people in the population

that might give us a sense of how widely

this virus was was was was was spreading

and again this is where it's great to

look at these things in China because

the numbers are so big but you've

probably heard there's something called

an influenza-like illness surveillance

system that runs around the world with

many Sentinel sites that collect like 20

samples every month and we get them

analyzed etc but this happens in

multiple places of China and what you

could do is look at those data and they

could show you here or a data are

sampling here's all the flu cases that

were coming up and in November December

of last year they all went back to look

nobody because then once we had a you

know Kovan 19 tests they went back to

test all of these nobody found it it

wasn't there they found lots of flu but

then in January they did find it it

comes up in January the first couple of

weeks of January but outside of Huub a

very rare one might be positive here or

one there wasn't like all these samples

were positive like there was a lot of it

circulating and then another thing we

did is in in places that were heavily

infected more and more people were

coming to fever clinics and wanted to

get tested etc and in one place in might

even Guangdong I think they had tested

320,000 samples for

Kovach ovid virus 320,000 right it's

gonna give you some sense what's going

on and when they started the sampling of

those about 0.49 I think it was percent

of them more positive so less than you

know half a percent and in the recent

period it's something like 0.02 percent

so I know everybody's been out there

saying well all of this thing is

spreading everywhere and we just can't

see a tip of the iceberg but the data

that we do have don't support that and

what it supports is sure there may be a

few asymptomatic cases and that probably

is a real issue but there's not huge

transmission beyond what you can

actually see clinically and esra

or you will need to be able to see your

enemy to know what you're dealing with

now another important development in

China just while we were there was

they've just licensed a couple of Siro

assays that will let them test

antibodies in a whole bunch of people to

try and get a sense of if they have any

buddies but they weren't sick you know

the virus was circulating so you know

maybe I'll be sitting here next week and

saying guess what those data didn't tell

us the story these ones do but that cero

survey should help us understand that

and that would be important for example

you want to reopen your schools you know

that kids have not gotten very sick or

very few have have a lot of them been

infected are they part of the driver of

this outbreak it doesn't look like it it

looks like the main driver is not

widespread community infection it looks

like it's household level infection that

may be part of the reason that China

strategy find the case because the close

contacts are families and people usually

know them and you're going to be able to

find them and be more successful and

remember you don't have fine every

single one because you never will you

want to find enough to break the big

change the transmission slow this thing

down and get a grip on it so that's why

we went what we saw was being done the

impact that we believe it had and how we

think it can inform the global response

I want to highlight again I am NOT

speaking for w-h-o because you know

someone may be going what but but that's

what the evidence says and you know when

you're in a war like this this is we had

a big debate with with some of our

Chinese colleagues about you know is

this a dangerous virus is a serious

virus is whatever but the bottom line is

this virus kills people you've seen that

and it kills vulnerable people that

kills our elderly and you know what we

think of a society is how we care for

the vulnerable in our populations not

just and I hear people say oh yeah but

the young survival is good you know

seriously and and it is and and that's

not all this case either young people do

die of this disease as you've seen as

well and they die in industrialized

countries and I think people were also

looking

times atlas and saying oh but in China

you know they don't have this they don't

have that etc you know if I had covin 19

I want to be treated in China you know

we go into these hospitals and and you

know how many ventilators do you have 50

60 I mean just a scale we're not used to

thinking on the rest and then you'd ask

you how many ECMO systems do you have

and I was like seriously you're gonna

ask about ECMO you know this is

extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and

it's to to when the lungs simply even if

your ventilator and kind of get enough

oxygen and place would say five and I

remember being with Tim from the Robert

Koch Institute like five in one hospital

you know we don't have that in Europe

and we're using three of them too and as

we were like well do they people come

out and they yeah so when we look at how

dangerous this diseases as well I think

we have to be careful looking at the

China data because China know how to

keep people alive from COBIT they're

super committed to it and they're making

a massive investment in it as well

that's not going to be the case

everywhere in the world and as you've

seen we've had tragically lost people in

you know g7 countries are dying of this

disease and so it is a serious disease

and and I worry sometimes if we look at

the China numbers people are gonna get a

false sense of security

but these people know and they care

about keeping these people alive and and

they do it successfully they're really

good at it folks that's what we saw

we've heard what we think can help

inform the global response it's never

black and white but sometimes will

present our reporting's a little bit

more black and white and in hopes that

it'll drive the discussion about where

we go next with the global response so

Margaret no one looks interesting to go

Bernard I think let's you guys know

Bernard Schwartz either the chef de

cabinet here and he said let's try to

add up how much many hours you slept in

the last 14 days and it barely gets into

the double digits so again sorry to run

on it so long but we saw a lot and it's

a complicated story so I wanted to make

sure you heard it before

I hear would it be helpful to clarify

thank you very much dr. Elwood I'd like

to be treated in China too

so just to remind everybody those of you

online if you want to ask a question

dial star nine and or if you're using

zoom put your hand up on the icon on the

screen on your right we'll start with

questions from the room sooo she's gonna

take from a question from I also want to

thank those of you who tried to contact

me I saw Jamie's hand went up first

because people phoned me and called me

in in China and the rest and and those

even know me running many crises

I try to be extremely available to the

press because I just think you're so

important to managing crises it's in my

interest and in this occasion we went to

a complete you know blackout because we

really had to focus on this we were

trying to inform a global response and a

danger of escalating disease and you

know people who might might call and say

well this happened there or that happen

there you know it gets you off-track we

just had to focus on what we're doing so

so thanks for the the patience for those

of you who are frustrated by that okay

I'm going to be very geometric we've got

four microphones one two three four so

I'll take a question over here from the

correspondent from cgta

ad on Central Television CCTV I have a

question that is about you mentioned

China has been successful in containing

the virus and and the disease is being

it's it's showing success they're not

putting the cart before the horse if

they said I said they're contained the

disease I'm gonna jump in on the

questions it's a little bit like I said

right we this is respire Tori borne

pathogen and when we think about things

like flu and the rest

okay we need a vaccine a man is that

because you can't get ahead of the

transmission of it so part of it's a

mindset shift that Gus this can actually

slow this thing down and frankly I think

the mindset shift is is the hardest part

it's really hard work too right

kind of easy to stake a vaccine in

someone's arm really hard find every

single case and you got to find him

super fast and get you know find every

contact get them isolated so there's

going to be a range of challenges one is

going to be that mindset shift the

second is the communities and

populations coming with it because to

accept quarantine to where where it's

needed to accept you know the rapid

isolation etcetera you know these are

gonna be challenges for for people as

well and materially right have we are we

ready to isolate that number of people

to support that number of people etc so

there's a combination of you know

mindset issues I think community gage

Minh tissues and and just material

issues but we've got to overcoming them

it's as simple as that

works so so so let me say a word about

that you know with Ebola we have a

vaccine right but it's not going to

replace case-finding contact tracing I

don't know how the vaccine for this

might look like you know we have sorrows

we have merged we don't have vaccines

out we've got great candidates but

they're not out there working they're

coronaviruses right and remember those

are the six human coronaviruses right

now there's those two and then there's a

for that cost common colds and things

like you've heard about we're not great

at coronavirus vaccines I mean the whole

world of people in the world a corona

virus vaccine a slaughter me because

they're gonna say we are great we're

just not using them but we don't have

the experience we do with flu and with

other other other diseases so you know

and China's very pragmatic don't know if

we're gonna get it we're gonna work on

it but we're gonna move this way and

that's where you heard again and again

just let's keep moving

okay another question from okay

Stephanie it's been two years I can't

remember which agency I'm supposed to

write

I wondered if I could draw you please um

infections among health care workers

sure do two parts so they have enough

equipment they are you seeing

transmission still in healthcare there

was a super important question Stephanie

asked about health care workers right

because if your health system goes down

you can't run your response early days

of Ebola in West Africa it was one of

the big big challenges we had and it's a

common thing when emerging disease

nobody knows right it's a hell you know

it enters through the healthcare system

remember that's where a virus is gonna

enter often because they come in looking

for care and and all of a sudden boom it

blows up and if I remember correctly

Italy had a had a had an issue so with

that so into in terms of China first on

the numbers of health care workers and

and this is a rough we always have to be

careful and differentiate health care

worker infections from knows a coma and

outbreaks so a knows the Komal outbreak

is an outbreak in a health care facility

right and that can be patients infecting

health care workers patients affecting

other patients I mean there can be

different ways it works and when you

look at health care workers people often

think oh that's an outbreak there most

health care workers got infected in the

community not in the healthcare workers

you get in there and you talk to people

who actually did that they can tell you

they say well no they know people often

knew where they got infected and you

know the ones that are in the press and

rightfully so are ones where it may have

happened in the health care facility but

the majority hadn't so there had to be a

two-pronged approach to this first was

making sure that you run your kovat

facilities safe and frankly that

that was was was being addressed

relatively early on but then remember I

told you so that's your covet hospital

right and this is your hospital for

regular care okay so I'm pregnant don't

feel great I'll go into the regular care

hospital or I've you know had had chest

pain and I'm having probably breathing

I'll go there and you go into the

regular hospital and you've got in fact

you've got kovat and so a number of the

ones that were happening we're actually

happening not in the kovat facilities

but they were happening in in in in the

regular facilities

you know Stephanie so so the first thing

you always have to do in these is trying

to figure out who's getting infected how

are they getting infected where are they

getting infected and then and then try

and fix it and again everywhere we went

this was a top priority and when you

went in and looked at okay how are you

managing infection prevention control

you know all the basics about clean

channels dirty channels you know we're

in place the supplies now largely in

place yeah I'd we never found anywhere

in there there may still be some that

where people did say it was really tight

and there were periods where this was a

real problem but again when you look at

the distribution of the healthcare

worker infections most of them are much

earlier in the outbreak and that's the

other thing that's what we're seeing I

mean you've seen in the countries that

get reinfected boom you get these

outbreaks because they're not used to

dealing with with the disease but are

they taking it seriously

absolutely are they good at it

absolutely are their numbers coming down

absolutely in terms of health care

worker infections and that's a good news

story within it but it also highlights

something that's a little bit different

because again we think SARS flu right

but this is is doesn't cause we haven't

seen big nose to call Miele outbreaks

like we have with the other diseases

right so so something's a bit different

you know we're not seeing a lot of

disease and kids you know look at flu

you know all the kids get sick right

we're which is a problem because

remember one of the big problems with

few well the kids who get sick and that

all the parents have to stay home and

then you lose billions of dollars and

you know you from your economy

that's how it works that doesn't happen

with this disease and we never by the

way when we talk to people we couldn't

find an example where a child was the

index case in a transmission chain or

had you know led to the infection of an

adult now that might just be people's

recall or bias or whatever but it was an

interesting insight because remember a

lot of things that we test in science it

comes from someone's observation and and

then you say okay is that why is that so

did I cover that well now Stephanie I'm

sorry I'm kind of rambling because it's

such an important issue yeah I mean oh

one other thing

nugget so we're in Wuhan and we couldn't

go into the fever clinic because you put

yourself at risk and I was gonna come

talk to you guys and I wasn't gonna put

my family at risk and there's no need to

but anyway the but we could see where

they started and went in and got Galland

and the rest to go in and we met this

woman there who explained the different

stages and the mirrors for how they

checked the gown properly etc and she

really knew she was she was so

impressive and so I said so you're like

an IPC expert she's like no god I do

know something completely different but

I've learned all of this stuff this is

the most important part of what we do

you know you found this passion

everywhere so you know Stephanie that

was important because he wondered are

people getting sent into the line of

fire right with without the proper

equipment and early in this people were

caught in the war without the right

equipment that that's kind of what

sounds like it happened but then you

know because if you were coming in from

another province you had to bring all

your PPE so you know these guys that

send in a team from you know on the knee

or one of these other provinces they

came with you know tons of equipment

they had to be self-sufficient and that

was one of the issues with me going in

there and I was told that I said look we

have a principle no one goes in without

their own gear and fortunately we bought

her brought a bunch of gear which was

all sitting in Beijing which I told our

rep on the phone guess what that's all

going to the ministry tomorrow but that

that's how it worked you found that

discipline in everything sorry okay

we'll take one more from this side a

gentleman there with his hand up

it's young with Xinhua News Agency from

which once were young with Xinhua News

Agency with a with great efforts to to

the control and prevent to the control

prevention of the disease China is also

trying to resume the economic activities

so it's like a large number of people go

back to the police's - to where they

work so is there any special aspects or

any parts that people should pay special

attention to when they go back to work

and resume the active economic

activities and and again the the

question I was asking is so important

right so you get this thing under

control then you get massive numbers of

people moving again because remember

they've all been stopped right and and

then they carry the virus into these

areas so a couple of things have changed

right number one these areas are

prepared they know how to deal with this

disease when it springs up etc the

second is is that they've done a phased

reopening of the the factories the

industries etc and in phasing that

they've been able to manage the risk as

as they've opened more and more of the

economy depends a little bit on the

province because most lot of them have

done it a little bit differently so some

went you know like the week of 8

February I think it was others went the

following week so so it's been rolled

out temporarily a little bit different

as well but the other thing that they've

done and this was interesting in Sichuan

when we met with the governor he said

look can we show you a video and he said

look this is really cool we will look at

everything and he showed this video that

they'd made and and again all of the

migrant workers what it did was it was

this video you play on your phone and it

gave you all this information if you're

a migrant working from Sichuan and you

want to go back somewhere you have got

to do X Y and Zaid and go to the one of

these facilities get screened you will

get a certificate that's valid for three

days and you show up and you know the

next city and then you will have to show

that and it can be scanned and uploaded

etc but there's a whole effort to manage

it you know at the community population

level but also at the individual level

and and that five million people migrant

workers that they were going to run

through this system that was one

province so it is a risk it's a it's and

they know it's a risk but they've

economies got to work it's people have

got to work life's good it's not life's

got to go on it's got a power the

response as well ok I'm going to go

online now and ask Helen brands while

she can have her questions hi Bruce oh

sorry I'm getting a reverb I would ask

you right off the top why you're not

wearing a mask if you don't mind but I I

would also ask you to go into what you

were saying about not finding much

undetected mild cases a bunch of us were

hoping that there would be more of the

iceberg to be uncovered to drive down

the severity of this outbreak and I

think you're suggesting that that is not

the no yeah we got your point through

the echo yeah so so so first don't don't

miss misquote me please

the this is a serious disease there's a

lot of disease when you get a lot of

community transmission going on you know

tens of thousands of cases in this place

so that's a lot but what I've heard

people say is there's a whole bunch more

of transmission there's not a lot of

evidence of that now we're gonna do

serologic surveys there's a 0a saying we

may find out Oh a lot more people were

positive a lot more people were affected

than we thought because remember with

flu right it's 10 20 30 40 percent of

the population will have may have

anybody suggesting that they've been

exposed in a flu season I'm not a few

experts oh so if I got the numbers wrong

but they're quite high all of the

sources of information that we looked at

Helen like for example we were very very

interested in any kind of sampling that

had been done at a population level and

in multiple provinces we could find okay

we've sampled

you know 10,000 people or we've sampled

50,000 people in in in let's say a just

regular Hospital clinics or something

like that so this is convenient sampling

right is not a study but in those they

were finding a very low proportion of

people actually had the virus now there

could be reasons for that right because

people are really restricted to their

homes they've you know closed

restaurants closed cinemas etc etc

there's all those things which means you

know and the goal was to break that

transmission so but as things resume

that that's going to be a really

important thing to look at but for that

to happen and remember there would have

to be a whole lot of mild cases that you

wouldn't find and in wuhan now you know

these people don't want anymore

transmission they want everybody

isolated and break the transmission

chains and they're going house to house

to check temperatures etc they're

probably not missing you know a huge of

a huge amount but not definite orders of

magnitude and then with you know

asymptomatic Segen it doesn't look like

that's a big part of the picture

there was just no data that supports

that so you know I have to make a

judgement you know Helen between what

are the data that I have and what are

the speculations that I can make in in

in worst-case scenarios and the data

doesn't say that the bits of data we

have I may be wrong as we generate more

data but but you know all the data that

we have suggests that there isn't this

massive the iceberg is you know you've

got critical cases you've got severe

cases you've got mild cases and I've

been asymptomatic transmission probably

at the bottom of that that seems to be

what it looks like but remember we've

known this disease for seven days there

are seven weeks sorry haven't slept in

seven days sorry how does that help

we can go into Jason going but also by

the way would you be able to do that to

the curve if this thing was going around

everywhere like that and you couldn't

see it hard to believe and so I have to

go with what I can see okay I will go

into Jason gay that's why I wasn't

wearing a mask oh sorry sorry sorry

you know I don't have Cove in nineteen

I'm very low risk yeah I did I and and

you know I had an hour long grilling um

before I did this when I came back

anyone coming back from travel has to on

the w-h-o side but also I never had any

exposures you know we were we are

careful and we run careful you know we

have no contact with patients we have no

contact with caught direct you know

close contacts with no contacts with

contacts we washed our hands every three

seconds we wore masks all the time

because we had to wear masks it's the

government policy in the country

we're social distance we were you know I

told you we're on trains and cars and

everything one person in a row

everywhere but that's why I'm so horse

because shout at everybody when we had

meals our meals were eaten in the hotel

rooms we weren't all the restaurants

were closed so we weren't even

interacting with our group and then when

we sometimes the we we were we were

working and we would oh we're like we

went to the CDC was between meetings who

went to CDC cafeteria for lunch they had

a table like this and then another table

like this one person at a table and it

was one setting at each table and you

weren't allowed to sit you had to shout

at each other and then I told you the

last day we were having a couple of days

we were working on the report so

Margaret to be on that table

you'd be on one table you on the next

table and we had to use microphones to

run the meeting but everything was

distance two meters apart and mmin air

and you know any of the hospitals we

went to we go into the clean section and

we go nowhere near you know there's a

dirty section and then there's also a

grey zone go near those things I'm

trying to give some other examples

because I had to go right through all of

this and then because I was going

out through Beijing to do the press

conference and Beijing as you know

Udacity how about people returning to

work

Beijing put in place a policy anyone

coming back from any province is

automatically in a two-week quarantine

in Beijing and that applies to us as

well unless we're in transit on the on

the way on the way out and so what they

said there's a lot of negotiation about

this when I got off the train from Wuhan

into Guangdong I had a swab yesterday

and they said you know we will we will

test you've been in the country for two

weeks are coming through Beijing and no

shit negotiated agreement for how we

manage this and it was negative but you

know it comes back to a science and

evidence-based approach to to what we're

doing if the evidence changes right and

there were any reason that I was at risk

I wouldn't be wearing a mask I wouldn't

be sitting here I'm not gonna put a mask

between me and you guys if you think

there's any kind of risk that doesn't

make sense I'm still taking another

question from online Jason Gail are you

there with your question Hey Bruce lots

of feedback so I will push ahead

you mentioned learning more about the

natural history of this disease how do

you think it typically starts and

manifests so it that's a good question

but as one speaks to people what they

remember is the fever of course and and

in eighty-eight percent now the nice

thing you know try there's fifty five

thousand cases and data on every single

one of them at the time onset and what

the report is eighty-eight percent say

we had fever 68 percent say they had a

dry cough and that's important numbers

because folks what percent have a runny

nose

throw a guest out there because you know

you always see people going around

sniffling and the rest of mariota they

have Kovac 19 4% you know it's not it's

not an upper respiratory tract infection

so but Jason sorry back to your question

so they report that or the report just

the couple of days before having what we

call pros Romo like syndromes they feel

fatigue

do they fight Fela myalgia they feel

unwell you know it's just a general on

wellness so part of this is having a

high index of suspicion if you think

you've been exposed to someone because

because they they they they either

present with that fever a dry cough or

that prodromal nonspecific malaise you

know aches and and fatigue is that

coverage Jason actually to ask you what

what's causing the pneumonia to progress

to acute respiratory distress syndrome

and multi organ failure what do we know

about that that was interesting because

a couple of places had documented the

data fairly well it's not published yet

but what looks like about 80 percent of

these are as I mentioned mild at time of

detection about 13% severe and about six

percent in critical condition and then

if you look at the percent that

progressed from one to another about 15

percent seemed to progress from mild to

severe and then from severe to critical

because I thought it was a higher

percent but it's about 15 to 20 percent

again Jason that's what those numbers

look like and then if you look at the

survival rates per group that that's

pretty well published right extremely

high in in in in the miles and then I'd

have to pull the numbers out but but the

high mortality obviously is in the

suvir's and especially the criticals and

here you have to be careful right

because people say well what proportion

of severe and critical survive and you

know okay so say it's 80% in Chinese

facilities or 90% that's not what it's

going to be in other places they're

really good at managing a really

complicated disease on big scale right

now so I would not have a false sense of

security in the numbers okay one more

online Tammie BBC I have

hello go ahead please sorry I don't know

if you can hear me I would like miles

whoa killing that 200 we didn't quite

get your question was said something

about 250,000 really bad or 200 good you

kindly repeat that one what is your

response to miles blow telling Steve

Bannon that millions are infected and

200 I am

Tammy I've not seen whatever you just

referred to so again not dodging a

question but I simply don't know what

I'm responding to i third two people one

of them said it there's million cases

250,000 dead and being hidden in China

or something like that yeah you know I

didn't go to every single place and

every corner of China but I think we

have a pretty good sense of what the

epidemic looks like and I think these

numbers are reflective of that I need

but I don't know where their information

comes from and again this comes back you

know I get asked a lot of questions well

what about this and what about that I've

got to go with the data that we see and

anything that I told you we tried to use

multiple data points to try and

observations to try and corroborate it

right we didn't try and know like who we

heard that from someone let's go with it

we everything and the team remember I

told you is on this team CDC and IH

Robert Cox you know do bands tops

institutes etc and they'll sign off on

this thing so they're pretty rigorous

okay questions from the room okay all

right hiding behind am I not allowed to

do that thank

sorry no echo on this and hopefully a

couple of things if I could you

mentioned that the science is evolving

very fast in China one of the things

that's come out recently is that there

may be an oral vaccine and prompt in in

in preparation and China what do you

know about that

if you could also tell us about how the

two treatment trials are going and

particularly the HIV combo drugs with

rim disappear

and then just also in the numbers that

you've come up with doctor our director

general Ted Rose yesterday mentioned to

us that there was a seem to be a

disparity in the mortality rate between

Wuhan and the rest of China could you

try to explain why that is thanks

sorry pardon me first was about the

question about the oral vaccine I I

don't have information on that but there

were parts of the team that really dug

into some of the science that was being

done so so we may be able to find

something on that so apologies in terms

of the treatment trials the in terms of

how they're going of course these are

blinded trials etc right so I remember

somebody asked me oh great you talked to

child Ben how is it looking for a rim

desert ear it's a blinded you know trial

what I don't know but what I what I was

interested in talking to him Jamie was

how are you doing on enrollment what's

the timeline to get to your interim

numbers where you could actually look at

this and the results and they as I say

the enrollment had slowed down there's

two different remem deservers trials and

it slows down but but but there's still

enrolling so because you know it's

urgent we've got us get answers to

outstanding questions super fast because

if this drug saves lives we need to know

that and so one of the conversations we

had in China was well how do we

prioritize enrollment for the trials

that are the most promising and then how

do you make that decision because you

know this corporate interests and

everything else behind these but but

going well I mean the amazing thing

remember as well I mean you've seen the

pictures of Wuhan and and folks are in

there running multiple clinical trials

and similarly on the HIV ones there's if

I remember correctly some groups have

already released some information but

we're very careful as well these trials

are designed to get answers as quickly

as they can and you know if we metal and

answer asked the wrong questions etc you

know we want to know is there any way we

can help you get to the answers you want

faster and clearly recruitment was was

was one area it's a great story right

less people are getting sick but on the

other hand we may not get this answer

oh yeah one's higher higher mortality

rate right yeah so there's there's

there's a couple of things that probably

contributed to that because

one is temporary well three things would

contribute to to the difference ABC the

first is it happened at a different time

you know Wuhan started fast and and

early people didn't we didn't know what

we're dealing with learning how to treat

this and remember they've been through

six different treatment guidelines right

so some of that high mortality you're

seeing is the first couple of treatment

and guidance when we were learning how

to do this the second thing was just a

sheer scale of the numbers and this is

specialized care so so so that could

have been a challenge but the third

thing and this goes back to the point

that Helen was making that at the

beginning of this outbreak remember

people were finding severe disease and

that's why the alarm bells went off and

so we're really were sometimes looking

at because the we were getting more mild

cases now as knowledge of the disease

goes up when we're trying to gather in

people are understanding you gotta

isolate the model disease as well they

can't stay home that's what's you know

fueling that's the fuel that's keeping

this thing going so your the mild case

is in and you got more site on those and

that's you know broadening your

denominator but one important thing I

want to highlight folks is you know I've

heard it say oh the mortality rates not

so bad because you know there's actually

way more mild cases sorry the same

number of people that were dying you

know still die and and if that was a

problem and a concern that is still a

big problem in a concern so we have to

be careful how we interpret you know and

and these numbers sometimes okay one

more from the room this lady here

the duration ywa show they were not

ready to manage a situation ladies and

what are because at some moment that is

not really prepared for this what did

you meant by that

did you mean by that and if you should

advise five steps to country what did

they have to have okay so so first I'm

gonna be very careful I have not been in

any other country that's been managing

this thing and I don't want to make

judgment calls and again there's you

know III will really want to stick to

where we've got data and what I what I

know happened so I so I I don't know the

circumstance of other countries but I

think there's really important lessons

from it already right is and and this is

happening in in northern Italy we've

gotten good systems and you saw the

action that they took right I mean

they're acting on scale to try and and

and and and and manage this I don't know

the details of it so I don't want to go

beyond that but the you know this tells

you what this virus can do and I think

you know I I keep seeing okay well this

happens on that boat well this happens

in Korea or that happens there and I

keep hearing people saying yeah but that

was because of this or oh yeah but that

was because of this I mean you know this

virus will show up you have to think so

you know in terms of the steps number

one think the virus is going to show up

tomorrow you know like like think like

Italy didn't know they were gonna find

that they think it's gonna be there

tomorrow right you're an incredibly

interconnected world there was a

fantastic paper came out a couple of

weeks ago which showed the spread of

this virus in China compared with if I

remember correctly was the 2009 flu

pandemic which was only ten years ago

and if I remember correctly every

province with this virus have been hit

in 23 days with just ten

years ago it took 120 days or something

like that for all of the problems so you

know we're just so much more connected

so you got to think it's gonna be here

tomorrow if you don't think that way

you're not going to be ready so first

thing is that mindset shift and the

thing you got to think is if it hits us

we're gonna stop it

you have to think that way and I keep

hearing you know this if it hits us we

just have to accept and and you know

it's going to spread and why you know

you've lost before you've started so you

know there's that mindset shift the

second thing is if you're planning to

get be ready you know you know you're

gonna need beds to isolate people you're

gonna need to be able to quarantine the

really close contacts because we know

you don't 10% of those are gonna get

disease so and we know that they may not

even know it at the beginning so you've

got to be able to accommodate those

people you have got to have enough

ventilators for the serious cases you

have got to know how you're gonna

transport people to those places right

because you don't want to be managing

this in many many different parts areas

you've got to have oxygenation or

ventilators I mentioned you've got to

have the lab capacity to be able to do

this you know China is testing tens of

thousands of people every day still for

this thing so it's big-time lab capacity

and it's not an x-ray they don't do

x-rays of these people in China they CT

scan them because on a CT scan you can

find disease that you can't find on

x-ray you know how many of our countries

have got CT scanning about how many

people can we get through a CT scanner

you know like 10 in a day trying to put

200 people through a CT scanner in a day

right I mean they have systems to make

it work so you've got to be ready

hopefully you'll never use that right

but if you're ready to do that you're

gonna be ready for an awful lot of

things but it's readiness and rapid

response capacity so then someone's got

to know how to investigate one of these

cases so do you have a hundred people

who know how to fill out a case

investigation form or a thousand you

know or is it gonna be looking at that

case for him the day that they get that

first case do you know where they're

gonna send that form you know who's

gonna go talk and try and contact trace

cuz that's really hard

so that's you know readiness for a rapid

response and but it's you know when you

break it down every one of those super

doable right the other thing is talk to

your population folks we have to be

ready as if this hits us tomorrow

so everybody wash your hands all the

time don't make a run on the masks

because you know what probably doesn't

make a difference it out that may change

over time but we need them for the

response we need them for the infected

areas you got to get your gear where you

need it right and you've got to get your

population they got to know you're

taking to take care of them otherwise

it's not gonna it's a huge big piece so

for me that would be number three you

know and the fourth thing is talk to

people who have done it

China have done it yeah and we're

building barriers did the people who

know how to do this

that's for I'm sure I'm sure there's

more okay I'm gonna take two online and

then we'll go back to the room can i we

have a correspondent from new york time

see you on the line what about Angela

hello so much so much speaking

is somebody there hello your time my

question is about the antibody if you

could talk a little bit more about when

that was likely and what the strategy is

or when China is going dark testing and

who they're testing

hi I think that was an at the time is

that right Covel at the time

so the antibody test was licensed within

the lat I don't know exactly because it

was in the last 48 hours and I heard it

as I was leaving actually and then I

started asking some of the viola gist

who were with us okay how do they

actually validate this you know what's

your control pounds versus your others I

want to know a little bit more because

that kind of tells you what where is it

really in the process but so I'd heard

that two were licensed and and this is

something I can't validate so here I am

speculating I heard there were two our

conversation always was China was about

okay you need to age stratified cero

epidemiologic surveys I mean China know

that as well or better than I do and

what you're trying to do there is

understand for each segment of your

population what are the antibody levels

look like that gives you a sense of how

much they've been virus may have been

circulating there and for some areas

this becomes really important to to help

you think for example about opening your

schools so our children all 0 positives

suggesting that they've played a big

role in transmission and we missed it

and Helens right I'm wrong and as a

result you should be more careful or

take your time on opening the schools

etcetera you you that would that would

help understand that so there's a number

of ways you would use it and you know

III don't know how China plans it's not

something that we discussed to roll it

out but I would expect that they're

gonna want to look at a high intensity

transmission area like Wuhan to try and

understand okay because that's where

you're gonna get the most information

about the extent of it in that setting

and then you look at it and a lower

intensity transmission area so and the

way they kind of see the country is

places that have no disease places at it

sporadic cases clusters and and

community transmission and I would

anticipate and if I got your first name

right that they would they would look in

each one of those and try and see but

the reality is in China you know as much

as people in visit to a highly

centralized system the provinces make a

lot of decisions the provincial CDC's

make a lot of decision

about what studies they'll want to do

and when so I would imagine once this is

out there would be a lot of will or a

star a lot of it will be at the

provincial level but but but again I'm

I'm speculating because I heard that and

I think best thing to say is Bruce said

he thinks maybe there are and then we

try and get the right answer because

I've spent the last you know day on

airplanes so hopefully that helped okay

given the feedback problems I think

we'll just take two more from the room

and then everybody has a rest means been

sitting here quietly putting up with the

mortality rate in China and that it

might be higher if there's any evidence

of that and how how bad you think it

could be and also on different parts of

the population you mentioned children

don't seem to be affected but you said

there are young people dying do you have

some some sort of overview how many

young people are dying from this and do

you think that would be worse outside of

China with a different type of response

so on the first question and it's good

to hear back you said this because then

sometimes it's okay I didn't communicate

is like cleared as I would like to so in

in terms of why the disease there could

be more mortality associated with it if

I got the question right first of all

outside of these areas of China is China

have gotten really good at managing the

disease and what happens as you've seen

in some of the areas been hit more

recently the early cases you're getting

a lot of the severe cases are coming in

so you kind of get this artificially

high rate because

it's it's severe cases and the mild

cases aren't getting found so for

example in Italy we know what you know

it's been horrific I think eight people

have died I'd heard something like that

and you know people will immediately

start doing the numbers but what's

happened is there's been these severe

cases that are really getting the

attention and and and and so you have

that phenomena the second phenomena is

people have so they're they're coming

much later as well to to facility so

even if you're severe early severe

versus late severe is is is is a

different ballgame and so people are

coming quite late when they're really in

serious respiratory distress and then it

can be more difficult the second one of

the other things that concerns me is we

have an older population remember as

well right and this hits older

populations and populations with a lot

of comorbidity we have a lot of heart

disease we have a lot of you know

hypertension we have a lot of those

diseases that we know are associated

with with higher mortality so there are

a number of things that suggest you know

you could have bad outcomes initially

with this until you really get the hang

of it and how to manage these the other

thing I worry is well about is our you

know there's a question and you you're

asking earlier and are we ready to

manage these people are we thinking have

we studied this do we know the disease

right this is not flu this is you know a

a more stars like pathophysiology it

looks like and so are we ready to manage

that so those are the things that

concern me and you're one of the big

things I wanted to come back it was

really that message of go after the

transmission of this thing don't you

know except this in evidence of

inevitability that you cannot control or

contain this virus and I think dr. Ted

Rose you know because I heard him saying

there's a lot in the early going and I I

think he had an intuitive sense that

this was the right thing to be doing and

certainly what we saw would definitely

definitely support that and and I also

worry when this guy

into lower capacity lower-income

countries right don't have ventilators

don't have a relation capacity don't

have oxygen supplies I mean those are

the things that you need to keep people

alive

you know it's a so on the question of

young young people and how many are

dying this was you know it's the it it's

low you know very low single single

digit stuff but what worries me on that

a little bit is and I talked to a lot of

clinicians and said okay we know about

the older population we know about the

cobra verities this population between

30 and 60 and especially the younger

ones when we see people die what's your

gut feeling like why are some of these

progressing and you know I said we have

a lot of smoking and china these heavy

smokers right they got they got that and

no they didn't seem to and they couldn't

identify things so that what makes you

uncomfortable right well you because you

don't know you know where's that native

needle in the haystack and so you got to

manage the whole thing both to keep the

community safe but also to be able to

try and predict it really seems the

comorbidities and age are the big

predictors but but it's a really

important question and and you know

we've even had very very young people

die of this by the way I mentioned

something earlier about the human side

of this I remember the mayor of

Guangzhou had 25 million people in the

city or something I mean you could

unbelievable right this giant city he

was presenting what they were doing

sitting he's going through slide after

slide after slide and and and you know

phenomenal understanding who talk around

all the issues you know that the

political leaders knew the disease and

then he popped up one and he said and

this was our youngest survivor you have

two month-old who actually survived this

this disease it's important to remember

it does hit all ages it and can and and

then he went on the next slide and they

said he went back and he said actually I

want to tell you about this he said you

know this was a family

where if I remember correctly the whole

family all the adults have become

affected and there was this child this

two month old and they rapidly go and

they isolate people right and here was

this two month old child because the

grandparents were also affected and when

they took the child to the hospital it

was a close contact me absorbant was

separate from the mother and the nurses

found a note inside saying you know this

is my child she's two months old and you

know please make sure C survives this or

something but it was just the most

heart-wrenching thing there's millions

of so many stories like that and yeah

and this team of nurses took care of

this little child and she survived on

that no I funny and I think last

question but would you know people have

waited a long time okay yeah I'm just

worried about people's deadlines but he

feel happy to take them we'll keep going

yeah yeah Ebola Zika yellow fever

because and not grunting so easier I

remember question folks I'm not a

contact you know I have not contacted

anybody been near anybody you know with

Ebola Ebola with with this disease Kovan

so you don't isolate your isolate cases

that would be really clear right case

isolation contact quarantine you know or

self monitoring if they're low risk but

you know it's not it has to be

differentiated so sorry just want to

make sure tomatoes for testing - Chinese

founded funny and instead of

do we have to test the paper test the

paper for just a fine or disease were

work affecting do we have some either

way to do thing so there's a bunch of

work going on in China and elsewhere to

to develop rapid Diagnostics for the

diseases I guess people at first is is

that what the question is yeah and

there's a number of challenges to it

there's four or five different

approaches being taken and because PCR

takes time takes sophisticated lab etc

and you know if you got a rapidly moving

outbreak it's a good question is a very

it's a bit labor-intensive takes a bit

of time etc and we've seen lab capacity

even in China where there you know now

can process huge amounts of this as a

problem so right now there there is not

a rapid diagnostic but it is one of the

one of the priority development areas I

found the word said Oh China what to

call aggressive for one with success and

you suggested this tomato to other

countries oh yeah folks time is

everything in this disease right you've

seen the doubling time of the case is

the exponential growth and I remember

someone said there was a study that said

[Music]

some of the big population restriction

movements in China had delayed you know

some areas and spread by three days and

I saw some kind of cynical comment on

that or by a week at most but again when

you look at these curves right if you

can slow something down by three days

and then effect it like that by the time

you get to a fifth generation of cases

you can cut the size of that by 90% days

make a difference with a disease like

this okay

these two ladies you first and then you

sure I'm taking too long with my answers

thank you very much for taking my

question in a Mexican journalist proceso

M this is not an Ebola outbreak we we

know that but is there any special

recommendation on the handling of the

death bodies do you have something to

say about that thank you I'm not an

expert in that piece of it but if I

remember correctly and the technical

guidance we actually have that's part of

the technical guidance series that's

available on our website there's a

specific recommendation about how one

actually goes about that and again is

not a bully you're absolutely right and

we always look at for everything like

that is there evidence that you know

mishandling bodies have resulted in

transmission chains etc wasn't something

we were specifically asking about but I

have not III haven't heard that so so

it's a different level of risk compared

to but but I want to be careful because

again it's not something we looked at

and I'm not an expert on that area yet I

will be tomorrow

thank you seeing from Xinhua news agency

doctor all word you mentioned yesterday

that China has adopted all of government

all of society approached by the virus

so could you elaborate on this approach

to your knowledge which part of it or to

what extent this approach should be

replicated or can be replicated in other

countries with different house governing

systems and was different capacities in

response to this disease and could you

also how do you view the effectiveness

of the TCM the traditional Chinese

medicines on the virus please thank you

let me take the second one first because

again not having worked in China for 25

years and and you know I and I don't

know traditional Chinese medicine well

and it was a striking thing for me just

how prevalent the use of TCM is but also

how organized and

a lot of it as well as and and and and

and regimented and I I can't speak to

the efficacy of it because I I you know

we didn't see trial results and there

weren't randomized trials with it so

most of the use of it was observational

you know like they took all the patients

everybody got TCM because it's part

frankly of the tree I think ninety

percent of treatments or patients get

get some TCM so it's it's used a lot the

physicians have a lot of confidence that

it helps particularly in the mild cases

they think that a lot of that is

possibly the anti-inflammatory effects

of it or maybe antipyretic you know

helps bring down a fever again I don't

know what's in the compounds but but

that that's what we heard a lot but

again it was observational data not

randomized so would was not possible to

make a judgment one way other than that

that regard but very popular and and and

and the the other thing a couple of a

physician's has said to us that taking

TCM helped with a lot of the anxiety

around the disease for people because it

was part of what they were familiar with

that's etcetera so so we heard a lot of

positive about it and it's very much a

part of I think it may even be in in one

of the treatment guidelines I can't

remember about how one could use it but

but I may be wrong about that so in

terms of the all of government all of

society so I didn't say that and I never

do if I said it yesterday that was very

very tired because I never know what

that means

it's like okay everybody should do stuff

everyone should do is I you know and

that's why what what I would tried to be

careful with my language today and say

you know it was a repurposing of the

machinery of government to run this

response you know because when we say

all of government everybody should be

involved okay I normally do agriculture

I'll do more agriculture I normally

transport do more transit I don't I I

think it's a great term but we use it a

lot and I hear it a lot in responses

where that don't look much like this

let's say that so yeah so

what I heard no what I saw in China was

they had a task force things had to get

done which ministry have actually got

that kind of machinery or have got that

kind of transport capacity or I've got

you know this kind of capacity so it was

really and where it had to be used the

term repurposed actually to do to do

that and then in terms of the Olive

society again I I struggle with what

that means and I'm getting slaughtered

by another part of you know I'm sure

they're great terms but you gotta define

okay what part of society is actually

doing what and in China it's really

clear right okay everybody has to do

this we need folks doing this but

everyone has to be involved because if

everyone's not taking the procedures

everybody's not cooperating in the

lockdowns everybody's not doing this

it's not gonna work now of course

there's going to be you know slippage in

places in terms of can that be

replicated elsewhere again it comes back

to you know the whole plain this

conversation is there's this disease

spreading people are desperately

concerned about it there's evidence from

a part of the world that you can be

masters of your own fate here because

I'm getting this sense that you know

we've lost that ability with this virus

and China wouldn't accept that and

hasn't and and that was that that was

the big message can it be replicated why

not you know people say oh well we can't

do this here trying to did it well sorry

yesterday you said there was no answer

so you had to throw your hands up I mean

come on that's how I try because nothing

on that list that you asked me you know

how to get ready well do one two three

four there's nothing on that list that

countries can do that is a great place

to end up questions sure oh you've got

one more okay okay last one because and

I have to apologize to people online

with not being able to maintain the line

there was a question about the reports

okay yeah whether it whether it will be

available and when

okay so my job is to write the report

well actually the team wrote the report

and and again it's a little embarrassing

because I've said I did this or we did

that and people have said what I thought

I want to be really clear everything

that's in the report and everything that

we're saying are things that were

carefully discussed 25 people and a

consensus view on so it is not me as an

individual providing a perspective the

other thing was we kept this completely

separate of w-h-o and degree possible of

the government China and of the people

who are on the mission from their

institutions they were serving their

their capacities as deep experts and and

and I have to say you know it's the

journalists that we're looking for me

more than my own organization was

badgering me and I appreciated that as

did this tea as did the team members but

it was just so important you know this

is 25 people who know this business in

different parts of it came to this

conclusions collectively and there are

things that aren't in the report now

you're gonna ask me what I'm sure

there's lots of areas where we didn't

think there was enough evidence that

supported and and it's not there but

most people were struck by the big

picture right the curve doesn't have to

include all those people that we talked

about reminded me of the other thing the

other ask online is can we post them all

we have to these belong to the

government of China well we'll try to

make sure that well when the report

comes out Oh someone asked about about

the report so the report goes to dr. Ted

Rose goes to the government of China and

it's going to them tonight and then they

will be in charge of a release I would

anticipate that they're gonna want to

read it and and absorb it because I'm

not speaking for wh I'm speaking for an

independent team of experts WTO I will

brief w-h-o tomorrow and then they will

make their decisions about if and how

they want to act on this and last

question

actually first my first my first

question was about the report as well

but you have already answered so I moved

to the second one that's the outbreak of

kovat 19 has been going on for some time

so people may enter a period of

psychological fatigue in your opinion

how would you better soothe the I mean a

anxiety of people and meanwhile from

what you have seen do you think do you

think that in the face of this epidemic

China tabloid show and the whole world

have more experience and preparation

thank you yeah so the second question is

easier there is a lot more experience

you know I did have a couple of people

on my team from w-h-o including the

technical lead from from w-h-o we do

have a country office there of course in

a regional office which is rotating

people through so there's an increasing

you know knowledge and experience of

what China has done and and and how that

can be used the part of my role is to

say here's what we said and try and get

this out to to to others so but again

it's it's still a very new disease and

we're all learning and you know we need

to be very careful this is what we know

today tomorrow can can can can look a

bit different but this looks pretty

robust right they've been doing this for

four weeks now and the first question

was probably oh yeah the anxiety really

important interestingly and a number of

people in the team commented on this to

me all of the clinicians that we talked

to and the people running these big

facilities whether a stadium or hospital

or whatever they all talked about how to

take care of the patients the medical

needs and the rest and how they take

care of the psychological needs of the

patient and then there was also a lot of

discussion about the people who were in

quarantine the very close con

Jax who were at the high risk law to

talk about the psychological support for

them and then they were also running hot

lines but they had this was as big as

the medical part of the response was it

was the impression that that one got at

a general public level right they want

to know is there anything that we can do

yes are we ready to do this that's what

they want to hear from the leadership in

in in their countries and that's why we

want to get the message out and and

hopefully hopefully help that because

again I come back to that point that is

concerned me a little bit that sense of

helplessness in the face of a virus

right

it's a 21st century and and Sciences is

incredible on this and you know we've

seen a country take a war footing to try

and use really fundamental principles in

the absence of a vaccine absence of of

drugs and and turn this around but it

isn't going to work as well unless the

population is highly sensitized and and

and because you got to find those early

cases fast and if you wait for them to

come to a hospital remember people are

asking about wuhan I think you were

asking earlier but you know the average

time from onset of symptoms to when they

were admitted and hit the hospital when

this started and in the first period if

I remember correctly something like 15

days so for 15 days that person is out

there with a really productive rate of -

of the virus interacting with people

getting sicker and sicker and

interacting with more and more people so

this thing is spreading and moving so

you've got to cut that right down and in

China it's three days now from when

summer starts to get sick for when they

get them isolated in a hospital bed

right so they're cutting down the number

of people that are getting exposed and

that's why the cases are dropping fast

because at a certain point you choke off

the ability of this thing to find

susceptibles

so coming back to your issue about the

anxiety people want to know what is this

thing they want to know you know I have

a family they know what is this thing is

there anything we can do about it are we

ready to do it you know each of those

questions

there's more and more answers the big

question that remains is are we ready

and you know know and someone will ask

me okay well when we'll be ready you'll

never be ready the day that you think

I'm ready now

you're you're you're not ready right

because you got to have that sense of

it's gonna come here today okay if I got

this in place that and plays that in

place you never feel completely ready

right me getting on a plane to go to

China do that are you ready I know how

to spell it

all right no not quite but you know and

that's the reader the reality but you

got to be as ready as possible and we're

not as ready as we could be first

psychologically you know our mindset and

then in the materials and then the

populations got to be with us I would

like to know if there is a spread of the

corona virus in conflict-affected areas

even in developing countries how can

States civil society NGOs international

organizations respond thank you it's a

great great question

pammi
