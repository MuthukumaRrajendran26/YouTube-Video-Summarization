so we had air and ground operations

dispatched early this morning we

commenced those operations and we were

able to positively identify the aircraft

involved at this time I'd like to turn

it over to battalion chief kono ho for

more of those details thank you Thank

You mr. mayor for the record my name is

Solomon kind of whole battalion chief

with the Kauai Fire Department I do have

a prepared statement so if you bear with

me like the mayor mentioned before

yesterday afternoon received

notification of an overdue tour

helicopter with seven people on board

including the pilot the US Coast Guard

coordinated search and rescue efforts

along with additional resources from the

United States Navy Pacific Missile Range

facility the coy Fire Department the

Kauai Police Department the State

Department of Land and Natural Resources

as well as the Civil Air Patrol in

combined efforts with the local

helicopter tour companies and the Hawaii

National Guard this morning at

approximately zero 9:30 hours our

resources located to breathe from the

missing aircraft in a remote area of

cocaine our ground at this time we have

no actionable information on the status

of the passengers our ground and air

crews continue to search for survivors

in addition to searching for survivors

we are focusing on identifying and

establishing contact with family members

of the passengers on the flight manifest

the NTSB has also been notified and the

lead investigator is in route upon our

request the FAA has issued a temporary

flight restriction in the vicinity of

the search area and we will be providing

you more information when it becomes

available thank you once again we like

to offer our sincerest thoughts and

prayers I would like to reassure the

family members and friends of all of

those involved that we are sending out

as much

resources as we possibly can and once

again as we get more information we will

be issuing them out or in further press

releases thank you very much we're still

in the process of trying to notify

family members what I can tell you is

that there's two different sets of

family members that are on the aircraft

party of two and a party of four but

that's all I can tell you right now yeah

that's a very good question and it was

along the prescribed route that all of

the tour helicopters normally fly once

again at this time I cannot give you

that information

pending contacting with the family at

this time I don't have the information

on that as far as the fire department

we're just focusing on the search

operation at this time

nothing nothing that I can confirm as

you know prior to this incident we did

experience some very bad weather

conditions and we are going to be

following up with additional information

when the NTSB arrives on scene so in the

interest of Public Safety we did ask the

FAA to have that temporary flight

restriction to still allow other

companies to fly their routes so there

is a ceiling and a limit that they are

all aware of that they cannot proceed or

venture into to interrupt those search

operations so we did have a coordinated

effort as you know it's a very tight

community here on kawaiii so they did a

lot of the companies did want to offer

their assistance however safety is

paramount both for Coast Guard u.s. Navy

and all other assets we tried to hold

off and try to assign and have him

coordinate with the Joint Operations

Center through the US Coast Guard at

that time you know I cannot speak for

that part of it only because I was more

involved in a search operation but what

I can tell you is what I know off of the

report there were 25 mile an hour or

25-knot winds coming from the north the

conditions did change to more of what we

call our trades from the north and

northeast and they actually became a

little bit more favorable for our crews

and their search operations

I'll have to get back to you on that one

just to confirm if I'm not mistaken I

believe it was what we normally see here

on kawaii which is the a star type Ural

type helicopter but I do need to

reconfirm that and I can get back to you

on that as well you've been involved

with several searches over the years was

this up a larger more extensive search

using the Navy the Coast Guard the

cetera or was it about what happens to

usual process over the years that was a

very good question mr. Whaley having

served before on the rescue the time of

day when the report came in it kind of

limited our capability as far as the coy

fire department is concerned that's why

we contacted or contact was also made

with the US Coast Guard to assist they

have that what we call night vision

capability so they did assist with us

before and then we also have a request

that we put in with additional assets

we're gonna we're gonna take one more

question because I got to get these

folks back to work this is an ongoing

operation and so we'll take one more

question well we still hold out hope I

can't because I'm not there on scene I

have several companies there without

working the scene right now I will try

to get an update for you at our next

press conference not at this time no all

right thank you everybody you know once

again we'll be will working very hard to

to have this operation be successful so

thank you thank you

you
