Harbour is awesome yeah but down the

Quebec today an opportunity to talk

about how we're lowering taxes for the

middle class with a measure that makes

sure that no one has to you don't have

to pay taxes on the first fifteen

thousand dollars of revenue you make but

only if your middle class are working

hard to join it our tax break will not

give assent to the wealthiest Canadians

unlike Mr Shearer and his conservative

universal tax cut which benefits more a

family that's making four hundred K a

year the one that's making forty K a

year that's not right but it's what the

Conservatives do austerity cuts and tax

breaks for the wealthiest on top of that

we recognize that the Conservatives are

gonna rip up the best environmental plan

Canada has ever had

they will show no leadership on the

environment and Quebecers and indeed all

Canadians know that the only way to

build a strong economy for the future is

to fight climate change

at the same time that's exactly what

we've done for four years recognize

there's much more to do and that's what

we're going to do well certain companies

there lately seat over to a Quebec

results you should carry resolute

I think there is nothing about having

the dual citizenship that should disc

why anyone disqualify anyone from being

a politician but I do think that you

have to be honest with Canadians when

you're applying for a job to be Prime

Minister 37 million Canadians I think

that's what Mr Shearer has an answer for

I took responsibility for the mistakes

I've made in the past

I apologized for them Mr Shearer that

continues to not take responsibility for

his choices in the past his actions of

the past his mistakes of the past and

that's a question for him would you be

responsible people miss Evans bossy long

responsible people since his actions

passive no shows good staff his own

humor who's the fire are concerned that

none of the parties have comprehensive

strategies or specific plans to create

prosperity and economic growth by

supporting the growth of homegrown

innovators what are your plans to

improve access to domestic economies to

capital markets actually we made

significant commitments in our platform

to continue on the work that we've been

doing investing in the economy of

tomorrow we have put forward

opportunities for access to capital from

EDC for $2,000 a year we've made sure

that advice and services are accessible

free of charge on growing your

businesses from BDC we've also made sure

that there is greater access to capital

for companies to scale up because we

know that we're competing in a global

environment as we've continued to invest

in the economy of tomorrow whether it's

artificial intelligence or robotics

we've continued to make sure that we're

putting Canadian opportunities at the

forefront we've done on an awful lot

over the past four years but we fully

recognize there's more to do it's not

the time to go back to the kinds of cuts

and austerity that the Conservatives

always propose we need to continue to

invest and ensure that our entrepreneurs

and our small businesses are successful

people about Sevilla I think one of the

things that Mr Shearer is recognizing as

he should have been much clearer earlier

with Canadians about his personal

anti-choice convictions I would have

avoided a lot of speculation a lot of

dragged-out questions now that he has

Canadians have a choice to make

if it's important to them to have

someone who will stand up for a woman's

right to choose

they know that perhaps mr. Chuck Mr

Shearer even though he has said that he

he you know wouldn't change the laws as

written will he defend women's right to

choose against the international forces

and even the people in Canada who want

to take away those rights

including candidates within his own

party I have made it very very clear

I am always happen pro-choice and anyone

who wants to run for the Liberal Party

of Canada needs to be ready to defend a

woman's right to choose unequivocally

that is what people know they get if

they vote for the Liberal Party that's

not what they're getting if they vote

the work we've done with our partners

internationally there is much more to do

to eliminate violence terrorism and

hatred from the internet we have begun

to work with the big Internet companies

to move forward on creating better

mechanisms for that and we hope to be

able to work with them because they have

actually laid out that they want to do

much more to remove hate intolerance and

violence from from their pages and from

their responsibilities we will work with

them and we are very confident that

we're going to be able to get not just

that 24-hour mark but much quicker than

that we hope to work with the with the
