the unsolved double homicide of a

billionaire Canadian couple still seems

to have more questions than answers two

years on it was December 15 2017 honey

and Barry Sherman were discovered

murdered in their Toronto home found in

a seated position

side-by-side strangled to death on the

deck of their indoor swimming pool we

did not observe any signs of forced

entry to the to the building and so at

this point indications are that we have

no outstanding suspect to be going after

fast-forward two years later 150 items

have been submitted to the center of

Forensic Sciences for testing 243

witnesses have been interviewed for

terabytes of security video has been

obtained 205 tips have been provided

directly to the police from the public

343 tips have been provided so far to

the police via the private investigative

team 701 investigative actions have been

assigned but we are still asking for

help no arrests no known suspects just a

family and community desperate for

answers when the news broke that this

couple had been found dead everyone was

stunned and horrified

that's Kathryn McDonald global Toronto's

crime specialist who's been covering the

story for the past two years

Barry Sherman owned a pharmaceutical

company a giant and he was known

worldwide and his wife honey was a

prominent member of the Toronto

community she was a philanthropist as

was he they they were quite well known

in the Jewish community and one of the

things that became quite obvious in the

months after his murder was that Barry

had a lot of enemies had a lot of people

in in his business and the business and

the business community knew him it was

well known that he was litigious

he had sued a lot of people and so they

had to look at every possibility as to

who might have had an axe to grind with

this man since the beginning a number of

missteps have generated intense

criticism and scrutiny into how the

investigation has been handled by police

that evening the police said there was

no sign of forced entry in the

weren't looking for any suspects which

led a lot of people to believe that it

sounded like this could have been a

murder-suicide in the next day a number

of newspapers in Toronto were reporting

in fact that the police were working on

that theory

it wasn't until six weeks later that

police made this announcement we have

sufficient evidence to describe this as

a double homicide investigation and that

both honey and berry Sherman were in

fact targeted police have maintained

that they believe this was a targeted

murder but of course the fact that it

took them six weeks to come out and say

it was a double murder also added to the

community you know intrigue and people

were upset and like the family that it

took them that long to classify it as a

double murder we've had to navigate

through a terrifying maze of non

information an unfounded speculation all

while trying to support each other

emotionally a ten million dollar reward

for information was offered by the

family who also hired their own team of

private investigators there were four

private investigators who made up that

team and they in fact took over the the

house the crime scene after the police

were finished with their investigation

Brian Greene found this lawyer was

highly critical of how the Toronto

Police have handled this police

investigation saying that they missed a

lot of evidence they didn't call people

back in a timely fashion the lack of

information from authorities spawned a

lot of speculation from the public with

their own theories one of them being

that the couple was murdered by a

professional hitman or international spy

over a business deal gone wrong they

knew the people and that's my theory

they were strangled that's which is a

very personal sort of attack this is not

in any way a run-of-the-mill crime to

have two people murdered in their own

home and and staged in the seated

position is something that certainly

I've never encountered in 35 years of

reporting on crime if you don't hear

from the primary investigators mouth or

the major case managers notes then

you've got to take everything with a

grain

on Monday Toronto police announced the

private team has concluded their

parallel investigation and are asking

the public to call them directly with

any tips the Toronto Police for the

first time asked for the public's help

and they haven't done that in two years

I believe the police do have a theory of

this case I think police want people in

the community to believe that they're

getting closer to solving this case but

it didn't seem to me that this is where

they're at I mean I feel like they have

looked into hundreds of tips and spoken

to many people but are they any closer I

didn't get that sense today
