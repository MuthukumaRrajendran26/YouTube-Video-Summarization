and welcome back everyone let's take a

look at our national and international

news and of course it is the morning

after the election and Canadians are

waking up to a minority government after

what was a very tight race

the Liberals in the end able to cling to

power and Justin Trudeau will enter his

second term as prime minister from coast

to coast to coast tonight Canadians

rejected division and negativity while

Trudeau won his own Montreal riding but

the party fell 13 seats shy of a

majority the Conservatives boosted their

seat count on the popular vote in fact

by a very slim margin Tory leader Andrew

share predicting the liberal minority

will be short-lived

tonight conservatives have put Justin

Trudeau on notice and mr. Trudeau when

your government Falls Conservatives will

be ready and we will win the NDP's

momentum towards the end of campaign did

not translate however into votes the

party lost just over a dozen seats but

under a Liberal minority government yes

if you do the math jug beating could end

up holding the balance of power so

here's a look at how the party lines

were drawn across the country the

Liberals won one hundred and fifty seven

seats remember you need 174 majority 13

seats shy Andrew Sears Conservatives

took 121 the block making big gains more

than tripling their representation with

30s here that was a big surprise the NDP

fell to 24 seats while the Greens got a

boost to 3 and there's one independent

held by Jody wilson ray bulb right with

more on the elections biggest wins

losses and the surprises

yes we're joined by Global's chief

political correspondent David akin who's

filled only by coffee and a love for

politics and numbers and data absolutely

great job last night thanks very much

long night you know it was a long night

in the end the polls were more or less

the polls were dead-on in the sense that

in terms of the national popular vote

the Conservatives were like what about a

point point and a half better than the

Liberals but the problem is the

conservative vote is what was called

inefficient and so for example there's a

there's a few ridings in the middle of

Alberta

Battle River crowfoot the two Red Deer

ridings yellow head where the

Conservatives ran up what is the next

best thing to unanimous with like

eighty-five percent eighty percent all

those votes were wasted they only elect

one MP in each riding the Liberals were

much more efficient and the big story

was in Ontario where the Ford fear

factor which Trudeau was really

hammering away at the end of the

campaign Ford and sheer equals cuts it

may not be correct but it had an effect

the Liberals won nearly 80 seats in

Ontario they won 80 seats in 2015 the

Conservatives could not make a dent in

the 905 and that was the ballgame and

it's interesting that we haven't heard

or really seen Doug Ford snow no we

haven't heard from Doug Ford since he's

sort of been in witness protection all

through the thing because he's unpopular

but the other I mean on the flip side

you know I think Saskatchewan Premier

Scot know is very popular his province

Jason Kenney the Alberta premier very

popular Saskatchewan the Conservatives

ran the table and Scott mode been very

active and Ralph Goodale loses his seat

absolutely and in Alberta

this is conservatives almost round the

table that have the New Democrats held

one seat there in Manitoba where the

conservative premium there Brian

Pallister won an election the day before

this one got started again conservatives

doing very well winning some seats in

and around Winnipeg you can drive from

the Ontario border to the Pacific Ocean

and stay in conservative seats that's

the split I mean that clip we had about

Trudeau though you're rejecting

divisiveness no sorry Prime Minister

there is a divided country the West is

blue Ontario is pretty much red Quebec

has just elected a bunch of separatists

and you're the guy in charge yeah it

definitely highlights the regional

divide in this country we've been down

this road before yes and this country

has survived even has survived minority

governments how do you anticipate this

unfolding I think I was saying when I

was on the show couple of days ago the

number one issue for those who voted not

conservative was climate change and the

number one issue for those who voted

conservatives was my taxes are too high

followed by deficit nothing to do with

climate change so there's a bunch of

parties who hold the balance of power

who think climate change is the most

important thing then health care and

then

housing so when Trudeau looks to get the

support of some some parties to sustain

his government it's probably going to be

moving on those three things

Brad wall was the former Saskatchewan

pre member was on our panel last night

and he's very worried about the progress

of the trans mountain pipeline expansion

so be very interesting to see how Justin

Trudeau is going to manage proceeding

with that project liberals said they

were in favor of it but they're partners

now in the House of Commons are not at

all in favor maybe the block I don't

need the bloc care so there's a pipeline

in BC no pipeline in a Quebec that's

gonna be the ball speaking of potential

partners we're referring to in many ways

the NDP so it's interesting because you

can claim a victory but not really

because I me was dancing around like

they was the best day in their lives

they lost half their seats practically

right so then and the big the big player

there was Quebec but how much of a

factor could they be in this minority

government well given how much because

jeongmi's saying while losing more seats

for his party you know could be really

he could be the play it could be he's

gonna be the player and this is the

paradox of the way our system works is

that when Jack Layton won a hundred

seats he was powerless because it was a

Harper majority government he was facing

off against so here's a Trudeau Liberal

government and with just 20 24 and 20

odd seats jugni Singh will hold the

balance of power and can perhaps force

Trudeau to do some actions the thing is

there's another partner the bloc

québécois

you get them onside you're you're also

okay and the block was much less

ideologically guided in terms of the

markers eight sit down so long as

whatever Trudeau does has got to be good

for Quebec so if Trudeau did a national

pharmacare program which a lot of the

parties on the Left wanted there'd have

to be the opt-out for Quebec you just

have to give them cash and let them do

their own program is it fair to say that

the Liberals have bought some time

because no one is really in a position

or has an appetite for an election the

NDP's really yeah mortgaged their

campaign headquarters literally we will

see the Conservatives are rich as

Croesus and you know they could probably

fund a remember the the the spending

limit was twenty nine million dollars in

this election for each major party

the Conservatives probably have that

money in about a week all right we only

have a quick second but I want to any

leader of the of that group in jeopardy

of their job

I don't think so the only leader we

might see a change is Elizabeth May

because she wants to move on she's 65

she was looking maybe to pass a baton so

the greens may be looking for a leader I

think Andrew Shearer holds on Trudeau

right he's the Prime Minister and Singh

ran a good campaign David we have to

leave it there thank you so much David
