the two Boeing 737 max crashes over the

past year killed 346 people including 18

Canadians the max is the newer version

of the much more common 737 next

generation or ng Australian airline

Qantas has grounded at least one of its

Ang's over an issue highlighted by

regulators a month ago but we definitely

have found one on one of our aircraft a

small crack Airlines had been ordered to

check engies immediately for a small

structural crack near the wing if the

aircraft has flown more than a thirty

thousand flights but slightly newer ones

could be checked within the next 1,000

flights we've made a really conservative

decision to inspect our aircraft and the

inspections will all be completed by

tomorrow morning for Canadian airlines

operate the 737ng WestJet says all of

its applicable planes have been checked

and are fine Sunwing says its fleet is

too new so the checks don't apply Air

Transat says two of its planes will need

to be checked within the next 1,000

flights but it's not saying exactly when

those checks will be done and flare

Airlines didn't get back to us before

broadcast a small crack caught early

doesn't actually endanger the plane at

all it's really if you let them go

so this is I've chalk this up to routine

maintenance and and the workhorse status

of the plane but in the wake of this 737

max crisis it has passengers worried

Qantas should be ground into the chick

sedan so for them to get control of this

situation they have got to do the utmost

to reassure people that they make very

solid planes they stand behind these

planes up to 50 and G's worldwide have

reportedly been grounded for repair
