[Applause]

hello my name is Laurel Collins and I am

running to be your next MP for Victoria

it is so great to be here with you today

on the home lands of the Lacroix and

speaking peoples of the song he's and

Esquimalt First Nations I am grateful to

the nations and the people who have

stewarded this land and grateful to be

with a party who puts reconciliation and

supporting indigenous rights at the

heart of everything that we do

thank you so much for coming today as

most of you know today was the climate

strike and I had the privilege of being

down there with jug meat and of marching

with thousands of people in our city and

every day I talked to people who are

worried about the climate crisis they're

worried about protecting our coasts and

they're worried about what that means

for their future and their children and

their grandchildren people are telling

me that they are frustrated with

politicians who refuse to take action

the time to act is now

the NDP has a proven track record of

standing up for the issues that matter

most jug meat and the NDP understand

that social inequality and the climate

crisis are interconnected and we have a

plan to tackle the climate crisis to

invest in housing and to ensure we have

a future where no one is left behind now

it is my privilege to introduce someone

who has fought for our community he has

fought for improved transit he has

fought for the southern resident killer

whales he's fought for our human rights

please welcome my friend and mentor

longtime MP and your candidate for ask

why molt's Anna sook

Randall garrison

wow what a crowd

thanks so much Laurel for that kind

introduction and I'd like to ask all of

you to join me in giving another hand

for our next MP from Victoria Laurel

Collins so I supposed to know I'm

Randall garrison I'm the Member of

Parliament for ask why malt Saanich sook

like Laurel I've been talking to a lot

of voters in the past few days and they

all say the same thing they say British

Columbia is a very special place they're

very proud of our pristine coast and

they're very proud of our diverse

communities and they're looking for a

leader who's prepared to defend those

things that we are so proud of Justin

Trudeau said he'd be different he said a

lot of things and made a lot of promises

but those pretty words turned into

broken promises he said he understood

the urgency of climate change and then

he let big polluters off the hook and he

bought a pipeline jug Mead Singh is

different

we know that today jug meat signed a

pledge to protect our coast against the

trans mountain pipeline expansion and

increased tanker traffic

[Applause]

that's something that both the liberals

and conservatives want to impose on

British Columbians jug meat Singh is

different he's gonna stand up for us

he's gonna fight for our coasts and in

this campaign jug meat is the leader

who's taking on the rich and

well-connected he's standing up to

powerful insiders and he's putting

forward the ideas that will make life

better for all of us not just the few

[Applause]

I'm inspired every day by his leadership

I'm proud to work with him in Ottawa and

I would like you to join me in giving a

very warm welcome to jug meat Singh

leader of the New Democratic Party of

Canada

[Applause]

thank you thank you thank you very much

thank you

how's it going Victoria oh this is

pretty amazing I mean you get a chance

to look around there's a lot of people

that's pretty cool friends we've got an

incredible team of candidates an

incredible team and if you could just

join me for a moment we've gotten the

front row here we've got Sabina Randle

Laurel Alistar we've got a whole team of

Canada's up and down the island all

across BC and all across Canada he just

for a moment give them some recognition

as our incredible team

so friends I want to hear from you today

so we're gonna have some time to chat

and get to hear some questions before

you do that I want to lay out a little

bit about what's going on some of the

challenges that we're faced with and a

little bit of an update of what's what's

at stake in what we've got to do so a

lot of you know this and I'm sure you

spoken with friends and family that tell

you these stories but I want to share

with you a little bit of what I've heard

from the road traveling across Canada

one of the things today laurel touched

on this and randall touched on this

today we we know that thousands and

thousands of young people took to the

streets in cities across Canada

demanding action on the climate crisis

and I think we should just take a moment

to acknowledge the power of young people

how many of them took to the streets how

inspiring it was to see so many young

people like we saw little kids who are

barely six years old to university

students all they're too many action for

climate and that was pretty beautiful to

see

[Applause]

I remember speaking as one woman in

particular a young woman and I asked her

what did it mean to be there at the

climate rally at this climate action and

she said you know I was really angry I

was really frustrated I felt like how

could leaders let me down and betray our

future how could someone like mr.

Trudeau say pretty words on one hand but

deliver empty promises how could he do

that she was angry she was frustrated

she also was feeling a little despair

saying I don't know what to do like this

seems like such an uncertain Abul

insurmountable overwhelming difficult

challenge how do I overcome it and she

said I was kind of losing hope but when

I came here today she was talking about

in front of the Legislative Assembly so

when I came here today and saw so many

people thousands of people coming out I

didn't feel as alone I felt like people

do care that if we come together we can

actually solve this problem and that was

pretty inspirational to hear that that

shift from despair to hope but the

reality is is a lot of young people are

angry and they're frustrated and they're

right to be frustrated because they've

been let down you know their future is

so crucially important and people always

talk about their kids being their future

and kids being so important well kids

are demanding action they're saying

please do something we're worried about

the future of this planet I want to let

those kids know I want to let everyone

across this country know everyone across

this world know that we will not let

them down we will not let them down

[Applause]

and then we look at you know the other

issues that people are faced with the

other problems that people are

struggling with we know that climate

crisis is one of the biggest stresses in

people's lives and rightly so but as

laurels mentioning some of that's unique

to New Democrats is we don't think of

each issue on its own we know they're

all interconnected we know that people

are also worried about things like

housing here in Victoria and across the

island and across BC people can't find a

place to call home and those that have a

place to call home are worried if the

kids are ever gonna be able to not just

buy a place or worried if their kids

could have a rent a place it's becoming

so hard I've met so many young people

that tell me their biggest fear is they

don't know if they can ever own a home

or even rent a place so that's something

we've got to tackle when you know that

people are worried about health care you

know we're really proud as Canadians

we've got this health care system that's

a pride of the world in a lot of ways

people look to us and say wow you've got

something pretty amazing and we do but

over the years that really amazing

system that we built up has been eroded

decision after decision made in Ottawa

by conservatives and liberals have

starved the funding for this beautiful

system and then what happens when

something that is amazing that we're so

proud of gets starved of funding what

happens

well slowly something starts to creep in

someone says well what if I pay for this

service what if I pay for that service

and eventually the public system that

we've built and that we've we've become

so proud of becomes eroded and then

there's a privatization that starts to

enter and then slowly it starts

replacing that one to your system with a

two-tier system and and that's the risk

that's the threat if we allow the

continued ongoing trend where less and

less funding is being delivered at the

federal level it means we might lose

that precious public health care system

that we so cherish friends I want you to

know I'm pretty sure I speak for

everyone in this room we will not let

that happen

[Applause]

in healthcare I also hear a lot of

really painful stories about the lack of

access because of that starved system

people can't get the care they need when

they need it and I met a lot of people

that can't afford the medication they

need to stay well I remember I met a

woman who got late onset type 1 diabetes

she was just completed her master's and

she said I was healthy my whole life I

never worried about medication I never

worried about going to the doctors

because they never needed to but then I

got diagnosed with late onset type 1

diabetes and I didn't have any coverage

and I earn a good living I have a good

job but it's cost me thousands and

thousands of dollars and and it's it's a

worry that I have and she's like I can't

save up to buy a home because my

medications cost so much and I have no

choice I have to take it all die

I met a kid 10 years old and he lived

with her chronic illness he was one of

those young kids that's wise beyond his

years because he's dealing with a really

stressful illness so he told me about

the medication and the injections he's

like I gotta take you know these

different pills and I've got to monitor

my blood and he looked at me and I he

could tell I was worried about him

because he was so so dealing with all

this worry and he said you know if I

don't take care of myself I know I might

die and I was kind of taken aback at how

casual he was speaking about death and

then you could see the worry in my eyes

and he said no no don't worry about me

I'm okay

I can do this ten-year-old kid is like I

can do this I'm alright but I am worried

about how much my medication costs my

mom and dad he's a little kid ten years

old and he's worried about being a

burden on his mom and dad I like it

doesn't shouldn't be that way my kids

shouldn't feel like a burden and then I

think about you know the other worries

that people have and the fact that a

health care system that should cover

people when they need it it's not always

there for them you know things like

dental care it's not covered people

don't get access to the mental health

services you need there's a massive gap

in our system when I look at the options

well who's gonna stand up for these

people who are worried about climate

crisis who are worried about the cost of

living worried about housing and the

health care system say okay we'll are

the Liberals gonna stand up for these

these folks

thanks for that I was hoping you'd say

that that wouldn't work to all of you

had I said yes I just kind of left out

of the lab I was on a limb there thank

you for that was good so no they're not

it's true you they're not gonna be there

and we know why you know it take

pharmacare for example mr. Trudeau

announced the plan recently that they're

gonna put in Pharma care then we looked

at the plan and it's it's basically

they're gonna negotiate with the drug

companies to maybe hopefully give some

breaks on medication it's not actually a

plan and there's no Ashley universality

in it in fact we know that mr. Shido is

not gonna do it because the Liberal

Party has been promising Pharma care for

how many years does anyone know 22 years

they've been promising it well this time

they were a little bit more honest they

normally promise pharmacare then after

the election they break the promise this

time during the election they admitted

it wouldn't be universal so at least

they're being honest this time so

they're not gonna tackle the health care

issue and I want to give you one

concrete example you know looking at the

problems that were faced with the fact

that we're worried about the climate

we're worried about our health care

worried about housing how do we get here

how do we get to this point that's true

someone said I could answer I appreciate

that answer neoliberalism is the answer

is still academic

simply put governments in Ottawa haven't

been working for people they've been

working for those at the very top

they've been working to make life easier

for multimillionaires and billionaires

and wealthy corporations and by making

it easier for them they've made life

harder for everyone else they've

consistently made decisions that have

put those at the top ahead and everyone

else behind and back to mr. Trudeau the

example a concrete example of why he

would never bring in Pharma care well in

2015 he made a promise he said I'm going

to change the list of countries that we

set our prices for medication and by

changing the list of countries it's

gonna drop the cost of medication

significantly and he's right because the

board that sets a price is demanded they

asked if you give us a new list of

countries we can drop the price of

medication that's a zero cost solution

it wouldn't cost us a cent four years

went by and mr. Trudeau didn't do it I

was wondering why wouldn't he do

something as simple as changing the list

of countries it costs us nothing why

wouldn't he do it we figured out why in

four years he met with Big Pharma him

and his government they met with Big

Pharma and they met with insurance

lobbyists a whole bunch of times rough

guess of how many times in four years

five hundred I got a five hundred yeah

if you like it's an auction it's no

higher someone jump to 2000 you're

ruining my story because that's way too

high 2000 is the wait that's a lot I

mean it five hundred is already a lot

someone said eight hundred combined

we've counted at least eight hundred and

seventy five times that is massive just

to put into perspective that is massive

and so after four years of being lobbied

so many times by the Big Pharma and the

big insurance company lobbyists mr.

Trudeau's government gave up on that

promise again it's no coincidence

because they'd rather work to protect

the profits of the insurance companies

and the big pharma companies rather and

protect families it's a choice it's not

a coincidence this is a choice they're

making and again with the climate you

know the simplest first step that should

be taken is why is it that billions of

our public

are going to the fossil fuel sector it

makes no sense makes no sense

[Applause]

now now mr. Trudeau made the promise he

said I'm going to end fossil fuel

subsidies when he was campaigning in

2015 and so again well what happened in

four years he didn't follow through in

that commitment

why didn't he the lobbyists we did a

little search we found out that he met

with the energy lobbyists a whole bunch

of times

Rauf guess how many times hints hell he

hints a little bit more than the Big

Pharma and insurance companies a

thousand very close fifth over fifteen

hundred times fifteen hundred times he

met with energy lobbyists and obviously

he again caved to the demands of the

powerful elite rather than helping out

people young people were saying please

do something to protect our environment

do something to protect our future mr.

Trudeau said no I'd rather protect the

profits of those at the very top again

so it's an ongoing trend here so the

Liberals aren't going to do it they're

not gonna stand up for people they're

not gonna make life better for people

and I'm not sure I need to say this in

this crowd but are the Conservatives the

answer I'll take that laughter as a

strong no okay thank you

I also that one I didn't feel like I was

going on a limb very much

I felt pretty secure on that one so I

mean just to just to make it clear

though mr. schirra is gonna say that

he's gonna pop money in the pockets of

families he's gonna say that we're gonna

hear him say that he's gonna say I'm

gonna put some money in your pockets and

she sure he might put a couple of

dollars in people's pockets he's gonna

cut taxes a little bit for people but

what else is getting is he gonna cut

he's gonna cut services massively he's

gonna save a little bit of money by some

tax cuts mostly for the wealthiest but

it might save some people a couple

dollars but then he's gonna cut all the

services that you and your family need

and it's gonna cost a whole lot more

it's gonna be difficult and we've seen

that before we've seen that story before

right I was with mr. Harper's exactly

what he did mr. Schurz gonna do the same

thing so mr. Trudeau's not gonna make

things better

mr. shear is not gonna make things

better

what other option do we have that's all

of us that's right

[Applause]

and I just want to say one thing on on

the Green Party you know I know that

they share our commitment to fighting

the climate crisis they both are

concerned about it but there's a really

big difference for us social justice

like we talked about health care housing

they're non-negotiable we don't

negotiate with those things those are

very important to us

[Applause]

we also very proudly do not negotiate a

woman's right to choose

[Applause]

so

[Applause]

hey it warms my heart it warms my heart

to be in a room of New Democrats who'd

applied so loudly to that that's amazing

that's amazing but we've been heard from

ms/ms me from her own her own comments

that she would support a shear

government she would put mr. shear a

conservative into the seat of the prime

minister's office she said that and and

she's also allowed anti-abortion

candidates to run for her party right

now so those things are non-negotiable

for the new Democrats you know I've

ruled out entirely I will never work

with someone like Mr Shearer with

conservatives

[Applause]

and not only do we proudly support every

single one of our candidates are proudly

pro-choice but we want to expand access

to abortion services because you know

how important they are and they need to

be expanded and invested in so friends I

put it to you this I'm gonna wrap up

here cuz I need to hear from you

I put it to this we've got a new deal

for people a new deal for people that

says we can invest in our healthcare

system and expand it to ensure that

everyone in our country has access to

medication when they need it if you need

if you need medication in our country

you should use your health card not your

credit card

[Applause]

we're gonna expand we're gonna in put in

place a public government public

insurance program to cover 4.3 million

Canadians who don't have dental coverage

right away we're gonna put that in place

[Applause]

on day one of a new democratic

government we're going to end fossil

fuel subsidies and invest our money into

clean renewable energy

[Applause]

we're gonna retrofit every home and

every building to reduce emissions and

create jobs we're gonna invest in public

transit and Electrify transportation we

are gonna make sure young kids have a

bright future and friends the reason is

this people gonna ask how we're gonna

pay for this we're gonna say how are we

gonna pay for all these ideas exactly

what we're gonna do exactly what we're

gonna do that's it that's it but I'm

gonna tell you exactly how we're gonna

tax the rich we're gonna do it in a very

clear way first we're gonna impose and

put in place a super well tax this is a

tax and those who've got fortunes of

over 20 million dollars we're gonna put

a tax on that

I'm pretty sure that's no one in this

room but even if it is I'm sorry we're

gonna tax you something yes I can live

with it you're the best the second thing

we're gonna do is we're gonna close

offshore tax havens that's twenty three

billion dollars that we're losing

[Applause]

and the final thing we're gonna do we're

gonna make different choices I want to

give you one example one really clear

example last year mr. Kudo spent money

on the following things

he gave 14 billion dollars to the

wealthiest corporations in the fall

economic statement just last year so

that the wealthiest corporations could

buy corporate jets and limousines and

the babies crying cuz that is really

that's sad

that is sad that they did that so I

agree with you baby sack

he spent 4.5 billion dollars on a

pipeline

and this almost is the one of the most

galling things he forgave six billion

dollars in corporate loans so that's the

wealthiest corporations got six billion

dollars forgiven

that's almost twenty five billion

dollars last year alone put that on one

side twenty five billion dollars our

plan to cover Medi or to cover dental

care for all those Canadians who don't

have coverage who earn less than seventy

thousand a year

that's 4.3 million Canadians that plan

would cost eight hundred and fifty six

million meaning it could be paid 25

times over with the money that mr.

Trudeau spent on the wealthiest most

powerful that's the matter of choices

his friends I don't work for the rich I

don't work for the people at the top I

work for all of you

[Applause]

you

thank you and now thank you very much

now we're gonna get to some questions so

we got a mic roving around and where are

the mics we got them someone in the back

here has got a mic yes go ahead right

there people sometimes are concerned

that New Democrats overspend and

over-promised why should Canadians and

in general and we in this room trust you

to be fiscally responsible thank you for

the question we believe in being

responsible we understand the the weight

I understand the weight that's being

placed on us as New Democrats people are

counting on us

so we would use very fiscal very

responsible fiscal measures to make sure

we've got revenue from the wealthiest to

fund programs for people not for

corporations not for the wealthiest so

we would take the budget very seriously

and we wouldn't run deficits like mr.

Trudeau has to pay for basically giving

billions of dollars to billionaires we

wouldn't spend 12 million dollars on

buying fridges for Loblaws we we would

stand that's true we would be very

responsible with making sure we have

revenue to pay for the programs that

invest in people and that's really the

difference New Democrats don't believe

in giving billions away like mr. Harper

did to the wealthiest corporations with

massive tax cuts with no strings

attached and in doing so gave billions

of dollars to companies that then closed

their factories and ship their jobs

offshore we're not gonna give we're not

gonna give that 25 billion dollars that

I just laid out that mr. Trudeau did to

the wealthiest corporations instead

we're gonna invest in people

that's a responsible use of our dollars

and it's gonna result in better return

on that investment because when you

invest in people it builds a better

country it builds a better society

[Applause]

when before he was elected Prime

Minister Trudeau promised to engage in

nation-to-nation relations with First

Nations which for my understanding is

nation by nation but seems to have moved

toward a formula that suggests that if a

majority of nations approve a given

project it's a green light and so you

spoke about electrification and I'm

concerned about site C that was not a

green light and we've you know we're

looking at a project that now in terms

of its its length basically almost goes

up the whole length of the island if you

include the piece and the Bennett Dam

leaving the people in that area with

virtually nothing and I'm wondering what

would you move to stop site C because

our provincial got been DP hasn't thank

you for the question I appreciate it

thank you it's okay we're ready for him

we have to have some tough discussions

it's important for after that for us to

have those you know you talked about mr.

Trudeau and his approach you know it's

important to point out he said in one

hand in public that the relationships

with indigenous peoples was the most

important relationship he said it

numerous times and then that was his

public comments and then in private at a

fundraiser in Toronto when an activist

who was speaking on behalf of the people

in grassy narrows a community that is

struggling with mercury poisoning said

what are you gonna do about cleaning up

the mercury poisoning in our community

mr. Trudeau in private said thank you

for your to mock that person and said

thank you for your donation while the

wealthy donors all laughed and jeered

and that's a really clear example of

what happens in private versus what

happens in public and I can

and I can tell you when I look at I've

been to grassy narrows and and I've seen

the people in grassy narrow suffering

with mercury poisoning but this is this

is I'm talking about mercury poisoning

in grassy narrows you know but that's I

know but I'm talking about some people

that are really struggling so it give me

a moment to talk about these people

that's it's a very important issue and

so those people that are struggling with

mercury poisoning I can't imagine why

someone would say in private to to mock

people who are stealing with such a

horrible issue and so for us

reconciliation is a tough path but it's

a path that we have to be committed to

and it's gonna be it's gonna mean that's

when we're gonna have to work hard it

means that projects can't go ahead

without making sure communities have

prior and informed consent and they have

to be free and prior informed consent

that's what we believe in we also

believe in the United Nations

declaration so under a new democratic

government what I wouldn't put in place

is the United Nations declaration to

ensure that nations are treated as

nations and that indigenous communities

are treated with respect and dignity I

would put that into law to make sure

that any decision moving forward would

never contravene those principles

[Applause]

yes more hands up we got some people in

the front here yeah yes thank you so

last year it was revealed that there are

over 5,000 homeless veterans in Canada

which is absolutely disgraceful what are

you going to do about it thank you for

the question

thank you yeah for sure that's a very

important question so so veterans these

are these are people that are that are

putting their life on the line for us

the people that have sacrificed their

whole lives they've served for our

country and they they discharged their

service and then have no supports and

have no protection and they're left and

neglected that is shameful the treatment

of veterans in Canada we just saw last

in the last couple years they were safe

there are standards of service that

veterans should have simple things like

when they request coverage for a benefit

and they ask am i covered or not

veterans had to wait months and months

to get an answer and we looked at the

budget and the budget that was set aside

for veterans year after year there was

an amount that was set aside but it

wasn't spent on veterans again shameful

we've got people that have served for a

country they need to have access to

services they need to have access to

mental health services they need to have

timely responses and if veterans are not

housed and are not living in good

conditions we need to immediately ensure

that they get housing they get supports

these are the men and women that have

served us we need at least to serve them

back by ensuring that they are supported

and given the services and help that

they deserve and and need yeah

get a mic back here yeah thank you for

coming to Victoria a lovely little city

is also one of the third most expensive

housing communities in the country I

have a pretty good job and I spend half

my paycheck on rent and I don't think

I'll ever save up enough for a down

payment for a home what are you gonna do

to stop skyrocketing rents and increase

access to affordable housing thank you

for the question yeah thank you for the

question

yeah it's it's a national crisis and

I've met so many people just like you

who who are spending so much of their

salary on on their rent and it leaves

very little left at the end of the month

to pay for the other things that you

need in life it's tough for so many

people and and it's an issue that we

used to think was maybe just a Vancouver

or maybe just a Toronto issue but it's

certainly not just a Vancouver and

Toronto issue it's Canada wide and

there's a couple things that are going

on one is that there's forces that are

driving up the cost of housing

unsustainably we need to get at those

and we also need to build more housing

so the first part is we know that

speculation through the foreign kind of

markets foreign investors that look at

Canada as a stock market and they say

the stock market of housing let's just

draw our money in and drive up the cost

of housing the BC government's done some

really good things they've put in place

[Applause]

they they've put in place a foreign

buyers tax which has been very effective

in cooling the market we want to take

that another set for in the national

level and put in place a 15 percent

foreign buyers tacked nationally that's

gonna really have a powerful impact on

making sure those housing prices don't

go up the second thing that's driving up

the cost of housing is money launching

and we've seen a lot of reports of money

launching having a massive impact on

driving up the cost of housing also

fueling the drug trafficking and having

an impact on the opioid crisis as well

so we need to get that money laundering

and again BC is doing some good steps BC

government's done some great steps but

the federal government has failed one of

the things is there's a there's a

federal money laundering department

that's set aside as a money large

anti-money laundering department that

has no one working on money laundering

so why ask the question in Parliament

said mr. Trudeau we've gotten a

department that set aside two G with

money laundering why isn't it that

anyone's working on the actual file I'm

sure you can guess his answer he didn't

answer and I said we've got to get at

this so what I'm committing to is

investing in a specific anti-money

laundering department funding that

putting half of that funding towards BC

to make sure we tackle it here in BC we

need to get that money laundering it's

one of the massive drivers of the cost

of housing once we tackle these two

things alongside what we need to do is

we need to build more affordable housing

using these a building

[Applause]

so so what we're gonna do is this we're

gonna build half a million new

affordable homes across this country

massively invest what the government

hasn't done for 30 years we're gonna do

and we're also gonna help out people who

need help right now people like you who

are spending 50 percent of your of your

salary on housing we want to put in

place a rental subsidy to help families

out that need help right now I met a

woman that was forced out of her home

because she was just a little bit

outside her budget couldn't afford her

rent and it meant she was living in a

tent in Campbell River and she said to

me you know what if it was just me I'd

be okay but I've got my kids as well and

to that woman I know we need to solve

the problem with cooperative housing and

non-market housing and invest and build

them but it's gonna take some time to

build them even if we invest all our

money right away and start building

those units right away it's still gonna

take some time and that woman needs help

right now

and so what I'm committing is to put in

place rental subsidies to help families

out right now we need help while we

build those affordable units

[Applause]

haiman sorry i got a jet back from my

break i'm actually my coworkers are

covering a longer break so we can ask

you this question

thank you I was like somewhere with

low-income housing shelters supportive

recovery illiterate and breathing life

into overdosing people every fucking day

I'm sorry for the sweating I'm sorry I

am so tired man and the pay is not great

but the works hard so that's nice yeah I

was wondering I've buried six of my own

friends what are you gonna do because I

I'm so tired I've just like CPR naloxone

so they can get up and then get more

offense at all and drop again the next

day and I've exhausted what are you

gonna do thank you I want to know

hold on hold on now I gotta say that

takes a lot of courage to share your

story thank you for what you're doing I

know you gotta run back so hold on I

want to answer this because this is very

important to me I the the problem that

we're faced with we've got an opioid

crisis and if you think about any other

crisis let's say if there was an illness

that struck Canada a virus and struck

Canada and thousands of Canadians were

dying thousands of our brothers and our

sisters and our siblings our parents the

people we love our co-workers if

thousands of them were dying through an

illness you know there would be an

immediate emergency response

we'd have camp set up everywhere we'd

have a mobile response in every corner

we would respond as if it was a crisis

but just because people are dying to the

opioid crisis they get neglected and

ignored all right I met I met a woman

just you see other day here on the

island who told me she lost her dad she

was in her 20s she lost her dad to to

opioid overdose this is a real crisis

and for me on a very personal oh my dad

struggle with addiction and he was he

lost his job he lost a lot of weight he

went from being 180 pounds sturdy guy he

lost all his weight who's down to 100

pounds and I remember having to clean

him cuz he wasn't taking care of himself

and I lifted him up to take him to the

bathtub to wash him and when I lifted up

my dad he felt like a kid like my own

dad who you know used to lift me up I

lifted him up and he was way too young

for me to lift him up and for him to be

like a kid and and he didn't have any

money at the time we didn't have any

money as a family we had gone through a

lot of financial difficulty and he said

at the when he was at the doctors and

they said you're gonna die if he keep on

doing this and just by chance sometimes

it works out that people you know they

have the hit rock bottom and he said I

don't want to die I want to live and in

that moment if you've met anyone that's

had an addiction or mental health and

they need help there's only a small

window of opportunity and we were lucky

that there was a publicly funded rehab

center that was open there had a spot

available and he was admitted and it

saved his life and now he's he's healthy

but well what that reminded me with that

moment around I was lucky because there

were services available so what I'm

saying is that our current approach to

the opioid crisis is flawed is failed

and is wrong our current approach has

not worked and that means we've got to

reimagine how we save lives if our goal

is to save lives then let's do

everything possible to save lives first

thing we need to immediately do is if

someone is dealing with addictions or

mental health or poverty they do not

need to be criminalized the criminal

justice response is flawed that's not

enough I mean that's that's one bold

step that's a bold step and law a lot of

people are talking about that I want to

replace a criminal justice approach with

a health care approach but we need to go

beyond but that also means looking at

the evidence and if there's any other

way for us to save lives where experts

can show there's evidence and there is

clear scientific proof of a way for us

to save lives we have to have the

courage to look at those solutions and

be willing to put them in place I'm

cannon commit to you whatever will save

lives I'm ready to do whatever that may

be the first step is to respond with

compassion and health care but anything

else we can do this is a crisis we need

to declare a public health emergency of

right away and we need to solve this

right away we can't wait

he's got one follow-up okay this is

really that was a really emotional thing

give me one quick follow-up no thank you

for that by the way I appreciate that

are you willing to meet with frontline

workers like myself and get the actual

scoop on life day to day stuff so that

you can know not from people who like

having an opinion on it but for people

who are pumping life back into these

people are you willing to chat with us

about that yes I would like that yeah

you got my vote yes yes yessum thank you

brother

Sarika yes that's it go thank you

we're lucky in this way mode we have one

of the best MPs around who understands

our talking but as a disabled veteran

and wounded what can your government do

for us because as it stands right now as

a service officer I constantly get calls

from guys and girls who are literally on

the edge because they feel completely

betrayed by this government and it's sad

because my time of service was during

his father's time and he's doing the

same thing he's neglecting the walking

wounded and there's actually veterans

out there who won't even apply for

benefits because they don't want to go

through the York radical minefield

that's out there so please thank you for

the question and thank you for your

service thank you

I'm sorry you should not be treated that

way and none of your college should be

treated that way that's just wrong you

know and and I commit to you that with

the new democratic government we'd never

let that happen we know that you've got

to be treated with respect and dignity

at a minimum what I've heard from some

some folks who've served there used to

be more access to account a manager that

would have managed your file that would

actually take care of you walk you

through all those different processes

which are complicated they shouldn't be

but that's why you need someone to

actually help manage it but they've been

cut Harper cut them and Trudeau

continues to have those cut we reinstate

that reinstate the service qualities

make sure that you get the care that you

need

you deserve to have that at a minimum

thank you for your service

yes okay load my collar it's natural

even though I was an NDP candidate in

the last federal election for

northeastern BC I am NOT a plant I have

a question so I'm north northeastern BC

oil and gas territory forest industry

everything the resource interested in

taking a tank my community both

indigenous and non-indigenous there's

suffering people are in distress they're

losing their homes for the price of one

home down here you could buy six or

seven in fort nelson people are hurting

they're hurting bad and so my question

might be greeted with some boos or

whatever but the thing is though right

now people are hurting and they used to

make their living through the oil and

gas industry and the thing is yes we

want a great environment you want that

but how do we get there we need

petrochemicals for a manufacturing

process anything in this room my

petrochemical processes so I want to

know what's the plan to get there I want

to know a realistic plan to get from

where we are today to the point where we

are we're protecting the environment

without hurting our people

thank you for the question good question

no no it's a very fair question and I'm

glad knowing booth that because it's a

very important question in fact this is

the room where you can ask that question

and you should be applauded as you were

because New Democrats believe we can't

fight the climate crisis unless we make

sure that no worker and the working

person is left behind that's what we

believe in so so what that means is as

we want to move towards a future where

we're not burning any fuel any carbon

fuel for energy we know that there's a

lot of workers in the resource sector

and a lot of workers are struggling we

also know that those workers were

struggling historically as well when you

work in the resource sector there's

busting moves and I met with a lot of

people I met with a kid who said his dad

worked in the resource sector went

through busting boom so he's like I'm

gonna go to school and get a get a

degree so that it doesn't happen to me

so he went out got an engineering degree

because he's remembered his dad telling

him stories about times being tough and

then him losing his work and then times

being good and getting more work so he

got an engineering degree went into the

resource sector and I met him at the

Calgary Airport he said I'm also now

losing my job and I got an engineering

degree and and the reality is is that

when we have an economy based on a on a

certain commodity and it's not diverse

there is busts and booms and so we owe

it to the workers who are working hard

it's not their fault that commodity

prices go up and down they're working

hard they deserve to have a good life

and so my commitment is this our plan to

fight the climate crisis has to be a

plan that also is a jobs creation plan

that puts people who have talent and of

skills gives an opportunity to work and

so what we're proposing is to tackle the

climate crisis we want to create 300,000

quality jobs in communities one of our

plans is to retrofit every home in every

building in Canada that means creating

jobs in local communities that's a way

to create Inspira kelana me in

communities

you can't offshore or send these jobs

anywhere else they have to happen in a

community we also need to make

investments in communities that are

hard-hit where there's instability where

there's unpredictability those are

communities that need a little extra

help and Canadians we believe in taking

care of one another so we've got to do

that

you gotta do that so this what I'm

talking about is a massive we're talking

about 15 billion dollars of investment

into tackling the climate crisis and a

lot of that's going to go towards hiring

people to fight the climate crisis we've

got a challenge we've got a problem it

also creates an opportunity we're gonna

need a lot of people working to fight

this climate crisis we need to invest in

public transit where it's applicable we

need to invest in of course here in in

Victoria that makes a lot of sense but

in rural communities we need to invest

in infrastructure to create jobs in

those communities we need better

connectivity we need better cell phone

and Internet connectivity for jobs of

the future we need to make sure workers

are never left behind and that's why our

plan is to invest heavily in workers and

in people starting here just want to say

it's an honor to meet see you face to

face I've been following the elections

said I think since we started I just

have a couple questions I'm gonna try to

keep it brief but the first I want you

to ask this to senior care I was raised

by my grandparents by a single father

who worked in his own business where a

home along maintance company we've been

round for 28 years my question is my

grandparents they're on pensions my

grandfather's also a veteran disabled

veteran so they spent I think for

helping my sister and I like half a

million dollars and as they get older

now and my father too because I'm

thinking about mom my family as I get

older I'm worried really much about you

know the future for the seniors my

grandma is my second mom and my god she

wish she was here right now but

unfortunately is not doing well she's

having major surgery next Friday and you

know she sorry you know my family means

a lot to me and you know for yourself

you know how much family means to you

and

my question is what are you gonna do the

help the seniors as a lot of older

people now or start you know an aging

older and the healthcare here and think

not just BC but in Canada and yeah I

just want to know that how are you gonna

help the seniors and their health

benefits in our country thank you very

much thank you for the question

thank you very much for friends it this

is a really big room lots of folks

there's cameras and lights is tough to

ask a question it takes a lot of courage

so thank you for asking that question

the stuff so a lot like voy in this case

thank you for your grandfather's service

as well let him know I say thank you

just like veterans have served and

contributed so much to us and sacrificed

so much for us seniors we're only here

today because of all your sacrifice all

the work you've done you've contributed

your whole life into building a better

country and and you're worried about

your your your grandparents and they

were like here they were like your

parents and and I can feel that passion

like you're worried about them and and

you're not alone a lot of people are

worried about their grandparents because

we see our parents aging we see our

grandparents aging and we know that the

health care system is not always there

for them and it's scary like we

shouldn't have to worry about that the

whole vision the whole dream was we had

a health care system because we all

believed in taking care of one another

we pitched in to the system to make sure

that people would not have to worry you

wouldnt have to worry about your parents

and your grandparents and that's why

we've got to change what's happened for

the past you know decades where liberal

and conservatives have been cutting into

our health care system so the reason why

you're afraid today is again not by

chance it's not by coincidence there

used to be a 50/50 split between the

province and the federal government and

now anyone know what that split is now

used to be 50/50 close 80/20 yeah 25

it's about 25 75 so provinces are now

having to do with literally half of what

they had before and so naturally that

means there's less funding and there's

less care and the care that we need that

where our loved ones need is not always

there for them

scary and that's why I'm committing to

you I firmly believe I told you my dad's

story you know we wouldn't have had care

if it wasn't for the public health care

system I know so many people rely on it

I believe very firmly too no matter what

you earn no matter whether you have a

job or not

you should get the care that you and

your loved one needs

[Applause]

yes okay we only have time for a couple

more so make this one count

no no pressure no pressure I'm just

saying yeah sure but no thank you for

being here and I used to work in the

Downtown Eastside in Vancouver with

folks that were on income assistance and

a lot of them had really poor oral

health because they couldn't afford

regular dental care and that affected

their overall health it affected their

ability to work and I'm wondering what

you plan to do about dental care because

it is health care and I don't know why

we don't see it that way sure

thank you for the question so true so

true thank you very much really good

question you're absolutely right it's a

bit arbitrary when you think about it

you could go into the hospital you know

god forbid but if you need to go to the

hospital you can get open-heart surgery

and we can get complicated ligament

surgery but if you had a problem with

your teeth they would give you a

painkiller and send you home how does it

make any sense

and you said it so well your dental

health is directly connected to your

overall health so it's a really

illogical healthcare system where you

can go in and get incredibly costly

surgery you can get all sorts of

treatments in our healthcare system but

you can't get your teeth fixed I

remember I'm meeting at a meeting a

woman much like the stories you're

telling me you probably have met so many

people I met a woman who came into my

office in Boerne me and and she was

covering her mouth what she spoke to me

and she said I'm so embarrassed I've

lost some teeth because of a

complication due to an illness that I

have in a medication that I took and I

couldn't afford and so she lost some

teeth and she's like I don't want a

handout you know I want to work hard I

want to take care of my family I've got

kids that I want to take care of I don't

need a handout I just want to be able to

fix my teeth and she can't and so again

I look at the choices that mr. Trudeau

has made you know giving billions and

billions of dollars to the wealthiest

the people at the very top and everyone

else suffering and I look at the plan

that we're proposing what we want to put

in place is literally a government

publicly funded insurance program for

dental care that would immediately not

it wouldn't take any negotiations this

would immediately cover 4.3 million

Canadians who don't have coverage with

our plan we would give them the dental

care that they

need right away I want to make this

happen I kind of get shivers when I

think about it because there's so many

people that would be benefited from in

this plan we need to make this happen

so many people are counting on us and I

want to make this a reality the last

question

pressures on where is gonna be okay hi

so living here in BC was really

discouraging to see first-past-the-post

not make it through the public

referendum and I also have a lot of

friends who maybe would vote NDP or

would vote green but feel that there's

no points and they're picking between

two clowns at this point so where does

your party stand and how likely do the

clowns are the conservative and liberal

just to clarify that's absolutely

correct just I just wanted to sit back

Jessie case okay yeah so just wondering

what your official stance is on

electoral okay thank you very much thank

you for the question we the important

question thank you so in case it's not

clear I'm a huge fan of premier Horgan I

think he's done a lot of great things

and I think he's the NDP's a lot of

great things I think it was great to see

a commitment for a referendum and then

it happened but I was really sad with

the results as well I'm with you and so

I looked at around the world and looked

at different options and looked at the

committee that was struck federally and

the committee made it really clear that

the overwhelming overwhelming majority

of people in the committee that was

struck federally to look at this

question said that proportional

representation was the way to go so I

want you to all to know this this is a

commitment I'm making this is a

commitment as leader of this of the new

democratic party a new democratic

government or whatever people choose I'm

running for prime minister I'm running

to form government people choose now

I will bring in mixed-member

proportional without a referendum I will

bring it in and bring it right out

and

and I'll and I'll bring it in because of

this I believe in giving power to people

I believe the first-past-the-post system

which creates false majorities is wrong

I believe when less than 40% of the

people vote for a certain party and that

party gets a hundred percent of the

power it's unjust and it's wrong and I

believe them people are worried about

who they vote for and they have to make

decisions around voting strategically

it's wrong I want people to vote their

values I'm pretty sure they end up

voting for us if they did but but I

think it's really important to get power

back to people and make sure that every

vote counts we'll take this last last

question Thanks congratulations on being

the next prime minister next month

Mike I have a couple quick questions

first of all in BC you know we cherish

our ancient old-growth forests there's a

lot more value in tourism for decades

recently some has been cut down on the

island so maybe some forestry work I

know for us who's hurting a little bit

maybe some forestry workers could get

jobs in the parks protecting these trees

secondly it takes about 20 years to grow

a fort like to clear cut it again right

for the fiber we're a hemp's been legal

for years why can't we fill these clear

cuts which I wish we were selective but

anyways the clear cuts that we have now

we could grow four times as much fiber

every year instead of waiting 20 years

so inside in 20 years when you cut down

those trees we could have done about 80

times as much

hemp every year that would give everyone

jobs in the forestry hurt that's hurting

and you know as we all know hemp's good

for a fiber plywood for building

clothing it's it's medicine it's

everything

so I hear ya

yeah I we were we were coming down the

island and I want us a teacher to go to

k3 drew groves cuz I wanted to just be

in the presence of a thousand year old

trees and just soak in that energy I

know it's it's really it's really

threatened now there's not very many

old-growth forests left I would like to

see them practive absolutely there yeah

yeah it's a climate emergency absolutely

right in protecting these old rogue

old-growth old-growth forests is

incredibly important I agree with you

all the way and on hemp I think you make

a really good argument that it's a very

sustainable product or plant it can grow

in a way that's quick and it can also

create opportunities for employment and

has multiple uses so it's an interesting

idea that you bring up and I appreciate

it yeah okay friends I got the signal

that time is up I got to take some

questions from the media cuz they've

been traveling with us and it's

important to be able to get the media to

be able to share their thoughts or their

ask questions so they can share that

across Canada so just bear with me I'm

gonna answer I'm gonna hang out with you

right afterwards so hang tight we're

gonna get some questions from the media

maybe feel like my answers you can

applaud but but we're gonna go with some

questions hi it's Annie Bertrand Oliver

with CTV national news back in 2017 you

told fair vote Canada that you would

quote consult with caucus and advocates

for the inclusion of a PR system and

that would be a condition of any

alliance or support for a minority

government Trudeau has publicly stated

he is opposed to a PR system so does

this mean you would not support a

Trudeau minority considering he's not in

favor of a proportional representation

change so my position is I would bring

in place mixed-member proportional

representation I believe in it and I

would make it contingent on anyone

supporting me as Prime Minister

[Applause]

with all due respect your party sorry

I'm gonna push back a little your party

is currently it will be fair by the way

they're allowed to do that it's

important your party is in a distant

third and there are a lot of voters who

are wondering what this would mean for

them so given the fact that a minority

government is possible with the two top

party's liberal and conservatives tied

in the polls I ask again if Trudeau's

not in favor of proportional

representation does this mean you

wouldn't support him so I want to ask

you a question I can't accept a premise

that I'm not going to form government

because I don't want anyone to think

that I'm not running to form government

that's what I wanted to and I believe in

it and it's important but I can still

answer the question it's the same thing

it's a flipside of the same thing I

would make sure it would be a

requirement as Prime Minister in a

minority setting that if a government or

if a party wanted to work with me it

would be one of my important values that

we put in place PR and I'd work for that

I would say that would be a part of a

negotiation so the similar question I'm

just flipping it around if I was Prime

Minister in a minority setting I would

seek parties to support me on bringing

in PR because it's so important to get

people a power of voice and then ensure

that their vote counts

[Applause]

I'm mr. Singh Ashley Burke with CBC News

I actually DC's Green Party leader

called you a hypocrite today he said

that only a few months ago you were

supporting LMG here in BC and now you're

talking about eliminating oil and gas

subsidies do you think it's wrong for BC

to move forward with LNG my position is

very clear on day one of a new

democratic government we end fossil fuel

subsidies and we immediately invest in

the clean energy of the future because

that's what we need to do our kids are

depending on us

I also could care less what Andrew

Weaver said

[Applause]

so does that mean if you were elected

that you would get involved to stop the

LNG project it would mean that we have

federal dollars and that none of those

federal dollars should go towards

investing in in fossil fuel sectors it

means our federal dollars our public

dollars should go towards clean energy

our kids are depending on that that is

what we need to do the energy of the

future is renewable and clean and that's

where all of our public dollars need to

go

[Applause]

[Applause]

keeps multi global news mr. Bahari

himself folks thank you for that jug me

but I want to I want to put on my other

hat is a columnist for your hometown

newspaper I'm gonna be now and about the

LNG question because I've asked you this

before and I'm gonna give you another

chance to be a little clearer here

there's a lot of people in this room

work for the BC NDP government which has

as its centerpiece of its economic

strategy the LNG Canada project so again

do you support the LNG Canada project

and I ask that again in the light of

Burnaby because Sen Robinson that your

candy and Berta mera Seymour is one of

the most outspoken critics of that

project I mean it's a it's a tough

question I get I get it and it's gonna

be a question that people gonna ask

again and again I can just tell you what

I'm gonna do and what I would do is as a

federal government I'm in the federal

government position I have the power to

control where federal dollars are going

and I would ensure that we're not

spending any federal dollars on fossil

fuel subsidies I would not be spending

our money that way that's where I have

control what I have control over and my

values are this I don't believe we

should be using carbon as fuel I know

that the future depends on us moving to

a renewable clean energy future and

that's what I want to achieve

as a fall follow-up a completely

different topic and again above the

greens we're here on Vancouver Island

where apparently they seem to be the

strongest they won the Nile by election

how concerned are you about them here on

the island and will you step up and do

more in terms of calling Elizabeth

making the Greens out from your

perspective in terms of political

criticism thank you for the question and

there is there's been a lot of talk

about this one clear distinction I can

put it right on the table very clear

concern really clear distinction I have

said I would not work with Mr Shearer or

the Conservatives because they cut

services that family depend on Miz Mae

has said very openly that she would work

with and put Mr Shearer effectively in

the prime minister seat I would not do

that

she also and I just that's not

negotiable she's also she's also allowed

her the Green Party has allowed

anti-abortion candidates to run for new

Democrats again we do not believe the

woman's right to choose is negotiable

you would not work with conservatives

and women's rights issues non-negotiable

yes Mary Brooke from West Shore voice

news

there's a lot of hi there's a lot of NDP

support on the island it may be more

proportionally through the rest of the

country what do you attribute that to

people in the island know what's good

for them but honestly the the people to

know that you know you need something

that's on your side that's gonna fight

for you and New Democrats have always

fought for people we're not in it for

the powerful and rich we're in it for

people we want to make sure there's good

health care there's investments in

housing we care passionately about the

environment and want to defend and

protect the environment and fight

climate crisis so people see in us the

solutions that they want for a better

life and I'm proud that they do

[Applause]

and follow-up how would you align

yourself with the BC government if you

were to form government would you

because you like a lot of the Horgan

policies there's a lot of things that we

can work together on I mean I love the

pilot project on childcare in Burnaby

South it's there's a pilot project there

and I've met people who families to tell

me it's literally changed their life

it's transformed their life having

access to affordable childcare means

that the women that I've spoken to can

go back to work with the confidence of

knowing their kids are safe families

don't have to pay that massive cost it's

thousands and thousands of dollars that

they're saving which they can invest in

maybe buying a home or maybe saving up

for other things they need investing in

their kids future that's a powerful

pilot project that I'd like to expand

because I want to see a day where we've

got national childcare national daycare

the complaint ah I'm back again I you've

previously said that you're opposed to

fracking would your government ban

fracking and when so I I believe that

fracking burning fuel burning coal

burning carbon for energy is not the way

of the future

we need to end that and move towards in

a future where we're no longer using

carbon for fuel at all our future has to

be clean and renewable energy and I'd be

putting all my energy all my efforts at

the federal level to achieving that goal

[Applause]

but but one I don't know how how quick

that would happen I would put all my

effort since you're doing it right away

I put all my energy into putting all the

investments we can towards complete

clean and renewable energy this is

something that needs to be done

yesterday it needs to have been done a

long time ago but I'm gonna use all my

energy and all my resources for the

future to ensure that that's where we go

and that's what we get done as quick as

we can
