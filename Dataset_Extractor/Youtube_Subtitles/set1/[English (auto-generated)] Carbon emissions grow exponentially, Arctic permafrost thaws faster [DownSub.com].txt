the gases move move freely through as an

emissions researcher Dave risk measures

greenhouse gases risk is among 75

scientists from 12 countries who

collaborated on a first-of-its-kind

study in the Arctic we have a lot more

carbon dioxide going up to the

atmosphere than we thought in the first

coordinated carbon measurements in

winter the scientists measured the

ground at more than 100 sites around the

circumpolar Arctic we always have to

remember this kind of balance with the

carbon dioxide that's taken in by the

vegetation annually and then then the

amount that's released from soils for

thousands of years Arctic land areas

have soaked up co2 from the atmosphere

and preserved it in the soil but now

with permafrost melting in the winter it

releases carbon and that's a big concern

the researchers found carbon emissions

of 1.7 billion tons a year that's twice

as high as previous estimates and more

than tundra plants can absorb during the

summer the report warns whether co2

emissions will likely increase in the

near future as temperatures continue to

rise however this can be mitigated with

a reduction of global greenhouse gas

emissions this is exacerbating

understanding of how quickly or I guess

I'm highlighting how quickly we need to

reduce because things might be getting

worse quicker than we thought

the report says carbon emissions from

Arctic soil will keep increasing even if

there are moderate cuts to greenhouse

gases if nothing is done scientists say

the outcomes will be much worse ross
