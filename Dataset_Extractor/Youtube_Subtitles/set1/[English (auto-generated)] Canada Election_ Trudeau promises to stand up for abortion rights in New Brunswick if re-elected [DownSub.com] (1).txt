good morning everyone thank you all for

being here I'm happy to be joined by an

incredible local rep and a strong voice

for this community not the cursing it's

always great to be here in Federer Kim

is here just a few weeks back announcing

that a reelected Liberal government will

give even more support to our seniors

because after a lifetime of hard work

Canadian seniors deserve to retire with

security and dignity today I'm happy to

highlight yet another of our little a

our liberal team plans to move Canada

forward for New Brunswickers for

families and for communities

unlike the conservatives liberals

believe that investing in people is the

best way to grow our economy and help

the middle class and those working hard

to join it and a big part of that

includes investing in people's health

I'm proud to live in a country that is

universal health care but the reality is

that too many people are slipping

through the cracks I'm talking about

parents who have to spend the night in

the ER and their kid gets sick because

they're stuck on a wait list for a

family doctor teens struggling with

mental health challenges who are told to

wait months for professional help he's a

unique unicorns way you know pie except

so develop a therapy over the old one

can use any on the Haley's in a progress

report on a sniffle only Garcia ran

again the new Voter cough so that's

something I think we probably tear each

one when I don't see the Charlotte felt

very silly pretty mean scammer the shuns

multiple me poke an agenda panini press

media the dollar who called no question

listening

Jana Misaki Mirko say from a Maitre D'

recommendations Olaf a song don't of the

preceding for methanol lesser

meets ghetto liberals understand that a

healthy Canada is a prosperous Canada

and a reelected Liberal government will

keep moving our country forward and

ensure that all Canadians get the health

care treatment they deserve and that

starts with fixing the current situation

around family doctors just imagine for a

second your kid has a fever

and is having a rough day your spouse

has spent weeks complaining of a pain

they just can't quite place your elderly

parent is starting to really struggle

with age imagine meeting access to the

kind of specialized service that only a

professional can provide and imagine

being told there's no one who can help

this is a real problem

so our team will take steps to ensure

that under a reelected Liberal

government all Canadians have access to

a family doctor or a primary care team

not only that will also continue to

improve access to home care and

palliative care but we know that health

is bigger than just the physical mental

health is equally important and so we

will improve access to mental health

services for Canadians from coast to

coast to coast will strengthen the

Canada Health Act to make sure the full

range of mental health services required

by Canadians are available in every

province and territory and will bring in

new national standards of care wait

times and cost of treatment should never

be a barrier to getting the mental

health support you need and finally a

reelected Liberal government will bring

in universal national Pharma care so

that all Canadians can get the

medications they need at an affordable

price

Andrew Shearer wants people to think

that this election is about you but it's

not about me it's about Canadians and

between now and Monday here's the

question you have to ask yourself do you

want fifty three billion dollar

worth of conservative cuts do you want a

progressive government that will

continue investing in families investing

in communities

that's the choice it's that simple and

it's that important in terms of the NDP

and the Greens remember this if you want

a progressive action they need a

progressive government not a progressive

opposition voting liberal is the only

way to stop conservative cuts liberals

know that the way to grow the economy is

by investing in people we have the

record to prove it

over the last four years we've put more

money in people's pockets by cutting

taxes for the middle class and giving

parents a monthly tax free canada child

benefit and in the process we've seen

Canadians create almost 1.2 million new

jobs we've lifted 900,000 Canadians out

of poverty including 300,000 kids

contrast that with the failure of the

harper decade where wages were flat job

creation was stalled ambition was

nowhere to be found

cuts and austerity don't work it's only

through investing in Canadians that will

continue to help the middle class and

those working hard to join our liberal

team will always put people first and

together with strong voices like math in

Parliament we will keep moving Canada

forward

particularly

workers who were challenged with limited

Brunswick is an area that is dependent

on trade with the United States and

that's why we were so pleased to be able

to renegotiate NAFTA and secure a good

deal for Canadians at a time of

unpredictability and in protectionism in

the United States we're going to keep

standing up for workers right across the

country in regards to energy East the

proponent of the project pulled the

project off the table but we're going to

keep making sure that we're investing in

families investing in communities to

make sure everyone has a chance to get

when you sweep a region like the

Atlantic and you sort of have nowhere

else to go but down how do you keep what

you have I guess what do you say

specifically to voters just to tell them

that you don't take them for granted

that you deserve their vote

voters across Atlantic Canada made a

very clear decision in the last election

to turn their back on ten years of

Harper cuts and austerity one cuts to

culture and cuts to communities and cuts

to families to veterans the things that

matter to Atlantic Canadians over the

past four years with an extraordinary

team of Atlantic and peace we've been

able to move forward on Atlantic growth

strategy includes investments in

infrastructure and innovation and

immigration work in partnership with

premiers across the region to grow the

economy to respond to the challenges

people are facing people in Atlantic

Canada like people right across the

country are now facing a very clear

choice do we go back to the cuts of the

Harper years or do we continue to invest

in the middle class and people working

hard to join it and invest in things

like ensuring that everyone has access

to a family doctor this is the choice

facing Canadians right now and I'm

looking forward to Canadians making that

choice here in Atlantic Canada and right

across the country in just a few days

here's to know why do you think there's

been a recent surge and support for the

bloc québécois and the NDP I think we

know that Canadians are taking very

seriously the responsibility to choose a

path forward for our country

Canadians are worried about the costs of

living they're worried about getting

access to a family doctor they're

worried about their kids futures and

their jobs and they're worried about the

environment they need to choose a

positive

progressive government that is going to

deliver on investments that will help

their families the choice is very clear

are we going to move forward with the

government that invests in people and

ensures that everyone has access to a

family doctor or are we gonna go back to

a time where conservatives simply cut

services for skinny jean at chirality ki

Atlantic Canada we are going to work

hard to ensure that we continue to have

strong representation right across

Atlantic Canada of great MPs who keep

stepping up we know that right across

Atlantic Canada in every single writing

people are faced with a very clear

choice do we go back to conservative

cuts to services or do we move forward

on making sure everyone as a family

doctor I'm making sure families get the

investments and the support they need

for seniors for young people for

hardworking Canadians the choice is

clear and I'm very confident will

Canadians choice in Atlantic Canada the

Green Party is more of a threat to you

here what is your message to green

voters beyond working to elect a

progressive government and not a

progressive opposition we know that

climate change is the largest crisis

that our world and our country is facing

at this time and that's why we move

forward on the most ambitious plan

Canada has ever had to fight climate

change

over the past four years we've done more

than any government in the history of

this country and we've done it pushing

back against conservative premiers like

Jason Kenney Doug Ford don't want to act

on climate change

Andrew Shearer has made it very clear

that he doesn't understand that building

a strong economy requires leadership on

the environment as well

that's why we're going to stay focused

on electing a government that is going

to continue to act on fighting climate

change right across the country with a

strong mandate to push back against

those conservatives as conservative

premiers who don't want to do anything

for our future so I can point if someone

do a Liberal government will always

defend women's rights including when

challenged by conservative premiers

that's something we know Andrew shear

will not do

we will ensure that the New Brunswick

government allows access paid for access

to clinics that offer abortion services

outside of hospitals I will sit down

in the debate and you said again this

morning that your government expanded

access to abortion here in New Brunswick

but that expanded access actually

happened in her pre-miracle and before

you were elected so why are you

exaggerating your grafted on abortion

here in New Brunswick we had very clear

conversations when I was leader and when

I was Prime Minister on ensuring that

new Brunton New Brunswick moves forward

on protecting women's rights and that's

why it is so frustrating to me to see

the government of New Brunswick continue

to challenge and limit women's rights

and women's access to abortion the

Liberal government of the Prime Minister

will always stand up to provinces who

want to limit women's rights to choose

something that the Conservatives

particularly under Andrews sheer will

not do we will ensure that access to

medically necessary services out

of hospitals are provided here in New

Brunswick we will use the tools at our

disposal to ensure that that happens

Michels olio with the Global Mail good

morning

Canada has temporarily suspended its

export permits to Turkey in light of the

military incursion in Syria in your

opinion is the violence in Northeast

Syria the fault of the Trop

administration's refusal to support the

Kurds and pull its troops out we are

obviously strongly condemning the

Turkish incursion into Syria and very

concerned about the situation in the

Middle East we are engaged

diplomatically and the officials level

with all of our allies and we will

continue to monitor the situation

closely including the impact on Canadian

forces in nearby Iraq and elsewhere the

fight against - is one in which

countries from around the world joined

in and this is a situation that concerns

us deeply you have been demonizing

Donald Trump in your election campaign

rhetoric are you concerned this could

negatively affect your relationship with

the president if you're real acting I

have demonstrated that my responsibility

is Prime Minister in regards to the

United States is two things to stand up

for Canadian values and to defend

Canadian interests that's exactly what

we did when it came time to renegotiate

NAFTA Donald Trump was threatening to

rip up this incredibly important trade

deal for Canadian jobs Canadian

prosperity from coast to coast to coast

we sat down pulled together a team

Canada approach where our people are

different orders of government different

political parties unions from

business different organizations all

came together in Canada spoke as one

voice to demonstrate the Canadians were

going to remain strong in the face of

American protectionism and

unpredictability we succeeded in

renegotiating the most important trade

deal we have despite the fact that in

the House of Commons

Andrew Shearer was calling for us to

simply capitulate because that's what

Stephen Harper had told him to say and

jig meat sing in the NDP are not

supportive of the protections we were

able to get for our workers for steel

workers for aluminium workers for Auto

Workers right across the country

we're gonna continue to stand up

strongly for Canada we're gonna continue

to do it in a firm reasonable way

because that's what Canadians expect of

us I miss Trudeau Tom Barrett at CBC but

you're saying that voting liberal is the

only way to stop conservative cuts are

you trying to scare people green voters

and EP voters into voting for your party

I think people remember when the cuts

and the choices that Stephen Harper had

made for 10 years that hurt Canadians

that hurt our veterans that stopped

investing in communities through

infrastructure the choice the Canadians

made in 2015 to turn their back on the

Harper years was the right one because

over the past four years we've seen

about 1.2 million jobs created most of

them full time we see 900,000 canadians

lifted out of poverty we've seen 300,000

of them kids we know that investing in

communities is the right way to move

forward and it's a very different choice

than conservatives me conservatives

choose to cut services we're choosing to

invest so that everyone can access a

family doctor the choice is very very

clear are you trying to scare them are

you using fear to drive NDP voters and

green voters to your party we have been

very positive in the approach that we

take and we will remain so looking for a

strong mandate to continue to

invest in Canadians and I will be sharp

on the policy differences between us and

the Conservatives the Conservatives

still believe that tax breaks for the

wealthy cuts to services are the way to

grow the economy 10 years of Stephen

Harper's failures showed that that was

wrong over the past four years we

invested instead we demonstrated that

investing in Canadians grows the economy

and lifts people out of poverty and

that's the positive choice that

Canadians are facing do we continue to

do that or do we go back to Harper cuts

lemon tree or CTV News

mr. Trudeau you've spoken a lot about

the things you say you've accomplished

over the past four years but you know

what it is you regret the most something

you did or didn't do as Prime Minister

that you've had another chance you would

handle difference one of the things that

I was most focused on in 2015 after 10

years of a government that played

regional politics and look to pit

Canadians against Canadians was to bring

Canadians together and everything I've

tried to do over these past four years

has been focused on bringing the country

together standing up for people's rights

ensuring opportunity and prosperity

right across the country and yet we find

ourselves now in a more polarized more

divisive election than even the 2015 one

and I wonder how or if I could have made

sure that we were still fooling

Canadians together

I recognize Canadians are anxious about

their future and for everything we've

done for the over million of jobs we've

seen Canadians create for the 900,000

people we've lifted out of poverty

there's still much more to do and my

focus is going to be continuing to do

that and I really hope that Canadians

continue to pull together and I hope the

Canadians make the choice to pull

together

instead of dividing come Monday well in

that spirit what is the walk one thing

you admire or respect most what enters

here he seems to be a very strong family

now

[Music]

you appear to be stalled in the polls at

the stadium if you get reelected it does

not appear to be an enthusiastic

endorsement of your first four years

can you tell Canadians what you've

learned about being Prime Minister and

what you might do differently as far as

tone if you reelect it I'm gonna

continue to fight every day for the

middle class and for people working hard

to join it we made a decision in 2015

that pushed back against right-wing

economists and conservatives who thought

that the only way to grow the economy

was give tax breaks to the wealthiest we

chose instead to invest in families and

we demonstrated that that creates

prosperity and growth in which more

Canadians can participate we recognize

there's much more to do for all the

900,000 people we've lifted out of

poverty there are more people who need

help there are more indigenous

communities to work with to build a

brighter future they're more

marginalized peoples who still face

systemic discrimination and racism every

day we know there is much more to do now

is not the time to turn back but you

took your achievements

do you also recognize that many people

I've disappointed in you we recognize

that we have had and have an extremely

ambitious vision for this country and it

takes a lot of hard work and that's

exactly what we did over the past four

years and we know there's much more to

do and that's what we're focused on

delivering for Canadians with a strong

mandate across the planet of Canada

across the country to continue fighting

climate change to continue investing in

families and in their communities and to

continue to do things like ensuring that

every Canadian has access to a family

doctor

good morning Jacques cuesta from CBC New

Brunswick the current funding model for

the for abortion services under premier

Higgs is exactly the same as it was

under premier gallant why didn't you

take on premier gallant at the time we

did we encouraged premier gallant to

expand access to abortion services and

there were steps made and we're

continuing to work with the province and

I will continue to defend women

right in every single province in which

conservative premiers are challenging to

restrict women's rights Stephen from The

Daily Gleaner newspaper here in

Fredericton now Prime Minister good

morning the Tories are calling for the

creation of an energy corridor across

the country do you think such an energy

corridor is feasible the imposition of

pipelines on any part of the country is

not a responsible plant that that is the

conservative approach it was a

conservative approach that failed for 10

years under Stephen Harper to get our

resources to new markets that's why we

created a process that looks at

environmental responsibility that works

with communities that respect respects

indigenous peoples and moves forward in

a responsible way because Stephen Harper

couldn't get things done and Andrew

Shearer won't get things done because

they don't understand that the only way

to build a better future is by

protecting the environment and listening

to communities at the same time and who

shares plan is to impose pipelines on

parts of the country that don't want it

we will work with people to build a

better future for us all yes

[Applause]
