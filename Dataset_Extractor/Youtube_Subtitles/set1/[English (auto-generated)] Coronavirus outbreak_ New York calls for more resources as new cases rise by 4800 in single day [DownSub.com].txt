i said yesterday new york is testing

more people than any state

in the country and per capita more than

any country on the globe

that is a positive

accomplishment pardon the pun because we

want

we want testing we want more testing we

ramped up very quickly we're doing it

better than anyone else

and that is a good thing because when

you identify a positive then you can

isolate that person and that's exactly

what we're trying to do

when you increase the number of tests

you're going to increase the number of

people who test

positive and the numbers show

exactly that we have now tested 61

000 people uh

newly tested 15 000

people so these numbers just are

exponential

to what is being done anywhere else in

the country

and that's why you're going to see much

higher numbers than anywhere else

total number of new cases 15 000.

i'm sorry total number of cases 15

thousand total number of new cases

four thousand eight hundred new cases

you see the state uh more and more

counties

uh we're just down to a handful of

counties now where we don't have

existing cases

as i said that is going to be 100

percent covered it's just a matter of

time

on the hospitalization rate which is

a number that i watch very closely it's

nineteen hundred cases out of fifteen

thousand

thirteen percent thirteen percent is

actually lower than it has been

we've been running at fifteen percent

sixteen percent as high as twenty

percent

this is thirteen percent this is

the key indicator because this is saying

how many people are going to come into

your health care system as the number

goes up

uh so this uh is a

is is not bad news uh

across the country you see new york now

has 15

000 cases washington state

1600 california 1500 so we have

roughly 15 times

the number of cases now do we really

have 15 times the number of cases

you don't know we're testing much more

than anyone else

so that is a major factor in this

but i have no doubt that we have more

cases we have more density

we have more people from other countries

who come to new york than many other

states

so i i have no reason to believe

that we don't have more i don't believe

we have 15 times more

i believe that's also a factor that we

test more than anyone else

114 new deaths total number of deaths

uh 374. and that

is a sobering uh

sad and

really distressing fact that should give

everyone pause because that's what this

is all

about is saving lives

and we've lost 374 new yorkers

keeping it all in perspective johns

hopkins has

followed this from day one 311 000 cases

13 000 deaths statewide deaths

to the extent we can research the

cause of death and the demographics of

death but we're seeing

roughly 70 percent of those who passed

away

were 70 years old or older

and the majority had underlying health

conditions

okay so it is what we said it was

approximately 80 percent

of the deaths of those under 70 years

old

had an underlying health condition

so young people can get it

young people will get sick young people

can transfer

mortality lethality

older compromised immune system

underlying illness that's what we're

seeing

but even within that population

the capacity of our health care system

can save those lives

it doesn't mean just because you're 80

and you have a compromised immune system

or you have an underlying health

condition and you get coronavirus

you must pass away

that's going to depend on how good our

health care system is

but in terms of overall perspective

i'm afraid for myself i'm afraid for my

sister i'm afraid for my child

older underlying illness

be very very very careful this gets back

to matilda's law this goes back to my

mother

uh that's my fear this gets back to

nursing home

senior care facilities etc

i'm requesting today from the federal

government that the army corps

immediately proceed to erect temporary

hospitals

i went out yesterday i surveyed the

sites

there are several good options that give

us regional coverage

a an army corps temporary hospital at

stony brook which is on long island

west berry which is on long island

westchester where we have that

terrible cluster which is thank goodness

reducing and the javits center which is

a very large convention center in

manhattan

in new york and new york city is

obviously where we have the highest

number of cases

time matters minutes count

and this is literally a matter of life

and death we get these facilities up we

get the supplies

we will save lives

we're also implementing the trial drug

we have secured 70 000 hydro

chloroquine 10 000 zithromax

from the federal government i want to

thank the fda for

moving very expeditiously to get us this

supply

the president ordered the fda to move

and the fda

moved we're going to get this supply and

the trial will start

this tuesday the president is optimistic

about this about these drugs

and we are all optimistic that it could

work

i've spoken with a number of health

officials and there is a good basis to

believe that they could work

some health officials point to africa

which has a very low infection rate

and there's a theory that because

they're taking this anti-malarial drug

in africa

it may actually be one of the reasons

why the infection rate is low in africa
