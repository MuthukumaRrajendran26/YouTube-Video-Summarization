there's much to reflect on after the

Tories lost to the Liberals the future

direction of the party the leadership of

Andrew Shearer who faced a moment of

truth today our chief political

correspondent David akin is outside that

caucus meeting David how did they

address Andrews shares leadership well

they were essentially voted on a process

that would have given the caucus the

power to initiate a leadership review so

if there was a bunch of MPs Conservative

MPs that wanted to get rid of Andrew

Shearer today was the day that could

have voted to start the process and they

overwhelmingly rejected that idea so the

caucus votes essential at this point to

see what Shearer can do so it's a win

for Andrew Shearer in his leadership he

still faces some hurdles he has a

mandatory review coming up in April

that's going to happen in Toronto that

will be for Conservative Party members

to show up in Toronto and vote thumbs up

or thumbs down and just as some context

for that vote in April there was a new

poll out today from the Angus Reid

Institute and the Angus Reid Institute

asking conservative voters all voters

not just party members but all voters

would you like to see Shearer remain as

leader or step down answer 41% said

remain 42% said he should step down so

still some hurdles for Shearer to clear

in terms of the broader message but

today at least his caucus looks like

it's standing with him Donna and David

there are some other things the

Conservative Party needs to fix if it's

going to win over more Canadians what

our caucus members considering there's

really three things there is some issues

with the leader if it's going to be

Andrew Shearer he didn't seem

comfortable in his own skin talking

about his own personal beliefs and

Canadians did not feel comfortable in

voting form so they got to do something

about the leader whether it's she or not

but then there's also some policy

development conservatives telling me

they really didn't feel they were

putting something on offer that

Canadians and persuadable voters could

really grab on to and finally they got

to fix their election machine database

systems were broken that inhibited

get-out-the-vote attempts so three

things to fix but a lot of work to do on

policy and on election plumbing
