we good to go yeah let's do this thank

you all for being here thank you for

joining us in the eye of a firestorm

between one fire that's hit us in

anticipating a crazy wind event what

they're calling historic and dire coming

up on Saturday I want to thank first of

all the governor governor Newsom Tom

Porter

CalFire mark Gillard uchi all of our

elected representatives have got McGuire

here our state senator Jim wood we got

the mayor Hills burg city manager

Celeste our public health official here

in Sonoma County our congressman Jared

Huffman our sheriff Marc ESSEC and many

more susan gorin it's great to see you

my colleague here this is this is the

team that's deploying and I want to

first of all thank the state because

they have sent the Armada we have a

fleet out there right now going after

the fire the Kincaid fire in a way that

it needs to be done in the next two to

three days to prepare for another wind

event which is really making us bristle

a little bit and but at the same time we

have had the partnership and the

resources deployed and I've had a lot of

people who told me out of all the

incidences I've seen they have not seen

this kind of force come in and this kind

of coordination so have them gone

through this two years ago and you

coming out with us it's a crazy time to

say here we are again but we are more

prepared than ever you can tell by the

sense on the ground and the individuals

there's not that same Friends frenzy

that was there before but at the same

time this is going to test us so we're

in a situation right now thank you for

being here and taking a lead on an issue

that none of us decide to be leaders on

but we have to embrace and go with so

I'm gonna pass it on over to the

governor and thank you all so much thank

you thanks for all your leadership and

let me thank the elected officials

assembled by me but more importantly let

me thank the men and women out of the

frontlines that are keeping you safe and

doing heroic work not only those that

wear the badge of your local

jurisdiction and the state Cal Fire but

folks that are providing mutual aid from

all throughout the state of California

and from outside of the state of

California I was just down in Southern

California and the new fire sparking in

San Diego we are monitoring two fires in

Los Angeles County and two fires here in

Northern California though the Muir fire

seems to be substantially under control

the biggest concern obviously in the

northern part of the state is Kincaid

and while we are enjoying a moment of

respite away from the wind events as the

supervisor said we're expecting those

winds to whip back up on Saturday

evening into Sunday potentially

dissipating we hope on Monday and so the

expectation of these now commonly

referred to PSPs the de-energization

it's likely to occur at scale again into

the weekend despite the fact that now

we're down to about 6700 customers that

are currently be energized in the PG&E

territories so this is multifaceted

we are a nation state so we are

conducting ourselves all across this

state by allocating appropriate

resources and as the supervisor said

we've never had more resources in this

space than we do today will be bringing

in 747 into the area for exclusive use

in the state of California you'll see

that aircraft in the very near future

meaning in the next number of hours

we've got our DC tens up there we've got

other suppression equipment in the air

those that often don't see that

suppression in the air should just know

this there's a reason it's not because

we're neglecting it's because of

conditions that are not appropriate for

those aircraft not only the issues of

suppression in the air related to wind

conditions or literally clarity issues

inversion that layer where you need to

get low and if you can't actually get

low there's no point in bringing those

aircrafts up but that does not deny the

work that's being done underneath the

hand crews that are out there the

bulldozers that are out there and the

lines that are being drawn in and around

the fire

to contain it we have the best in the

brightest in this business that's not a

governor saying that I'm not paid to say

that it's not because I think that it's

because I know that because I've had the

experience you have the experience here

in the North Bay have seen it firsthand

some of the finest folks that exist in

the business doing heroic work and they

are preparing for Saturday night they're

preparing for Sunday and they are

working with meteorologists they're

working with data that's

state-of-the-art they're working with

new ladar technology new radar

technology new satellite technology and

working with our federal partners not

just our local partners in concert to

develop strategies and to map and

anticipate the movement not only a

Kinkaid fire but the other fires the

ticke fire in particular in Los Angeles

County that obvious are opposing most of

the anxiety and concern I don't want to

go back but I do think it's important to

remind folks of some of the preparation

it's been interesting the coverage that

was given though understandably it was

given to the new technologies were

rolling out on cameras we have

substantially increased our investment

in last year's budget and we are

expecting to significantly enhance that

in future years for more technology

allows that early detection through

these cameras you saw the specific

benefits of that camera and the Kincaid

fire in terms of allowing us earlier

response times and the like but we also

were aided by pre positioning we put an

historic amount of money this year to

pre position assets all around the state

we were the beneficiary of that pre

positioning here and as a consequence I

think mitigated what may have been an

even more extreme event one again we

continued to manage as we speak and that

is complementary to those assets that

include new Blackhawk helicopters 109

million dollars in the budget for

procurement of those helicopters new

c-130s seven of them that we have

procured that are now being rolled in to

the fleet it will take some time to

implement

the inclusion of that entire feat but

those assets are now underway those

investments have been made historic

vegetation management investments

proactive efforts to address the

vulnerabilities of 200 communities in

this state through some forest

management and vegetation management

techniques that required me to declare

an emergency before an emergency and

that work is being complimented by the

National Guard let's we took off a

political operation on the border to

Mexico and brought substantial number of

the National Guard to complement our

hand crews and our vegetative management

work and by the way thank you to the

National Guard for the extraordinary

work they're doing and they continue to

provide resources that are

pre-positioned as well and will aid and

abet our efforts I want to thank the

Department of Justice and their work to

address issues that we consider at these

moments price gouging people don't take

advantage of vulnerable communities

people that make runs on groceries and

gas we want to make sure that they're

safe

people are being respectful people

aren't panicking but also that people

aren't taking advantage of this

situation we are working with California

chamber and we are working with our

business agency we refer to as go-biz to

make sure that people are aware that

people are still open for business in

this community that we want to continue

to see commerce we want to consider

continue to see tourism as is

appropriate in certain areas and we are

mapping that out and promoting the same

we are working double-time to address

the issue of Health and Safety our

Department of Health and Human Services

working with the counties working with

the cities to make sure the most

vulnerable reached out to wellness

visits efforts at the local level

working with the hospitals to make sure

people are appropriately taking care of

this remains a vexing issue and a top

priority for all of us accordingly we

are working to provide resources for

those that have had business

interruption and those individuals that

have lost their homes I just visited

number of structures that were destroyed

a familiar sight to all of us

devastating sight to those impacted

lives literally torn asunder and we

wanted to make sure that they have quick

access to cash and reimbursements I want

to compliment and thank the president

United States Donald Trump for his quick

actions through FEMA on securing our

what we call F mag which allows

initially 75 percent of our costs

associated with these efforts to be

reimbursed we want to compliment their

willingness to engage as quickly as they

did its consequence of that in the

consequence of the two emergency

declarations that I've announced here in

Sonoma County and in Los Angeles County

we are moving as expeditiously as we can

final point and then we'll get you the

folks in uniform the experts that you

came here to get updated on the 16,000

acres and that 5% containment on the

Kincaid fire in particular but that is

the issue of resources that the state

anticipated in a circumstance like this

I want to compliment senator McGuire

Assemblyman wood for their leadership

their stewardship for their

steadfastness for their demands of me

and their colleagues to prepare for this

wildfire season because they've had

enough as representatives of this

community we put 75 million dollars up

in the budget to anticipate these

blackouts today we're announcing that we

are distributing those funds 26 million

dollars has now been made available

immediately for counties counties like

those the two representative Supervisors

are responsible for those dollars will

be based grants depending on population

those that have been impacted by

blackouts will have additional resources

and then will have the ability to

provide proportional resources based

upon need up to 26 million dollars

immediately we are providing money as

well to the big 13 cities $500,000 based

grants

and additional resources above that

based on the discretion of our Office of

Emergency Service also tribal lands

we were just up at River Rock which by

the way did a heroic job keeping their

structure safe and by the way keeping

other structures safe they have a

million gallon well up there or at least

I guess cistern of sorts or storage

capacity which we were able to utilize

and draw down there were resources there

over night getting the benefit of their

work we're providing money for our

tribal lands as well and then

reimbursements tens of millions dollars

for state agencies so they can move

quickly to address the needs in a

discretionary manner for communities

impacted by these blackouts impacted by

this disruption so that's a broad

strokes overview I want again just thank

the extraordinary heroism of the men and

women that are out there on the

frontlines I want to thank all the

complementary agencies for their hard

work I want to thank the elected

officials for their steadfastness and

their stewardship and I want to once

again say this we should not have to be

here years and years of greed years and

years of mismanagement particularly with

the largest investor owned utility in

the state of California

PG NE that greed has precipitated in a

lack of intentionality and focus on

hardening their grid under grounding

their transmission lines they simply did

not do their job

it took us decades to get here but we

will get out of this mess we will hold

them to an account that they have never

been held in the past we will do

everything in our power to restructure

PG&E so it is a completely different

entity when they get out of bankruptcy

by June 30th of next year we will hold

them accountable for the business

interruption and costs associated with

these blackouts and we will do the same

with the other two investor owned

utilities in Southern California we have

a new president of the PUC she was up in

Redding having public hearings and she

will take them to task mark my word it

is a new day of

accountability a new day of transparency

but I cannot look any of you in the eye

and honestly say that we can snap our

fingers and address a decade of

mismanagement and while I have been here

nine months unfortunately I have not

been here nine years and I will do my

best to make sure that we are never

again in this position but I do want

folks to know the kind of investments

that are necessary we'll take a little

bit of time but with all due respect not

ten years this is not the new normal

this cannot continue the system simply

cannot absorb it but nonetheless we have

to recognize we are living in a new

world particularly in a state like ours

after a five-year historic drought after

15 of the 20th most destructive fire

seasons just since 2000 because of

climate change yes because the Hots are

getting hotter and the drys are getting

drier and the wets are getting wetter

which has aided and abetted these grass

fires because of those rains that went

later into the season now that are

drying up we have a unique

responsibility and obligation to do more

and better than any other jurisdiction

anywhere in the United States of America

will meet that moment but please

understand that moment cannot happen

overnight but I recognize it can't

happen too soon and we are resolved and

we are collectively rolling rolling

rolling in the same direction so that's

my long-winded preamble I know you all

got that edited already but now let me

ask the head of the office of a mercy

Service to update you on some more

technical issues that I imagine you're

interested in and also then ask the

chief of Cal Fire to come up as well to

talk a little bit more about how we're

pre-positioned and how we are preparing

for this weekend mark and she

that we were gonna do is carry Muslim

yen agradecer todos que estan represent

unload la comunidad latina i algunos de

nosotros que perder que se puede estar

disponible para entrevista c otras cosas

despues tenemos muchos recourses Yaqui

bien sûr kita tambien I own Centro

comunitario in Ciudad de Hills burg

donde I'm Mucha gente que habla espanol

como premier lengua yes so sooner they'd

a los de las casas de los de las las

cosas que está mejor esta vez que hace

dos anos si mucho mas integration and 3

las comunidades so i just wanted to say

that to anybody we we're working better

and faster with multilingual community

and that's one of the things we wanted

to relay to everybody thank you for

Thank You governor so on the fire I'm

not going to give a full briefing on the

fire we can cover that on separate

pieces and parts and questions as we as

we move on what we we do know is that

we're about 2120 1,900 a KERS that as of

this morning 5 percent contained

we were working diligently on closing

the doors that are still open on this

fire there's still a lot of open line we

have bulldozers hand crews all working

to to put line in to bring those

containment numbers up

but with wind coming back to us we're

very concerned that we we not only get

line in but also have line that we can

hold so it's it's a fluid process right

now the fire is not moving a lot today

but it is just because we're in this

kind of transition period and we're

worried about the winds resurfacing what

I wanted to also spend a little time the

governor just mentioned we we have put

the 747 global super tanker on contract

for California exclusive use there are

now three very large air tankers to

dc-10s and the 747 all available to

California we are looking at what the

next week has in store for us we're

going to have whether that's going to

continue to give us challenges it's

going to give us challenge

no matter what the spark is so we have

also our assets that we're working

through the California National Guard

and the governor's direction to have

remote sensing capabilities to tell us

when and where fires are starting 24/7

also making sure that we can get to

fires early and get resources there put

them out before they get big we have

been putting out more than 95% of the

fires that are happening in California

for the last several days at 10 acres or

less we have been very active there are

a few that have escaped this is the kind

of situation and season when those fires

can happen we're all aware of that so we

have up staffed we're working with local

government director Gillard uchi will

mention some of the some of the local

government assets that we're bringing in

the pre positioning but all of this is a

concert ground resources air resources

remote sensing cameras that we're adding

to the camera fidelity across the the

the state through the governor's budget

all of these things are helping us to

get better fidelity and get resources to

where they need to be to protect lives

and property it's important for

everybody to understand this is the time

of year when the fire starts that we

can't put out in that early stage it's

going to start running in a direction

and we're gonna have to evacuate you

have to work with your local listen to

your local law enforcement and fire

officials and when they say it's time to

go it's time to go we have ready set go

you better be set right now have your

go-bag ready when you're told to go go

this is life and safety that we're

talking about and it needs to happen

then with that I'm going to turn over

the mic to director Gillard uchi

good afternoon so a couple things I want

to mention we have really as a result of

the fire weather conditions that are now

really in statewide we're seeing hot dry

windy conditions red flag conditions

throughout the state we've had to really

lean in and respond in a probably the

largest way we have ever done the

governor mentioned a number of of ways

we're looking at situational awareness

to drive all of that intelligence into

the state Operations Center so that we

can try to stay out in front of these

evolving crisis situations now we

understand that the PSPs is a is an

element that is completing it more

complex and we know that we're coming

off of a PSPs here shortly but we're

going to go into another PSPs event

coming up here Saturday evening into

Sunday and that may last a little bit

longer and so in those are elements of a

symptom of a larger problem that we're

dealing with and that is the fire

weather and the red flag conditions

these are dangerous conditions and we

want everybody as the chief said to take

very very close attention to that the

state operations center in Sacramento

and all of our regional operation

centers are all fully active will remain

fully activated 24/7 through the

remainder of next week we are in close

coordination with all of our fire mutual

aid assets I want to highlight the chief

cosna from Santa Rosa fire who's here

and and our police chief from Santa Rosa

ray Navarro is here as well as our board

supervisor chair David Rabbitt

we're working with all of these entities

local and state and even our federal

partners to ensure that we have all the

resources in place for these events as

chief Porter mentioned the goal is to

try to keep these fires as small as

possible part of that the governor

mentioned was a allotment of funds in a

new program to pre position fire assets

that are from local government and from

state

yes and we have those we have

pre-positioned those assets these

they're specialized strike teams or task

forces here with in Sonoma County as

well as in Marin County and in Napa

County and in Alameda County so that so

that these strike teams of engines can

be immediately deployed to new starts

they're an augmentation of the existing

forces that are on the ground and I

really want to give a shout out to our

State Fire and Rescue mutual aid system

our local fire agencies that participate

in that state program and are augmenting

we're approaching this like a battle and

we have to really think about it as

strategically as possible in our ability

to get resources that's good

intelligence situational awareness good

communications and having the right

resources on the ground and as chief

were mentioned a lot of that is the

responsibility of each and every one of

the citizens be prepared be aware have

your equipment your supplies ready to go

and if told to evacuate do so during a

PSPs event there are going to be

conditions where gas stations may not

have power you should be thinking about

that now having your cars fueled up and

ready to go you should have a family

plan a communications plan power for

your devices very important understand

that there is extensive law enforcement

capabilities within the county as well

as through our mutual aid system we have

also tasked the California Highway

Patrol to up staff personnel for

security throughout the power outage

area and we don't want you to make runs

or get into conflicts at gas stations or

at food stores think through that now

and and plan accordingly

to be prepared for when these events

happen so this is really sort of an

unprecedented place that we are in as a

state but as the governor said we will

get past it and we will get through it

together

in an effort to be able to be better as

we move out through the other side of

yes okay Who am I going to now why don't

we bail ourselves to any questions and

can have at any of us

yeah you know we saw I mean just smaller

versions of what has become all too

familiar up here from 17 and 18 and

that's homes completely destroyed cars

that looked like they've been in a war

zone and everything all but melted down

except a few curious items right next

door home that's completely untouched

then this the remarkable you know just

serendipity that is a fire then again

there are some that make perfect sense

because defensible spaces were provided

it was more green people had focused on

perhaps upgrading some of their

materials on their roof and their decks

and the like but we we at this moment

and this is a number that will change we

have 21 structures individual

residential structures rather that have

been impacted and 4028 outbuildings so

yeah so 28 outbuildings 21 residential

structures that we know of at this

moment that have been destroyed

you see vineyards that have been

impacted obviously tremendous amount of

land will assess the wildlife damage but

it's a big big area and there are a lot

of hot spots still and there's still a

lot of suppression work that's needed

but we are benefiting because of this

respite of the winds and so people are

out there as aggressively as they can be

for this moment

well we'll see that's what they say I'm

not convinced that that's what they'll

end up doing we have a lot of tools in

our toolkit the Public Utilities

Commission a bankruptcy judge a federal

judge by the name of Judge Allsop public

opinion morality ethics good business

practice and judgment all those things

are on our side well that's through the

bankruptcy process in order to come out

of bankruptcy they're trying to

recapitalize they have people from Wall

Street that are trying to make a bid

Eliot managements one of them well-known

they're doing their own internal bid

there's people that are looking at their

assets potentially break them up gas

division versus electric division cities

like San Francisco are making bids al

San Jose the mayor said he was

interested in making a bit so all these

things are happening and that's all part

of this bankruptcy process that's all

part of them emerging out of bankruptcy

and my hope is not just my hope but our

efforts numbers for many many months as

we've reached out to potential bidders

to see more people into the space and

provide creative strategies to modernize

this entity and determine whether or not

it's simply too big oh there are details

that have been laid out specific plans

have been presented to the bankruptcy

judge take a look the state is not

making a bid to purchase PG&E if that's

the question that is not currently on

our agenda that being said I said

currently on the agenda

I'd lie if I said there wasn't a

discussion there was a discussion but I

would also be errant if I said that

discussion was conclusive meaning that

determination an investigation was

complete it is neither determined nor is

that investigation complete this moment

in our history where millions of people

are impacted throughout the state again

again I just want to paint a picture

because this is the northern part of the

state in Southern California not

dissimilar experience just not at the

scale and scope Edison is turning off

the power

San Diego is turning off the power San

Diego has been doing it since 2007

interestingly the new San Diego fire is

now occurred in and around where that

2007 fire occurred where a lot of

lessons were learned aye aye aye grant

San Diego Gas and Electric this no other

utility arguably in the country is more

successful in their strategies for

de-energization but it is a tool in

their toolkit but they are able to do it

with precision a scalpel versus the

scope and scale of PG&E

because they've made investments because

they've been more intentional on

focusing on you and public safety over

them bonuses and shareholders and that's

the fundamental contrast between the way

they operate and the way Pacific Gas and

Electric has operated over the last few

decades

well that's why we're up here and I'd

encourage you to rewind everything that

was just said in terms of our proactive

efforts to pre position assets the

extraordinary work that everybody you

see around me is doing to make sure

people are protected and people are made

safe the work that's been doing people

are knocking on every door looking at

every structure they're tagging those

structures to see if they're safe

they're out there doing everything they

possibly can you're going to see more

assets as the air clears up and the wind

now has gone down more assets in the air

you've got bulldozers out there you've

got line crews out there

they already proactively anticipating

where the weather is going the wind

conditions what they'll look like it is

remarkable our ability to protect

predict the precision with precision the

acuity of those winds the gusts and then

map out and anticipate how best to

utilize our resources today so that we

could protect people tomorrow

that would be called fill a bailout I

doesn't surprise me that PG&E is looking

for a bailout

we will not bail out PG&E

well I say should be outraged they

should be infuriated and they should

direct their ire at the mismanagement of

Pacific Gas and Electric who for decades

have created conditions that led to this

moment that said what we're anticipating

right now we're down about what sixty

seven hundred customers that are

currently de-energized and we should

expect most of those customers to get

back on today probably the latest view

I imagine scattered tomorrow but we

expect more power outages Saturday

evening at the moment into Sunday

hopefully turning back on on Monday and

we are doing everything in our power to

mitigate the scale and scope of that and

to make sure that they turn back the

power on as quickly as they can let me

on that subject make a point that's

important to make when the determination

to turn back on power is made you can't

do it unless you investigate the lines

to make sure that they're safe and that

takes time what we have done so you know

where the state has been we are

providing air resources infrared

technology so even during night time the

California Highway Patrol and it's

planes can do a lot of that

investigation to supplement the work

that's being done by PG&E all in an

effort to as quickly as humanly possible

get those lights back on

they have specific prescriptive

Ultimatum I would encourage you to go

back to the legislation we passed in

July which was historic in a heroic

effort to get ahead of ourselves before

the fire season in that legislation are

specific measurable roles and

responsibilities that we all will play

the state Public Utilities Commission

the AIA use the city and counties with

support from the state but more

importantly the the utilities themselves

that have a five billion dollar

obligation to invest in public safety

hardening undergrounding vegetative

management etc including technology that

allows them more precision to

de-energize

without having to turn off a switch

where the entire house goes out but one

room at a time all of that is laid out

in that legislation legally required if

they're ever to access the capital that

we're willing to put up to help PG&E get

out of bankruptcy and secure the other

io u--'s so that they can go out in the

bond markets with higher ratings and be

able to access capital to complete their

improvements I don't mean to complicate

this but we spent six months on a daily

basis working to put together that

package and I cannot impress upon you

more to look at what now is required

we're not reacting to this moment we

specifically laid out a framework in a

direct pathway for them to get back to

solvency and get back into the business

of being a good business anybody else

Oh Thank You governor

and thank you for the question so

fighting the fire with power shut off it

doesn't change a lot of the fire fight

itself communication flow and

particularly communication flow with the

public is where the bulk of the

challenge is Sonoma has worked

diligently to better inform the public

through early warning systems and so

some of that is happening here some of

that still needs to be built out built

out and and brought to bear in other

parts of the state but in general the

actual act of firefighting is not a

difficult process with the power out we

usually are fire fighting fire with the

power out because fires take out the

power as well there is something that's

important to know though we have

critical infrastructure for firefighting

that when there's no power makes it

difficult to do for instance retardant

plants at air bases they require power

to churn and mix the retardant pump it

into the airplanes that drop the

retardant the important thing here is

that we know this we put generators in

place we're ready to go so we flip the

generator on we mix the retardant we

pump the retardant it doesn't matter if

the base is out of out of power

so these are things that the state has

leaned forward we've been working with

the utilities understanding that this

was going to happen potentially over the

last eight or ten months and knowing

that there are places where we're gonna

have to do those kind of things we have

and that is how we're getting around

some of the power related issues

and that is a typical issue when we're

talking about wildland fire wildland

fire is different than municipal fire

and we have had fires running into

municipal areas it's part of the reason

we need to get people out of the way

because we're not just fighting a fire

in a structure that might spread to

another structure we're talking about a

conflagration that's coming into a town

people need to be out of the way we

can't ensure that we're going to be able

to save every one of those structures

we're gonna try but we can't ensure

number one is people lives in property

second then so the water source is

something that that we often deal with

and it's not something new to us there

are certain certain systems that require

power to remain that charged and keep

the the tanks full that that that then

enter the system and we are adept at

working through that doesn't change the

fact that there could be a group of

firefighters that are trying to find

water during an event and they may not

be able to do that or may not be able to

find sufficient water but that is

something that we deal with regularly

and we adapt and overcome and what we

thank you my name is Mark esic I'm the

sheriff of Sonoma County so some of the

things that we've taken proactive steps

on to deal with power outages is kind of

going back to the older style we've

equipped all of our patrol cars with the

high low siren so we are able to get out

into neighborhoods knock on doors and do

evacuations without having to have

technology without having to have power

so that's the most basic step we've

taken we've really leaned into that

currently we have over 50 deputies in

the geyser Ville area in the east hills
