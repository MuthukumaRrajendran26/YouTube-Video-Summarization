thank you very much everyone merci

beaucoup

thank you so much everyone

thank you so much thank you so much

merci beaucoup Delta BC it is such a

great pleasure to be here in Richmond

Hill a riding we will win on Monday

ladies and gentlemen and ridings all

throughout the GTA all throughout

Ontario all throughout Canada ladies and

gentlemen do I ever have good news for

you

we are only two more days away from

getting rid of Justin Trudeau's

scandal-plagued tax hiking deficit

running law-breaking government two more

days

[Applause]

you know Justin Trudeau has been flying

around like the high carbon hypocrite he

is flying around in his two planes but

after Monday he's gonna need two moving

bands but we've got a little bit of work

to do first ladies and gentlemen our

campaign to help Canadians get ahead is

nearing the finish line but now is when

I need your help our candidates need

your help the most in these critical

final days when we have to push the

hardest to get our vote out so I want to

thank you all for the work you've done

but we're gonna need everything you have

left to convince your friends and

neighbors to join the millions of

Canadians who are already voting

conservative in this election because

Canadians aren't counting on us to help

make life more affordable the overworked

underpaid single mother barely making it

into the end of the month she's counting

on us the risk-taking small-business

owner trying to make payroll and keep

her company afloat she's counting on us

the parents the parents who spend hours

commuting every day to support their

family and save for the retirement

they're counting on us and the seniors

being squeezed by higher prices for

groceries and home heating they're

counting on us Canadians are counting on

us ladies gentlemen they're counting on

us to finally help them get ahead

[Applause]

because that what this that is what this

election is coming down to who do you

trust to put more money in your pockets

so you and your family can get ahead

[Applause]

now we know how much we can trust Justin

Trudeau

[Applause]

this is the same Justin Trudeau who

looked down the barrel of the camera

look at Canadians in the i-ight he said

that he he said he would be as honest as

he possibly could be so and he said that

he would balance the but sorry that the

budget would balance itself in 2019 a

promise he never meant to keep then the

ethics commissioner found him guilty of

breaking ethics laws not once but twice

and he still won't let the RCMP

investigate the S&C Laughlin corruption

scandal and that's why when we form

government

I will hold a judicial inquiry into his

scandal to get to the bottom of what

he's done

now wow-wow or let's we're gonna get to

the bottom of his scandal we're gonna

vote him out vote him out vote him out

[Applause]

now Justin Trudeau has spent this

campaign telling Canadians that they've

never had it so good

and you know what I'm sure in his world

that might be true remember when he was

asked about higher gas prices he said

that higher gas prices are exactly what

he wanted well trust fund millionaire

liberals like Justin Trudeau might not

worry about $2 a litre gasoline but the

hard-working Canadians I meet every

single day they definitely do and that's

why we're not we're gonna cancel the

carbon tax ladies and gentlemen

and you know the government shouldn't be

for the people who are already doing

well conservatives we're in it for the

people who just need a break the parents

who sit around the dinner table like

mine often did crunching the numbers to

figure out how they're going to make it

to the end of the month

that's who I'm fighting for and that

ladies and gentlemen is who I will

govern for so let me tell you what I'm

hearing from the Canadians I've met all

across this country there is frustration

and anxiety out there and it's real for

the first time perhaps ever there is a

sense that future generations might not

be better off that no matter how hard

you work you're just not getting ahead

feeling that the dreams and goals that

you have for your children are getting

harder and harder to reach that's not

the Canada I know and love Canada

should be a place where hard work is

rewarded where no goal is out of reach

and where no ambition is too big that is

the Canada I want but under Justin

Trudeau the majority of Canadians are

stretching their last dollar just to pay

their bills almost half are overwhelmed

by their debts and middle-class families

are paying more and more in taxes but

life shouldn't be this difficult for

people who work hard and do everything

right and that is what conservatives are

all about getting government out of the

way so that people can create for

themselves a brighter more prosperous

future it's not the government that

should be getting bigger it's your

patient paycheck that should be getting

bigger

[Applause]

that's what my plan is all about as

Prime Minister I'm going to bring in a

tax cut for everyone a universal tax cut

that will put $850 back in the pockets

of an average earning couple and

conservatives know that heating your

home in the middle of January and

Ontario is not a luxury it's a necessity

so we're gonna take the GST off of home

heating and home energy bills we're

gonna boost the RESP so you can save for

your kids education and we're going to

bring back the kids and children's

sports and activities tax credit but of

course job number one the very first

piece of legislation that we will be

that we will bring in the first order of

business for a Conservative government

will be called an act to repeal the

carbon tax

[Applause]

and we're gonna do this by getting rid

of corporate handouts to multi-billion

dollar companies and cutting foreign aid

to wealthy countries that don't need it

or hostile regimes that don't deserve it

that money belongs to you not to them so

we're gonna make sure it stays in your

pocket you see that is the big

difference between liberals and

conservatives liberals believe that

opportunity can only come from the

government but conservatives know that

it is Canadians who make this country

work to drive our economy to solve the

problems we face as a country

liberals put their faith in government

conservatives we put our faith in people

ladies and gentlemen no amount of

government can match the ability of

small business owners to create jobs no

amount of government can match the power

of the free market no amount of

government can match the generosity of

our people because the dollar left in

the pocket of the Canadian who earned it

is always better spent than in the hand

of the politician who taxed it

when I look ahead to Canada's future I

see a country that creates its own

opportunity but under Justin Trudeau

Canada has become a country of no no to

big nation building projects no to our

energy sector no to standing up for

Canada on the world stage and no to

hard-working entrepreneurs who create

jobs but while Justin Trudeau says no my

Canada is a country of yes yes yes to a

stronger more united country yes the big

projects that put our people to work yes

to lower taxes and balanced budgets and

yes to more money in your pockets and

you know people here in Ontario know

better than most the damage liberals do

when they're allowed to govern just look

at Ontario after the McGinty win era

higher taxes endless deficits bigger

bills the most debt of any non national

government anywhere in the world and

scandal after scandal after scandal and

now Justin Trudeau is using the exact

same playbook in fact many of the people

who are architects of the damage the

Liberals did to Ontario are now working

for the federal liberals in Ottawa so we

cannot let Justin Trudeau do to Canada

what Kathleen Wynne and Dalton McGuinty

did to Ontario and that's why

conservatives are going to send them

packing on my name

[Applause]

[Applause]

but we know we know that they know that

they're in trouble we can tell because

Justin Trudeau is now leaving the door

open there's speculation about forming

some kind of a coalition government with

the NDP just so he can sling link to

power a coalition in which he may be the

spokesperson but the NDP will be calling

the shots for higher taxes fewer jobs

bigger bills and for less money in your

pockets and we know that this coalition

will raise the deficit by billions and

taxes will have to go up to pay for it

now he may raise the GST or Ebay raise

personal income taxes but Justin Trudeau

needs to have the guts to tell Canadians

exactly which taxes he's going to hike

to pay for this NDP liberal coalition

but we're not gonna let that happen cuz

we're gonna win on Monday

[Applause]

Canadians know Canadians know that this

would be a costly coalition that they

could not afford and now the choice is

crystal clear a choice between a

coalition that will drive up taxes drive

out jobs and make life more expensive or

a conservative majority that will lower

your taxes and put more money in your

pockets it's between a costly coalition

that will wreck the economy and put

thousands of Canadians out of work or a

conservative majority that will grow the

economy and help all Canadians get ahead

[Applause]

it's between a coalition that will wage

war on our industries and divide the

country or a conservative majority that

will unite the country around our shared

prosperity so let's turn the page on

this failed Prime Minister and let's

elect a new Conservative government this

election

that is the choice Canadians have where

justin trudeau will abuse the power of

his office to reward his friends and

punish his critics I will bring back

integrity and ethics to government and

shine a light on his corruption where he

will call smil small business owners tax

cheats I will always be on their side

where he will be bullied and pushed

around on the world stage I will always

stand up for Canada with strength and

for Canadians where he will demonize

people for what they believe I will

stand up for freedom of thought freedom

of speech and freedom of religion where

he will dump wastewater into our lakes

and rivers I will stop the dumping of

raw sewage into our rivers lakes and

oceans ladies doma where he will keep

buying oil from corrupt dictators I will

work to get Canada off of foreign oil

where he will look a war veteran in the

eye and tell our veterans that they are

asking for more than he can give I will

honor their service and their sacrifice

and make sure they get the benefits that

they deserve where he will say no to the

big dreams and aspirations of Canadians

I will say yes and where he will cut a

deal with the NDP to cling to power and

stay honest Prime Minister I will form a

government that lives within its means

so that we can lower taxes and leave

more money in the pockets of Canadians

that is the choice this election that is

the choice for Canadians let's get out

there let's finish this campaign strong

let's win on Monday for all Canadians

for all of Canada

god bless Canada thank you all so much

lady Jolie merci
