what we saw this year was really unusual

but it was not unprecedented a shift in

weather patterns at the bottom of the

planet has helped to shrink the hole in

the ozone layer to its smallest size

since its discovery higher temperatures

in the stratosphere have closed the gap

to six million square kilometres a

quarter of its peak size we've actually

seen really high September temperatures

over Antarctica three times in the past

40 years it happened following the

breakdown of a weather phenomenon that

most Canadians have grown to loathe

warmer temperatures around the world

shifted the polar vortex at the South

Pole and without cold air ozone

depletion slows down when that does

happen we get a very small ozone hole

the ozone layer is a 50 kilometer wide

shield that occurs naturally above the

earth protecting us from the sun's

harmful rays man-made chemicals get

caught up in the winds at the equator

and are directed to the south by the

force of the polar vortex in the

southern hemisphere during polar and I

to get super cold these reactions start

happening and then when the Sun comes

back the ozone is depleted but then the

Sun is back things warm up so then the

ozone hole goes away the ozone hole was

discovered in 1985 and by 1988 every

world leader understood the dire

situation and signed the Montreal

Protocol and more than 30 years after

that binding international treaty was

signed it still plays a vital role in

the climate conversation the treaty is

working the phase-out is working and the

atmosphere is is recovering

while the treaties goal was to limit

damage to the ozone layer the banning of

certain chemicals led to an unexpected

gain if we had not phased them out

global warming would be 10 years worse

than it is now so the most important

thing we've ever done so far to curb

climate change has been to phase out the

chemicals that were destroying the ozone

layer and as the Earth continues to warm

scientists are now trying to figure out

how future generations will fare the

connection between global warming in the

Antarctic stratosphere is it's it's less

clear exactly what we would expect to

happen in the future and while some

countries continue to use banned

chemicals the overall decline under the

Montreal Protocol is a good reminder

that when the world comes together for

the greater good CFCs are going down and

so eventually the ozone hole will

disappear you
