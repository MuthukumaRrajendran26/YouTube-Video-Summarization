Kuwait's shares a border with Iraq but

security in the two countries couldn't

be more different compared to its

neighbor Kuwait is an oasis so it's a

logical place for Canadian troops to

come and sit out the current tensions

stemming from the u.s. killing of the

Iranian couth sports leader custom

soleimani the Chief of Defence Staff

Jonathan Vance said this week that some

Canadian troops are being brought here

from Iraq and he said this was being

done for their safety and security

during what's been described as an

operational pause now the dangers faced

by Canadian forces in Iraq were clear

this week when the Iranian forces

launched a missile strike on a base or

Canadian troops were stationed although

men were harmed and over the coming days

we're hoping to learn more about what

happened that night and also how the US

Iranian tensions are going to play out
