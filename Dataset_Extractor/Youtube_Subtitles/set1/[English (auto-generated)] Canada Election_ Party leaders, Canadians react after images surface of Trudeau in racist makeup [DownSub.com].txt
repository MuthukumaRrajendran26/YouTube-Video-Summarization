Global News obtained this video from a

source within the Conservative Party and

independently verified it to be true

with Liberal Party officials before

reporting on it it shows Justin Trudeau

in blackface the video was filmed off

another screen with no sound and shows

the liberal leader in full body makeup

raising his arms and appearing to stick

out his tongue the video was taken in

the early 1990s what I did hurt them

hurt people who shouldn't have to face

intolerance and discrimination because

of their identity this is something that

I deeply deeply regret Trudeau mentioned

Wednesday that he'd done it once before

at a certain talent show when I was in

high school I dressed up at a talent

show and sang dale with with that with

makeup on but he never mentioned this

video his apology wednesday came after

Time magazine published the first photo

of him at an Arabian Nights theme gala

in 2001 all this has allowed his

opponents to double down on their

campaign trail messaging that Trudeau's

actions are unacceptable well I think

Canadians might have been able to accept

Justin Trudeau's apology if he hadn't

lied about it

but he was active asked specifically if

there are other incidences and he said

that there was only one other incidents

now we know that there are at least

three it's not for me to forgive it's

for Canadians to forgive him if they

choose to or not but I have to really

point out what we're seeing now is an

ongoing pattern of behavior that's

really gonna hurt Canadians they're

gonna see the Prime Minister mocking the

realities that so many Canadians live

with and it is not a joke it is

simply unbelievable that anyone would

have such an elapsed of judgment as to

think that that was okay even then the

nature of the photo is that had it been

a different candidate the Liberal Party

would be now saying you have to step

down on social media many seem willing

to forgive Trudeau given that he's

apologized but many agree even back then

he should have known better we all make

mistakes as long as we apologize and we

acknowledge that we've done something

wrong I feel like what people need to

realize is when dressing up in say

cultural outfits you don't necessarily

have to put on the skin colour as well

like you can dress up as a Latin and

people will still get the character

without you

painting your skin I mean he apologized

right at the end of the day at least he

did Travis tan Raj Global News
