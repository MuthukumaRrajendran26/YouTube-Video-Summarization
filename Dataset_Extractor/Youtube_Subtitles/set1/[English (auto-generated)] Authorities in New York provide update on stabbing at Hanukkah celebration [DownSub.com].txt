morning all we're just coming out of a

meeting discussing this terrible

terrible incident which took place last

night in town of Ramapo you want to

thank the governor for his leadership

and always doing the right thing in the

right time came down this morning

standing with us supporting us and the

governor will share with us some present

was the present and future plans thank

you so much thank you thank you thank

you I want to thank mr. Spitzer for his

leadership I want to thank the members

of law enforcement who were here chief

of Ramapo police the sheriff Falco who

you'll hear from in a moment the State

Police are here

law enforcement did a great job last

night and I want to thank them very much

the local officials who were here the

community liaison people who are here

it's a very sad situation obviously it's

also very disturbing I visited with the

rabbi this morning when he talks about

what happened it's even more frightening

than the report you read in the

newspaper or saw on the television and

inexplicable no warning nothing said

just hate just hate and violence that's

all it was

now I would like to say that I wish I

could say that this was an isolated

situation unfortunately it's not we've

had 13 acts of anti-semitism since

December 8th in New York State I'd like

to say it's it's only those 13 but the

truth is we've had incidents of hate all

across the state against the LGBTQ

community is the african-american

community the Latino community

and it's not just about New York State

this is a national phenomenon that we

are seeing and it's frightening and it's

disturbing if anyone thinks that

something poisonous is not going on in

this country then they're in in denial

frankly how many incidents do you have

to see from from coast-to-coast

hostility based on religion based on

race based on creed but based on

immigration status it's all across the

country it is an American cancer that is

spreading in the body politic an

American cancer

turns one cell in the body against the

other once we become intolerant of

differences then we are intolerant with

America because America is all about

differences we are all from someplace

else and we were founded on the premise

of tolerance for the differences these

acts are intolerant they're ignorant to

attack the Jewish community the nation

is based on freedom of religion George

Washington celebrated with the Jewish

community that's what America is all

about

ignorance intolerance and it's also

illegal and for government the question

is what are you going to do to stop it

and how are you going to protect us

thirteen incidents against the Jewish

community nationwide scourge of

hostility other incidents in this state

attacked the ignorance attacked the

intolerance education cultural awareness

but attack the illegality yes it's

ignorant yes its intolerant it's also

illegal

and we will enforce the law we're going

to have an increased police presence we

have the toughest hate crimes law of

laws in the United States of America and

we are going to enforce them to the full

extent of the law I also believe the

situation has gotten so bad

frankly that we have to increase our

legal enforcement not just with more

police but we have to change the laws to

call this what it is this is terrorism

it is domestic terrorism these are

people who intend to create mass harm

mass violence generate fear based on

race color creed that is the definition

of terrorism and just because they don't

come from another country doesn't mean

that they're not terrorists and they

should be prosecuted as domestic

terrorists because that's what they are

and I want this state to be the first

state to have a domestic terrorism law

to express how ignorant this is how

intolerant it is and how criminal it is

and I'll be proposing that law for this

state New York is all about diversity

New York is all about tolerance

we're 19 million people from all across

the globe we're not going to allow this

poison to spread throughout our state

because it is a poison and no one else

can defeat this country but this country

can defeat itself it has to stop

government must take the lead and New

York State will with that let me turn it

over to sheriff Falco who has been doing

an extraordinary job and it's my

pleasure to be with him today

Thank You Louis yes I want to start off

by saying got a call as soon as the

incident happened from chief Brad white

Delta the Ramapo Police Department he

personally responded to the scene I take

my hat off to him and the Ramapo Police

Department shortly thereafter all police

agencies that were requested for

assistance the Sheriff's Office the New

York State Police the Clarkstown Police

Department the FBI the JTTF everybody

was on hand

I want to thank that we thank God that

we have the technology that we have the

plate readers that helped us apprehend

this person my hats off to the NYPD and

I received a call while the chief was

doing some briefings from Commissioner

Miller of the New York City Police

Department what did we need what do we

what do you need and he was all over it

and I want to thank the NYPD for helping

the Ramapo Police Department the

Sheriff's Office and the people of the

county of Rockland the governor touched

on a few things and you know I didn't

make any bones about it when I said to

him you know we had these new criminal

justice reforms and part of the criminal

justice reforms there's hate crimes

where there's no bail I honestly believe

that our our legislature needs to go

back and start looking at some of these

things I think reforms are good but I do

think some of them have to be looked at

to go even further where he wants to go

with his domestic terrorism stuff you

know we become complacent

throughout the United States of America

you know just a year and a half ago two

years ago Pittsburgh happened nobody

thinks it can happen in your hometown

nobody thinks it can happen in your home

county or your city or people it

happened and it happened here and we

have over 90,000 people of Jewish faith

that live in Rockland County so it's a

major concern as well as our schools we

are assisting the State Police out

checking all houses of worship which we

do every year as a pattern but we have

to go one step further we have to put in

folk new technologies and move the

says forward so I say that we hope that

this was the first time it happened in

Rockland and now we will do our best

with the State Police and the local

political leaders and state government

and our governor to try to make sure

it's the last time that it happens in

Rockland so I want to thank you and at

this time I'll turn it over to

supervisor Mike speck there's a list of

municipalities throughout the United

States that share a single tragic common

bond to the list of places that include

Pittsburgh coal a Jersey City we now

said they have to add the town of Ramapo

I was shocked when I received a call

last night about a stabbing near a house

of worship but part of me was not

shocked as the governor and as the

sheriff have said this is a problem

that's been a long time brewing within

our community and within the state and

within the country and it has to be

fixed it has to be solved I want to

commend Governor Cuomo for being here

for strong words of support and being

here to support our community at this

time of sorrow and tragedy I want to

especially bring up chief Brad white

Dell with me our police chief commend

the panorama Police Department for their

outstanding work along with all the law

enforcement agencies last night that

participated due to the coordinated

efforts of the town police the police

from neighboring towns the Sheriff's

Office the New York State Police the New

York City Police Department the suspect

in this case was apprehended very soon

and I want to also thank and commend the

first responders from the ambulance

course and the emergency services who

came treated the victims and fermented

this from becoming an even greater

tragedy within the town we are going to

take measures to hopefully prevent or

make it harder for these incidents to

occur in the future

we are going to look to obtain license

plate readers to make sure that our

interest is and exits out of the town or

monitored so that as has happened last

night when an event like this occurs a

suspect could be apprehended as soon as

possible the this will be worked upon in

the next few days within the town so

again I'd like to thank law enforcement

the first responders the sheriff and the

governor for being here thank you and

I'll turn this over now to Steve Gould

from the Jewish foundation thank you

Steve

hi my name is Steve Gould I'm

co-president of the Jewish Federation

and foundation of Rockland County as I

mentioned 82 the governor my parents

were Holocaust survivors and growing up

my father made me promise him that I'll

do whatever I can to make sure it never

happens again today I can say I failed

my father

I think the Rockland County has failed

my father and every Holocaust survivor

and the United States of America has

failed my parents and all Holocaust

survivors this cannot continue

I'm confident that the governor is going

to work on some rules and laws to help

this and and that we don't have to do

this I mean this is the festival of

Hanukkah

last night I lit my seventh candle and

when I lit the candle I said I hope

there's not gonna be another

anti-semitic incident the way they were

with the prior six days

unfortunately that wish didn't happen

I want to thank law enforcement all the

first responders the governor's office

the anti-defamation league for the quick

response and you know Federation of

Rockland is going to be out there and we

also have to make sure that if you see

something say something

thank you

Thank You mr. gold

brings to mind there is a quote at the

Holocaust Museum in Israel that says to

the effect a country is not just what it

does it is what it taught and that is a

haunting quote for us in this country

and I think our United message today is

we will not tolerate anti-semitism not

just in our words but in our actions and

government job is to protect people and

this state government will protect

people of the Jewish faith and every

other religion in this state

any questions for myself or any of our

colleagues which chief would you like

there's many chiefs here a few Indians I

will be able to provide his information

to you after the press conference his

his name his date of birth he's

currently being held at our police

headquarters he will be arraigned at

some point later today and he will be

facing five counts of attempted murder

and one count of burglary and

first-degree

he's from Greenwood Lake New York Orange

County

I don't have anything to share other

than that at this point we have an

active investigation we're working with

multiple partners my preference at this

point would be to let that investigation

continue to proceed without the further

comment

that would be speculation as to why that

house was targeted as a as opposed to

another location that's accurate that

information was relayed to us by a

witness and we immediately plugged that

information into the system as the

governor referred to and we're very

fortunate that my PD was all over this

right away and by putting that played

into the LPR system we got hits as the

vehicle went into the city and we were

fortunate to have an apprehension occur

down in the 32nd precinct as a result of

the LPR

data it was critical to the case prior

to the press conference I'm aware that

there are two still hospitalized as far

as their exact condition I don't have

that with me right now but there were I

don't know what the exact status is what

is critical or serious okay thank you

I'm sorry

no there's no information

nothing like

okay thank you all very much thank you
