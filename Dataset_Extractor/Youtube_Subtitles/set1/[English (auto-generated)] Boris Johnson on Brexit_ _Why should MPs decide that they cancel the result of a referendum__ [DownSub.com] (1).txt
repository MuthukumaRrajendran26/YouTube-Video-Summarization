we've got a deal oven ready by which we

can leave the EU in just a few weeks

it's a great deal for this country

it delivers everything that I wanted

when I campaigned for brexit we can

leave the EU as one UK whole and entire

and perfect as we promised and so it's

been frankly mind-boggling in the last

few weeks to see how Parliament first

first voted to approve this deal and

then voted for delay and I'm afraid that

it is clear that if Parliament had its

way then this country would not be

leaving even on January the 31st and

that of course is bad for democracy it's

disastrous for trust in politics

why should MP's decide that they can

cancel the result of a referendum and if

we can get this deal over the line with

a sensible majority government we

certainly can then we can release that

pent up flood of investment hundreds of

billions are waiting to pour into the UK

and we can inject a surge of confidence

into our system and that is our mission

if I come back here with a working

majority in parliament then I will get

Parliament working again for you on day

one of the new Parliament in December we

will start getting our deal through so

we can get brexit done in January and

unleash this country's potential I hope

very much that you will support us let's

get brexit done and unleash the

potential of the whole United Kingdom

thank you very much
