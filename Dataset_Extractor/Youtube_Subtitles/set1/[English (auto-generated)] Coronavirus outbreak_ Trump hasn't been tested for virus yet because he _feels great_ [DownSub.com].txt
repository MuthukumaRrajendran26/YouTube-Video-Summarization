so we just had a great meeting

tremendous unity of the Republican Party

and we're working on a lot of different

things

very good updates on the virus that's

working out very smoothly tremendous

people it's a tremendous task force they

have done a great job not a good you

have a great job as you know it's about

600 cases it's about 26 deaths within

our country had we not acted quickly

that number would have been

substantially more but we we just had a

meeting with stimulus and you'll be

hearing about it soon but it was a great

meeting there's great unity within the

Republican Party

well I was just with the Republican

senators and they was they were just

about all they're mostly all there and

there's a great feeling about doing a

lot of things and that's one of the

things we thought

well we're going to see if they came in

very tough a lot of them are things that

you wanted to get for other things and

we're looking at the people we're

looking at solving this problem also

some very good numbers coming out of

some countries where it started earlier

and we're seeing some fairly good

numbers come out of those countries

that's a good thing including China and

they've released numbers that we've

gotten some numbers from China that look

pretty promising so we'll be able to

further the report please well I don't

think it's a big deal I would do it I

don't feel that any reason I feel

extremely good I feel very good but I

guess it's not a big deal to get tested

and something I would do but again spoke

to the White House doctor

terrific guy talented guy he said he

sees no reason to do there's no symptoms

no anything if there were you people

would be the first to know it you would

you would maybe even tell me about it

yesterday

I've been believe toward every

contingency you can possibly imagine

many contingency so a lot of positive

different numbers all different numbers

very large numbers and some small

numbers too by the way look right now I

guess we're at 26 deaths and if you look

at the flu the flu for this year we're

we're looking at 8,000 deaths and you

know hundreds of thousands of cases we

have eight thousand deaths so you have

8,000 verses 26 deaths at this time with

all of that being said we're taking this

unbelievably seriously and I think we're

doing a really good job and again the

task force headed up by the vice

president has been tentative no I think

the u.s. is not a very good job on

testing we had to change things that

were done that were nobody's fault

perhaps they wanted to do something a

different way but it was a much slower

process from a previous administration

and we did change them we made the

changes but the testing has gone very

well or when people need a test they can

get a test when the professionals need a

test when they eat test for people they

could get the test it's gone really well

look the biggest thing that we did was

stopping the inflow of people early on

and that was weeks ahead of schedule

weeks ahead of what other

people would have done in fact other

people mostly would probably not have

done it even till now and that's made a

big difference I think the people are

doing a fantastic job in fact just today

I'm an inside governor Newsom Gavin

Newsom in California said tremendous is

an article just came out they had it

inside and showed it to the Senators and

I showed him other articles too where

governors Democrat governors are saying

we've done a fantastic job Gavin Newsom

said there's not a thing that he's asked

for that we weren't able to get him we

all are but it was a very positive

statement many Democrat governors have

said that the task force and the federal

government what we've done has been

terrific well this was unexpected this

was something that came out of China and

it hit us in many other countries you

look at the numbers I see the numbers

with just by watching you folks I see it

it's over a hundred different countries

and it hit the world and we're prepared

and we're doing a great job with it and

it will go away just stay calm the way

we want to protect our shipping industry

our cruise industry cruise ships we want

to protect our airline industry very

important but everybody has to be

vigilant and has to be careful but

become it's really working out and a lot

of good things are going to happen the

consumer is ready the consumer is so

powerful in our country with what we've

done with tax cuts and regulation cuts

of

those things the consumer has never been

in a better position than they are right

now so a lot of good things are going to

happen thank you very much
