what floor is he on

thank you all we had a great shot with

Mayor Kennedy Stewart and I'm ready for

any questions you might have

there's a there's a mic system going on

there we'll get you in the lineup but

yeah everyone's gonna get a question I'm

like radically open to questions please

hi mister saying it's Annie Bergeron all

of her from CTV CTV News reported last

night about a British Colombian man who

was given a medically assisted death

despite pleas from his family that he

was mentally ill and showed no signs of

facing imminent death

they say he should not have been given

the procedure do you think there needs

to be an investigation into this case

and do you think that there needs to be

clearer guidelines on who should be

getting medically assisted death in

Canada so I don't know the details of

this case and so I can't respond to it

specifically honest I know more about it

but I can speak to the general the

general concerns the the choice is a

very difficult choice and this is a very

hard topic to talk about

but we know we need to make sure that

the choice is available to people who

who want to make that choice and we have

to respect the dignity of a human being

who wants to choose to to make a very

difficult choice and it is hard to do

but we've got to make sure that the

criteria is broad enough to allow people

to make that decision in Quebec there's

a recent Court decision that pointed to

the fact that currently the the

guidelines are too restricted and don't

allow for people to make the choice when

they need to and they want to but what

you're describing is perhaps an area of

concern around the safeguards that need

to be in place to make sure people make

a decision or in the position to be able

to do so and just as a follow-up you

mentioned that Quebec case do you think

that there should be an appeal to Quebec

decision expanding the availability of

medically assisted death yes I've said

that before that I do believe that the

criteria should be broader that the

court decision made that very clear that

they found that conditions or the

criteria were too restricted and too

limited I do believe that they need to

be broad enough to to allow people who

want to make the difficult choice to be

able to do so

hi mr. sang Ashley work with CBC why are

you focusing a lot of your attention

here in BC des election well BC is

really important because

it's a province with I represent now as

as a BC Member of Parliament

representing Burnaby south and there's

been a lot of a lot of times when people

in BC feel like they're neglected and

ignored in an election there is that

sense that you know the west coast is is

not given the attention it deserves

massive population an economic engine

for the country but it often feels

ignored and I don't want that to be the

case I know that people in BC want to be

seen and want to be heard and that's why

I'm making it a very important part of

my campaign to be here to be present and

most importantly to respond to the

concerns that people have around housing

which we announced today that we would

tackle that crisis around healthcare and

around tackling the environment the the

climate crisis is felt really distinctly

in a lot of ways here in BC with the

forest fires you know where it's about

two weeks into the election and you

already went straight to your home

writing and burn to be south some say

that that's pretty early to go play

defense in your own writing would you

say to that

no no not at all I love being home what

my wife was there so I kind of missed

her if I can be really honest I wanted

to spend some time with her and I loved

being able to meet with with the people

of Burnaby the people of Vancouver and

Burnaby is one of those communities

where it's a pretty central place people

can come in from the Lower Mainland it's

very convenient for folks in Vancouver

and in Port Coquitlam and in Surrey so

it's a great place to be able to meet

lots of folks and I was happy to be able

to talk about healthcare and in our

farmer care plans and our plans expand

dental care so it was a great time to

build to chat with folks do Canada we

can demand lmm shots

Papa sibling so amateur we fetch our TV

hi so busy has already implemented of

speculation tax and vacancy tax why the

study for NTP missed you

we invented a virtue maybe another

foreign buyers tax well we've seen that

that foreign buyers tax has worked in BC

it's helped cool the market and control

the other control astronomical rising

cost of housing that we had seen before

that but we know that once there is a

tax in place in one jurisdiction the

problem can just move to other

jurisdictions so we don't want there to

be a scenario where people who were

using the Canadian market like a stock

exchange to put money into drive up the

cost of housing to just continue moving

to other provinces so we want to put

something national and also we

acknowledge that the work of the BC

government has resulted in housing being

the cou markets cooling a bit but we

know we can do a lot more and so we want

to build on the success by building and

continuing with our federal tax one of

the problem is access to ownership a

younger generation because of the stress

test or 30 section CMHC

do you have anything to relieve those

pressure for the down the generations

yeah I believe that our tackling the

root causes so the speculation and the

money laundering

these are

two things that are driving up the cost

of housing and making it impossible for

a young person to ever buy a house we

want to tackle the root cause and so

that browsing doesn't continue to rise

too fast for young people to ever afford

it we also want to build affordable

housing and we know that rental

affordable rental allows the market to

be flexible enough for people to choose

to buy a home or to rent a home so we

want to invest massively in building

half a million new affordable homes

which will create a better opportunity

for people to make a choice between

buying or renting but also make it

easier for people to eventually buy a

place hey hey so it nice to see you nice

even so you Justin Trudeau are

campaigning in DC at the same time is

there any sort of strategy to that or

any sort of plan nothing particularly

mean I it happens though it's a big

country BC is also a very important

place so we ended up here at the same

time but it's a great chance for me to

contrast and say we've got the phony

former care plan of the Liberals where

they've promised farming care for 22

years and they normally make the promise

in an election and then break it

afterwards now they've broken the

commitment in the election itself

because they've committed to not bring

in place a universal plan and so this

gives us a chance to show the contrast

on things like the environment and you

know their plan that mr. Trudeau's

talked about and the Liberal government

talked about is again just a phony plan

that people can't believe because we

know when it comes down to it mr.

Trudeau and the Liberal government have

caved in to the demands of big oil and

gas they met with the energy lobbyists

1,500 times and broke a commitment to

end fossil fuel subsidies so I'm happy

to make the contrast if you want

something that works for you New

Democrats are there for you you want

something that works for the powerful

the elite then you can choose Liberals

I'm hoping people choose us

hi mr. Singh hi there Mike Howell from

the Vancouver courier you just met with

the mayor I wanted to ask you a couple

questions about transit and the opioid

crisis would you did you commit to

funding the extension of the subway from

our beauties to UBC this is something

that mayor Stewart has asked for and on

the opioid file

he has been lobbying for a clean supply

of drugs I just wanted to be clear on

your positions

sure I'll start with the infrastructure

for for for public transit so mr. mayor

Kennedy mayor Kennedy Stewart made it

very clear that that's a priority for

him and I want to make it clear that a

new democratic government would support

those types of investments we've made it

a part of our our plan to tackle the

climate crisis to massively invest in

public transit we know that this would

reduce emissions one of the biggest

contributors to greenhouse gas emissions

is transportation

so we've committed to investing

massively in in projects that

communities want and that means the

other thing is it means specific

projects where there is a consensus in a

community there's a regional consensus

around that particular project or

speaking of we want to support

communities that want to build

infrastructure for public transit we

want to make sure people have a better

quality of life and we're reducing

emissions so we've got a massive

commitment to partner directly with

cities in a direct allocation funding

mechanism that would give access to

cities that want to expand their transit

and then on the second question the

opioid crisis is is devastating and

we're losing mr. mayor Mary Kennedy

Stewart brought up that in Vancouver

losing one person a day to the crisis

and I just think if there was any other

illness or outbreak that resulted in

that many deaths there would be an

immediate public emergency response and

so I made it clear that I would respond

on day one of a new democratic

government declared a public health

emergency open up funding and a legal

framework to help those who are

providing care to people on the ground

on the frontlines and then when it comes

to the safe supply question I'm open to

anything that we can do to save lives if

there's evidence that supports a policy

that saves people's lives we've got to

be open to that discussion I've

committed to changing our approach which

has been to criminalize addiction that

should not continue and I made that

clear commitment that I would

not do that I'm open to the discussion

around how we can save lives and

anything that has backing of evidence

and experts I need to we need to be open

to having that conversation on the

housing file you you've made a big

commitment to affordable housing can you

give us any specifics on how that would

lay out in the in the Lower Mainland

you're riding in Vancouver

how much housing can we be looking at

here so we've put out a broad commitment

and it there's two elements to our

commitment one is a tackle the the

underlying causes that are driving up

the cost of housing so we want to make a

massive commitment to dealing with

speculation with the foreign buyers tax

and to money laundering which is driven

up the cost of housing in BC at least 5%

well it might be a lot more so we want

to dedicate funding to an anti money

laundering division in the RCMP

specifically dedicated to tackling money

laundering and of the funding that we're

committing half of that should go to BC

to tackle the issue because it's really

ground zero here in BC so that's to get

the root cause and then our commitment

to the the 500,000 half a million new

affordable homes we're gonna roll out

more details but the the broad

commitment is this we want to work with

municipalities with provinces with

not-for-profit organizations that want

to build housing and we want to back

that up with federal money this used to

be the case 30 years ago three decades

ago the federal government was involved

in building cooperatives it hasn't

happened and a large part of the the gap

in the housing market and affordable

housing has directly been attributable

to the fact that the federal government

has not in made investments we've got a

make up for that lost time but really

investing boldly now but you got them

thank you

hi mister saying I just want to follow

up on one of my colleagues questions

about opioids

I believe that during your leadership

campaign back in 2017 you supported the

idea

of drug decriminalization and in the

current platform it says that the party

would end the criminalization and stigma

of drug addiction

so would you decriminalize drugs if an

NDP government were to get elected yeah

we would absolutely change our approach

there is no reason that people who are

dealing with mental health and addiction

and poverty should be criminalized that

is the wrong approach it means that

people don't get the care they need they

don't get the help they need and really

if you're dealing with mental health

addiction and poverty you don't need to

be treated as a criminal you need be

treated as a patient that needs health

care and a compassionate response and we

want to save lives and we cannot

continue doing things the way we've done

it in the past if we want to change the

outcome we've got to change the way we

do things okay and on a separate subject

sorry about this lots of questions today

the Liberals today and the Conservatives

have both come out with tax credits or

grants in terms of retrofitting homes

and helping homeowners do that the

Liberals are giving homeowners a $40,000

interest-free loan paid back over 10

years the Conservatives are offering a

refundable credit on your tax income for

home improvements from $1,000 to 20,000

I know the NDP has something in their

platform it says it would save about 900

dollars annually for families I believe

it's an interest-free loan I'm wondering

what you say how your plan would benefit

homeowners who are looking to retrofit

potentially better than the other two

parties and how it compares well the

real comparison is this the government

the the governments that we've seen in

Ottawa whether they've been liberal or

conservative have really made it their

priority to help those at the top

they've helped the wealthiest the most

powerful and they've made it they made

it harder for everyone else they made it

harder for families the economy feels

rigged for so many Canadians they feel

like they're falling behind we're

committed to putting in plans that help

people out our plan is not to help those

at the top or the richest and it's hard

for people to believe mr. Trudeau now

and the Liberal government they make a

lot of commitments and when elections

come around and they break those

commitments and so it's another example

of another fake promise they're gonna

say it whatever it takes to get elected

and it's not something that's credible

our plan is real and credible and people

can believe us that we are committed to

making sure we retrofit all homes and

buildings and that's really when it

comes down to on a super public
