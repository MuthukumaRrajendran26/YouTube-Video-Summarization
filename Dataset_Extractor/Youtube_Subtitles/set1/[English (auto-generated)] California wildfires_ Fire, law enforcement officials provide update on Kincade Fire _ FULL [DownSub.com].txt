my name is Jonathan Cox division chief

and public information officer with Cal

Fire incident management team 6

I'll just to start things off I remind

everybody to mute their telephones in

the room and if you do need have a

conversation to please do that outside

we have multiple representatives behind

us today please know that if you have

one-on-one questions for them there will

be time afterwards for you to meet

individually with them additionally at

the conclusion of this English language

press conference we will have a

spanish-language version available so

should there be the need that will be

available after this one just to start

things off I'm going to give a brief

update from where we left off last night

after last night's press conference and

just kind of set the stage overnight we

obviously saw the wind surface through

Sonoma County coming from the northerly

northeast direction with that we had

fire activity that increase spotting

ahead of itself and burning into some of

the closer areas to the more popular

excuse me more populated spots in the

county with that firefighters made

aggressive attacks on the fire defending

structures as well as contending with

downed trees and downed power lines at

the same time that the fire fight was

going on last night and continues today

we had the incident commanders at the

command post throughout the entire night

evaluating the need for additional

evacuations throughout the area at 4:30

this morning

additional evacuations were ordered for

Northern Santa Rosa and that was based

on the current and expected fire

conditions so now I'd like to welcome up

to the stage to talk about the current

weather conditions from the National

Weather Service mr. Waldron all right

good morning again so last night on the

fire lines itself we did get reported

wind gusts of 76 miles an hour within

the fire environment under those red

flag conditions the red flag warning

does continue through 11:00 a.m. Monday

morning so we still have approximately

another 24 hours straight of red flag

conditions in addition in the

firefighting world we look at the

humidity values very close

the humidity values went down into the

single digits which is dangerously low

low for fire spread as we look into this

afternoon we're kind of at the peak of

the wind event right now it's important

to note if you're down low places like

Santa Rosa Windsor you may not be

feeling winds quite as strong but does

have you as you move up every five

hundred to a thousand feet in elevation

there's very strong winds aloft at the

start of this press conference we were

still getting winds on the order of 70

to 80 miles an hour up at three to four

thousand feet so we still have a another

good 24 hours or so of dangerous red

flight conditions things will improve as

we head into Monday and Tuesday but we

need to be resilient as we look at we

like we have another north wind event or

another dry event that's going to impact

the region Tuesday night into Wednesday

thank you speaking next from incident

management team six will be our fire

behavior analyst Steve Ballmer a good

morning last night we saw an increase in

fire behavior due to the winds that came

through that the meteorologist spoke of

those winds pushed that fire down into

the 126 corridor and down into those

communities we've got spotting

potentials up to and over one mile in

certain areas we've got rates of spread

that are extremely dangerous at this

point with erratic fire behavior this

fire we know what what it's doing we

know where it's going to go the problem

is is when we have a new start those new

starts that we're going to get are going

to be very problematic they're gonna

have the same effects as this fire right

here the same rates of spread the same

spotting potential if anything does

start on the opposite side of 101 the

west side that area hasn't seen any fire

history since the 1940s so the the fuels

in that area are extremely dense they're

extremely old and decadent and they're

extremely dry so we're currently

modeling all the fire behavior

potentials that we can have for this

fire that we've got the Kincaid as well

as for other areas in the surrounding

location that could be potential

problems

thank you now we are gonna introduce one

of the incident commanders Mike blank in

hind behind me he's gonna give you a

quick update of the current status of

where the fire is a co who'd be behind

me on the map chief blank and I'm just

to echo what the I meant yep and have

talked about we did see those conditions

materialized about one o'clock this

morning as predicted when the weather

showed up again as predicted we saw the

fire conditions that that stood st

warmer talked about so up in here at one

o'clock in the morning the fire started

making rapid runs to the south and to

the west and by about probably 2:30 3

o'clock in the morning had crossed 128

the fire right now is fairly well

established on the south and west side

of 128 in between 128 and highway 101 it

has not crossed highway 101 yet but it

is starting to impact highway 101

between Healdsburg and and Windsor so

with that priorities today are going to

continue to be the west side the south

side and if possible keep crossing

highway 101 if we're not able to do that

the map probably looks quite a bit

different than what you saw it yesterday

we've built a pretty expansive

organization on the west side of highway

101 to deal with that if it comes across

the highway and starts making a run into

the communities west of there we've got

the organization and built and staff so

we'll be ready for it when it comes

across thank you Thanks just so we can

get the chief back to the command center

can we have anyone who has questions

specifically to the fire operations

right now if they have any questions for

chief Blanken hi now would be the

appropriate time

predicted fire conditions I think very

concerned like you can see the map there

we've built a fairly expansive

organization and are staffing it right

now and working with our partners in law

enforcement build an evacuation plan

that they'll speak to here in a few

minutes so short answer is very

concerned

that's what's currently impacting that

there are plenty of other places that

could possibly cross that but the

current impact right now is an area that

you just described okay thank you chief

Rankin home a next like to invite up to

the the podium the sheriff for Sonoma

County Sheriff ESIC good morning I'm

mark ESIC I'm the sheriff of Sonoma

County it was quite a night for us we

have over a hundred and eighty thousand

people under evacuation right now some

of the evacuations that we added

yesterday afternoon and through the

night included the areas around

Sebastopol and West County and I could

say that although I've heard some people

express concerns that we are evacuating

too many people I think those concerns

are not not valid at this point as we

see from this report we just received

our evacuation of Healdsburg in Windsor

yesterday was well warranted there is

significant danger to anybody who's

still in the Healdsburg Windsor area or

the unincorporated areas around Windsor

so please if you were in those areas now

we're still encouraging to get out

we have deputies and peace officers in

your neighborhoods they can't assist you

if you're not sure if you're an

evacuation area we want you to check the

map we have plenty of maps available you

can get them on Sonoma County dot org as

well as some of the Cal Fire web sites

we currently have over 262 peace

officers in the field and those are

supplemented also by the National Guard

we are using our peace officers in the

National Guard to maintain checkpoints

for evacuation areas and we're also

having that strong police presence there

to really assure people that if they

have a

evacuated their property their homes

will be safe we've not had any reports

of looting at this point and I as far as

I'm concerned we're gonna take a very

aggressive standpoint on looting we will

not tolerate it and that's why we have

so many peace officers in your

neighborhoods to protect your property

so one thing you can continue to do if

you hear our high/low sirens we want you

to be alert to that we still have

deputies out in the field evacuating

including the West County and in some of

those expanded evacuation zones so

please if you hear the high/low siren

take note of it

that means the deputies in your area you

can go to that deputy or that peace

officer and they will help direct you

and give you instructions the one thing

we don't want you to do is we don't want

you to call 911

our 9-1-1 center is very busy right now

we're gonna use 911 for only really one

reason right now in the evacuation part

of this is if you have a medical need or

some medical inability that prevents you

from evacuating call 9-1-1 and we'll get

peace officers there and medical

personnel there to get you evacuated if

you just have questions about the

evacuation process please call 2-1-1 and

we can just get you general information

please continue to follow us on Nixle

sign up for so covert facebook twitter

instagram we're updating all those

sources right now as long as we have

continued to have communications and

power we will continue to update all

those different sources for people and

we will respond to your questions

sheriff's office has been serving Sonoma

County for 170 years this is our

strongest moment now our staff are out

there they're ready to go and they're

here to serve you so please seek out our

deputies seek out our partners and we

will take care of you

thank you I speaking next in the

California Highway Patrol is chief noise

good morning everybody Tim noise

assistant chief California Highway

Patrol I just remind everybody as the

evacuations were going out yesterday a

lot of people were evacuating you saw a

great deal of traffic we appreciate the

fact that everybody was heading

southbound I do want to thank everybody

because even though it was heavy traffic

we didn't have major in

and that really helped keep the flow

going as quickly as we did we'd still

have a heavy flow this morning going

southbound we please continue to heat

these evacuation orders this is a major

incident and we're still bringing in

additional resources not just locally

but regionally and we need these

roadways clear to move these and plus we

have a lot of emergency situations and

the system's really fluid so we're

moving equipment very quickly back and

forth so if you have nothing to do with

this area please stay out of the area

please keep the roadways clear this

morning early this morning we did have

the 101 closed we were able to reopen it

however I hate to inform you that as we

are speaking we are reclosing the 101

freeway from errata to Dry Creek due to

no visibility pretty much across the

roadway through that area and due to

heavy smoke we are going to be moving a

lot of equipment through that area so

please stay away from the area and we

will continue to try and keep the

roadway as clear as possible and for

everybody else just please keep using

the your your patience and calm leak

evacuating like you have been in the

area the powers been out for a great

deal of time we still have a great deal

of intersections that have no power

remember to treat those blacked out or

flashing traffic signals at stop signs

and for those of you guys that are

stopping don't assume the other vehicles

going to stop make sure that your it's

clear and because we want everybody to

be safe and get out of here as quickly

as possible because every time we have

to respond to something that's that much

more of our resources that are being

tied up to help everybody else so thank

you next representing the sonoma county

board of supervisors supervisor rabbit

thank you very much first off I got to

just say how grateful we are to all the

firefighters the law enforcement

personnel and to all those who have come

to Sonoma County in our time of need we

know last night in spite of our obvious

concerns going forward could have been

much much worse without the battle

fought by the firefighters out there it

was a full-court press they put on last

night and that remains the case as we

speak we know there are more resources

coming

to our aid here in Sonoma County we know

we are not out of the woods and the wind

conditions that were ferocious continued

even today as you heard and the red flag

warning remains in effect we ask

everyone to stay out of the evacuated

areas we ask everyone to stay off the

roads as well we ask everyone to take

care of themselves take care of your

family your neighbors Public Safety is

our highest priority

there are new evacuation centers being

set up as we speak I can tell you that

Napa Valley College is an evacuation

center now crosswalk Community Church

over in Napa also has facilities the

Marin County Fairgrounds is also open to

residents of Sonoma County who are

evacuating and lastly the Alameda County

Fairgrounds is a another spot where you

can take large animals so thank you for

that again public safety is our

number-one concern we need to let the

firefighters be able to do their job

we appreciate the orderly evacuation

that took place in the great job by the

sheriff but we need to stay safe we need

to stay vigilant we need to make sure

that you are signed up for alerts as we

go forward and I would recommend that

you look at SoCo emergency org SOC Oh

emergency org for the latest on

evacuations and other emergency news

from the county of Sonoma and I also

want to say thank you to all of our

state partners as we ramped up more and

more shelters with the number of people

that have been evacuated the cooperation

the collaboration has been nothing short

of wonderful so thank you very much

thank you in regards to the evacuation

zones of the map you see behind me the

live fire map that many of you are

streaming does have the most current

evacuations in Sonoma County that

includes zones one two three four five

six seven eight nine and ten those are

all currently under evacuation and that

is showing on the map

I'm moving forward we ask everybody in

the area of Northern Sonoma County if

they are not in an evacuation area to

obviously have a plan that includes what

things they might need such as paperwork

pills pets documents and photos should

we need to expand evacuation orders into

other areas that is that probably the

single most important people thing

people can do right now if they are

outside of an evacuation zone currently

we have three thousand plus firefighters

now out on the line that includes a

significant number of air resources air

resources will be out there throughout

the day we have an air attack officer at

higher elevation who's bringing in

aircraft when the targets of opportunity

present themselves within the realms of

wind speed and visibility and finally I

just want to say thank you to every

member of the public who has assisted

the firefighters by evacuating early we

are only successful when the public does

evacuate and we from the bottom of our

hearts thank you for evacuating early

that that really does help our our

efforts with that I'd like to open up to

any questions from the media for any of

the speakers behind me

sure are you talking about a Hanley fire

or a different fire

right you're talking about the the west

side of 101 yeah we can get you fire

information about fire history we do

know that a lot of fires in California

tend to burn in the same locations the

tubs fire was an example of that one the

Hanley fire from the 1960s so we do look

back at the last hundred years about

where fires burned and how they behaved

to try to help us in the in the current

situation look at if the fire does get

to that location where is it likely to

move

so that's a great question we're talking

about Napa County and in Calistoga our

liaisons and our la liaisons and all of

our incident commanders are currently

working with the surrounding counties

Lake County in Napa County specific to

Napa County I do know that they are

working on looking at what the potential

impact is on there and if and when that

decision is made it will be broadcast

yeah I believe it's just spotfires but

it is fairly close to 101 it's between

128 and 101 currently hence the reason

101 is closed and the concern obviously

is with that wind still pushing directly

west it it jumping 101

yeah so as far as visibility goes with

the with the naked eye looking down from

an aircraft smoke can be a hindrance to

us we do have the ability to once or or

so add a get infrared up there and

actually take a look at where the heat

is with infrared cameras that look

through the smoke so that's done on a

cycle and obviously once that done were

able to see where we're more the smoke

is I would say right now with the with

the amount of wind we're getting at

higher elevations we're just seeing the

spotting issues that we have ahead of

ourselves as soon as the map is produced

you know it's it's changed since that

moment so there there's a lot of concern

out there for the the progression of the

spots that we're seeing absolutely yeah

yes so a rough estimate right now is

November 7th obviously you know we're in

a little bit of a defensive position

with Mother Nature at the moment and

that's that's always has the potential

to change but know that November 7th is

our target yeah so we have a whole

liaison shop on the incident command

team and those liaison officers

specifically work with other

stakeholders external to the actual

incident itself so utilities is a part

of that
