Liz Clark and her fiance are Millennials

on the move looking to buy their first

house in the Greater Toronto Area but

their search for that dream starter home

has fast become a nightmare it's pretty

terrible I think it's pretty it's pretty

sad though at the age of 30 and 31 that

were having as hard a time to find a

house for many years first-time

homebuyers who couldn't afford big city

prices looked to the suburbs communities

like Milton an hour's drive from Toronto

not long ago this was Canada's fastest

growing municipality but these days for

many including Clark even Milton is out

of reach yeah it's a lot more than you

kind of anticipate for sure

now housing prices even here in Milton

have gone sky-high the price of an

average single-family home here is now

nearly $900,000 still a bargain compared

to the nearly two million you'll be

forced to pay in downtown Toronto we're

seeing now house prices are appreciating

more and more every year those soaring

prices have made housing a key election

issue but some of the proposed solutions

could make a bad situation worse by

increasing debt and demand it's just

gonna make house prices even more

expensive the Liberals are promising to

increase loans for some first-time

homebuyers up to 10% of the purchase

price the Conservatives want to review

the mortgage stress test which forces

buyers to show they could still afford

their mortgage if interest rates rise

both the Tories and the NDP also want to

raise the amortization period to 30

years that would lower monthly payments

but analysts worry it could also

increase debt and housing crisis that's

one of the biggest risks in our economy

that everyone is very very highly

indebted the other reason is about

policies it actually fuels the man and

pushes prices up so actually are not

that much better off if house prices are

going up 10% a year

he says instead of increasing demand

party should focus on supply last year

in Canada 37,000 new apartments were

built but demand increased by 50,000

and speaking of supply the Liberals are

promising to build a hundred thousand

new affordable homes over the next 10

years the NDP want to increase that

number to half a million homes a massive

undertaking Donna but in both cases

they're short on details in terms of

exactly how they plan to make that

happen lots of ideas Jeff but not a lot

of detail is there any single idea that

any of the parties have that experts say

could really make a difference to people

well there was one that seemed to be

popular and it speaks to the concern

about vacant housing in this country a

recent report found that almost 10% of

the housing market in Canada is sitting

empty we're talking about more than a

million homes that are either

temporarily occupied or left vacant now

the Liberals want to increase taxes

slightly on homeowners who leave their

properties sitting empty but the bottom

line Donna is that if you're a young

voter hoping to get your foot on the

housing ladder for the first time this

election is not expected to be a

game-changer for you all right Jeff's

simple thank you
