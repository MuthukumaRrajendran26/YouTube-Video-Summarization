20:20 has been a remarkable year for

global events unfolding at seeming

breakneck speed from the targeted

killing of iran's general Soleimani to

the tragic shoot down of a plane filled

with canadian citizens to fears of a

global pandemic and its economic impact

on markets and trade we have already

seen global economic and supply chain

disruption there are very real potential

challenges by being clear we get a

behavioral response that cushions the

economy for the norovirus affect our

lives and it's important that Canada be

prepared for the effects beyond those of

health we are currently engaged in a

gray zone conflict with Russia that they

are largely winning the war is off

joining me now is Fred Kagan of the

American Enterprise Institute thank you

for joining us Fred it's great to be

with you you know we've been talking

about a lot of global issues Russia Iran

China all in the headlines people

looking at kovat 19 right now you're an

expert in critical threats what do you

believe the single biggest global threat

is right now that keeps you awake at

night

the single biggest global threat is that

is the erosion and possible collapse of

the rules-based international order that

is being fueled by a lot of different

malign actors but that poses an

incredible danger to countries like the

United States and Canada that benefit

from that order more than any others you

were just here in in Ottawa late last

week we shared a stage together and we

were talking about Russia and during

that you said that essentially we are at

war as the West including Canada with

Russia whether we know it or not I think

that's a statement that would surprise a

lot of our viewers at home so what do

you mean by were at war with Russia

the Russians are pursuing a set of

deliberate operations in Ukraine

throughout Europe in the Middle East in

North Africa and elsewhere to advance

Putin's desires Putin's goals which are

antithetical to our security

requirements and he's using military

force to do that he's using diplomatic

force and finish

pressure and other things and we are not

really recognizing how cohesive is his

plan how cohesive are these operations

and how they are actually all moving

toward a single objective and we tend to

be a bit too focused in my opinion on

the risk of conventional conflict with

Russia and how we need to prepare for

war with Russia and we do but we are not

really seeing that he's actually

achieving his objectives without having

to use conventional warfare in the

current environment so how is that

threat manifesting then is it in terms

of fake news is that information

operations is it attacks on elections

how is this sort of existential war

playing out well it's all of those

things but it is also military

operations he invaded Georgia in 2008 he

invaded and seized an annexed Crimea in

2014 he invaded Don bas in eastern

Ukraine in 2014 he has put forces in

Syria he's now got forces in Libya so

there's a military component to this

which is significant but then of course

it's also that military those military

undertakings are primarily aiming to

support a general information operation

that is designed to distract the west

disrupt the West disrupt our democracies

persuade us that we're wrong that he's

right and just get us fighting amongst

ourselves so that he can achieve his

objectives without us resisting them so

if you were able to sit down at a table

with the Canadian Prime Minister Justin

Trudeau and give him advice on how

Canada should respond and what our role

should be in all of this what would you

say to him I think Canada can play a

really important role this is not right

now a conflict in which you can only

play if you've got big conventional

forces there's a place for that there

are places where that's important but

this is a conflict where soft power

really does matter it matters to Putin

how his information operations are

perceived it matters to him how the

legality of his undertakings is

perceived and these are things that

Canada can challenge as well or better

than the United States or other

countries there's a big diplomat

effort here calling things out calling

the Russians out not giving in to their

narratives as an example if I may in

Ukraine the Russians are simultaneously

a belligerent they are fighting on the

ground and they're posing as a mediator

as well in the Minsk talks in the Minsk

agreement and the Normandy format talks

we should not be allowing them to get

away with that that's something that

Canada can help with because that's

about Canada saying hey you Russia you

can't both be a belligerent and a

mediator

so either stop fighting or get out of

this mediator role and that would be

very valuable coming from Canada we

don't have much time left but I want to

ask you about Iran because it's

something that you've also written about

extensively in the wake of the targeted

killing of general Soleimani of course

what happened after that to the

Canadians who were innocent on a plane

shot down by the Iranians that's all

kind of gone quiet in the wake of kovat

19 but there are still many Canadian

families who are hurting what do you

think Canada should be doing in terms of

navigating that relationship with Iran

look I think Canada and the rest of the

West needs to understand that Iran is a

threat to them it is a threat to the

West in general it is a proliferation

threat both of nuclear proliferation but

also of terrorism which it has conducted

globally and attempting to disrupt and

achieve hegemony in the Middle East

which is not in Canada's interest or

anyone elses so we all need to craft

together a way of keeping sustainable

pressure on the Iranian regime in order

to prevent it from pursuing its

objectives and force it further and

further down the road where it has to

make a choice about whether it's going

to keep being an oppressive regime

seeking regional hegemony or whether it

is going to choose another path and that

Canada needs to be involved in that

discussion and we need to find a way to

reform a consensus policy that works for

us and works for Canada and works for

Europe right thank you so much for

joining us so to be with you that's all

the time we have for today thanks for

joining us for the west walk I'm
