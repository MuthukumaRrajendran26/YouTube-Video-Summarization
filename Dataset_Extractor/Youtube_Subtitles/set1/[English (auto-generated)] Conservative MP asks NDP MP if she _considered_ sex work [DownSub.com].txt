a Conservative MP is taking heat tonight

after an exchange in the House of

Commons about sex work

Arnold Pearson's remarks were directed

at an NDP MP during a debate on the

federal parole system after a sex worker

was allegedly killed by an inmate out on

day parole here's what he said I would

just respond to that by asking the

Honourable member across the way if it's

a area of work that she is considered

and if that is an appropriate mr.

speaker Mercedes Stevenson joins us now

Mercedes that's not a good look for a

party hoping to expand its base what was

the reaction yeah Robin definitely not

what the Tory is needed when they've

been struggling with their brand

following allegations of sexism and

misogyny in the party and as you could

imagine political opponents pounced on

this immediately claimed that it shows

what the Tories really think of women

mr. veer s'en stated that he was trying

to make a point that he believes women

are trafficked into sex work and they

simply do not choose it of their own

free will but backlash was immediate and

verson apologised mr. speaker I'd like

to apologize unreservedly for my

comments towards the towards a member

from Victoria Thank You mr. speaker

after question period NDP leader jug

meat Singh was quick to characterize the

comments as sexist I think it was he was

disrespectful to a fellow colleague and

that was wrong I think his comments

strike of misogyny Global News asked the

party of fierson would be reprimanded

but they simply said the MPs

unreservedly stands NDP MP laurel

collins the woman who was asked the

question and the female MP at the center

of this tweeted that she accepts veer

syns apology but said he should extend

it to all women and not denigrate sex

work

alright Mercedes these are the kinds of

challenges the next leader will have to

deal with and we have some new numbers

on that race tonight tell us about that

yeah an exclusive poll for Global News

shows that Peter MacKay is the

front-runner in the Tory race with 40%

of Canadians saying that they would

consider voting for the Tories under

McKay's leadership that's a significant

lead but lately

has been his own worst enemy he had a

tone-deaf tweet about Justin Trudeau's

yoga and abrupt into a TV interview

caught on camera

and today he backtracked on his position

on Canada's Embassy in Israel Mackay dis

cheer after the election saying that the

defeat was like having a breakaway on an

open net missing the net but with this

pace of missteps he's in danger of going

down the same road robbing Mercedes

Stevenson in Ottawa
