let's bring in our Ottawa bureau chief

Mercedes Stevenson to look at what Prime

Minister Trudeau and the Liberals will

have to tackle straight out of the gate

when they return to Parliament

Mercedes what are the first priorities

with the Liberal government well Robin

no doubt the first priority for the

Prime Minister is to find a way to

govern a divided country and policies

he'll be able to put through Parliament

that opposition parties will support the

two big platform promises that the

Liberal government made and they'll

focus on deal with affordability and

climate change both of which the Prime

Minister made a point of raising

repeatedly today a government source

says that Prime Minister Trudeau's very

first move will be to pass the promised

middle middle-class tax cut break that

would be by eliminating income on the

first fifteen thousand dollars that

people earn that move would see some

people pay no tax and the Liberals say

that it would save the average family

around $600 a year pharmacare is another

possibility that the government could

look at but it's expensive and

complicated that said the NDP is

promised that they will push for it and

the Liberals put out a report on it just

before the election so keep an eye on

that when it comes to climate change

another major priority for the Liberals

the Prime Minister had a number of key

election issues and promises based

around that one of the critical ones

that they've said they will do is to

surpass the 2030 carbon emission targets

and to be carbon neutral by 2050 but how

exactly the government is going to do

that is unclear interesting though that

there's no sign of backing away from

trans mountain despite NDP opposition to

that project and today the Prime

Minister reiterated that the money and

profits from trans mountain will go to

green energy and environmental programs

on the nonpartisan front medically

assisted dying will be perhaps the most

complex issue that this Parliament has

to confront a Quebec Court has ruled

that the federal government has to

expand the criteria or considerate for

medically assisted dying as it's

currently too restrictive so keep an eye

out for that

okay the Prime Minister is really not a

coalition but as he perhaps looking at

alliances uncertain issues along the way

well you can bet that they are talking

to opposition parties right now trying

to determine who they can work with and

meeting with leaders in coming weeks

that's something he talked about today

and it's something that government

sources reiterated to me behind the

scenes

may not be a single Ally but a case

where they're working with different

parties on different issues the presence

of the bloc québécois significantly

changes the dynamics of Parliament but

they've said that they won't dissolve

Parliament unless they feel the Quebec's

interests aren't being heard

the NDP are likely to back the Liberals

on a number of issues as they shift the

left to govern and they could also work

with the Tories on some issues

especially things like tax cuts and

considering this government doesn't have

any representation from Alberta or

Saskatchewan the block is in the

strongest position right now because the

Tories are facing internal questions

about their leader and why they didn't

perform better Robin Wright Mercedes
