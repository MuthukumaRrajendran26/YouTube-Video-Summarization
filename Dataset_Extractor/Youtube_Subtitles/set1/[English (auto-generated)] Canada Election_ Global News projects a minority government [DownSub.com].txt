Global News is now projecting a minority

government a minority government now

we're not saying liberal conservative

and Mercedes David that's because we

just don't know at this point nothing

about the who yet which of course is

critical but it tells us that those

numbers we were seeing early on Donna

and David but the pollsters have been

telling us we're in fact accurate the

Canadians were not ready to hand the

reins to any one government to be in

power at this point they're clearly

expressing that they want a little bit

of give and take they want someone to

really rethink whoever that is what

they're doing in Parliament and it'll be

a very different situation for whoever

along this minority government lasts

than what we've seen over the last eight

years

David Justin Trudeau's lost his majority

he has and Nathan was saying earlier

tonight Nathan :

that losing your majority is a clear

rebuke to the guy who lost his majority

it is and whether it's a slap on the

wrist I'll go to that point or a kick in

the butt would be the next thing how

deeply is the Liberals are off to a

pretty decent night and the Liberal War

Room today was suggesting they would

finish up the night around 150 seats

we'll see in Ontario where the numbers

are just closing now the Liberals won 80

seats in Ontario in 2015 on their way to

a majority there again this is from some

conservative sources saying we think

they're gonna win 80 seats again in

Ontario and that would be again a very

solid minority but either way it's a

minority and that means and I think

Justin Trudeau is going to take a look

at this when he gets over the night but

it's the progressive side of the wing

it's the bloc it's the NDP it's the

green support that is eating away

particularly Atlantic Canada and that is

just intruders gonna have to say I

really blew it with my progressive

promises and he's probably gonna have to

make some adjustments on that front I

don't think you're writing a speech

though huh he probably won't go he

doesn't

dick in the butt can I say that on TV I

think I can
