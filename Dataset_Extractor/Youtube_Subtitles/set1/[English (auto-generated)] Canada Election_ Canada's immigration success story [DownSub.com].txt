look at Torontonians on a city street 33

years ago almost uniformly white today

the mix of cultures has transformed

Canada's biggest city into a global

melting pot Justin Trudeau's black face

incidents Quebec restrictions on

religious symbols and the emergence of a

National Party critical of mass

immigration raise questions about

Canadians inclusiveness we need to

receive fewer refugees and ipso survey

this year found almost four in ten

Canadians agree that immigration is a

threat to white Canadians the Canadians

are losing confidence in our immigration

system conservative leader Andrew

Shearer has criticized the government's

handling of irregular border crossings

but that represents a fraction of

Canada's overall immigration numbers

Canada now welcomes some 300 thousand

immigrants per year most are in the

economic class that contribute directly

to the economy about one-fifth are

refugees and other humanitarian cases

others come as part of family

reunification it's changed the makeup of

the country in ways that other countries

are studying and copying the overall

Canadian system of immigration it's been

one of the most successful in the world

in fact you know there's delegates from

governments across the world who come to

Canada on a regular basis to see how we

manage migration Canada's point system

ensures most newcomers will step in pay

taxes and boost the Canadian economy in

fact the country's low birthrate and

high number of retirees make immigration

essential without immigration the the

sustainable pace of growth in the

Canadian economy would be close to 1

percent and that would actually feel

like stagnation so if we want rising

prosperity if we want an increasing

standard living in Canada we actually

need immigration Canadians largely

recognized the value of immigration and

the main parties in this election

recognized the political value of new

Canadians the writings that encircle

Toronto could be decisive in next

month's election and they are teeming

with immigrants any party who's going to

be successful in the campaign is going

to have to appeal to those voters and

that and that immediately makes

immigration an important issue in the

campaign the parties may differ on the

number of refugees but there's no

serious debate that immigrants

should be curbed in fact the issue going

forward is how many more immigrants the

country will lead ultimately with aging

demographics as baby boomers as that the

labor force were actually going to need

to increase our immigration levels the

world is increasingly competing for

skilled immigrants and Canada as a head

start in making them welcome Eric
