was a full moon good morning and thank

you for joining us today it is great to

be here today with an outstanding member

of our liberal team Allen Howe Allen

never stops working for this community

and he's the voice you deserve in Ottawa

now I've just had a great chat with some

families here in Markham about something

I hear right across the country how life

just seems to keep getting more and more

expensive between a mortgage and

groceries day care and cellphones

monthly bills are going up and families

deserve a government with a plan to do

something about it my friends that's

what we've delivered over the last four

years and that's what we're ready to

keep delivering for the middle class

we're starting from a good place after a

decade of cuts and austerity under the

previous Conservative government in 2015

Canadians voted for change and we've

made real progress whether it's by

lowering taxes on the middle class or by

introducing the Canada child benefit the

results speak for themselves thanks to

our plan the average Canadian family is

$2,000 better off than they were under

Stephen Harper that's what you have

that's what happens when you choose to

invest in people but we know our work

isn't done families are still feeling

the crunch so here's our plan to keep

moving forward

a reelected Liberal government will

lower taxes again for the middle class

saving the average family almost $600

every year that matters to people so

we're going to get it done right away

today I can announce that cutting taxes

for the middle class will be the first

thing we do as a reelected Liberal

government we did it before and we'll do

it again now as much as investing in

families should be a no-brainer it isn't

at the

top of everyone's list the first thing

Andrew Shearer would do his first action

as Prime Minister would be to tear up

our plan to fight climate change

taking back the money that we're putting

in your pockets

because our price on pollution doesn't

just keep our air clean it makes big

polluters pay and gives that money right

back to families that makes a real

difference for people but I guess Andrew

Shearer doesn't think you should keep

getting a hand think about that for a

second the first thing we'll do is keep

moving forward to make your life more

affordable

the first thing Andrew shear will do is

to take us backward and it'll make your

life more expensive frankly it's not

just the environment that can't afford a

conservative government

it's the middle class because Andrew

Shearer would reduce taxes for multi

millionaires by $50,000 a year that's

more money than most Canadians make in a

year

I don't think the wealthiest should get

a tax break I think you should get a

break and whether it's this new tax cut

or our commitment to reduce people's

cellphone bills by 25% every month

that's what I'm focused on

Ontario are seeing what happens when

politicians promise to be for the people

and then cut the services they rely on

larger classes for your kids less

support for your communities that's the

real cost of Bukka beer and now Andrew

Shearer wants Canadians to double down

on conservative politicians like Doug

Ford twice the tax breaks for big

polluters and the wealthy and twice the

cuts for you and your family my friends

that's not the way it has to be because

we have a real plan to invest in

Canadians and to make life more

affordable for the middle class on

October 21st we have a choice to make

do we go back to the failed policies of

the Harper years and double down on Doug

Ford with Hendra Shearer or do we keep

moving forward it's up for us to decide

and I know where I stand I'm for moving

forward for everyone next evil

we still have a little over we can have

to go in this election and over the

coming days and week we will be getting

out there talking to Canadians from

coast to coast to coast about the really

important choice they have to make in

this election the very first thing

Andrew sure will do is rip up the only

serious climate plan Canada has ever put

in place the next thing he'll do is give

a tax break worth $50,000 to

multimillionaires we are going to lower

taxes for the middle class and continue

to fight climate change in ways that

supports ordinary families that's the

choice Canadians are facing

Doug Ford called Jason Kenney courtly

Petraglia Baskar owner mayor at near

about the result I highlighted and

recognize how much Quebecers amongst

many other Canadians are preoccupied

with the environment are worried about

climate change and the block cannot lead

the fight against Jason Kenney and Doug

Ford on a pan-canadian vision to fight

climate change which is what we've put

in place and Andrew shear will not take

on his friends Doug Ford and Jason

Kenney

to stand up against big oil and fight

against climate change the choice is

very clear the Canadians want to wake up

on the 22nd of October with a government

that will rip up the only serious plan

that has been put in place to fight

climate change in the history of the

country and let Envy shear cut taxes for

multimillionaires by

$50,000 a year or we would continue to

move forward on lower taxes for the

middle class and people working hard to

join it and a real plan for our kids

future that fights climate change and

build a stronger economy I'd like to ask

you again just what my colleague was

talking about there the path to a

majority it seems less likely right now

when voters go they might want to know

how you would work with someone else

potentially and who would you work with

best

I think I'm not taking any votes for

granted across this country and we are

working in writings right across the

country because I've heard clearly from

Canadians that they don't want to see

tax breaks to people who are

multimillionaires tax breaks that end

with shear is proposing there'll be 50

thousand dollars in tax break for

multimillionaires which is more money

than the average Canadian makes in a

year we're going to lower taxes for the

middle class we're gonna fight climate

change with a realistic ambitious and

doable plan and we're gonna continue

working hard for Canadians every single

day and the choice Canadians are facing

in this election is go back to Stephen

Harper's approach that does nothing on

the environment does nothing for

economic growth and gives tax breaks to

the wealthiest or move forward on a plan

that has lifted 900,000 people out of

poverty that has seen over a million

jobs most of them full-time created over

the past four years and seeing a real

plan to both the fight climate change

and make it affordable for Canadians

that's the choice Canadians are facing

and that's what we're gonna stay focused

on okay would you be willing to work

with the bloc québécois which Canadians

see as a separatist party even though

they call themselves nationalism I think

Canadians know that I have always stood

for Canadian unity and always will but

quite frankly even as I crisscross

Quebec and the rest of the country

Canadians are not talking to me about

national unity

Canadians are not worried about national

unity nor should they be they are

focused on having a government that has

a real plan to fight climate change that

has a real plan to push back against

Doug Ford and and Jason Kenney and the

big oil companies who wrote Andrew

sheers environment plan we are going to

keep making sure that we're lowering

taxes for the middle class and people

working hard to join it and rejecting

Andrew sheers proposal to cut taxes by

fifty thousand dollars for the

wealthiest Canadians that doesn't make

any sense it didn't work under the

Harper years in terms of creating growth

and opportunity for families and that's

why we turned that around we invested in

Canadians we invested in their

communities and four years later we're

seeing the impact now the choices do we

continue to move forward or do we go

back to the failures of the Harper years

good morning uh Prime Minister Liberal

leader mr. Trudeau cardmaking David akin

Global News Prime Minister yes still

Prime Minister very true sorry just let

me get my notes handy I guess I'd like

to know and when we talked about

government cuts why your government has

suddenly decided not to pay the

provinces for their costs to provide

health care to Canadian servicemen and

women

and do you think it's responsible to men

and women in uniform that they could be

stuck with health care bills because of

that decision this is unfortunately

another example of conservative

misinformation what we are looking at is

ensuring that there is fairness the

reality is that the guttural government

is being charged significantly higher

prices for the same services for

military members as it offers to other

Canadians and we're just looking at

making sure that the system is fair for

everyone the reality is what we're

looking at will not cut any services to

any military members nor will it

negatively impact hospitals or service

providers but we're seeing a lot of

conservative misinformation in this

election campaign Canadians need to be

attentive

to that turning to a different matter on

Monday night in Nathan Cullen's riding

of ski nabokov Valley the frazer lake

and District Chamber of Commerce held an

old candidates debate the moderator

asked all candidates what are your views

on women's rights an abortion and your

candidate the Liberal candidate Dave

birdie replied and I'm quoting directly

here I am a pro-life and one thing I

don't do is I don't judge anyone who's

in that situation I leave that up to God

and the woman you have said and I'm

quoting you now someone who's not ready

to defend women's rights cannot run for

the Liberal Party should Dave birdie be

running for your part obviously we'll be

having conversations with that candidate

but every single candidate every single

future and present Liberal MP needs to

defend a woman's right to choose and

that means if they are candidates for us

they have agreed that they will not

support any efforts by anyone in the

House of Commons to limit women's

reproductive rights the Liberal Party is

unequivocally a pro-choice party and we

will never support limiting women's

rights to choose newsom or party Joshua

the fashion Nanak evoke it to know

consider a traveller be so Sontag edgy a

shammy and create took initiative give a

limit a leash wa gen fan just to follow

on David's question you take

conversations that sounds ominous are

you considering dumping that not at all

if that candidate is a candidate it is

because they made the engagement in

writing to never accept that anyone

would limit women's rights we are a

pro-choice party we will always remain a

pro-choice party or in a community with

very close ties to China to Canadian

citizens remain imprisoned in China

coming up on a year in December we've

seen the pictures from Hong Kong of

brutal treatment of democracy protesters

there and yet you've had one of your

cabinet ministers attend a gala

celebrating the founding of the People's

Republic of China wearing what point

do you start to reconsider our

diplomatic relationship and and take

actual concrete diplomatic action

against China we have been considering

and being very careful in our approach

diplomatically and economically with

China over the past years we have

mobilized countries from around the

world who have stood up strongly and

expressed to China their concern over

the two Canadians who've been

arbitrarily detained which is always at

the very top of our list whenever there

is an engagement with Chinese diplomats

or officials we recognize that the

arbitrary detention of Canadians is is

illegitimate and wrong and we need to

make sure we are moving forward to get

those Canadians home at the same time we

recognize that China is a growing

economic and political power in the

world and we have to work with them to

try and ensure both opportunities for

Canadians and that they continue to and

endeavor to play by the rules as

established in the current global

rules-based order that is something that

continues to require effort and

engagement but we will always do that in

a way that stands up first and foremost

for Canadian interests and for the

Canadians that are in difficulty more

Prime Minister your opponent is that the

Robson road crossing this morning and I

wanted to ask what plans you would have

if you're re-elected to stop border

crossings outside of with legitimate

border posts and also device how the

renegotiation of the safe third country

agreement is proceeding where you're at

with first of all I'm pleased that

people will be seeing the infrastructure

that we've built at Rock some Road to

ensure that every single person who

crosses our border whether it is

regularly or irregularly gets fully

processed by our immigration system they

get full security screenings they get

placed into our immigration system and

go through every step of our immigration

process

there are no shortcuts there are no are

no skipping steps within our immigration

system

everyone arriving in Canada goes through

the same immigration system and they've

a full rigorous immigration system that

is being applied we are going to

continue to work with partners in the

United States and around the world

directly talk with communities about the

fact that there are no shortcuts into

Canada and we will continue to

strengthen the application of our

immigration system because one of the

reasons Canadians are in favor of

immigration still when other countries

are turning away is that we understand

that it is beneficial to our economy to

our communities to our country to have

diverse people coming here and building

a better future for themselves but it

only stays positively supported by

Canadians because they have confidence

that our immigration system works and it

works and continues to apply in regards

to the United States we continue to

engage with them on measures that will

strengthen our cooperation our

collaboration and the integrity of our

borders and I wanted to ask you also

about president Trump's abandonment of

the Kurds to a possible invasion plane

Turkey those of course are not only

American allies they were Canada's

allies I said known for many years

fought alongside Canadian soldiers for

many years and they also hold probably a

few dozen Canadians who were formerly

members of the Islamic state in their

prisons which are in the potential

invasion zones so I wanted to ask you

first of all how do you react how do you

feel about that abandonment of the Kurds

what message would you send to the

United States to Turkey and others and

also how do you plan on dealing with the

situation of those former Islamic state

members who may now be set free we

obviously are working very closely with

our allies obviously the United States

but also other allies in the region to

ensure that we are creating long-term

peace and stability in the Middle East

we rec

that this is an area Canada has stepped

up over the past years we were very much

involved in training in northern Iraq

you know we were not in Syria we were in

northern Iraq and we continue to lead

the NATO training mission out of Baghdad

to make sure that we're promoting

stability and long-term institutional

and and people stability in Iraq we're

obviously monitoring very closely the

developments in the region between the

United States and Turkey and we will

continue to put stability in the region

and security of Canadians at the very

front order it is a crime in Canada to

travel abroad for the purpose of

promoting or supporting or participating

in terrorist acts and we will continue

to ensure that the law is applied the

mr. Trudeau just to any go back to the

military funding for hospitals can you

explain why some hospitals were charging

more for to treat military personnel as

well if you're renegotiating to make it

more fair will that not impact the

bottom line of those hospitals that

perhaps have been relying on that extra

funding that is why we've worked with we

are working with a we've established a

working group to exactly look into that

but we have made it very very clear that

no military service members will get any

cuts to services and hospitals and care

providers will not be negatively

impacted by this unequal treatment and I

wanted to quickly turn to the

debt-to-gdp you've said repeatedly that

the the federal debt to GDP is in pretty

good shape

but when you include the provinces and

municipalities we're actually in very

bad shape

perhaps as bad as Italy ins by some

accounts given that many people

economists expect perhaps the recession

or at least a market downturn coming

what kind of flexibility would your

government have under under your plan if

reelected we have a very different

approach than conservatives have had in

the past and have right now in this

election we don't believe that cuts to

services for people and austerity and

tax breaks for the wealthiest creates

growth or helps Canadian families in any

way Stephen Harper tried that for ten

years and had low growth and a lot of

families were hurt we made a different

decision in 2015 one to raise taxes on

the wealthiest 1% and lower them for the

middle class to invest in families with

things like the Canada child benefit or

the guaranteed income supplement

increase to invest in infrastructure

like public transit new housing and

transportation infrastructure and that

has led us to having the best balance

sheet in the g7 that is being put to

work for Canadians we know that one of

the best ways to strengthen families and

communities against

waters in the global economy is to

invest in them give them the

opportunities to build a stronger

present and a better future for their

kids that is the opposite decision from

when Andrew Shearer is proposing he

wants to lower taxes for

multimillionaires by $50,000 and we're

gonna lower taxes for the middle class

and give nothing to the wealthiest

Canadians

that's the choice Canadians are facing

in this upcoming election I want to ask

you about what your message is to the

undecided progressive voters

particularly here at the GTA who might

be wondering if they should how they

should vote and if they're undecided

could potentially split the vote and

deliver a win for conservatives I think

Canadians saw in the debate on Monday

night that talked about the environment

throughout the entire debate on every

different theme and I've heard it from

Canadians right across the country that

affordability and the environment are

top of mind in this election in over the

past four years even though we recognize

there's a need to do much more we have a

plan to do more we have done more to

fight climate change than any government

in the history of this country and we're

going to continue to do that we have

lowered taxes for the middle class

saving average Canadians about $2,000

every single year as compared to the

final Harper years we know that

investing in Canadians and standing up

to Doug Ford and Jason Kenney on the

environment is what we need from our

government that's exactly what we've

been doing we will continue to do the

choice facing Canadians is very very

clear do we have a strong government

that stands up to Doug Ford and Jason

Kenney or do we double down on

conservative cuts austerity and tax

breaks for the wealthy with no plan for

the environment
