I'm just wondering what you're going to

be doing to support the youth that are

suffering in the mental health epidemic

more of my friends than not through my

entire life have been depressed

self-harming severely anxious including

myself and and suicidal and I just want

to know how the mental health system

that you're talking about implementing

will support the youth specifically

thank you for thank you for raising that

I'm so sorry and please get the help

that you need and don't be afraid to ask

for that that's exactly that's we're

talking about 200 hours a week and how

expensive it is I'm just yeah just

thinking about diamonds makes me so sad

to think about that

young people here they care about you no

no it's okay it's okay we're here for

you we care about you these people care

about you thank you we okay with it

we all care much in this room right I

mean if there's any other reason I mean

for our young people we owe it to them

they you shouldn't be worried about this

like you should have to worry about it

right we're gonna make sure that is

covered like so we want to fund it as a

part of our health care system and that

means with all the checks and balances

you should get the care you need

whenever you need it you shouldn't have

to worry about the cost that's what we

want to do I want to bring it in I want

it to be funded I don't care what the

cost is I want to get it done I believe
