ferocious winds continue to stir up the

Kincaid fire Sunday morning ripping

through wineries and homes across Sonoma

County more than 12,000 hectares have

burned to the ground a devastating loss

for a region that was only just

recovering from the wildfires of 2017

and 2018 this is going to be potentially

unprecedented then for the county of

Sonoma if you receive an evacuation

notice you need to get out now tens of

thousands of people have been forced to

flee including residents in Santa Rosa

and tourists visiting the wine capital

of Healdsburg where the historic Soda

Rock winery was reduced to rubble Costa

3,000 firefighters have been battling

the blaze which began Wednesday

California's biggest utility admitted

its electrical equipment may have

ignited the fire

despite blackouts across the region and

weekend winds topping 130 kilometres an

hour created blowtorch light conditions

making it even harder to contain we're

talking hurricane-force winds and wind

just throws oxygen on to a fire you know

and when you have dry conditions and you

have a low relative humidity and you

have these strong winds moving in you

have the right recipe for disaster

further south in LA firefighters have

finally gained traction on the TIC fire

but for many it's too late with over

1800 hectares leveled I feel the heat it

was too much for my eyes back in the Bay

Area with high winds forecasted through

to Monday the front line fight continues

as residents face what the state calls

its largest plant power outage ever I

need a new battery I know that decision

that's left more than 2 million in the

dark in hopes of preventing more fires

and even more destruction Jamie Muro her
