folks cuz yeah okay

okay merci beaucoup thanks so much we

are here in Danforth with our candidate

mr. Cooley we're really excited to win

back this riding this was the riding

held by Jacqueline this is an important

writing to us and the people of this

writing have felt let down because again

liberals talk a good game during the

election but they don't deliver on what

people need

people need I just heard from someone

who said that their cell phone bill is

so high and we know that liberals

haven't moved to lower the cost of cell

phones and they're not going to because

they met with the lip the telecom

lobbyists over 550 times and they're

gonna make sure that the prices remain

high they're not ready to bring down the

prices the way we are gonna impose a

price cap make sure that there is

unlimited data plans that are truly

unlimited we've heard from families are

worried about childcare they're worried

about the cost of medication all these

things when it comes to pharmacare 22

years of liberal broken promises when it

comes to child care 26 years of broken

promises they don't deliver on

pharmacare they don't deliver on child

care we're gonna make sure we deliver

for people and then conservatives we

know they cut services and so Canadians

need to know this the people of Danforth

needs to know this the people of Toronto

need to know this you are not stuck with

two choices you know one owns your vote

you are free to choose what you want

vote out of don't vote out of fear vote

for hope

vote for New Democrats we're gonna fight

for you we're on your side

don't set elecci√≥n who's ever in schewe

una de barra zero until a conservator

who Leal available will publish was here

I'm governor mo even deputy keep have I

provoked Eva Sobotka poovu say newly do

Democrat on say K lay liberal in flash i

ago spawned on a like like campaign

electoral me to not what pond on is

Coney so no governor mom who knew on on

travaille provoked popular foolish me

poovu own epic Idol affair except so

much and I'm ready to take your

questions yes

hi

to win it but she's concerned about what

you said about the coalition and says

that now she's worried that people will

go and vote strategically because they

don't want to see a coalition but how do

you convince people that if that were to

happen it's not a bad thing well what I

see is that in Canada our history is one

where so many of the things that we're

proud of happen when you voted when

people voted for more New Democrats our

health care system was only possible

because Tommy Douglas fought for it the

New Democrats and progressives fought

for it but when we had changes to make

sure that seniors could retire with

dignity pension and CPP and old age

security these were things that were

brought in because New Democrats were

there so I'm saying to you I want to be

your prime minister but whatever

Canadians vote for come the 21st of

October I want Canadians to win and so

I'm saying to win if you vote for New

Democrats we will fight in whatever form

the government takes whatever power the

people give us to make sure we deliver

on the things that people need

healthcare investments Pharma care

dental care making life more affordable

tackling cell phone companies and making

housing more affordable and making sure

we fight the climate crisis like we want

to win it and making the richest pay

their fair share we can do that and we

just need your help no not at all I'm

proud of the fact that I'm ready to

fight conservatives no matter what and

however I can I think Canadians want

that the majority of Canadians don't

vote conservative majority Canadians

want to progress the government I'm

saying if you want a one that delivers

on real action one that delivers on the

investments that you need the services

that you need the health care the

medication coverage the dental care the

housing and real action on climate

crisis meaning ending fossil fuel

subsidies New Democrats will deliver

that for you and will deliver it no

matter what and that's what I wanna say

to Canadians we're not in it to win for

ourselves we're in it for Canadians to

win and whatever you give us we will

fight hard to make sure you get what you

deserve so don't settle for less

your Democrats have your back

to enforce it

this is last part okay okay and nobody

to pass care only fear dela fakie all

over sir but can't rally liberally Lily

avada services mom who license

medicament

universal welfare faster like this

climatic salut they neo Democrat he keep

on affair I hope he's encouraging people

to vote for me because that's that's the

real progressive alternative for people

we know that mr. Trudeau is not willing

to tax the rich as Canadians we put it

to him and people have asked him would

he be willing to put in place our super

or well tax on the super wealthy he

hasn't said yes and no other party is

willing to say we're gonna make sure

that the richest Canadians those who

have fortunes of over 20 million dollars

that they pay their fair share everyone

else

Canadians hard-working families

middle-class families they're paying

their fair share they don't need to pay

any more of the burden we're not gonna

raise taxes on middle-class and

working-class families but we're asking

the richest to pay their fair share mr.

Trudeau's not willing to do that so he's

asking folks to vote progressive that's

voting for New Democrats we're ready to

take those votes yeah

my man will get to you yes yes we're

gonna make sure ever gets a question we

stick around til everyone's done

but clearly this is it seems to be a

distinction that Trudeau is trying to

make and obviously in 2015 there were

many progressive voters that went and

chose the Liberal Party so what what

defines your type of progressive

politics sure with the Liberals they

like to talk progressive but they govern

conservative with your Democrats we are

always progressive all the way through

we don't switch one way or the other the

difference is we're willing to ask the

richest to pay their fair share

mr. Trudeau isn't we want to put in a

super wealth tax so that those are

fortunes of over 20 million pay their

fair share something that could raise as

much as seventy billion dollars in

revenue so we invest in services mr.

Trudeau likes to talk about pharmacare

we want to deliver pharmacare we want to

deliver a universal public farm care for

all the difference is we don't just say

we're gonna end fossil fuel subsidies we

were committing to ending them

immediately

mr. Shido talked about them and then

broke that commitment and with the

Greens they said they were willing to

the differences they say they're willing

to or open to working with the

Conservatives I've said I've ruled that

out entirely I will not work with the

Conservatives because they cut services

and they're their platform shows it very

clearly they are going to cut health

care they are going to cut transit so

there's no way I would support a party

that wants to cut all the things that we

need we're standing right here at a

transit stop we need to invest in more

transit not less yes you don't on fat

difference aka liberals on the progress

is key

sweet I serve on sabbatical year member

mattgenever nation's medical universal

in swanned entire national

newse just a few weeks ago there were

concerns that you were gonna lose party

status but in our recent poll there's

been a surge what has changed we've had

a campaign where people have seen

themselves reflected in the campaign

young people see a party that is

fighting for them that's gonna fight for

them that's gonna stand up for them

working-class people see a party and see

a leader and see us as someone who's

gonna say you know what we know that

you're hurting right now we know that

you're working hard and you're not

getting ahead and you feel like the

economy is rigged we see you and we hear

you and we're gonna make sure things are

better we're gonna make the richest pay

their fair share when they make sure we

deliver the services the health care

that you need

I just missed the beginning part of your

question I would just push back and say

that our strategy has been about

fighting for people and really what this

campaign has been about is that anytime

I get a chance to talk about the stories

that I hear from Canadians people who

feel like no one's listening young

people who feel like no one cares about

them we've been making sure that they

get the attention and the and the help

they deserve and so we're speaking to

those folks that say we're giving up

we're losing hope or don't think that

anyone cares about us we don't think

we're ever gonna get medication coverage

or the investments in healthcare we're

saying to them you will get it we're

gonna fight for you we're on your side

and I think that's really what what

people want in a government they want

someone who's gonna fight for them and

stand up for them and that's what we're

gonna deliver as New Democrats 2015 of

course that election was very divisive

all

so I'm just wondering what your thoughts

are on that how

well I could say generally that I

believe and people be able to put out

their opinions and have differences of

opinions I think that's important I

think that should be done in a way

that's respectful and in a way that no

one feels fear and I'm worried about the

recent threats to mr. Trudeau I think

that's wrong that no leader should feel

any sort of threat to their security

just because of what they stand for

I think mr. Trudeau is wrong and what he

stands for but I certainly don't believe

he should face any threats because of

that I believe that we should be able to

have a healthy discourse a healthy

discussion about politics which means

fighting for people standing up for

people and making sure they get the help

they deserve in this election I want

folks to know they're not they're not

stuck with choosing between the

Conservatives and the Liberals they've

got a free choice in this election and

we can do that respectfully we can do

that with hope we can do that with

courage to believe in a brighter future

[Music]

well folks in this writing I want to say

this is Jacqueline's writing this is a

rotting New Democrats elected amazing

MPs with mentally you'll have someone

who's a strong fighter with a proven

track record passionate about climate

change and fighting the climate crisis

passionate about social justice and

housing you're gonna have something

that's on your side that's not gonna

cave in to the powerful and wealthy

lobbyists that are pressured liberals

and the Liberal government to change

their positions you're not gonna have a

conservative certainly not in this

riding that's gonna cut services with

the new Democrat you're gonna have

something that's on your side and I want

people to dream big don't settle for

Less if you're looking in this election

for someone who's gonna fight for you

and deliver the things that you need in

your life fighting cellphone companies

to make sure your fees are affordable

and Internet services that are

affordable fighting to make sure we're

tackling the climate crisis it sauce to

democrats are gonna deliver that i think

they're gonna make their way over to you

sorry is that okay ctv important guy CP

is important too sorry of course

you spent a lot of time here a lot of

the other leaders have as well you

haven't been to some provinces

Newfoundland Prince Edward Island up

north what message do you think that

sends to people to voters in those areas

that are not living in vote rich areas

or swing ridings I'm sorry that I

couldn't make it out to all the places

that I wanted to make it out to Canada

is a very big country and there's lots

of places that I wanted to be able to

make it out to that I haven't been there

been able to to get you but I want folks

to know no matter where you live I know

that people in this country want better

health care

I know they want universal pharmacare

and they want better access to dental

care they know I know that people are

struggling with the cost of cell phone

and Internet services because they're

the highest cost in the world I know

that people are seeing government's in

Ottawa that have worked really hard to

make life easier for the richest but

haven't really made their lives better

and in fact have made their lives worse

I want those folks who know with New

Democrats we're in it for you we're

fighting for you because we're gonna

take on those powerful lobbyists we're

gonna make sure we we really take action

on the climate crisis by ending fossil

fuel subsidies and investing in clean

and renewable energy we're gonna make

sure we invest in health care that makes

your life better we're gonna invest in a

farmer care program that's gonna make

sure that everyone in our country has

access to farm care no matter where you

live Canadians can count on us no matter

where they live and they can count on us

to fight for them not for the rich and

powerful

power and influence in Ottawa well the

reality is the Senate doesn't really

represent people there their political

appointed positions that represent the

parties they represent the Liberal Party

they represent the Conservative Party

they don't represent the people and

their interests they're more interested

in being a mouthpiece for the political

parties that I pointed them I believe

people should have real representation

someone who's gonna fight for them I

also believe to give people true

representation means making sure that

everyone's vote counts that's why I

believe in proportional representation I

believe in giving power to people I know

that our country would be better run if

people had more of a say not less of a

say I believe our country would have

better results if their votes counted

more that's why I want to make happen

Wakita in the Fupa Aled 11a Simone JD

the collocated park opposite Wakita aid

Seba de Kock acocella maka the legless

Akita yeah yep yeah yes so I've got

three criterias when it comes to

projects and first and foremost it's in

making sure that the project is in line

with environmental concerns that

includes protecting the land and the

water in the air and it's in satisfying

environmental assessments but also our

plan to reduce emissions so it's got to

satisfy that criteria secondly it's got

to have the the social acceptability is

that we say in French but make sure that

it's something that it's in line with

the values of respecting the indigenous

communities that might be impacted in

local communities and finally it's got

to be a project creates jobs in

communities a job creation strategy if

those criteria aren't satisfied we

should not go ahead and in this case

I've said that it does not satisfy these

criteria and that's why I don't support

the project

Google Amman on Columbia Botanic so I

believe that the future of our country

is a future we're no longer using any

fossil fuel for energy that is a future

for our country in fact that's the

future for the world and we need to get

to that future the first step that we

can get to that future at the federal

level is ending all fossil fuel

subsidies and that's what we will do as

a government when it comes to projects I

made it clear that the project in Quebec

doesn't satisfy the three criteria that

I've laid out environmental social

acceptability and making sure there's

local job creation in BC I've said very

clearly that the BC government has the

most ambitious climate action plan in

North America and I support the climate

action plan which is ambitious and my

plan is to at the federal level make

sure we stop all federal funding and and

subsidies that go towards a fall service

sector and instead invest that into

renewable energy

talk about the debasement okay so I

would say I think we're pretty far from

an american-style election still I think

we're not there and I think we're proud

of I think we should all be proud of

that

Canada is is different and we're proud

of that but we still have a lot of

problems we still have systemic

discrimination or certainly have

systemic racism it applies to black

indigenous and people of color it

applies to many people because of their

sexuality because their gender and we've

got to tackle those things we've got to

be honest about those barriers that

still exist and the fact that we want to

tackle them when it comes to the

divisiveness in politics I believe it's

important to make the contrast to be

known it's important for people to be

able to put forward their ideas and have

differing opinions I want that to be

able to be done in a way that's

respectful and that's safe and that no

one should feel any risk to the security

recently we saw that there was a threat

and it caused an increased security

presence for mr. Trudeau and while I

disagree with mr. Trudeau's policies I

absolutely think it's wrong that he

should be faced with any threat to his

security and we should have climate in

Canada where we can have respectful

discussion and disagreements and I'm

going to do my best to make sure that

that's the type of tone that we strike

where we can disagree we can be

passionate but we're respectful and

everyone should be able to express their

opinions and safety I think that there

is a certain style of politics that is

built on division and that's wrong

politics that divide people simply for

the purpose of division and simply to

Pit one community into another to gain

votes is wrong and we're seeing parties

do that we've seen conservatives use

that tactic using terms of illegal to

describe people that are just seeking

safety and fleeing persecution it's

wrong to refer them in a flama Tory way

we've heard remarks about mass migration

which is also inflammatory and wrong it

dehumanizes people and I want to make

sure we always remember these are fell

human beings that are struggling we can

have an immigration system that balances

security and compassion but we have to

do it in a way that doesn't inflame

hatred or point the finger and blame

Canadians that are coming to our country

for a new home and for a new future and

in some way blame them for the problems

of housing and healthcare and jobs when

the reason that we're in this situation

where we've got precarity is not because

of a 12 year old refugee or a man or a

woman that's working hard 12 hours a day

in a labor job it's because governments

in Ottawa have chosen to benefit the

rich and powerful over families they've

given massive loopholes to the rich they

don't pay their fair share and that's

meant that we're starved when it comes

to funding our services they've given

massive exemptions to the richest and

they've made families suffer with lack

of services that's why we're in this

position and we can change that though

we can change that with better choices

thanks so much appreciate it

thank you everybody now C beaucoup thank

you

[Applause]
