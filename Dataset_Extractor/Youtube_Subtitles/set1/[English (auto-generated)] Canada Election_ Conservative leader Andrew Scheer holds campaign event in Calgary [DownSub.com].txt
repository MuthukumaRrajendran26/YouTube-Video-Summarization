Thank You friends neighbors and

supporters for being here today the

leader and I just came from an excellent

discussion with a cross-section of Calvi

women and have heard their reaction to

the outstanding family-focused

announcement of yesterday and today the

Conservative Party understands that

families are struggling in Calgary we

understand the importance of ensuring we

leave dollars in your pocket

on to you to spend on your families the

way you want to spend we understand

you're hurting because of lack of

pipelines tanker bans and callous

liberal attitude towards Western Canada

as your candidate I'm committed to

changing that I also want to take a

moment to thank the special guests who

are here today

my candidate colleagues Pat Kelly Martin

shields and LAN Weber and local elected

representatives the Winterthur and

Nicolas Milliken but now I want to

introduce the most special guest of the

day our leader the next Prime Minister

of Canada and you Shir

[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

yeah

thank you so much merci beaucoup how's

everyone doing this evening I want to

say a special thank you to all my

colleagues in the House of Commons all

my colleagues who are offering for a

reelection and our candidates here in

Calgary and across Alberta I've got a

piece of very good news to start off the

evening

I know Alberta can use some good news

it's been a tough few years but we are

less than 6 weeks away from getting rid

of Justin Trudeau scandal-plagued

government I have been able to visit

Alberta a few times since this spring's

provincial election and I can tell you

as someone who has come from

Saskatchewan who knows what it's like to

get rid of the NDP provincial government

things are already brighter in the

province of Alberta but unfortunately

for the province of Alberta this federal

government has been following the very

same playbook as the provincial NDP were

running massive deficits which threaten

social programs raising taxes and being

embarrassed about our natural resource

sector I can tell you that Canadians and

Albertans deserve a government and a

prime minister that is proud of our oil

and gas sector and will champion it all

across the world

[Applause]

I am glad that we live in a country that

celebrates the right to freedom of

expression and so I have no problem in

principle with people who protest our

oil and gas sector I'm glad we live in a

country where that's legal but I'll tell

you nothing frustrates me more nothing

makes less sense to me when I see people

tying themselves to trees and laying

down in front of bulldozers on the west

coast of Canada to block exports of

Canadian energy but I don't see them

lining up and down the st. Lawrence

protesting tanker after tanker of

foreign oil coming into our markets and

I'm here to tell you that as Prime

Minister I will be a champion for our

resource sector I will go around the

world promoting it and talking about the

benefits of having oil and gas extracted

at the highest environmental standards

where the revenues from that benefit

every single province every single

region in this country and that's why we

are going to restore confidence in

Canada's energy sector that will

revitalize Calgary revitalize Alberta it

starts job number one my colleagues in

the House of Commons know this already

but jag you heard it here first if you

haven't heard it already job number one

for a Conservative government will be

called an act to repeal than carbon tax

that's job number one

[Applause]

we're going to repeal bill c69 the no

more pipelines bill and we are going to

start the process to get an energy

corridor in this country so that Western

Canadian energy can flow to eastern

Canadian markets that once and for all

we can get off foreign oil and become

energy independent in this country a set

corridor initiative at da yayo Quebec

the capacity the partner is a saw energy

through La Liga Beckley's otra province

OC this is the type of nation-building

project that will bring this country

together so that Canadians in every

region and every province can benefit

from the bounty that has been bestowed

on Alberta Saskatchewan and Western

Canadian provinces now I come from

Saskatchewan as you all know now just

out of here

hey just out of curiosity I like to this

is a little experiment in Alberta how

many people here are there from

Saskatchewan originally or whose parents

came from Saskatchewan fantastic

fantastic so you know I know exactly the

types of challenges that you're facing

here it used to be in Saskatchewan that

for generations when the NDP were in

power young people had to come to

Alberta to find work and opportunity and

I know that that has been the case for

many young people here in Alberta

because of this federal government's

attack on our natural resource sector

you know it used to be that the private

sector built pipelines in this country

instead under Justin Trudeau he now has

had to take 4.5 billion dollars of your

tax money and send it to American

investors so they can build pipelines in

other countries competing with our own

oil and gas sector shameful isn't that

that is a terrible indictment under the

energy sector under Justin Trudeau's

leadership but all that will change on

October 21st because we are going to

have a government on October 21st

that puts Canadians first as a champion

for our energy sector and the thousands

of women and men who work in it that is

the positive vision I'm offering the

people this country

[Applause]

now in addition to that we are running a

campaign that is focused on making life

more affordable for Canadians all that

adri√† for the coup de Vie poor to lay

Canadienne all that Rhonda Levy blew up

our developer to take a year we are

going to make life more affordable for

Canadians we've already started

unveiling innovative policies to put

more money in the pockets of Canadians

so that they can get ahead

I mentioned the carbon tax we know now

that the carbon tax is going to go up

after the next election we know that

when Parliamentary Budget Officer has

shown that we're falling further and

further away from our climate change

targets with the carbon tax why would we

continue to follow a policy that doesn't

work a conservative plan is going to

take real action to lower global

emissions take the climate climate

change fight global we could shut

everything down in our country and in

just a few days China Indonesia and

India would replace all those emissions

so our plan takes the climate change

fight global it also puts more money

back in your pocket with a home

renovation tax credit and our plan for

the environment goes beyond it will once

and for all because it's 2019

put an end to the practice of dumping

raw sewage into our rivers lakes and

oceans

[Applause]

we are lowering taxes in many many

different ways just last week I was

excited to announce the public transit

tax credit now we heard initially that

this made liberals very excited they

thought you know you're gonna get a tax

credit for taking the bus but then it

turns out the only reason why they were

excited is because they thought that it

made it easier to throw people under the

bus not to actually take the bus so we

had to clarify that with them today I

announced that we're going to bring back

the children's fitness and arts

activities tax credit to make it more

affordable to put your kids into

different activities and yesterday I

announced a universal tax cut a tax cut

for everyone lowering the first income

tax bracket to put more money in the

pockets of every single hard-working

Canadian family so this election is

coming down to that simple choice who do

you trust to make life more affordable

put more money back in your pockets so

you can get ahead sorry what was that

Justin how many here to think that it's

not Justin Trudeau who can do that we

know who gets ahead under Justin

Trudeau's government and it's not hard

working individuals it's not small and

medium-sized business owners it's the

corporate elite it's the people who have

high-priced government relations experts

on speed-dial who can get special access

to the prime minister's office he can't

even tell the truth about his own

interactions in the S&C Lavin affair and

now we know that he's blocking the RCMP

s

attempt to get to the bottom of that

corruption scandal

so once again once again I will call on

Justin Trudeau to do the right thing

wave the cabinet confidences so the RCMP

can do their job and get to the bottom

of your corruption scandal so that is

the choice this election where Justin

Trudeau will talk down our energy sector

and block important pipeline projects

conservatives will restore investor

confidence and get them built putting

people back to work all across this

country where he will abuse the power of

his office to reward his friends and

punish his enemies I will restore ethics

and integrity to government and shine a

light on his corruption scandals where

he will look our veterans in the eye and

tell decorated war heroes that they are

asking for more than he can give I will

honor their service to the country and

ensure that they have adequate

compensation for their service to this

great nation and where he will raise

your taxes run massive deficits and

impose greater amounts of debt on

current and future generations of

taxpayers I will run a government that

lives within its means so we can put

more money back in your pocket because

it's time for you to get ahead that is

our positive conservative message ladies

and gentlemen and I cannot wait for

October 21st thank you very much

[Applause]
