thanks very much I want to begin by

thanking the courageous men and women

who have joined us today for the vital

work that they do for sharing their

stories with us and being so open and

direct with us about the challenges that

face so many families here in the GTA

and other neighborhoods across Canada

throughout this campaign we have laid

out a clear plan to put more money in

the pockets of Canadian families so you

can get ahead at the same time however

we must always remember that too many of

our neighbors too many Canadians are

facing even more serious challenges than

being able to pay the bills what should

be o Canada relief could they fami

impaired delay sailors on fall jidoor

valley are they color p ecause todavía

knows army the Canadien D Kennedy NSYNC

yet telepresence the gang dollar

quartier you know / colors on phone

deviants alone please day gang days

aren't Televi loss they did I do it

today in Canada there are families

worried about letting their children

play outside or walk to school for fear

of gun violence

there are Canadians who are worried

about the gang presence in their

neighborhoods and whether their kids

will fall into the vicious cycle of gang

gun and drug violence they're worried

about the plague of opioid and

methamphetamine addiction was costing

lives and tearing apart families and

communities and worried about the vile

practice of human trafficking and the

innocent young lives

it puts at risk every single Canadian

deserves to grow up and live in

neighborhoods free of violence and crime

and they expect their federal government

to pass and enforce strong laws that

keep them safe and on this Justin

Trudeau has failed instead of going

after gangsters and criminals who use

guns to commit violent crime Trudeau

actually reduced the penalty for gang

crime to as little as a fine instead of

passing the buck off to other levels of

government it's time that Justin Trudeau

showed some accountability for his own

record it is beyond dispute that the

gang criminal who is prepared to shoot a

gun illegally

is also prepared to own a gun illegally

but don't just take my word for it

Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders has

said quote in recent years we have seen

that 80% of firearms are coming in from

the border and also quote by and large

shootings have street gang connotations

to them or our street gang-related

it couldn't be more clear to tackle gun

crime you have to take the tackle gangs

Justin Trudeau's plan forcing firearms

owners who already follow the law to

follow more laws will do nothing we have

to target the source and that's what my

plan is all about first we will

eliminate automatic bail for gang

members we'll also create a process to

automatically revoke parole for

convicted criminals who associate with

gangs after they have been released from

prison every week the justice system

releases violent game criminals onto the

street the police know these gang

members are violent the crown attorneys

know they are violent but the bail

system releases them anyway under a

conservative government will stop the

revolving door once and for all will

also create new sentences for violent

gang crime anyone who commits a violent

gang crime will spend at least five

years behind bars and we will vigorously

defend these sentences against legal

challenges currently with each

gang-related trial prosecutors must

prove time and time again that the gang

is a criminal entity no our police force

has already know the factions and gangs

that terrorize our neighborhoods so a

Conservative government will formally

identify gangs in the Criminal Code in a

manner similar to what we currently do

for terrorist organizations this will

help reduce court delays and the waste

of prosecutorial resources and ensure

fewer gang members get released on a

technicality now the same time will

pursue smart gun control measures to

keep illegal firearms off the street it

will start with strengthening background

checks so that they work as intended

under our plan will ensure that the RCMP

is contacting references for those who

apply for a gun license it will also

include cracking down on smuggled

firearms we will create a Canada Border

Services Agency task force that will

work with local law enforcement on both

sides of the border to disrupt smuggling

routes and intercept smuggle guns as

they enter Canada and we will amend the

Criminal Code to make possession of a

smuggled firearms a crime that will

carry a mandatory five year prison

we zone Oh buddy get wha will ensure

that firearms are kept out of the hands

of dangerous individuals anyone who

knowingly provides a firearm to an

individual who has been banned from

owning one will face up to 14 years in

prison we will back up these measures

with new investments that give our

police forces the tools they need to

keep our community safe this will

include a dedicated sixty million dollar

fund to help provinces and territories

make investments to fight gangs along

with an additional 12 million dollars

for gang diversion and prevention

programs that keep kids from falling

into the cycle of violence will also

create a police infrastructure grant

program to allow municipal police forces

to purchase new and innovative equipment

to combat crime and will create a

national framework that allows for

better information sharing between

individual police services on gang and

gun crime from coast to coast our plan

will also tackle the opioid crisis in

our communities unlike the Liberals we

don't believe legalizing dangerous drugs

is the way to keep Canadians safe the

only way to truly win this battle is to

give more people a pathway out of

addiction and into recovery will invest

more in building or upgrading recovery

community centers recovery high schools

and treatment centers this will give

those who suffer from addiction their

families and those who have recovered

its spaces where they can get the help

and the support they need

we'll also revise Canada's drug and

substance strategy to focus on recovery

and we will recommit to a national

education program that will inform our

children youth and teams about the

dangers of drug use and to protect the

innocent children and families we'll

help municipalities clean up and dispose

of used needles on public property

finally a Conservative government will

implement the harsher penalties for

those engaged in the despicable practice

of human trafficking targeting the most

vulnerable the vast majority of whom are

young women and girls for sale into

slavery is disgusting obscene and

unacceptable that is why we will amend

the Criminal Code to remove the need for

prosecute

to demonstrate that a trafficker

exercised coercion or an element of fear

over the victim many human traffickers

operate much more subtly and will end

automatic bail for all human traffickers

and if convicted they will receive

consecutive sentences for each of their

victims loser on claim program

thank you very much

merci beaucoup have to take your

questions clément writer CTV News

mr. Sheeran citizenship issue could you

explain clearly how many times you filed

tax returns to the United States and

exactly how much taxes you paid in the

u.s. well as I said it's

it's not a big deal for Canadians to

have dual citizenship there are millions

of canes who have had a parent born in

one country or another and and I've

always been tax compliant I've always

followed those laws but respectfully you

didn't address my question I think you

want to be clear and open about this

incorrect so why don't you say how many

times did you file a tax return to the

US and in total how much taxes did you

pay to the US as you know in Canada in

the u.s. we have a tax treaty so I've

only ever earned income in Canada so I

filed those taxes and I've always earned

income in Canada my salaries been

publicly available on the on the House

of Commons website widget clearly sir

thermo Canada more salary public more

CBC to Canada episode I mean set lot

further since la la la montee a

delicious Pandorica bang avec une

intentional their affair al-aqsa cleric

the question on the conference but

Acadiana

they can identify our confidences tend

to do mr. shear Janice Dixon the Globe

and Mail I have a question about

innovation leaders of Canadians scale of

technology companies are concerned that

parties don't have specific plans to

help them grow what are your plans to

improve access of domestic companies to

capital to talent both both in markets

here and also abroad so they can grow

into companies like Shopify for example

well that is a great question and I've

met with many representatives of the

high-tech industry and companies startup

companies and people who are responsible

for incubators and and facilitating

Canadian companies to to grow to

starting to scale up and they're often

very frustrated that Justin Trudeau

seems to be focused on the big giant

international companies while ignoring

the great stories that we have here at

home and so our innovation agenda will

absolutely help foster startups and

scale ups here in Canada one of the one

of the ways that we will do that of

course is by tackling the regulatory

burden I made an announcement a few

weeks ago or I said there are so many

regulations in Canada that prevent

companies from starting and growing and

other countries have a more competitive

environment for business startups and

we'll have more to say that of course in

our real plan for the environment a huge

piece of in of that is innovation

supporting research and technology

development the green patent tax credit

as well so I'm very confident that were

under a Conservative government we're

going to see a great deal of economic

activity in startups in high-tech and

innovative research ok and there's a

video circulating of one of your

candidates right now online from Burnaby

North Sea more it shows her saying that

homosexuals recruit children were you

aware of this and will you stand by this

candidate I haven't seen this

particularly that you're referencing of

course our party stands for

inclusiveness and the rights of all

Kings including LGBT Cannes and will

always do so

good morning mr. shear receptive Aliante

the Canadian Press just a couple days

ago you mentioned that the further cuts

to your foreign policy and your foreign

policy wouldn't affect the commitments

that the Liberals had made to maternal

health reproductive rights around the

world you're one of your spokes people

just said recently that the

Conservatives would not get involved in

a UN ongoing UN argument over the over

abortion how that fits into

international health so my question is

do you think the Canadian government has

the responsibility to defend the right

of women and girls to access the full

spectrum of sexual and reproductive

health services around the world I think

it's been very important for Kings to

understand that the laws on this issue

will not change under conservative

government axis will not change this is

a debate that divides Canadians

that's why we will not reopen it that's

why access won't change your home and

we're certainly not going to have a

divisive debate at the international

level as well yeah

the Canadian Parivar coffee on Scalia

National Park pond dong-geun or

conservatorship relaxer on a long seungu

demo in ecology pond or governor actual

clean energy products or food ^ are in

the body VC VC okay no you know you know

international and on the announcement of

today on gangs and guns one of the

points is one of the points that you had

mentioned in your policies to revise the

Canadian drug and substance strategy and

another you spoke about in the bullet

points investing in treatment centers

recovery centers and that kind of thing

but you didn't mention safe injection

sites and the current laws around that

what a conservative government change

anything regarding the current Canadian

laws on safe injection sites so I have

had this question before so uh thank you

for giving me the opportunity to be very

clear and to repeat it a conservative

governor will respect the decisions of

the court that's we will always do that

we will also however recognize that

community voices need to be heard in

these decision in these decisions and we

do not believe it's it's fair to moms

and dads who are worried about their

kids walking to school or playing in a

playground that these sites are put in

without any type of consultation or

without adequate levels of competative

Constitution

that is something that we will ensure

happens at the same time the focus

should not be on maintaining addiction

we don't do addicts any favors if we

just could you merely make it easier or

if the focus is on just maintaining a

life of addiction our preferred route is

to start to build a capacity for

recovery that's where our focus will be

enhancing the ability for health systems

and for different levels of government

to different government agencies to get

people off of a life of addiction so

they can have a full life under your

government there's these these centers

could be closed down or move depending

on the community as I said our focus

will be on making sure that community

community consultation is done done

properly and then it's robust and that

the views of the local inhabitants of an

area are taken into account so had a

survey call a thank you to lay the

feedback the community they may have had

a pair they're on TV doesn't quite so

sometime do a saw at the less a CBC you

say you have didn't hide your dual

citizenship a US and Canadian

citizenship but it was brought up

numerous times by your party so I'd like

to know when you told your party that

you hold dual u.s. Canadian citizenship

and we're you know finally following the

rules and filing us tax returns as well

as Canadians as I said everyone who

knows me or knows my family knows my

father was born in the United States and

that's been open with that so you didn't

officially disclose it I'm just

wondering cuz the issue came up because

your party was attacking other local

figures for it I wasn't leading the

party at that time and you were involved

in those discussions and attacks for

other people so I just wonder it's not a

big deal in Canada for people that have

dual citizenship there are millions of

Canadians who have had one or another

parent born in another country and as I

said I decided to after one the

leadership that I would I would renounce

my citizenship and so I have had

meetings with the representatives from

the embassy to tell them those

renouncing my citizenship and have

submitted the paperwork so just to

clarify it didn't come up when your

party was you know talking about other

political figures and

criticizing other political figures for

having dual citizenship it didn't come

up and you didn't think oh maybe I

should say I'm also a dual citizen as I

said I wasn't leaving the party at that

time and I've always know it's not a big

deal to have dual citizenship here in

Canada okay and there's a strike looming

on Monday here in Ontario your office is

spending a lot of time in Ontario this

week made last few days what does that

strike do to your chances here in this

province people on Ontario understand

that there have been strikes at the

education level against every political

party who has who have been in obvious

obviously we hope as we do with all

labor disputes that both sides can come

to an agreement yes a cleric or an

Ontario yeah they grave confer upon them

they the government Atul a party a come

to role news espero honk in solution

lately Ducati portability don't come in

since since you held American

citizenship can you can you confirm what

your office has already said that you

never voted in an American election and

can you please also say whether or not

you have ever been a member of the

National Rifle Association as I believe

your father was that is incorrect that

I've never voted and no one in my family

has ever been a member of that

organization

Thank You JJ vote it was it a genial can

percent among fami Katie and mambre this

at organizational and did you did you

disclose your dual citizenship when you

became a member of the Privy Council

when 2017

I have always followed all the rules and

and and

and regulations around being a member of

parliament and holding the different

offices within that Parliament well as

it's not something that's ever been been

been required it's not something that's

over I've ever failed to be open around

and and transparent about everyone who

knows my family knows that my father was

more in the United States it's that's

quite simple good morning Steve shear

with Reuters I wanted to ask about this

Monday is the only English debate and

after the difficult debate this week I

wanted to ask you how important you

think your performance will be on Monday

and what is it you want to communicate

exactly on Monday night mm-hmm well

debates are always important they give

Keynes an opportunity to see party

leaders hold each other to account it's

regrettable that there's only one

english language debate it's too bad

that justin trudeau ducked out of the

foreign affairs debate that was planned

it's understandable given his terrible

record on foreign affairs and the way

that he's represented Canada around the

world it's too bad he skipped them

cleans debate that was held early in

this campaign that gave voters an early

opportunity to see what the party

leaders were talking about I so I'm

looking forward to Justin Trudeau being

there

finally for english-language debate and

obviously I'm gonna hold

not only will I hold him to account for

his broken promises but I'm also going

to use it as an opportunity to promote

our plans to leave more money in the

pockets of Canadians to talk about our

tax cuts the way that we're boosting the

RESP the way that we are going to raise

the seniors age credit the way that

we're gonna help fight climate change on

a global context while at the same time

putting more money in the pockets of

Keynes with the green home renovation

tax credit so I'm very excited for

Monday's to be we know that a phenom

Olivar in the back of exercise will only

get a monkey a bdellium premier do diba

yeah Evita LED busting is a fairly

transia super comp wrong yeah even below

or a blue laser Fair international it's

all a stage mondiale may Lindy done in

opportunity

poor poor xbk a proposed a may solution

poor

say prudish on Tralee posh taken a knee

there on relevee pure bored habla

America Lydia imported a Canadian

Canadian and if I could ask about

today's announcement you know the your

plan doesn't include any sort of ban

against guns you say eighty percent

comes from across the border anyway but

wouldn't it be useful I mean why not

just ban assault rifles if it takes

twenty percent off of the of the board

and if I could add to that violent crime

often it you know is economically driven

so why not include a plan or do you have

the you know do you think you will

include a plan to address all the

loopholes from money laundering and in

Canada which is one of you know the

violent crime is it's a symptom of them

the money they think goes into the

system and and we know that it's had you

know it's pretty easy to launder money

in Canada mm-hmm well first of all on

the money laundering side you're

absolutely right that this is there's

increasing evidence that this is

becoming a very serious issue in Canada

when I announced our housing policy just

a few weeks ago I also indicated that we

would be conducting a national inquiry

into money laundering as it relates to

real estate and of course as we get

feedback from other levels of law

enforcement s-- we would obviously want

to ensure that all different types of

money laundering or are being looked at

so that we can have better tools on the

issue of firearms it's very important

for canes to remember that there are

already many different types of

classifications of firearms that are

prohibited and others that are

restricted and the Conservative Party

will always support and maintaining

those those that have been deemed

prohibited will continue to be permanent

what we're talking about now is a plan

by Justin Trudeau to ask law-abiding

firearms owners to follow more laws in

response to shootings that the

overwhelming majority of what have been

related to criminal activity a drug

dealer does not stop to think do I have

the right permit as he's traveling from

one part of the GTA to another to sell

illegal drugs he doesn't worry about

whether or not his illegally trafficked

firearm his handgun or his sawed-off

shotgun or rifle is prohibited or

restricted or non restricted he is a

criminal and he

committing crimes and so asking la vie

law-abiding firearms owners to follow

more laws is lazy and ineffective

government what this plan does today

goes after those repeat and dangerous

offenders and it is on the advice of

various police chiefs from all across

the country including Toronto's police

chief who was indicated that precious

police resources being diverted to

enforce new bands that will just mean

law-abiding firearms owners following

more laws diverting those precious

resources is actually going to have a

negative impact on keeping our community

safe so we're listening to the experts

on this issue okay

Lily currently about coffee on school a

continue a that Robin is a very systemic

Co Canada who boost poor a different

Sibley Libre criminal a gang the root

missus a society shows conv fair assume

guru our conservator good morning Janice

McGregor from CBC News Mr Shearer when

was the last time you traveled on your

American passport and used it to enter

the United States sir anywhere else I

would have to go go back and look I

I've never renewed my passport as an

adult so it expired when it said I would

have to go back and look you don't know

I I said I'd have to go back and look at

and see one that when it actually

expired I've never needed as an adult

something my parents obtained for me

while I was living at home and a child

and teenager

okay and when you turn to 18 did you

register with the US Selective Service

as would be required for you as a dual

Canada US citizen

this is they haven't used it since the

80s but this is the system that's

required by law for potential military

draft purposes even though you were

living in Canada it would have been a

legal requirement for

did you register I would have to I would

have to check and get back to you on

that good morning my name is Jazmin gang

from Gerber Korean post so my question

is do you really plan to ban a handgun

on another life or nationally well thank

you again for the question because it

allows me to reiterate the point that

banning fire additional sorts of

firearms has been shown has been

indicated by Chiefs of Police from here

in Toronto from Peel from Winnipeg from

the Canadian Association of Chiefs of

Police who have all indicated that this

would be ineffective that it would not

help address the issue of illegal

firearms in our communities and that is

why our plan for safer streets safer

communities is going after the criminals

who use firearms that is a more

effective way so we're going to take

illegal firearms out of the hands

members of gangs and people who have you

know continually repeat repeatedly

commit the same crime over and over and

that is in contrast to just ensure keep

in mind that you know we're talking

about a government that is actually

lowered penalties has actually lower

penalties to the point where people who

are convicted of gang activity have been

given it can receive just a fine we

don't think that's the right way to go

could you share your detailed plan for

affordable life including land control

expense per house marque and the medical

plan for none insurance for a affordable

affordable life for me rent rent control

and expense per house murky and medical

plan for non insurance if you don't have

don't we don't have insurance medical

right so the the whole theme of our

campaign is about making life more

affordable running a government that

lives within its means so we can leave

more money in the pockets of keynes so

that they can get ahead right now with

the massive deficits that this Liberal

government is racking up its meaning

more and more of your tax dollars going

to pay the interest on that debt and not

going to serve that's why we have to get

our finances on

control as we do that we're gonna cut

taxes leave more money in the pockets or

cans and make things like housing more

affordable I unveiled a plan just a few

weeks ago talking about reworking the

stress test reworking the the mortgage

amortization period for first-time

homebuyers and we're gonna have a little

bit we're gonna have more to say in a

little while about how we are going to

help address the issue of housing supply

as well so our whole campaign is about

making life more affordable with a

Conservative government for the next

four years you will get ahead you'll

have more money in your pocket life will

be more affordable okay thank you David

Aitken Global News good morning your

campaign has done centered around the

your chief opponent is not as advertised

and a lot of people may be looking at

this revelation of your dual citizenship

is saying you know this guy's kind of

not as advertised and I think you're

right millions of Canadians is perfectly

normal they have this but a lot of

voters I speak to don't like the

hypocrisy that your campaign is now

based on that the other guy's not as

advertised and now you're not as

advertised do you understand how that

might be seen as hypocritical I reject

the premise of their question David as I

said everyone who's ever who knows me

and knows my family knows my father was

born the yes it's not a it's not a

secret in fact he actually worked at a

newspaper and worked as many people in

the media and was always open about

where he was born and where he's from

and when we're looking at Justin Trudeau

who look Canadians in the eyes and lied

he was asked specifically about the S&C

labelling affair and he said things that

he knew were not true that is a lie he

promised he would balance the budget in

2018 he didn't he promise you and make

life more affordable he raised taxes on

80 percent of Canadians middle class

Canadians he said he would represent

Canada with strength on the world stage

we saw how that went so when when canes

are looking at what he is offering this

election they know that they cannot

trust him to do the things that he is

promising but they can under with a

Conservative government I know anybody

holds a citizenship of any country

including Canada's understands the

importance responsibilities that comes

with holding that citizenship you're

just asked by Janice about did you

register for the draft and if you

haven't been told let me tell you it's a

requirement it's not an option you have

had to register for the draft there may

have been other responsibilities you

as a US citizen and now you want to

renounce a lot of people may find it

hard to understand why you didn't

register for the draft and why all of a

sudden in August on the eve of a federal

election in which you were trying to be

Prime Minister you went maybe I should

do something about that American

citizenship you want to square both of

those on the draft and why it took so

long for you to get rid of this American

citizenship well I as I said I will go

back on get back to you on that specific

question you can understand growing up

in a household growing up in Canada that

was something that my my father

did for me well after after I was born

and and I did not renew passports as

adults and things like that I made a

decision after becoming leader the party

this would be something that I would

address before the election campaign it

was a personal decision that I made and

and so I took those steps before the

election thank you thanks very much
