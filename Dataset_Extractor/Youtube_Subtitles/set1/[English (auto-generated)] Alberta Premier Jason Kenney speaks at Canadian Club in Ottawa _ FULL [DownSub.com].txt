seen 16 more people take the rise here

in central Canada there seems to be a

misunderstanding

energy sector everyday I recall and

commentary suggesting it's true that

2014 there was a sudden the drop on 100

the current benchmark West Texas

Intermediate around $60 a barrel which

is well that the range of historical

norms as you can see on this truck in

fact it's hotter but the average price

since the 1947 since 1980 and I because

of the 2014 price correction Canadian

producers have cut costs one-third

becoming partition endeavor those third

major oil sands producers will tell you

that they can operate profitably now at

$35 prices from West Texas at the same

time and at the same prices we have seen

it also constitutes we believe a latent

it's a deal

that threats this these are ways is why

we've seen a disturbing rise in

alienation on Canadian Prairies and

particularly in our EOC polls indicated

support right as high as 32 percent

friend even interrogation let me be

clear

[Applause]

how does what and serves me most in the

poll it is the indication that upwards

of 80% of my upper to say they

understand or to and parliamentarians

from across party lines let us take

seriously these challenges in a

processes but so much to build this

country to be an engineer social ability

of progress of prosperity that is not in

the state of diminishing or deriving

these voices of frustration the

experiences of so many properties my

office's population has

in large part because of people from

every opportunity society fishery these

traditional industries of center the

forestry in British Columbia to enjoy

opportunity in Alberta first by the

Deputy Prime Minister Cleveland as

minister of intergovernmental affairs

and our initial productive conversations

about issues affecting Alberta's future

but I also have to say that we need to

see me off dress bar we need to use some

of the powers exercised

you're not a marginal reach new promise

demographers protect the people in the

not-too-distant future to proceed

British Columbia's the third most

populous province until recently they

have the second largest economy in

Canada until this and so will be society

the whole range of ways in which we can

more effectively exercise our powers

[Music]

first you're seeking a firm fixed and

fast deadline to complete the

transmission expansion so we can bring

investment and drops back to Canada I'm

specifically asking the government to

commit to a holding and enforcing the

rule to ensure that this happens and to

make it a priority to bring across

nations into the project as equity

partners as quickly as possible and on

this we offered a leading by example

we've just passed through the

legislature the creation of the Alberta

indigenous opportunities corporation by

a billion dollars the Faith and Credit

of the Alberta crown to facilitate

appropriate financial participation in

and co-ownership of major research

projects including respectively type

arms because we think it is an economic

imperative it would be okay

in terms of completion of major projects

but we also recognize that we have a it

is a world imperative of our generation

so how are indigenous people benefit

from the resources that lie below the

ground that their ancestors first of

happened

I was between to the world decides to do

that to recognize the huge adversity my

promise that we will put those do

something to create good and call them

drops like reclaiming abandoned wells at

the same time we seek repeal a bill c40

date and we'll see 69 recognizing

to mitigate the uncertainty created by

that okay I'll give you one example

we've got a huge conversion from calton

actually past firepower going on an

Alberta companies need to build

pipelines to create natural gas into

their electricity price and if they're

not the impact Act that's - emissions

that we can do together another of the

resources that we create thousands of

draws that has multiple deep

partnerships with First Nations and

indigenous communities and I see her

here from the meeting of it and they set

out more than 80 people as well do you

know I don't forgive her did she palette

happen how is the chief of the first

triple operation occurs nation Allen has

in the past to Leo DiCaprio

Jane Fonda around the Opera was she had

to the resources we sure this points in

common in our agenda let's find ways to

deliver cheap request to the prime

minister Torah will be an equivalency

recognition for Alberta's methane

announced significant so we asked that

persist and see our insistence on the

DNS in our arts called Burton's our

patriotic interest so I think only

number of words see themselves as not

only at home in their country a country

they have so dutifully served and to

which they contributed

disproportionately then is the

responsibility of all Canadians

especially the national to address that

lucky they do it the words of a man who

spoke back to speak first town hall

meeting conducted by a fair deal panel

he I don't know this man he stood up and

talked about having for Canada in

Afghanistan probably PPC a lot I hope

you did the forces become a good pain

group in the oil patch

in Africa where he proudly reported that

his Canadian company fallen except Larry

environmental social and governance

poverty rate to Alberta he lost his job

and has been out of work for the past

two years

here's how he feels today goes just

because were right just because we have

the right

[Music]

and as well that's what I worked is why

it's what we need we hope that's what

we'll get in a fair deal within the

foundation thank you very much

anyway let's take questions I Missouri

that went long

the truth be told much to the

frustration of my environment the

spirits of my staff I have to exercise

10 pages about the Markman social

determinants of the occupy initiatives

and I'm happy to take questions so I'm

gonna hand this over to Alan and we're

gonna roll in the room please keep your

questions very brief so more people

going to have a chance to hear what they

were like

my question is what do you use to try to

share with us on the recent appointment

of our economy as US special envoy for

climate change

kind of action climate finance and do

you think there would be areas of

operation was that asking for too much

well I think there may be in fact I'm

hoping to see my friend governor Carney

in London as early as next week you

might be otherwise in the UK elections

but I do hope it's up when we have a

chance to to traffic Merck about his new

responsibilities and I can share with it

the part of the answer to the challenges

we face of climate change can be found

in cabinet energy industry but bear with

me a moment according to the

International Energy Agency their best

projection base for the Sabbath school

policies dead set is for the world to be

consuming 110 million barrels per day

crude oil in 2040 and a 35% increase in

natural gas consumption by that

according to their most stringent

conservative very protraction with these

coming out of a change of policy we need

full compliance with Paris

they protect 70 million barrels per day

crude oil in 2040 so that's 10 there

vector projection is 70 that's just off

thirty percent or thirty thirty million

barrels per day from where we are now

the question is who will be providing

that along because even over converted

to electric cars percent 25 percent is

caustic products that is generated from

industry this turning energy I think is

electricity during the three-day cyclone

on a pattern

no one is close to solving the problem

of reliability hard way to make steel

where's the fertilizer to cement the

pasta where's our going to come from two

planes fly through the survived because

you put numbers on the spreadsheet there

is no substitute for how the industrial

economy runs today another mister case

you supports renewable energy is trying

to say is yes there is a transition

there must be a direct transition we

change

since the year 2000 ever incredibly

attracted me to supply another 20% yeah

major produce usually CMR L that make

energy who have a commitment themselves

publicly to net zero carbon on the

energy that they produce there's an

entire generation of technologies coming

on the street replacing water with

dissolves that will radically reduce

energy consumption and water usage and

after Haskell Jana's power source and

carbon capture utilization and storage

at sequestration we have a carbon trunk

line that we're building from a plant

used to that Benson an operator to help

with enhanced oil recovery the episode a

venturi Basin which is one of the best

to geological formations in the world

for carbon sequestration CC new axis

becoming that we believe scalable

there's so much and this doesn't happen

by accident itself it's Canada's energy

industries that have been invested tens

of billions of dollars over the years in

this kind of technology so I would say

in a world where 70 million barrels

being consumed 20 years from now

[Applause]

this is CTO barely pressing on the

question of liquefied natural gas I

understand if we were to fully satisfy

the future demand for LNG in China and

India so happy to convert off a

heightening coal to much lower six of

the agreement we'd like to work with

them I could go on but the point is this

in the real world the real world of

which Bill Gates speaks to constantly do

better really

Alberta was the first jurisdiction in

North America to have a person partner

which we just increased with their major

emitters lighting so with the impression

of the are being the perilous about this

visit is the power have an imperative

but we think that at the end of the day

we should be the last best source

[Music]

[Music]

you know I first met Prime Minister

Narendra Modi when he was chief minister

to Iraq in 2007 I believe and I thank

you for coming they're the very first

the next thing he said was how quickly

can we get your Canadian liquid natural

gas

he was building a huge algae import

facility at that time in into Iraq which

as you know is West India and

unfortunately there we are problems

later not an inch closer and he has to

import his led primarily from hot dog a

regime which finances extremism and

indirectly terrorism which sometimes

targets India that's why he so that's

what he wants Canadian LNG so thank you

for championing your project consult

energy and let me just say I really

believe that about energy can be a

nation

project we need to adopt Asia suppose we

have all ten all three territorial

governments of all parts of strikes in

favor of Mg I have my disagreements we

prevail ago about a prospective pipeline

to to the East Coast but he is clearly

in favor of the two proposed energy

export facilities including energy

saguenay because he sees the role that

it could play uptake rating drops at

home but I'm just releasing co2

emissions abroad strongly in favor of

facilitating additional energy export

projects and almost every first nation

indigenous group in British Columbia

synched up with that artist right across

the spectrum provincial territorial

governments and First Nations lined up

obvious you've developed resources that

can also be beneficial to the global

environment I think we should seize this

opportunity to dance professionally

they're good sorry for also on that was

definitely not Christy at the 30-second

answer with a bit question for mr.

Graham actually conducive to you for the

rest of the afternoon and as I listen to

you I'm certainly struck by the

complexity of the Albert economy and my

Canadian economy and by the impact of

that complexity all of us on our

Canadian society on very human issues

and all of us as human beings and all

the Canadians and I am very thankful for

your leadership and for challenging

leadership across the country to think

differently I'm thankful for provoking

the public discourse for provoking the

public debate I'm thankful that you're

here today and on behalf of the Canadian

Club the bottle and all of us in this

room today thank you for being here

[Applause]
