whether it's somewhere else what's the

difference right now we're staying open

and I said we monitor it hourly we know

exactly how many people are entering the

building exit W so we do control a lot

sanitizer I mean I don't have my

containers of it we've got with us I

responsible we Friday Ottawa asked

Canadians to avoid travel outside the

country a tweet from the Foreign Affairs

Minister Saturday took things a step

further recommending those already

abroad come back via commercial means

while they are still available all

travelers coming to New Brunswick must

at news conferences Saturday many

provinces echoed the federal message and

in some cases took it further if you

travel abroad you could you you could be

subject to the measures of other

countries your one week trip may become

much longer you may also have reduced

access to quality health care I would

like today to ask all Quebecers over

seven

years old so all elders to stay at on

from physicians nurses students retired

people and we we are very grateful for

that and we will definitely make use of

that Ontario is limiting the volume of

test swabs supplied citing an increased

demand and in BC people with mild

symptoms and returning travelers who are

isolating at home do not need to be

tested unless you get sick enough to

require health care both provinces

Abigail Beeman global news Ottawa right

across Canada homeless shelters are on

alert for Cova 19 it's a segment of the

population already at high risk with any

serious virus but as we are now learning

the new corona virus can be devastating

as Mike Armstrong explains shelters and

missions are already cutting services

planning for worst-case scenarios it is

a population without many of the things

most take for granted not just to bed

but also things like sinks and washrooms

places to keep clean put hundreds of

homeless people together in a shelter

eating and sleeping close together and

you have the perfect recipe for a virus

like kovat 19 to spread we are at a

heightened risk we can't change that

that's the way a shelter is shelters are

ramping up cleaning procedures they

always worry about germs even at the

best of times but this is different the

homeless population is at a higher risk

from kovat 19 because many already have

other health problems a lot of them have

respond

to return to illnesses chronic heart

disease hepatitis C much of the last

week has been spent on education and

vigilance making sure people already

vulnerable or careful but the worry now

is turning to what if what would it mean

if kovat 19 got into the homeless

population most big cities shelters

already hover around a hundred percent

capacity what if people have to be

quarantine if at any point anyone is

asked to self isolate how are you going

to self isolate if you don't have a home

to go to some of the harder hit areas in

the US have already taken special

measures a county in Washington state

bought in Econolodge motel and has

turned it into a quarantine facility for

the homeless well the city of San

Francisco has least 30 recreational

vehicles and parked them well I think

that the the mayor and and the city has

made it very clear though our number one

priority is vulnerable populations in

Montreal the four major shelters are

always in close contact they've dealt

with threats together before back in

2017 it was an outbreak of flesh-eating

disease they are now cutting some

services a warming centers closed as of

this weekend some are suspending

volunteer activities they're also only

serving meals to people staying at the

shelters people from off the street can

only get meals to go and many understand

why virtually everybody that we come

into contact with has heard about Kovan

19 and is concerned

now there are worst-case scenarios being

studied shelters and missions don't have

big reserves of cash or extra facilities

they can open up or one Montreal shelter

says it's considering making an appeal

Monday requesting the military be

deployed to help with the homeless
