the place

in the kovat 19 pandemic past two grim

milestones in Europe today more than

20,000 people have died on the continent

after contracting the virus 10,000 of

those deaths were in Italy as dozens of

countries struggle to get a grip on the

crisis the lockdowns are expected to

become even more severe Redman Shannon

explains this is the latest - of the

Spanish government is using to try and

slow down the spread of the new corona

virus thousands more people will

unlikely die so this work is all about

mitigating the misery of the coming

month

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has

guaranteed full wages to all

non-essential workers who stay home over

the next two weeks on Friday Pope

Francis delivered perhaps his most

surreal mass since being elected pontiff

praying for an end to the pandemic in an

empty st. Peter's Square

a very different service in Italy's

north this church is full full vetti's

of coffins the priests opening their

doors as a makeshift morgue I started to

kill a body no one could take care of

these people said father Mario community

so we leave them here in the house of

God for him to look after them some

Italians are still not getting the

message about the importance of

lockdowns

with police lecturing drivers over

unnecessary journeys

there are similar bans on public

gatherings across the continent Berlin

police controlling people's movements in

ways not seen since the days of East

Germany's Stasi secret police the scene

is no different in London where this

enormous Convention Centre will soon

open as a 4,000 bed hospital I've

developed mild symptoms of the

coronavirus Prime Minister Boris Johnson

remains isolated with the virus and like

so many he is now working from home I

think the one thing this has reminded us

is that no one is immune and that is

precisely why we ask people to follow

the government advice the British

government is scrambling to get 20,000

new ventilators in the coming weeks a

communications mix-up meant it missed

out on a chance to join a European group
