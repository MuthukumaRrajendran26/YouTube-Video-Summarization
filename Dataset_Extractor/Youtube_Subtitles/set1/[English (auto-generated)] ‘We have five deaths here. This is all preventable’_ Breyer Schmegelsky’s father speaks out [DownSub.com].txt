we have 5 deaths here this is all

preventable and and with this being an

international story right we have people

from around the world that are deceased

we have the old world wanting to know

what's going on

I know you want to ask me about the

video but I still have a nondisclosure

and I still haven't told anyone I

haven't known what to feel since this

all started ok

he wasn't healthy he was skin and bones

he was abused he was neglected he was

failing to thrive I just don't want any

other parent to have to go through this

I don't want any other kid off the side

is the only option in life go on a trip

like this ok I know what this ever

happen again every day you've seen awful

news every day I think the big question

that a lot of people who don't know

Breyer are asking is why and as his dad

can you maybe is there anything you on

the public to know about what perhaps

hope he lost hope ok I mean the Breyer

that the public knows that's not the

Breyer that you know no no where I will

enjoyed company he's very intelligent

very active he had disabilities we

shouldn't have had to go on News and say

we're gonna take this to litigation wait

why why why do they treat me in that way

and they've done it since the start it

wasn't till a week later that our CP

actually came and talked to me why when

I was the only one to love my son when

are they ever gonna do a media release

August 7th was the last one and they

keep saying in a few weeks

well which year have you shared the

frustrations that we have had with we

feel like we're not getting a lot of

information about even cause of death my

level of frustration okay if you're

frustrated is the media how do you think

when this is my Lou

oh boy that I dearly loved but the boys

had a cellphone the whole time you know

it was Breyers pay-as-you-go fallen okay

I bought it for him it was a samsung but

he never called anybody he had it for

text messaging okay so he didn't pay

into it so the number was disconnected

but any phone is active to 9-1-1 hey

and it was active to 911 still can be

trapped

how come they weren't tracking the phone

how come they didn't talk to me maybe I

could have helped him if they would have

admitted it I exist maybe he didn't want

to you know go to the measures that he

did in terms of real hope okay when you

have no hope you don't have options okay

you don't have options when you see

those photos of briar bullied in a

special ed school okay it's the skinny

thin guy so I don't you see he's got to

put on a scary image just for

self-protection

lots of kids do that but they were

selling this Nazi stuff a block and a

half away from a special education

school two kids

hey that shop since closed but there's

lots of an import Oh Bernie

don't finger-pointing my kid because

he's wearing something that was mass

sold in that town he wanted away from

poor Oh Bernie

so bad do you think that perhaps and

with a trans down dramatic but blood may

be on the hands of these federal and

provincial officials that you're

representing in terms of perhaps having

being able to step in it

Ministry of Children RCMP representative

for children and youth and there's a

couple others I will not name right now

all have blood of five people on their

hands anything you want to say to the

parents channel Lucas and the family of

one Arthur I I apologized on

international stage okay on behalf of my

country I did not program my son to hate

I did not program my son act out in

violence I did not give my son a firearm

but we still need to know lots of key

information to RCMP okay lots where did

two teenagers get firearms

fire didn't have any for all I know my

son's but he showed up it is I said

let's go my said okay let's go

right we don't know all I know is my son

never lied to me before my son didn't

have a vehicle did not drive and now

he's gone okay and nothing can bring

that back but nothing can bring back any

of them but we got to do is analyze what

happened where it all went wrong there's

a lot of things that are wrong here

okay this was years in the making and

this was totally preventable that's the

problem here again could you clear it up

for any members of the public that might

say what was the motive here as his dad

could you maybe tell us what might have

motivated him is you have any idea I

can't say I I don't know what him and

cam we're talking about right there was

two boys there so I can't say I can't

say the Brera did anything other than he

was there only the RCMP can tell us if

Breyer or did something and they're not

saying any of that do you feel though

that that perhaps they could have been a

bit more on the ball in terms of after

they fought all the way to Manitoba

come on

you know australia's know that they

gotta the world knows they got halfway

across the country how many police

officers were on this chase do you think

though al that may be the plan all along

I mean obviously we don't tell our

parents everything I don't tell my

parents all the plan okay I don't know

the plan I don't know if this was just a

families incident right we don't know um

and I think that's part of the reason

there is such fascination about the

story too is because Lucas cam China and

Breyer all young attractive at the prime

of their lives sort of thing and as news

that under different circumstances maybe

they would have cracked open a beer and

how to drink on the side of the road so

what do you think went wrong or what do

you think happened there was gun sir and

we don't know what happened except we

know there was guns fire hey if they had

just stopped over to say hey we'll help

you I have a beer whatever rate that's

what

Lanaya would have done but the rich guns

came from somewhere hey do you want to

lay blame find out where those guns come

from members of the public that are

gonna watch this and they're saying well

you know his son is X Y Z a killer a

racist or white supremacists a Nazi

sympathizer how do you respond to that

shattered all the time and he never

touched any topics anywhere near that

okay he wanted to join the Canadian Army

is what he wanted to do he was working

on his GED because he had dropped out of

school

hey he's having trouble finishing his

GED without help so he got a job at

Walmart hey whit camera oh you only had

a job for five weeks

hey two full paychecks

like second feature cuz it makes him put

some money in retirement savings he's

all hokey done and that was two hours

before he said we're gone
