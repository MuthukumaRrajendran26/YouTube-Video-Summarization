right good afternoon on a Saturday and

the the time is continuing as I said

this weekend going to early next week is

an important one we want to monitor how

we're doing and mostly how well

everybody is staying to the task of

social distancing in all the venues

whether you're staying at home where

you're out in public places for a short

period of time if you have to go and

urgently need to go you maintain those

aspects if you're doing essential

services and essential purchases that

you need you respect those things

respect the retailer who has taken the

time to come out and to undertake their

duties and they're trying to respect

that as well an ongoing hand hygiene of

course in that regard so these are all

very important times to do it do it

again and do it well and do it

consistently and we're going to continue

to monitor that situation as I said I'm

concerned at this time with the amount

of people returning to Ontario who might

have been infected or at least

incubating from other countries or from

other contacts with cases that we need

to be vigilant in that that everybody

needs to do it

those who come in are being asked to

isolate when they come across the border

for 14 days and we are anticipating and

expecting them to do so

regardless of age and where you've come

from and also those from flights the

same rules in that regard so everybody

knows what the plan is and how to do

that we just need to do it and do it

well in light of that we're seeing some

rising numbers which I said yesterday we

wouldn't I would anticipate because of

the number of people coming back and the

time perhaps since they came back of

their incubation period we will start to

see some numbers rising so I'm going to

ask dr. Yaffe to talk about the numbers

that came in what we're working with

today and to update you on those various

aspects there so over to you dr. Yaffe

thanks very much

so as of yesterday the data from the end

of yesterday we have a total of three

hundred and seventy seven cases

confirmed in Ontario

of those six are now resolved and

unfortunately we have a third death this

is an individual male in his 70s in

Barry who was a close contact of another

individual who has died in terms of the

we still have seven seven thousand two

hundred and thirty nine people under

investigation and a total of fifteen

thousand seven hundred and sixty-eight

negatives so in total we have tested

today twenty three thousand three

hundred and eighty four people the

numbers are going up in terms of cases

we have 58 new ones today compared to

yesterday's data in terms of the cases

themselves we have data that shows that

over 50 percent have traveled outside of

Canada about twelve percent were close

contact of a case and of those that had

traveled almost thirty percent had

traveled to the United States most

commonly New York Colorado California

Florida and Nevada and after that the

next most common travel was to Europe so

basically we're looking at mostly travel

and contact with a case very small

number still under investigation or at

this point we have approximately 20

cases in Ontario with no identified

source thank you and monitoring the

global situation the numbers in the

United States continue to rise fairly

quickly cases are now over twenty

thousand and unfortunately the situation

in Italy in spite of all the stringent

steps they've taken the number of cases

continue to rise extensively and

unfortunately so the number of deaths in

that regard in that and so I think with

that in mind you have to be sensitive to

where all the different travel issues

what different countries have done we

understood that since they have

eased off or some of the aspects in

Wuhan and China now for at least two

days they've had no cases reported

publicly in that regard and it seems

like they're other cities that were not

in any the same type of lockdown as

Wuhan have remained quiet in that regard

as well but we continue to monitor their

situation because they of course are the

first to go through this kind of

activity and we need to monitor it and

learn from what they're experienced and

what they have experienced in that

regard there so the aspect here we want

to emphasize is that I said yesterday it

wouldn't surprise me if our cases over

the weekend rose to over 60 we're close

to that today and we continue to do the

testing we're ramping up the people are

working around the clock to increase our

capacity or well over 2,000 now hidden

to 3,000 but we would like to get to

5,000 fairly quickly and working on that

and all fronts our surveillance

continues in that regard and monitoring

those other people in emergency

departments as well as long-term care

homes and those ones there we still have

had no positive with over 2,000 tests

being done 2,100 hundred about and the

Trenton situation is remaining stable or

with the six none Ontario residents and

six Ontario residents having converted a

positive during the time in the

quarantine in Trenton so with that I

think it's more important we get to one

emphasize the key prior today is ongoing

vigilance in your home situation there

minimalizing your external social

contacts do so when necessary if it's

really critical essential services are

there for those that need medication

those that need food those need other

things that are critical for day-to-day

living but as I said before when you do

go out along with the person who's

operating that retail center they'll do

their part to maintain the social

distancing the hand hygiene and all the

other key components and you-you-you

need to do the same and by doing

do you minimize and eliminate the risk

to yourself and then later back to your

family members accordingly so with that

we're going to take questions and

they're all in line today so I'll hand

that over to our moderator to take the

questions ok we'll take the first

question now

hi there we'll turn it over to the

phone's first question please your first

question on the phone comes from human

hands seems part briefing please go

ahead hi dr. Willy one wine I had been

trying to contact them and so I was

hoping that that you could help explain

what some other challenges harder to

think it's a good question and we knew

that when we were going to ramp up and

extensively when you're doing that it's

not just simply asking people to start

doing something that they've been doing

more of already you have to get the new

equipment out there you have to get the

proper reagents that's the chemicals you

use in those processes you then have to

do the preliminary testing and do

quality checks because one thing besides

not doing enough is to do some and do

them in air and you have to go back and

search and find the ones that you miss

because the quality checks weren't put

in place so what it it does take time

because usually this would take us

normally four to six almost eight weeks

to get up and running they're trying to

get it up in two weeks so you can

imagine how hard they're working around

the clock to try and get these other

aspects up and going at this time so

they've moved quickly from when they had

remember a long time ago it seems a two

weeks ago our maximum was 1,000 then we

moved up to 1,900 now we're moving just

under these 3,000 in that aspect there

and we hope to get that 3,000 firmly by

early next week and then head to 5,000

by the end of the week so this was

contingent also we had a limitation of

all the supplies that are needed for

that such as the special kits and that

was running short but then we had the

large purchase and obtain inspire the

federal government and we received a

large order on that so that is no longer

issue we're working hard on we have

obtained enough reagent to make sure

that's there so as all the components

the staffing the training the equipment

the reagents the test kits and the

a collection and moving of the samples

around are all part of it that goes in

parallel with our assessment centers

that are carrying out their duties and

responsibilities to make sure that the

all the testing is done correctly in the

right way so these do take time we're

rounding as fast as we can to get those

up and but we don't want to then make

mistakes in that process and trying to

ensure quality that our pauses our

pauses and our negatives we are fully

confident negative ok follow-up workers

day they have as well to serve the

population that that you know needs

there that that will need their help

over the coming weeks and so on the

province has has sent out a guidance to

healthcare workers who are coming back

and and so they can choose to self

isolate but they don't have to will you

prioritize testing us or these health

care workers who will be in close

contact with lots of positive people ok

yes first let me clarify what the memo I

sent out was know exactly as you said

what I said that people come back health

care workers who are back traveling if

it's been within 14 days of entering

back into Canada or their contact was a

known case in the last 14 days they are

supposed to remain in isolation in the

home setting during that time so but we

did say if there are one some positions

that are agreed on ahead of time that

are critical in the operation of a

facility that if all the parties agreed

those are critical positions they could

with the person still asymptomatic and

with proper monitoring and wearing

proper PPE on the job have that person

resume duties before the 14 day period

that's only with the number of checks in

that ID there one it's critical second

the person is asymptomatic and third

there's a proper protection and

monitoring that person while they're on

the job now the other point you

mentioned there is important to us is

that when there's healthcare

workers for other reasons our jobs and

they didn't have any travel history

didn't have any symptoms back 14 days

and if they feel unwell before coming to

work from other reasons because there's

other infections going around there's

other respiratory conditions there's a

sense that they want to make sure

they're tested and assess especially

they're working with very high-risk

patients or if there's something related

to cases and contacts on the hospital

ward they want to make sure they're

handled and tested and they want it done

in a very quick time that's why in our

load of tests we want to pry or I guess

expeditiously move through because it

has major implications on the overall

health of the workforce as well as the

operations and functions and the health

of the patients in those facilities so

we have set up systems to make sure

those are received quickly tested

quickly and that means if you may jump

the queue in a sense to make sure those

are handled because we do need to know

those in a very timely fashion okay next

question please go ahead hi there I'm

just wondering how many people do we

have in hospital today with kovat 19 and

how many are on ventilators we didn't

get the that data from the hospital

today as you know yesterday we had about

20 and that changes so there's missions

and they're coming and going in there

and if I recall correctly in one area

they had four and ICU four on Vance as a

couple of others so they get taken on

and get taken off and they try to remove

them so that can change by the hour as

they try to wean them off or place

people back on

so unfortunately Rob we don't have the

data from the hospitals yet today in

that regard with us waiting for you

should order more stores to shut down

and maybe perhaps go to just essential

services a lot of people are wondering

are you basing your your decisions on

these results that we have now

with a backlog of what 7,000 there 779

hundred tests or 7,200 tests the waiting

are you so are you making all your

decisions on like we call of data cuz it

it looks like we're about a week behind

on getting a lot of these tests in well

we're moving quickly to work those too

because as you're adding those 7,000

that you see there we received over

about 38,000 or 1300 yesterday so then

the 5,000 yes they were moved back

through so it's not all week old in that

regard as more and more tests come in

that number grows a bit but doesn't mean

there's some sitting there from over a

week ago so it's it's like a revolving

door or like a bathtub water coming in

water going out in that regard on that

basis that we have some other of our new

satellite sites they're doing their

tests and they're working them through

and they don't have any pending because

they're very much new in the process

we're that helps also and we have our

ongoing surveillance that we're doing

with our hospitals Eadie's and long-term

care homes so we're being formed by a

number of databases we also have the

information from our assessment sites

also from our IDI visits how many people

are going in how many people are being

emitted and we have those on ER

dashboards being put together to see

we're seeing surges and directions there

as well so while we have the lab testing

it's not the only metric that we look at

when we're seeing this we also have

feedback on how well aspects are being

adhered to and yes or no in the

community setting and the key thing here

about closing down a number centers as

you know there's are there are essential

services and we're doing a list on that

both in Ontario and we're looking at it

on a national basis as well so we can be

consistent if we can with our federal

counterparts and in that then we're

saying well those servers are staying

open

they're staying open for a reason and

the public at times need to access those

of course they're not in isolation cuz

they're positive cases they're not

supposed to go out if they are just home

staying at home and social distancing

they can go out but that doesn't mean

they do not continue to do social

distancing and that means you go to

those retail centers you

do that and you respect the retailer is

trying to do that as well because there

are some of our workers and they've gone

out to serve the public on those

essential services so it's important

that they are respected in that regard

and you need to respect them that way if

there's a sense of other services that

you're doing that there's no way you can

maintain social distancing you have to

ask yourself is that really essential

and you probably shouldn't be doing that

and so like some of the examples given

and I'm we talked to dr. Davila about in

Toronto they gave those is for instance

for example and I think there were good

examples that would be very hard for me

to imagine how someone get their hair

salon their hair done from six feet away

so I can see why that doesn't make sense

and so how many people are here into

that and then we hear maybe some reports

more and more if they're people not

obliged and then we have to take some

more strident steps and measures so the

data I think from many sources is going

the way we think it's going we really

feel that backlog as more and more tests

to come in which we wanted more tests

coming in as that turnaround happens

like you can see now you would say well

you could have three thousand four

thousand pending and they all just came

in yesterday even early next week and so

we want to even pick up that pace even

quicker so while we have some pending I

don't think we're that far out of date

and the other sources reassure me that

were continue to monitor the situation

along with all our 34 health units our

Regional OAH offices around the province

and our hospitals and institutions as we

watch many different ways to see how's

it moving and what is happening in

Ontario okay next caller

we're just curious how many ventilators

are currently in use in Ontario and

available and then how many would the

province need to feel like they could

accommodate patients given a worst-case

scenario situation so you asked me how

many are in the hospitals right now and

in use I don't have the data in front of

me number the larger facilities have

quite a few the ventilators they use

them all throughout their facilities how

many patients are on the moment

like Robert asked earlier in that and as

of the other day I think there was four

or five or six but that can change very

much by the hour in there

we had already in stock another two

hundred we've ordered more and we're

trying to repurpose and ask our

manufacturers as the premier noted they

can start to build and manufactures

others as we speak so it's a dynamic

process and it's good to see that all

this extra stock is being moved on not

just saying well 200 is good enough

let's go for 300 or 400 so we have those

in reserve to the hundreds that are

already out in the hospital sector yes

there there have been some comments from

private practices private surgeons

saying that they would donate their

ventilators is that something that the

province would consider Tate we've heard

that no we've had a lot of good

suggestions from many parts and

different sectors coming forward with

good ideas as their practices have shut

down at the moment in that regard we've

heard from some dental experts as well

that they have some available so all

these are suggestions that we're not

going to ignore and it's great to see

them stepping forward and making that

knowing knowledgeable to us but

available to us in the province okay

next caller

Morgan Campbell with Global News please

go ahead hi doctor I'm wanted to know

what's your response to people who are

still waiting for test results for COBIT

19:00 it's been it's been communicated

to us that some people are waiting

upwards of four to five days and if

there's a backlog

what would the true reflection of the

numbers be if there's if there's like

sand getting that you know those results

I've talked to Yaffe answer so I

certainly sympathize with people wanting

to know their results as soon as

possible and as was mentioned we do the

lab tries to prioritize results for lab

for healthcare workers people in

long-term care or people who are

hospitalized so if somebody's already

been tested and told to go home in cell

5

so late they should the most important

thing to do is to assume they have it

until the year they don't I would say

and you know act as if you have it which

is to self isolate make sure you're

washing your hands really well don't go

out you know get other people to help if

you need food or whatever and if you're

starting to feel worse

contact your primary care provider or we

also have now a self assessment tool

online that's that will help people

determine if they should do anything

different than stay at home but at this

point there really is nothing different

that they need to do okay follow up do

you suspect that that the numbers then

could be could be higher because of

these test results being delayed

possible certainly possible we you know

the numbers are going up each day the

percentage positive is is still very low

last time I worked with the lab people

it was around what just over 1% I think

so hard to say but I mean we are

expecting to see more cases okay next

question

your next question comes from Carly

weeks with the Globe and Mail please go

ahead hi and thank you guys I'm speaking

to some health experts who say that the

lack of testing and some of the backlogs

that we have in Ontario are putting us

on the same trajectory as Italy if they

look at the case numbers just wondering

how concerned you are about that

possibility I think the comparison there

we're always watching to see how we

compare with other ones the aspect

you're asking with projections based on

modeling and looking at what does that

mean in that regard I think part of the

other measurements when we compare is of

course while many are missions we're

getting how many intensive care patients

and how many deaths watching that so we

always we are always asking ourselves

those questions we're looking at that as

I said to an earlier question the number

of tests that we're doing

daily is is informative there's various

things to our other surveillance methods

so we're not looking at only one source

of data we're looking at multiple we're

following our syndromic surveillance

system in the province of Ontario which

monitors some daily and sometimes even

more frequent at almost hourly the flow

of clients coming through all our

emergency departments and compared to

the running averages and so we can see

sudden shifts in that if that was

occurring and I think if we saw the

situation starting to resonate like

Italy we would see our IDI departments

starting to be deluged with lots of

severe respiratory conditions which we

fortunately have not seen yet it doesn't

mean we're not looking for it doesn't

mean we're not going to watch for it and

prepare for the event that we might have

it so the modeling aspects and the

discussions around that are useful it

continues to challenge us with ask

ourselves are we prepared for scenario

one two or three and different ones in

there and and in that regard we look at

those and we consider all the options

and prepare for the possibility of each

one of those if it might and could occur

but we deal with what we're dealing with

today but plan for the possibilities

follow-up research labs who say they're

mobilizing and they're ready to help

start doing some of the testing

I just wanting to know is that something

you guys are working with are you

talking to other labs basically how to

get that capacity up outside of the

public health system that's a good

question and again just like with the

ventilator it's great to see if they're

ready to step up and move forward you

have to understand if they're going to

move in that direction they don't have

the exact equipment in hand so we'd have

to obtain some of the equipment we'd

have to obtain the proper reagents we'd

have to train up the staff there so we

want to first do our expansion out to

our Hospital sector in there because

they tend to be mostly attached to our

assessment centers are close by so we

can be efficient effective in that

monitoring but as these go on we would

not exclude that as a possibility and

that all depends on because every time

you open up more and more your core key

people are taken off from

they're part two bill that training and

optic if you may have those centers and

we can only stretch those people so far

so we have to keep expanding out in our

first one which we said we'd go from ten

and we're hoping to five and even up to

ten thousand so we're looking at all

possibilities and we would not ignore

those suggestions okay next caller okay

your final question comes from Sara

macmillan CBC please go ahead hi thank

you my question is about personal

protective equipment I'm just wondering

about what the supplies are like in

hospitals through the province and if

there are concerns about hospitals

running out of essential gear such as

n95 masks so when we both can say some

of them that the personal protective

equipment is a major discussion we're

having all the time we know that number

of the facilities have supply but

they're looking at projections if what

if and do we have enough for this

scenario in that scenario and they'd

like to have enough for all scenarios

the main thing we have to do is we did

before is to put out directions on what

should you use for what aspects and we

want to make sure that people know knee

or you are protected when they need to

be protected and they do it right and

doing correctly and do it every way but

there's also the supply there when they

do need to do it and so we're trying to

encourage that we're ordering and going

after ordering the federal government's

going after it so or firing on all

cylinders to get as much supplies you

want so we know only have enough we

would like to have an abundance if we

could but we're going to have to

continue to do it in a conserving way

and to make sure that those needed get

it and need it when they need it and not

have to wait and so we're we have a long

list of people with their orders that

they're looking for and it's much beyond

their historical ordering status a lot

of it's going through quicker because

people are using it I think a lot more

assertively and maybe from apprehension

on that basis there but some are doing

it because there's a little more

workload there's more cases coming in so

we're trying to work at that it's one of

our major thrusts that we're doing that

noni as the premiers alluded to but also

the minister

and our government and all the

governments across Canada were all

driving to ramp up that supply on a writ

large basis

okay follow-up yeah when it comes to

wrapping up that supply I'm just

wondering are you looking into what

industries that might already be using

these masks might be able to assist in

providing those masks for health care

workers absolutely that's part of what's

happening give you one example we've

been contacted by some dentists saying

you know we have a lot of masks right

now we're not doing elective procedures

you know we are willing to give them to

you so it's it's masks that are not

being used elsewhere plus manufacturing

companies that could potentially produce

more okay thank you very much

I believe that's the last question

Thanks
