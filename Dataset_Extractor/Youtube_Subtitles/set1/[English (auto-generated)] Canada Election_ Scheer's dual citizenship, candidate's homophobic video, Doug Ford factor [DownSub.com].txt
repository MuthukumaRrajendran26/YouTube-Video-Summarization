our chief political correspondent David

akin is travelling with the shear

campaign David first duel planes now

duel passports how much of this is

relevant to actual policies and and the

leaders who want around the country well

I guess the first thing done is the

conservative campaign has been attacking

Liberal leader Justin Trudeau on the

theme that quote unquote ease knot has

advertised and so this certainly opens

the Conservatives up to the charge that

their leader is not as advertised now

over the years the Conservative Party

that that's of course the party Shearer

now leads has criticized some of its

opponents notably Stephane Dion and

Thomas Mulcair for holding dual

citizenships and Shearer once quizzed

his own constituents in Regina if they

thought it appropriate that former

governor general Mikhail Zhang held both

French and Canadian citizenship so for

those reasons Donna Shearer has is all

but invited his opponents to launch

attack ads labeling him a hypocrite

okay David let's switch gears some old

video of a Conservative candidate in BC

has surfaced it was posted a few years

ago she's being interviewed about why

she opposes a school board policy aimed

at stopping bullying and what she says

is blatantly homophobic tell us about

that and the reaction all right so the

NDP is running spend Robinson in Burnaby

North Sea more and spend of course was

the MP for the area from 1979 to 2004 he

was Canada's first openly gay MP the NDP

have now dug up some material in which

the Conservative candidate that Robinson

is running against her name's Heather

Leung makes many homophobic slurs

including in this video it was posted to

YouTube more than six years ago this

homosexual people they cannot reproduce

the next generation they recruit more

people and more people into their camp

now she's also on the record calling gay

people quote perverted and she says gay

people try to recruit children that's

her words now we asked Shearer about

this this morning here was his answer I

haven't seen this particularly that

you're referencing of course our party

stands for inclusiveness and the rights

of all Kane's including LGBTQ

chains and we'll always do so now it is

not the first time that the

Conservatives have been confronted with

something like this in the campaign we

have asked the party if lung will remain

on the ballot in Burnaby North Seymour

and so far no response other than what

you saw from Shearer all right and David

we are both in Ontario today and someone

else is as well Jason Kenney the premier

of Alberta he's on the campaign trail

why

right well Donna the bigger question is

why isn't Ontario premier Doug Ford on

the campaign trail here in Ontario and

here's that answer federal conservative

candidates tell me Ford's name is poison

when they knock on doors Kenny on the

other hand he is still one of the most

popular politicians in the country among

conservatives cheering Kenny our great

friends Ken he's even godfather to one

of shears kids and Kenny believes

Trudeau's defeat is the best thing for

his province all right David akin in

Toronto tonight thanks
