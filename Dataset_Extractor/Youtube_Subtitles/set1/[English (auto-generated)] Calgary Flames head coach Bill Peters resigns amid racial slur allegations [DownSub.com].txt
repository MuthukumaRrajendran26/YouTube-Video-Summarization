good morning everyone this morning I

received a letter of resignation from

bill Peters which I accepted effective

immediately

bill Peters is no longer a member of the

cotyledons organization what I'd like to

do over the next few minutes here is

just give you an overview of the

timeline of events the last three or

four days give you some insights into

what's taken place please bear with me

and please understand that there's

information that I can't get into there

may be questions that I cannot answer

but as we've attempted to do throughout

this process we'd like to be as open

honest and transparent as possible on

November 25th in Pittsburgh during the

game I was made aware of a tweet on

social media from Hakeem Illume boast km

I immediately met with the media inform

them that we were aware of the

allegations obviously something that we

take very very seriously and that we

would immediately begin a review of the

entire incident an issue postgame prior

to departing to Buffalo I made a call

and contacted akima loop which was the

first of two conversations that I had

with Keith Hakeem throughout this review

on the plane we were going from where

were we going we were going from

Pittsburgh to Buffalo i sat with bill

we questioned him about the the incident

in question and a long conversation with

bill traveling to to Buffalo once we

arrived at Buffalo I met with my staff

communication staff management staff

that was in attendance and we put

together an action plan of how we would

move forward and the three critical

areas that we felt that we had to have

on that plan is number one was to

conduct a full review of the situation

of the of the allegation of the incident

and it had to be thorough I've been

criticized a lot over the last three to

four days that things have not moved

quickly they've not moved in a timely

fashion if I've not met anyone's time

agenda I apologize but it was more

important to make sure that we get all

of the information this was something

that needed to be handled correctly it

needed to be handled in a timely fashion

but I was not going to treat

carelessness for thoroughness second

part of our action plan was dealing with

our team we're in the middle of a road

trip dealing with young men that were

made aware of this allegation I met with

the team a number of occasions number

one needed to provide support to our

players needed to provide information

and updates we check to see if there was

any situations in our team where people

were putting in situations that they

were not comfortable with there were

none but dealing with our team was

important and then third part of this

was dealing with the media we tried to

be we tried to give you as much update

as we can as regularly as we could with

as much information as we could the

media speaks to our fans speaks to our

stakeholders and we thought it was very

very important

everybody was kept up to speed on this

process it may not have been perfect but

we tried our very very best

later that night - I communicated with

Bill that he would not be part of the

team you know with the immediate basis

we had to practice the next day and if

he wouldn't be taking care of practice

take beat be taking part in practice

November 26 really started the review

here obviously the allegations took

place in Rockford eye contact and

tracked on various members of the

organization five players that were part

of that team management of the Chicago

Blackhawks management at that time of

the Rockford ice Hawks members of the

Rockford I saw coaching styles I again

met with our players on the 26th and we

also prepared for the game that was

going to take place on the 27th that was

at that time now in the physics

informing Jeff that he would be coaching

moving Kraig cadre down onto the bench

with Ryan Husker Marty Jelena and really

did the host of issues that take place

on an operational standpoint later that

day and in the early evening it became

aware of allegations they took place in

Carolina

on the 27th now we'll move to I met with

Bill part of it he wouldn't be traveling

with the team that we would fly him home

to Calgary which he did on the November

27th and at that time I made contact

with past and current members the

Hurricanes management staff as well as

the player that went public with

allegations of of contact

and these things take time players are

all over the former players are all over

the globe when tracked him down and

spoke with him we played that night on

the 27th in Buffalo and during the game

I received this letter from bill which

also went out publicly as a statement

that was addressed to me yesterday we

arrived late early hours of the morning

of the 28th I gathered sort of the

information that we put together the

information that we've been gathering

obviously communicating social eternity

to the people within our organization

senior management ownership throughout

this process was involved and

communicating regularly with the league

and continued to follow up on calls that

I needed to follow up with that brings

us to today and the resignation letter

that I received from Bill this morning I

conclude this of saying a subject matter

that we've been dealing with over the

last two days is difficult it's hard and

it does not in any way reflect the core

values of the Calgary Flames it's been a

difficult time but we are going to move

forward

Jeff Ward will be our interim coach and

met with our players this morning and

we're ready to move move beyond this and

focus on the game on the ice with the

announcement with bills decision to

resign what's the status of your

investigation you concluded do you

continue the investigation and we'll

review for the most part now it's a it's

done that information will be obviously

turned over to to the leak when we

consider the matter closed your

conversation when you were hiring bill a

lot of questions are going to be asked

whether or not hey have you heard of any

of these allegations before with you 100

bill and B if you talk to Ron friends

sure well the first question where we

aware of any type of these allegations

categorically no the questions been

raised we know and we're what do we know

we knew nothing of any nature that's

been

so please in terms of due diligence you

do to do diligence we do a full scrub on

any fire and I did speak to previous

employees the employer's of go your

separate defectors Rob just curious how

this is a quality ours question excuse

me I can't mean how does this change the

bedding of coaches ten years how does

this change this office for you but for

any GM in the lead no matter how

difficult the situation you go through

the giving you have to learn from it

there's lessons to be learned here

certainly I guess that's what I would

say you know you always want to find out

information I think in all of us there's

probably things in the past you know

people may not be aware and try to do as

best a job as you possibly can

we'll continue to make sure we dig as

far as we can for anybody else

if I may just followed up was there any

indication that this is something film

is hiding or more that you just didn't

imagine it being relevant oracle popping

up tenders there yeah just one more

follow-up on that

if who who did who were some of the

people that you did speak to one vetting

bill and he you don't even want to

reveal that what what it will the

conversation be like moving forward when

vetting a coach and the fact that those

instances those incidents never never

came up

well I don't know like I guess it's cool

lots of lives remain to the previous

question I don't know if you're gonna

find out all the information on you know

everything of everybody's past but you

have to do the best job they possibly

can know is there things that we can

change and add and sure you review you

look at your policies you look your

procedures you always got to get better

and so we'll attempt to do that as far

as the first part of the question I

talked to people that bill and work from

the past

fight for Bill in the past you know

people that had been in contact with not

unlike any process that you would you

would go through a normal process I

would call and the NHL have were they

involved in this process throughout this

week yeah I communicated to the NHL a

very regular basis so there was there

was constant communication

excuse me I'm Erin consciously I just

wonder while ago why I think in a

general sense Erin there's there's

acceptable and not acceptable behavior

and I think there's you know whether in

dressing rooms or in society we all

evolve we all you know I certainly in

from our standpoint you want people to

feel safe secure in the environment and

but I think I think this is like I said

it's going to be a learning lesson for

everyone and I hopefully this is as

difficult as these days or have been

hopefully this is something that could

be positively before just just a quick

point of clarification since the coach

resign

yeah I'm not going to get into the

details of that he's no longer with the

organization

I was wondering did he voluntarily did

he offer to resign you out resign

he offered and submitted enough

resignation letter today that was very

similar to the last question and I'll

give you the similar answer I'm not

going to get into those details

it's obviously disturbing the 10 years

ago a person could color a young young

black man felt that coming forward with

allegations of racism with would derail

his career do you think that hockey

culture and I'm in the NHL and see its

own just all the stakeholders involved

in professional hockey need to something

needs to change

well I think from 10 years ago to I

think we have changed I think there's

change there's a there's everybody's you

evolve all the time as I said earlier I

think we you you have to continue to to

evolve you have to continue to look and

see if there's issues that that need to

be addressed and changed and all how we

operate in terms of the culture and the

values and things that we hold dear to

us and that type of behavior just has no

place now is there more steps that need

to be taken I'm a big believer in

accountability and responsibility so we

will be accountable to make sure that

we're doing everything we can in our set

standpoint but I think I think lots of

steps have been taken throughout you

know the hockey culture if you will to

move forward positively obviously we

need to we need to continue to do that

as as every business in a society

and given that there's no playbook for

handling something like this looking

back on the last few days at this point

are are you satisfied with the way you

handle it the way you did the review or

will you review the review just to just

to see if there's policies procedures

evening for play yeah I was I'm sure I

made a lot of mistakes I was flying

without a a compass here we tried to do

the very best that we could we tried to

get as all the information that we could

who tried to not react until we knew all

the information like I said I think

anything you go through in life you're

gonna learn I pray that my nobody in

this room or anybody else out there has

to go through this hopefully that that

doesn't land in anybody's feet but you

you deal with it as best you possibly

can to ensure something like that

doesn't happen like a formal process why

would that look like to do to help

someone in your position that's a good

question I don't know right yet you know

those are probably all things we're

gonna gonna look into I think I don't

know if you can plan for every eventual

outcome or every possible scenario I

think as we talk to our people I think

there's always got to be a feeling that

people can come forward if you've got an

issue if you've got a situation that you

either don't feel comfortable with or

you need to talk we talk to our players

about at all time we try to give them

outlets that they can come and

communicate when there's issues that

they need to communicate about I think

we always go to continue to have those

again I want to I want to reiterate the

these these these incidents didn't take

place here right so I think the avenues

that we've got and some of the

mechanisms that we have in place for

people to come forward if they need to

I bless you are in place and but you

always have to continue to look at those

do you feel like you needed more support

from Andy chiller or any organization to

do department work no I think the night

show was was fantastic in terms of their

in terms of their role in this and the

communication that we had I just like to

well just an experienced guy he's been

around part of what we're going through

right now is some turbulence

I think stability is important quite

honestly Kristen the goal Ford right now

will probably have more information for

you that in the next coming days but but

Jeff is a is a solid man solid coach

knows the players good relationship with

the players but also Ryan Husker Martin

you know Ryan's plays a big role already

plays a big role I got to sit down with

him with with the staff over the course

of today and the next couple of days and

we'll put together sort of our plan

going forward but you know when this

thing happened I felt Jeff was the right

man to lead over the course of last few

days and see where we go forward

just just one last one just bills bills

resign if you had resigned what was what

was the plan

well we a review that was going that was

taking place and I don't think

hypotheticals there are things that we

should get into right now he's resigned

I got same answer you know these resign

is no longer with us just to follow up

on Ward so is he the coach for the rest

of the season or does a coaching search

start today as well he'll be easy in

term coach I haven't gotten to that

stage yet Jermaine like I said I'll

probably have more information now we're

gonna sit down and for me to a plan

without but certainly for the immediate

right now Jeff Ward is going to be

guiding the show a timeline at the start

just asking if you could take us through

a little bit of what you had to deal

with in what your thoughts were when you

first heard the allegations by Al you

and then and then how did it change if

at all when the allegations I guess the

word would be abuse behind the bench

occurred and did you have to navigate

through that or wasn't the same process

going well I think I mean I would hope

that was like everybody else's when you

hear those allegations is it's I think

the word I use at time was repulsive but

their allegations you have to you have

to I believe in people and you have to

you have to be fair to all people so we

wanted to just do I believe process is

important and

so we had to continue that process and

as far as anything else with Carolina

when it that came up we just we

continued the same process is to to talk

collect information disseminate the

information and like I said earlier I

know everybody wants a very quick gavel

to come into play I just we were not in

that position we had to make sure that

it was done thoroughly correctly and and

that's what we that's what we attempted

to do in that sense was there any

possibility at the beginning of the week

of Bill continuing on as the coachman

with sensitivity training and whatever

needs to go through to make him a better

person moving forward and did that

change as things continue to mount I

began a little bit sort of hypothetical

questions we've gotten today Bill's

resigned a fundamental shift at your

level that could trickle down to finer

mafia as well everything from how

coaches are active players to how

empowered players be able to speak out

what you sort of see the good coming out

of all this across

well I'm not in a position to start

talking about other situations I'm

familiar with ours well and I think it's

a little bit like we talked about

earlier I think you always need avenues

to make sure that people have the avenue

to to talk about issues if they're there

I do think we've evolved I think the you

know how we've coached how we deal with

players how we deal with people has

evolved go back to when I played but

what a hundred years ago and so we

continue to evolve and that's no

different than society but as difficult

as you go through and lessons hopefully

you learn from them and this is no

different

right I I know this is kind of difficult

to speculate on today but you think

though Peters will work again difficult

to speculate again

there's I don't want a spectrum but how

hard was this for you this is the most

difficult thing in my career right right

we haven't heard the word racism at all

in this whole process is there a reason

why it would you categorize those

activities as racist that have been

alleged against Bill you know ever I&I I

think I said repulsive at the time I

think I've categorized what we feel of

of the issue

Fred Eric actually asked the question

already I guess the way I would rephrase

it is how tough is it on you knowing

that bill Peters was hand-picked and I'm

assuming a friend of yours how do you

move forward with that relationship well

I know like I said there's there's court

I've used a lot of you know sometimes

superb you criticize the performance not

the performer it's been difficult on

everybody okay thank you thank you

you
