all right thank you everyone for coming

today

yesterday I had a conversation with Jim

pop about his future his contract

expired at the end of this year and he

agreed it was in the best interest of

the franchise to relinquish his general

manager duties he will consult with us

till the end of the season and be

available to Michael and John you know

as we move forward I am very pleased to

introduce pinball Clemons as everyone

affectionately calls him pinball as our

new general manager for the franchise

John Murphy will join us as well as vice

president to play a personnel and and

pinball needs no introduction so I'm

going to turn it over to him right now

well I I was a part knee first

expression but even seeing your

brilliant faces this is not where I

wanted to be today I first want to pay

tribute to Jim pop an icon in our league

he is brought us a championship two

years ago and has has been one of the

best representatives of our our league

in a long time and so I first want to

start there and further to that I want

to say that we have to put our big-boy

pants on there are days like this and

I'll ask you to excuse me for not

smiling as much as normal but there was

also an opportunity here to try to again

try to reciprocate to our fans

some of what they've given me and so

when I was asked the first time I said

no and and then I said no again and then

I decided that this was bigger than me

most everything is bigger than me but it

was certainly bigger than me and and

maybe I needed to sort of look a little

bit further and see if I could make a

contribution if I could help the concept

here was actually creating culture again

that ethos of excellence if you will and

so creating culture I think our goal

here is to to build bridges not fences

and so as we go here we are we are

looking to try to build a culture first

we maybe have had a little bit of

challenge with transition the last many

years and sort of understanding who we

are where we're going and we've trying

to really begin to understand who we are

again and I'm an old guy now having this

be in here 30 years this is my 31st

season and and so I I'm one of the old

guys now and so hopefully we can let the

guys know who we are and begin to build

that brand again I am the lowest man on

the totem pole here it's my job to serve

everybody else my job to serve this

organization and I needed to be ready to

do that and and so I do understand that

that is what my job is I stop coaching

in 2007 because my oldest daughter was

starting high school it was the last

four years of three girls would be home

together and that oldest daughter is

in the back room there in the back of

the room there now and she's graduated

with a degree in journalism my middle

daughter beside her is in her final year

of business and law at Ryerson and a

final semester actually and and my

little one is actually in her final year

of high school so it is I stopped when

my my oldest daughter started high

school and and back again now when my

youngest daughter is finishing high

school and I I can't tell you how

passionate I am about this team in this

league and and how passionate I am about

our fans and it is my goal to do my

level best to make sure that we are not

just a competitive team on a consistent

basis but we want to return to being a

championship team now we've had some

championships here's matter of fact I

think we have as many as anybody in the

last 30 years since I've been here and

we have six championships I think

Calgary probably has six or maybe seven

I think there are six as well and so we

are we've won as many championships I

believe as anybody else but we haven't

had the consistency between and I was

surprised when I started to look back we

we haven't had very many runs where we

had 500 a better seat seasons in a row I

think we had and and so with that we

really want to be a consistent team as

well we have so many different outlets

that are available to us now with this

relationship with MLS see there's a

young man who we drafted many years ago

and I'm going to bring him on

- he he's a graduate of Columbia

University I believe young man and he

didn't come to play with us at the time

his name is Darrell Coburn but in doing

so while he didn't play with us he he

was he had a job working on Wall Street

so he he deferred to that rather than

being a rookie player but he he has

become a great friend and it's great at

analytics and data and the big data and

so we're gonna try to take advantage of

those things we've got so many great

people - to be able to pull on when we

look at what the Raptors in Masai Ujiri

has done and the way they've used

analytics then and done some forward

thinking we also look at Cal dubis and

and and the way he's looking forward and

and I'm hoping Jamil would be able to

bring a little bit of that aspect to us

and so we we want to we want to grow we

want to learn and we want to produce

something here that has a lasting

quality I can ramble all day so how long

I'm sure you'll have plenty of questions

so I'll I'll pause here

you know we understand that this is a

building process right we are not going

to make promises right we're going to

work hard and and build this back right

we need to build the championship team

that doesn't happen overnight we have to

have a foundation in place first when I

look at the the the great teams that

we've had in the past right we we had

guys that that are still in this

community today right who have families

who've grown in there and so it really

is growing those steady leaders John

Wooden said no written word no spoken

plea can teach our youth what they

should be nor all the books on all the

shelves

it's who the teachers are themselves the

number one determinant of a child's

success in the classroom is the teacher

that stands in the front of that

classroom the leader leadership is

important and so it is having those

leaders those leaders who are not just

not just founded on the team but many of

them who are founded in the community

who are committed to the team and and

and are willing to go through that

struggle through the rough times and so

we we need those guys who will identify

themselves will have to bring some of

those guys on board and this is a

building process it won't happen

overnight and we understand that but we

are committed to the ultimate success of

that I think in in when I was first

asked to be a coach I I don't know if

you remember I was playing one week and

the very next week I was the head coach

of the team and so the very difficult

situation and and that success didn't

happen overnight as a matter of fact we

had a winning season the rest of the

year but the next year I had my only

losing season as a coach at only seven

and 11 and I said enough of this and I

went to the front office and we weren't

doing so well the next year so I came

back and actually we figured it out and

and a few years later we did win the

championship and so that whole process

took about four years that time

and we don't know how things go and how

processes go but we will tell you that

we're going to give you our best that we

do understand a little bit about winning

I think that team not me that team I

think very specifically had the longest

night 500 or better streak than any

Argonaut team in the last 50 years and

so but it took a while to build right we

we had five years in a row where we had

winning seasons the other season the

season before we did make the playoffs I

came at the end so we had a winning

record while I was there so yeah pretty

much we can kind of say a modified six

winning season some 500 or better

seasons and and and you don't do that

yourself if you're the smartest guy in

the room it's your own fault you you do

that by building excellence around you

and that's what we're talking about and

so for me I understand that I'm pretty

useless by myself I can't do much right

the reason that we're going to do this

is because of those players who are in

the locker room and some of them who are

2 and 11 right now are going to be part

of that championship a part of that

turnaround and they they will have him

do it and they'll know what one side are

like and we we're gonna bring some other

guys that are gonna be coming to the

table who who know about those great

seasons are like and know what

championships are like and it's it's

that blend of things as we move on don't

know exactly how it will go and I can't

design that but but that's part of the

fun

yeah you know I've gotten to know

pinball over the years and what really

actually impressed me most you know he's

he's so charismatic was his football

like you and he had a deep love for this

team and when I first met with him we

were we were Owen six when when I talked

about would you ever consider coming

back with the Argos in some capacity the

idea was not to change over management I

I think at some point and in some ways

it's it's it's difficult to be here

having gone through a coaching change

and now a general manager change because

I'm big believer in my history 25 years

as an executive has been consistency and

building a core and the goal was for

Michael to help the team

pinball to help the team but at 2 and 12

and going into 2020 it was unacceptable

not to be in the playoffs two years in a

row and as we got closer to being

eliminated

you know pinball became an advisor and

saw some things in this franchise that

we need to fix and you know to me I

could not think of a better person to

lead this franchise going forward with

the winning pedigree that he has the

ability to motivate the ability to bring

unity and to show the path forward than

pinball Clemons and the one thing he

said to me as well during this time was

he needs a really strong player personal

guy and I have spent the last year

meeting as many people as I could

who've had success in the CFL and who've

been around the CFL long enough and John

Murphy's came name came up a number of

times he had been consulting with us a

bit with Jim over the last six months or

so

and and you know pinball and I had had

talked about that you know John comes

from the school of John huffnagle and

Chris Jones and then was very successful

with with with Calgary and with

Saskatchewan and I think this is going

to be an incredible one-two punch

because I think their strengths will

will actually amplify the franchise

going forward but in terms of the

leadership this is going to be Michael's

team and you know I know what I don't

know what I do know is they do know what

winning franchises look like and we were

not looking like a winning franchise and

with his pedigree he's got four great

cups three is a player one is a coach

John has two with Calgary and we need

that leadership and and 20/20 in a lot

of days in a lot of ways folks starts

today

and I'm incredibly excited I got to tell

you this man loves the or goes and and

and for me when I thought about the

future of this franchise in some ways

goes back to it was a no-brainer that I

don't think there's anyone better suited

to be the leader for this franchise

going forward than pinball Clemons thank

you sir

you

bitch and now we want to do things the

other way around we want to build

bridges not fences we like many of the

things that we see and and some need

well they need some bridge work right

and so we're we're happy to sort of move

along and it really is though about

building that excellence around you my

greatest strength my very greatest

strength is I understand how important

I'm not and I mean that sincerely right

and and and so we are going to build

strength around us and and and so we're

excited about that challenge that is

ahead of us and and we are we we that

that I can be excited about today I'll

smile more tomorrow there's there's

nothing we can do to ensure that what's

wonderful about the fans is that they

give us their allegiance when we don't

deserve it that's part of what being a

fan is fan comes out via the the word

fanatic right and so it means that I

support you when it defies logic and you

can argue that in your last little bit

it maybe does defy logic and what we're

here to do is try to begin to build that

back to build that trust back and there

is no way if we can earn it it always

has to be given right but but we're

going to do our best to earn as much of

that respect and understanding this is

that they're their hard-earned money

that they work for and and and so you

know I'm you know I didn't need a job I

have a wonderful foundation that

love and and I like make a living

talking to people I talk in they pay me

right and so like I'm not in this job

cuz I need a job I got a bunch of jobs

and like I don't mean I'm here because I

love that and I care about our fanbase

right and we want to make it better it

is not gonna happen overnight right but

but we we're going to do our best to

infuse that very same passion to every

player that walks through that door I

would say that John is fooling around

with his phone he may be doing just that

now so he is at the end of this press

conference and I'm probably a little bit

before it I imagine he has made a couple

of calls as I understand it and will be

working towards that but but the the

public assessment again is is not

something that solid ball clubs do right

we we don't we don't you know ever want

to to fall in that territory and if we

do if I ever answer a question like that

for you would you slap me

[Laughter]

Michael I'm just wondering then are the

next the next four five six anything

this is yeah for us an opportunity to

get a head start on 2020 right and and

so with that having that opportunity to

get a head start on 2020 puts us at a

small competitive advantage

we would rather sort of you know be kind

of going into the playoffs and and you

know but but it does give us a small

competitive advantage and as far as

assessing goes it's it's our duty to

look at everything a quick quick

opportunity to address the team and and

just prior to just prior to the meeting

yes yes sir

I plan to do that by building a team and

that's something that I've had a little

bit of experience in building teams and

it's something that I talk about quite a

bit in what would I do

present day and consistent with that

it's not I right it's not I think if

it's if it's me this can't be done right

if it is just me this cannot be done

right we're going to build a strong

capable team around us right that's the

only way that we're going to have any

success so I do have a little bit of

experience building teams and

understanding how to win and what it

takes in being able to assess and

those kind of things so I have a little

bit of experience there but I don't have

nearly enough to do what we need to get

done right we have to do that as a

collaborative right so that's a that is

a we thing and as it relates to the the

the things that are usually associated

with the GM the negotiating contracts

and all of those things that that's

that's going to follow their Murph's

hands well the reality is is that's part

of our development that's part of our

longer-term development and and these

guys don't even know about him yet so

that's part of getting the phase five

and yes um I'm sorry did you say

something else so so so so yes so so

this young man grew up in Scarborough

played football at Columbia and is a

tremendous young man who I is one of my

best friends who I interact with and we

we've talked about all he talked well

not we've talked about he talks about

big data and all these kinds of things

quite often and so I started asking just

generally like can you like can you help

our team out right is that possible and

so I did give him a quick call last

night after I talked to Bill and we had

this conversation and we decided that

this was going to be real

I had that quick conversation with him

last night and he'll he'll be a guy that

I love to introduce you to he's a really

neat guy and you'll have a chance to

chat with him and well we'll see how it

fits our game right when we win it and

when you look at soccer right I'm sorry

football the other other thing yes sir

you know they Scout around the world and

and so they you know there are different

ways to apply there's some real sort of

natural sort of things around whether

you go for to win and you know all of

those kinds of things right that that

that that we will certainly do but we

want to see where we can stretch it that

that can it can it be an essential part

of our personnel and scouting and

looking at players and I know Murph is

really excited about that as well so in

essence that is yes so he will he's the

player hawk he will be he knows the

players in the league he knows process

he unders he's been around successful

organizations organizations who have

done it right for a while when you look

at the model organization when I first

came here was Edmonton

today it's Calgary and and he's been a

part of that organization and

John Hufnagel himself was the one who

gave the suggestion to Bill when he was

gone and this was a part for me I didn't

you know know about all of those things

at the time and well when you say he's

the GM no I'm on the Jim right and so I

will have last call on many of the

things that we do right but we will do

them collaboratively we need to agree we

need to be an agreement anyway bill will

also at times be in on those sessions

for me part of what my job is to do is

to bring the group together right to

bring the the team together if you will

and that's that's not only our guys on

the field it is our team off the field

and how they work together fun office

group that we have that work here with

us as well

my job is to work with the coaches also

potentially working with players we

don't get in the coach's way right but

it's all it is to help to form that

group of coaches who are going to lead

us to help to form that group of players

who are going to lead us to help

collaborate in the decisions that are

going to be made and this is fluid right

so

it's really hard to say you know what

that looks like today a year from now I

probably can give you a better answer

[Music]

[Music]

you know again I rely on I rely on Jim

and Cory in terms of the the makeup of

the roster and the football decisions

that are made like I said you need to

know what you know and what you don't

know

my my job is to put the best people in

place to produce a winning football team

or winning soccer team for that matter I

have 26 years of experience I've worked

in in Major League Soccer in the NBA and

the NFL had been around a lot of really

good people I know what winning

franchises look like I don't know what

winning teams look like certainly was

not expecting a two and twelve team you

know one of the challenges that I laid

out for for pinball was we need to

create a core of players we need to

create the best front office and best

coaching staff that we can have to

produce a franchise that can win

championships and I'm entrusting them I

you know I don't want to take away

anything from Jim pop because his

credentials speak for himself and it was

said that this season did not work out

because that was not the intention to

change general managers but but when we

were eliminated I felt we need to make a

change

I did not expect we'd be two and twelve

I know going into the season you know I

read reports people thought we had a

good squad I know Cory felt very good

about the team coming out of training

camp Jim felt good about the roster even

into the season you know he felt we were

close to a couple of calls here and

there a couple plays here and there but

as the season has dragged on clearly

we're not close

and as Pinball said this is not going to

be an overnight you know change of

fortunes we have to build the champion

and building is a process that I'm going

to entrust pinball and then entrust John

and the people they bring to the front

office to build a winner and to build a

champion and that's that's that's my

role you know last year when Jim tried

to go out and make a big quarterback

signing I was called as to say hey can I

make this move at this price tag and my

answer was yes if it's gonna help us win

and I imagine we'll have those

conversations with pinball and with John

but I'm gonna entrust them with the

leadership of the Argos to run this

franchise and like Michael said you

don't want to be a smartest guy in the

room you need to surround yourself with

really good people and I think I've done

that today with with pinball and with

John I think it's a priority you know I

know

Michael Inchon do too and as we get into

that though I'm gonna rely on their

expertise that's not my call

I really wanna and and Michael knows

this and John knows this I'm bringing

them on board for their football IQ and

I think I think pinball strengths and I

think John strange will actually

complement each other really well with

our franchise and so I'm looking forward

to - how they want to shape the team

don't fall out I'll help you answer that

question in sixth grade Cup

championships here our quarterbacks have

been matt dunigan Doug Flutie Damon

Allen and the other guy is

ricky ray right so those encompass our

six championships right so there is a

lot to say you know we have to build a

strong team right there's no question

about that but ultimately we can't

disguise how the importance of that

position that klaris could be that guy

right but you know right now Zach

Collaros is is not physically playing

right he could emerge as that guy is he

feeling better yes but we don't we

really don't

it will serve us no no good to speculate

but just in the addendum Dave to your

question just the understanding here

that excellence is layered right it's

not doing one thing when you have great

teams right yeah great teams don't have

just a good offense right they don't

just have good coaches they don't just

have a good defense they don't just have

good special teams they don't just have

leaders on the team right they have most

of those things if not all of those

things right and so they it's a culture

that is created from the inside and and

and that's probably you know other other

than understanding how important I'm not

my strongest you're overseeing to French

you have to fire a heavy load and now

general manager I think you just discuss

personal yeah look it's been extremely

disappointing extremely challenging and

you know it's never lost on me the faith

that Larry Tannenbaum and the MLSE board

entrusted me to take on this franchise

when when they gave it to me two years

ago I felt at that time that hey we have

a really strong head coach we have a

really strong general manager this team

just came off the Grey Cup I in some

ways just wanted to stay out of the way

and give them what they needed to

continue running the franchise that just

want a great cup the biggest thing they

wanted is they wanted to move out of dom

bosco high school and they didn't want

to train at down to park anymore and so

you know we created the offices of BMO

Field and a coca-cola Coliseum we

trained at land port now which is is a

step up we still have to have a long

term plan for our own practice field

which is something we're going to work

on but I took this position thinking

that that structure in place was going

to continue on and win many

championships and so at the end of last

season at four and 14 obviously we made

the coaching change and and Jim and I

had a had a good relationship and I felt

you know Jim has a very strong football

IQ and and I felt that we were still in

good hands and it just hasn't turned out

that way and it's been extremely

frustrating and as the leader is the

team president I had to you know say to

myself I always have a plan but I used

to work for a guy named Dave check it

was very successful and he was someone

that would tell me Bill have a plan but

if the plan doesn't work you need a new

plan

and the plan wasn't working in terms of

the current general manager and I needed

to move on to a new era so it's been

frustrating it's been disappointing but

anyone who knows me and knows me well

you know yes I played the sport of

soccer but I'm a sports guy and and and

I've had winning franchises everywhere

I've been and everywhere I went and my

challenge is turning this franchise into

a consistent winning franchise even when

we won the Grey Cup in 2017 when nine

and nine and and Michael and I kind of

we really hit on that about winning is

you need to create consistent winning

that happens year over year and I felt

we needed to make this change and I felt

that Michael was the right man to lead

this going forward and and unifying

coaching and players front-office MLSE

the community and I don't think does

anyone better can do it than Michael we

were introduced actually by a city

council of more crimes who's the

chairman of Exhibition Place and he just

made an introduction to me and we had

lunch together and and we you know over

the years have have texted each other

and kind of stayed in touch I actually

asked pinball to come over and meet our

coaches at T FC and he had a chance to

speak to my coaches over there about

winning and about creating a culture

when when we acquired the argoes I had

asked pinball to address the staff in

his role at that time as an ambassador

with the franchise and we developed a

friendship and over the last year I've

tried to spend very much behind the

scenes and I've traveled to a lot of

different cities meeting people who

who've been involved in the CFL I've had

a lot of success in the CFL and a number

of times people said why isn't pinball

involved with your football operation

and when Michael and I met for the first

time I would say about me really talking

to him about joining the front office I

asked him why he hasn't been involved in

the last ten years since 2009 in a real

front office capacity or football

operation capacity said no one asked

no one asked and so I asked him and he

said no a lot of things going on

and over time I you know if anyone knows

me sometimes you got to sell a vision

and and my vision was that I wanted to

create a winning franchise and like I

said there's no one who loves this

franchise more than Michael Clements and

I think when he heard what I'm about and

and my own values and and and and my own

character we we were able to come to a

place where where he took it and this

was this was not long ago guys and and I

had asked Michael number times are you a

hundred percent content because if

you're gonna do this you need to be all

in you need to be a hundred percent

Diane needs to give you a lesson but he

actually he called me after the BC game

and he sent him in and that message to

me was loud and clear that he was only--

and I I congratulate him and I'm

extremely excited for him to be here

[Music]

I love Michael's gym manager of next 20

years like I said III I believe I I do I

but look I believe every winning

franchise has very little turnover they

have consistent core you look at Calgary

right now that is a consistent front

office staff led by John hufnagle who's

a general manager and the team president

you look at the best franchises in

sports there you look at San Antonio

Spurs been one of the strongest NBA

franchises and they have very little

turnover RC Buford pop that's what we

need to build here and so we have no

timeline and I told Michael I said I

hope you're here as long as I'm here and

we win many many championships so there

is no timeline what I do know is if you

are gonna have a consistent winning

franchise you need consistency in your

front office you need consistency on

your roster you need consistency in your

coaching snap and that's what I hope we

can we can accomplish mr. Nagel just

knowing his experience in the NFL having

coached on radio I'm adding one Super

Bowl and

the legacies builders you know I called

a number of people I'm gonna meant a

number of people and I don't want to get

into private conversations I will tell

you I think John hull flagels best in

the business right now I think what he's

done and what he's built out in Calgary

I think it's the model franchise in the

CFL right now you know one thing I've

done and is is I've really tried to

study the franchises in this league and

their front office makeup and and and

their coaching staff and and the

turnover amongst our rosters you know

you know one of the things and then you

know we talked about a little bit last

night and I'm not gonna get much into it

but we only have nine players that have

played in this team more than three

years it's not a lot of consistency you

look at Calgary and I think I think John

knew he knew it off the top of his right

I was telling it like 20-some players

and so I think John Hoffman Agel is the

best in the business and I think we can

learn a lot from what Calgary has done

standing so
