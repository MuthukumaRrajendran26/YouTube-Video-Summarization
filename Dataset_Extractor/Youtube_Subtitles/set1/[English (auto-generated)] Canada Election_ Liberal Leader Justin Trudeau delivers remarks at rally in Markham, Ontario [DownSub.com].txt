festival

[Music]

it's so great to be back here in Markham

with all of you Thank You Alan for that

wonderful introduction and my friends if

you're looking for an incredible voice

for Markham look no further than Allen

Howe a city councilor for almost ten

years he's exactly the kind of advocate

the people here deserve just like all of

our fantastic candidates here today he's

ready to keep standing up for you

although while we're on the topic of

local local leaders I have to give a

huge shout out particularly to Frank's

car pity and Mary Inge who never stopped

working for Marco I know that if you ask

them what they love about this

neighborhood they'll tell you about the

people they meet people like you our

communities are richer and our cities

are more prosperous because of you and

thanks to the Charter of Rights and

Freedoms we as Canadians are stronger

not in spite of our differences but

because of them

we know that our diversity makes Canada

the incredible country we love and

Markham the vibrant city you're so proud

to call home

so is family and friends across the

country and around the world gather to

mark the harvest and reflect on the

years successes let us also celebrate

the people around us while we light

lanterns and eat moon cakes we have the

chance to remember what matters most in

life spending time with loved ones and

being thankful for what we have now I'm

sure that as people share a meal this

year there will be more than a few

families talking and maybe even debating

about politics let's be real there's

always someone who brings it up but I

think that's a good thing because every

election is important but this October

we've got an especially big choice to

make there are two very different

visions for our country on the table

people here in Markham know exactly what

we're talking about you're seeing

firsthand how conservative politicians

say they share the values that matter to

your families but then cut taxes for the

wealthiest and cut services for

everybody else

my friends Canadians know that's the

wrong approach to take that's why we

chose to move forward by investing in

Canadians in their future and in their

communities our plan is all about

putting families first just look at the

past four years we've put more money

back in people's pockets while quitting

homeownership back within reach

we've helped families be together by

investing in our immigration system

while helping seniors be better off in

retirement

together we did this

let's keep choosing forward forward for

our friends for our neighbors and for
