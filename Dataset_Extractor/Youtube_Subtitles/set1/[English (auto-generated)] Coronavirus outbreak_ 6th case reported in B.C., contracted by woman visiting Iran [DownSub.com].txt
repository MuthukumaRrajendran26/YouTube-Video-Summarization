thank you very much I'm Adrienne Dix the

BC Minister of Health the side means dr.

Bonnie Henry the chief provincial of the

provincial health officer for British

Columbia as we've consistently said over

time or keep the public media informed

of new cases and changes with respect to

the novel coronavirus and we have some

new information today and I wanted to

introduce dr. Han thank you very much

so today we are announcing that we do

have a new case of covin 19 here in

British Columbia this is a young women

in a woman in her 30s who is positive at

the the testing that was done here at

the BC CDC lab it is samples have gone

on to the N ml for confirmation but we

are confident that this is a true

positive she resides in the Fraser

Health Region and has recently returned

from travel to Iran

Fraser health is actively investigating

the close contacts and a number have

already been put in isolation and

additional information is being gathered

even as we speak

we'll be doing a detailed investigation

of her travel when her symptoms started

and determine whether we need to

investigate or notify people who are on

the aircraft that she returned in and

more information around that will be in

the coming days she is has a relatively

milder form of the disease and she is in

isolation at home as are a number of

close contacts at this point so that

brings our total number of cases here in

BC to 6:1 presume positive four who are

confirmed positive and remain in self

elation and under the care of public

health and our public health teams the

first cases we mentioned earlier this

week has recovered and is no longer an

eye solution late in following the

resolution of their symptoms and

multiple negative testing so the risk to

us here in British Columbia I think this

reflects that we have a very robust

system for picking up people who may

have this virus this one clearly is a

bit

unusual in that the travel to Iran is

something new and Iran has recently

started reporting cases and we are

working and we'll be working with our

national and international colleagues to

better understand where the risks and

where she may have been exposed to this

virus prior to her return to Canada we

still believe the risk in Canada and

here in BC for sure is low and we are

encouraging people to continue to take

those measures that prevent transmission

of infection particularly washing your

hands regularly covering your mouth when

you cough and not touching your face and

really importantly if you are feeling

sick yourself even if you only believe

it's the flu or cold it's very important

to stay home and self isolate and stay

away from others so that you're not

passing this on thank you very much

thank you and just to just to reiterate

our continued view that the risk to

British Columbians is low but we are

acting with vigilance in our public

health care system to ensure first of

all that anyone who is diagnosed is

given the best appropriate care but also

that we ensure the protections of others

in the community and that continues to

be our overriding concern

this is our sixth case in British

Columbia as you know one case has been

resolved in the sense that our the first

case that we announced in British

Columbia has had two negative tests

there is obviously significant

investigation we're going to be doing on

this case in addition British Columbia

more than any other jurisdiction in

Canada has a low bar for testing and we

have tested a very significant number of

people we'll be announcing those numbers

tomorrow in our in our regular way at

9:30 on the BC Centre for Disease

Control website we continue to do that

much more than other jurisdictions and

we want to of course encourage people

who have symptoms to engage with the

public health care system we think this

is the most effective way of dealing and

controlling the virus in British

Columbia and ensuring that both the

individuals involved people who do get

sick

also the remainder of the public stays

healthy and is as safe as absolutely

possible and was that dr. Henry and I

will take care of questions doctor can

you explain the Iran connection what

makes that unique and and what that may

mean for the spread of the virus yeah so

that's some that's a very good question

we were surprised as you can imagine but

this person was only in areas of Iran

and Iran has recently started reporting

that they've had cases there including

just yesterday it reported they had five

cases and two deaths and so that

obviously triggered a bit of interest

from people around the world who are

looking into this virus because most

cases we know from China are milder

cases so that's it could be an indicator

that there's more widespread

transmission and I think this is what we

call an indicator or sentinel event as

well and a sentinel event means that

it's a marker that something may be

going on broader than what we expect and

so we have reported it as as our

responsibility under the international

health regulations to the public health

agency of Canada and they'll report it

as on our behalf to the World Health

Organization and I expect there'll be an

international investigation to try and

understand where the exposure occurred

so it's not clear yet but the travel was

from our own mild enough that she was

assessed at a hospital and sent home

after the testing and has been at home

in his being managed and cared for at

home yes yes the time when she was in

around long shoes

she did there and she right now I

continue in general sense because we're

still getting the details but she was in

Iran in late January and was there for a

couple of weeks and returned earlier in

that within the last week and when you

say that Iran is on movies that we

started reporting as of yesterday five

cases and two deaths can you extrapolate

more information from matter I only know

what I read on the

w-h-o reports that we receive we do have

a little bit of insight in that they've

said there are at least 20 other people

in various areas in Iran and that are

being tested for this including in

several cities both south of Tehran and

north of Tehran so that's something that

the international community and

certainly the w-h-o will be working with

around to help us understand and we'll

be linking with them to see where this

person had been in Iran and whether they

were in contact with somebody there it

was in late January so I go to stay in

contact she just returned this week and

so the there has been a number of

contacts and including some close family

contacts who are in isolation and we're

looking at all of her movements over the

last few days since she's been home some

of her family members poverty like

self-expression yeah they're being

monitored by public health so dr. Henry

the woman was in Iran she came home

decided there was something wrong went

to the hospital like what was she

thinking when she went to the hospital

like you just think I got the flu or as

many people most of the people I

mentioned the other day most of the

people who have been tested here in BC

for coronavirus have turned up positive

for influenza and we are seeing quite a

lot of influenza and my understanding

from initial discussions with the

clinician who saw her as well as the

patient herself they they did think it

was influenza and you know that is one

of the things that we've been saying

there is still we're in our respiratory

season

and it's really important especially now

when we have all of this other things

going on in the concern that we have

about coronavirus and other respiratory

viruses to have a very low threshold for

staying away from others staying home

monitoring your children for symptoms as

well and keeping them away from others

and home from school if they're feeling

unwell
