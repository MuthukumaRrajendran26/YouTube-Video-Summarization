kids right across the country may be

exposed to dangerous levels of lead when

they drink from fountains and taps at

their schools and daycares a year-long

investigation by a group of media

partners including Global News has

uncovered provincial data suggesting

many officials have been aware of the

risk though little has been done about

it in some provinces like Nova Scotia

results of lead testing in schools

aren't shared publicly in others like

Alberta led testing in schools isn't

required in part two of our series

Heather York's West reports on a serious

health threat that could have lifelong

consequences the filter itself is under

here Katie Gibbs has taken up a caution

to ensure her young son isn't exposed to

lead when he drinks water from the tap

at home she had no idea the toxin had

been found in the water at his daycare

parents should at least know these

things when they're sending their kids

to school or daycare and be aware of it

in the last two years provincial testing

in Ontario has revealed 2,400 schools

and daycares have more lead in their

water than what Health Canada considers

safe the information is available online

but the results are often not

proactively communicated with students

and parents last summer almost half of

the samples taken at this Toronto Area

High School exceeded federal guidelines

one sample was 28 times over the limit

this former student says she was never

told about the risk know if I was made

aware I would have never touched the

water at that water fountains still

Ontario students and parents have access

to more information than most no other

province mandates the water at schools

and daycares be tested for let well lead

me if you if you tested these schools

and daycares that did not test you you

would be horrified of what you find and

it's simply unacceptable to keep

allowing that irreparable harm that

unnecessary LED exposure to continue for

young children that exposure can lead to

permanent and irreversible health

problems it is a potent irreversible

neuro toxin it attacks really everybody

but the most vulnerable to let exposure

are developing children because of their

developing brains other provinces have

done some led testing and daycares in

schools though much of that information

has not been made public in Alberta we

obtained several test results showing

that tap water in many schools and

daycares was not safe

the Calgary Catholic school district was

one of two divisions of the province to

test its taps it found high levels in

about one quarter of their 86 schools

Danika Marshall has two sons attending

two different schools

only one of those schools has been

tested for that just to know that there

could be that problem that could be

affecting them it really is scary that

it's not legislated across the country

Alberta health officials appear to agree

internal documents obtained by Global

News reveal public servants have been

recommending the province take action

for years a 2018 memo sent to a

high-ranking health official notes that

Alberta's chief medical officer urged

the government to focus on the risk of

lead exposure in daycares and schools

its negligence - on the part of this

province to let this continue to be

ignored in response to this

investigation the Quebec government has

promised immediate change the Education

Ministry says they hope to test all

school taps within a few months

well Quebec family Minister revealed

last week the government will pay for

all daycares to be tested as well though

that will do little to ease the concerns

of parents and other provinces where

testing is still not required Heather
