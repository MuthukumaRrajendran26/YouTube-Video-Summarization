Madam President democratically during

the quorum

we're not thank you madam president now

Madam President I just listened to the

Republican leader and there was a

glaring omission in his speech he did

not mention what the rally yesterday my

speech or the case before the court was

about a woman's constitutional right to

choose to the women of America what

we're talking about here what I am

fighting for here is your right to

choose an issue of course leader

McConnell completely ignored in his

speech

I feel so passionately about this issue

and I feel so deeply the anger of women

all across America about Senate

Republicans in the courts working hand

in glove to take down roe v wade I just

read about a woman in Shreveport who

under the Louisiana law now before the

Supreme Court would have to travel over

300 miles to exercise our constitutional

freedoms and this is happening in states

across the country

Republican state legislatures are

restricting a woman's right to choose so

severely as to make it non-existent and

the courts are now likely to go along

because Senate Republicans have

confirmed nominees they believe will

strip away a woman's rights and

fundamentally change this country going

so far as to deny a duly elected

president the right to pick a Supreme

Court justice Republicans are afraid

here in the Senate to confront this

issue directly so they try to accomplish

through the courts what they never

accomplish in the court of public

opinion and they leave women out in the

cold so yes I am angry the women of

America are angry and yes we will

continue to fight

for a woman's right to choose I will

continue to fight for the women of

America now I should not have used the

words I used yesterday they didn't come

out the way I intended to my point was

that there would be political

consequences political consequences for

president Trump and Senate Republicans

if the Supreme Court with the newly

confirmed justices stripped away a

woman's right to choose of course I

didn't intend to suggest anything other

than political and public opinion

consequences for the Supreme Court and

it is a gross distortion to imply

otherwise I'm from Brooklyn we speak in

strong language I shouldn't have used

the words I did but in no way was I

making a threat I never never would do

such a thing and leader McConnell knows

that and Republicans who were busy

manufacturing outrage over these

comments know that too now what will

remain long after the clamor over my

comments dies down is the issue at hand

a woman's constitutional right to choose

and Republican attempts to invalidate it

the fact that my Republican colleagues

have worked systematically over the

course of decades to install the

judicial infrastructure to take down roe

v wade and do very real damage to the

country and to the American Way of life

that is the issue that will remain and

we owe I owe an obligation to the women

of America to fight for their

constitutional rights I yield the floor
