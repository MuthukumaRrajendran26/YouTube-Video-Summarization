[Music]

good morning everyone it is such a

pleasure to be back in Ottawa and as you

know Canada's capital also happens to be

my hometown and growing up my father

instilled in me a deep appreciation for

a Canadian history that's fortunate

enough to grow up surrounded by

world-class national museums where my

sisters and I were able to learn so much

about this great country the seven

national museums are within minutes of

where I am standing like Auto itself

these incredible institutions belong to

every Canadian the stories they tell and

the collections they preserve they live

through each of us

they reflect who we are as Canadians our

past our present and our future they

cease walk at Hong Kong I can't in a

collection calque on sale to semi second

inning it's after that key Newsome on

Tonka Kennedy Inc and again that's what

Patsy that's what pays off in a tribe

Nia

the very act of walking into a museum is

a reminder that before us came

generations of Canadians who shaped this

land into what it is today a single

united country with shared experiences

of trial and triumph and shared

responsibilities towards one another

when I think of museums I also think of

school trips March breaks summer

vacations that have stopped here my own

kids and the countless others across the

country walking through the doors of one

of our national museums is a ticket to

learning about and connecting with

Canadian history culture and identity

aunt we don't live in a museum

as you know new permit de prendre a de

vivre least walk that cultural le

naughty day can it yet our history

shines with heroic military achievements

industrial innovations artistic beauty

and athletic conquests it all comes

alive in Canada's Nash

museums there are places of great wonder

and they're uniquely ours there are

seven national museums here in the

National Capital Region there is also

the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in

Winnipeg

and the Canadian Museum of immigration

in Halifax now these are important

museums to remember our past and both

were established as national museums by

the previous Conservative government

today I am pleased to announce that a

new Conservative government will take

the unprecedented step of making all

nine existing national museums 100%

admission free free entry for every

Canadian every visitor 365 days a year

it's a move that will save Canadian

families more than 21 million dollars

every year and we won't stop there a new

Conservative government will also create

a tenth national museum the RCMP

Heritage Centre in Regina will be

designated as a National Museum it too

will be free to visit for all it will

tell the stories of the men and women of

Canada's national police force past

present and future and will designate

the grave sites of past prime ministers

and governors general as national

historic sites because despite those who

wish to sweep some of these leaders

under the rug they have left their mark

not only on our country but on the

entire world they are worthy of honor

and respect you see count on that on

sale should be canoe beaucoup de menthe

yourself president don't wanna let me

or should we need a man it was a long

promising geuv√¢nio general Delia

historic nacio pass comadre

sir key welfare tambien citator say

leader Don oubli song les Seiler mark

also not supposed to be mr. Lamont on

tier L married that's what the drunkest

man because I believe Canada's history

should always be celebrated that was it

perfect of course but we must never

allow political correctness to erase

what made us who we are we can and we

should celebrate the giants of our

history like MacDonald Mackenzie King

and Laurie we can look to the Past

acknowledge and learn from mistakes and

celebrate achievements at the same time

if we look back on our history and our

leaders and only see the blemishes we

miss out on a beautiful story of a

country that has progressed into one of

the safest freest and most prosperous in

the world now the bottom line is that

after four years of Justin Trudeau gains

just aren't getting ahead and at the end

of the month there simply isn't the

extra money for the next a house the

rising cost of the need to have the

everyday essentials leaves little left

for anything else I hear it all the time

everywhere I go people are working

harder than ever but they're barely

getting by and they're definitely not

getting a hit so this election comes

down to one important question who do

you trust to put more money in your

pockets so you and your family can get

ahead Justin Trudeau has already raised

taxes on 80% of middle-class family

and if he's re-elected his carbon tax

will only go up adding at least 31 cents

to the price of gasoline and hundreds

potentially thousands more for everyday

essentials conservatives on the other

hand have a plan for you to get ahead

will stops spending money will stop

sending for date money to relatively

well-off countries and stop cutting

checks to billion dollar companies and

instead will give that money to you we

will bring in a universal tax cut for

every Canadian that will save a couple

with average salaries eight hundred and

fifty dollars a year will bring in tax

credits for children's arts fitness and

learning making it more affordable to

connect your kids with culture and

inspiring a sense of discovery will give

a green public transit tax credit so

those who take the bus or train to work

and save will make maternity and

parental GI benefits tax-free well

increase the aged credit by $1,000

putting three hundred dollars back into

the pockets of a senior couple will

boost the RESP helping parents to save

to send their children to post-secondary

school and will do real tangible things

like throwing open the doors to Canada's

national museums making them free to

enjoy for everybody I have a plan to

make sure government lives within its

means to lower your taxes and put more

money back in your pocket for you for

your kids for your retirement you work

hard for your money and a dollar is

always spent by the is always better

spent by the person who earned it than

by the politician who taxed it James my

survey could a good moment

visa loss am I in for trade we oppose a

poll a mental occluders on Dumbo posh

porvoo for those our fault

kilaguni a cappella politician he led

taxi I know how hard you're working how

you feel like you are falling further

behind that comes to an end after

October 21st because it's time for you

to get ahead thank you very much

Khun rot phenol bomb d'Ivoire and a ban

on there that could include oh Allah sir

this is a consultation so say Ramona

socials Asian market

Cecilia Joseph could you see extra bad

comics would be you know oppressive says

said San Onofre in pour moi that's good

to do it to the lab or complex theaters

things with them so I'm looking forward

today finally to be able to debate who

Justin Trudeau in English he skipped out

on two prior debates because he's afraid

to defend his record so that is what I'm

concentrating on today's showing caves

are positive plan for how they will get

ahead under a Conservative government

and holding up Justin Trudeau's record

of failure organizations included after

we were denied accreditation by the

leaders

Commission is this something that you as

Prime Minister would allow happen under

your government and what are your

thoughts about the state making such a

determination well questions around

accreditation and the proper process

before that will really ultimately have

to go to the the debates commissioner

but I'm looking forward to having an

opportunity to debate jesters Bureau in

front of as many Canadians that will be

for millions or Kingsman so you say you

support the debate commissioner having

complete discretion on these matters I

well I will note that Justin Trudeau

passed legislation establishing this

debates commission without without real

consultation from opposition parties so

the ultimate responsibility for how this

has has transpired will have those

questions will have to be put to the

debates Commission ultimately just drove

to answer for for how he established

this process without proper consultation

two weeks in aadience ohs when will they

get a chance to see your costume well as

I've indicated that canes will have the

opportunity to go through our platform

in its entirety with plenty of time

before Election Day I will note that

justin trudeau still hasn't unveiled a

fully costed platform his platform is

full of on costed on detailed promises

and a platform without costing is just a

wish list so I challenged him to do the

right thing and show paintings exactly

which taxes he will hike in order to pay

for his on costs and promises at all

comes AJ JD they can get about 100

platform douchey free being I was

delayed after school take nationwide the

sustained photo pack month lacy platform

- shiftry a ildo are a lot of legacy on

the direct among Canadian they tack

skill Department a poor paper say say it

is an awesome mekakushi but what's your

time do you think Canadian Tire I just

said their canes will have our platform

with all details we're we are providing

fully cost of PPO costing on all our

platform announcements and our platform

itself will be fully caught in about

caustic that is in direct contrast to

Justin Trudeau who has unveiled a

platform over half of which have no

numbers behind them no costing no

details so I don't even think you can

call what he unveiled a platform

it's a random event without the

offensive incontinence is if Stevens

gather it was the only opportunity to

present our chef Mustapha proposal

definitely lot I do not get ahsoka some

people say that concert a vintage charm

j'ai beaucoup de cranial back they tell

either the beaucoup de Fora beaucoup de

is a spective the different collision as

you could in your vector rabbi they

shocked a software agent Daisy Massey so

what as Deputy Speaker I often held

meetings with different public figures

and those meetings were always open to

members of all party and members of all

faiths and I've had many meetings with

rabbis with with the moms I was at the

historic opening of a Buddhist temple

just the other day or to meet a

grandmaster

the Buddhist religion so I'm always

holding meetings with leaders of

different faiths and different religions

were there any discussions between

yourself your team and so like all

parents Ontario I'm glad that kids will

be in school today I think if there's

one parent who's disappointed in the

strike action being resolved today it's

Justin Trudeau and it's quite disgusting

that he was trying to politicize a kids

education for his own personal partisan

game come today Pahoa on our tail say

Jakarta saying boutros-ghali is Oklahoma

City know that for Darla college

district huaca de semana para que su the

globe the power path sales would be

association Ecuador Pascal say Clara KSA

the TV's a you know trip comes up or put

a pity party political hi mister sure

David Connelly CBC your candidate in

Burlington jean-michel has made some

controversial comments in the past about

gay straight alliances and schools

referring to them as sex clubs and

saying that

the school system what's your position

about this money goes into that well all

conservative candidates and members of

parliament will always stand up for the

rights of LGBT Canadians and that is

that has always been clear from day one

we are a party that promotes

inclusiveness inequality of alkanes I

know if that Justin Trudeau has not

fired his candidate in Nova Scotia who

was she tweeted out and made all kinds

of misogynistic and racist comments and

so he has to answer for why he continues

to have people to run for for him he

also has to still he still has not come

clean on to why he conspired to keep

hittin the details of his anti-semitic

candidate in Saline RSA Michelle and why

it took him so long to do why it why he

would conspired to keep those hidden and

why anti-semites feel so welcome in the

Liberal Party of Canada for candidacy

are past comments with your stated

position

well as you know I was honored to

participate in the historic apology to

public servants who are persecuted

because of their sexual - oh that

because of their sexual orientation and

all conservatives will always stand up

for equality of all canes including LGBT

community well obviously the situation

in Syria is is a very very serious one

and we all we are all watching this very

closely with the ramifications of this

maybe I will note that one of Justin

Trudeau's first acts as Prime Minister

of Canada was to withdraw Canada's

contribution from the fight against Isis

he pulled canada's jets out of the fight

against isis that sent a very negative

signal to our allies that under Justin

Trudeau Canada's not taking its

responsibilities to fight global

terrorism seriously that was something I

disagreed with at the time and I will of

course as Prime Minister of Canada

ensure that our country our armed forces

always does whatever we can to fight

global terrorism we are in the premier

active Justin Trudeau City sort ear nose

nose area under Chester there that

combat consular access to city officials

create a contour a lollipop a compromise

compromise Shiva toujours as you're a

colonel for Sammy juice or don't elude

consulate terrorism

since you're talking or defense you talk

too much of a foreign policy in your

platform out of the can base out would

you commit to increasing Canada's

defense spending with the armed forces

that have received an injection

well I will point out that just before

the election campaign started I gave a

very comprehensive speech in Montreal

outlining my foreign policy of what the

foreign policy of the conservative party

would be we also made the announcement

just last week about how we will cut 25

percent of Canada's foreign aid budget

to ensure that Canadian taxpayers

dollars are not going to relatively

well-off countries and that we would

also deep politicize the procurement

process and and it is arguable to get to

the the NATO target for our our defence

money I said I believe that we can

achieve significant amount of savings

for taxpayers by fixing the procurement

process obviously top-line dollar

amounts are important but it's even more

important to make sure that the dollars

are spent wisely and under the Liberals

we can see billions and billions of

dollars being spent starting and

stopping procurement policies you know

resetting the the processor played our

fighter jets politicizing the

shipbuilding contracts that adds

millions and millions of dollars onto

the backs of taxpayers without actually

delivering anything for Armed Forces so

I believe that by fixing the procurement

process we can spend in textiles more

efficiently have those texts I was going

to actually replacing jets and ships and

not and not wasted in in starting and

stopping process of all the time we are

all sitting at the object if that in the

simulator
