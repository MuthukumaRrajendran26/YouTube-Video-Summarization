good morning I'm Brent rusyn Manitoba's

chief provincial public health officer

today we're announcing 25 new cases of

kovat 19 bringing our total to 64 there

have been no additional deaths to report

we are aware of one client in intensive

care at this time I do not have any

further details to share about that

client at this time Public Health

investigations continue to confirm

details and information will be updated

on our website when it is available as

of yesterday sixty two hundred and three

tests had been completed at Kadim

provincial lab there were six hundred

and six tests done on Thursday we have

been reporting test numbers from Kadim

daily however today we have not received

the updated numbers so we're reporting

Thursday's numbers I want to remind

Manitobans an updated public health

order under the Public Health Act comes

into effect 12:01 a.m. on Monday March

30th this will be limiting public

gatherings of no more than ten people at

any indoor or outdoor place or premises

information is being shared with

travelers coming to Manitoba by both

Road and by air I do note that our

borders are not closed but we are

informing all people returning to

Manitoba of the need to self isolate for

14 days

we continue our work across the province

to plan our response and building

capacity within the healthcare system

this is done through our incident

management structure and it is a

provincial wide approach we have been

standing at this level of preparedness

since the beginning of February I want

to thank everyone who's been working

long hours and days and weeks to

continue to provide help and the safety

for Manitobans this includes our quite

dedicated frontline health care staff as

well as our lab support and to really to

all Manitobans who have been stepping up

at this time we've seen volunteers step

up we're seeing Manitobans making social

distancing part of their daily lives now

I want to thank thank you all and we

reiterate that we are not helpless

against this virus we've been taking

actions and we're going to continue to

take actions to protect us against the

widespread transmission of this virus

social distancing is one of our best

ways to protect ourselves the people

around us and all of Manitoban

Manitobans against this virus the best

way of reducing the spread is for people

to stay home if you can by staying home

you're protecting yourself as well as

other Manitobans as well as our

frontline health care staff staying home

is especially important if you're sick

it's especially important if you're in a

high-risk category for severe outcomes

to covet 19 this includes those over 65

and those with underlying medical

conditions as well as those with immune

compromised if you can't stay home then

please practice the diligent social

distancing physical distancing maintain

that 2 meter distance from other people

avoid large gatherings wash your hands

frequently coffin to your Snee into your

sleeve sneeze into your sleeve take

these precautions at all times

by practicing social distancing by

staying home as much as you can

we're going to interrupt the

transmission of this virus we're going

to reduce the the peak of this outbreak

I encourage all Manitobans to continue

access credible information about covet

19 visiting our website at motto but see

a backslash covet 19 and again thanks to

all Manitobans who have stepped up in

our fight against this virus we're going

to continue our social distancing

messaging and if we work together we can

really reduce the impact of this virus

on our communities so thank you very

much El Paso to Lynette so I just want

to begin by acknowledging our people who

are involved in long-term care and

elderly care the families the workers

and the residents themselves the the

changes that have been made are really

disruptive and we understand that

families who are used to visiting their

loved ones who are not able to now

families who are often a key part of the

care team are not available as they were

so we just want to acknowledge and

express our understanding that these

aren't easy times they won't go on

forever

but right now it's important to protect

such a valuable population that is at a

higher risk so for the families thank

you for the staff who are being required

to to pick up the pace I guess in a way

without those families there to support

and the volunteers but also just I know

personally making sure those residents

feel supported and loved for the

residents you know it's one thing to

have the physical contact but that

social

connection is really important

emotionally mentally and cognitively for

them so I applaud everyone who's trying

to find different ways to connect with

their loved ones whether it's just by

phone or using iPads virtual skype and

things like that it's it's a difficult

time and we understand and we are just

grateful for everyone the families the

workers and the residents themselves for

going through this with us I also just

want to acknowledge some really

heartwarming initiative in recent days

that will put on our social media in oak

bank or sorry Oak Lake Community School

which is west of Brandon the students

launched a rainbow of Hope campaign to

help seniors stay positive as they

managed with social distancing and in

Portage la Prairie I think it was

earlier this week kids showed up to

build snowmen in front of Lyons Prairie

Manor and if you look on our social

media it's quite adorable because the

even the snowmen are socially distant so

it's cute and it's outside the windows

of the residence so very nice and thank

you for the wonderful gestures please

keep them coming those are the kind of

things that we need while we're going

through this time so unto operational

matters so Portage la Prairie and Eric's

Dale opened their community testing

sites yesterday in in their first day of

operations Portage la Prairie tested 19

people and Eric's Dale tested 6 pine

Falls had an unofficial opening

soft-launched yesterday at a coal power

view and they tested 18 patients and

that site will officially open on Monday

with hours from 9 till 4 and as a

reminder these are not walk-in clinics a

referral is

prior to going there an update on Dyna

care so yesterday work began with them

cleaning up the backlog of people to let

them know that for sure that they were

covet 19 negative so this is relentless

but necessary work and we have I think

they went through yesterday 800 reports

they called in and just cleaning that up

so as the lab tests increase so will

those phone calls to people so expect to

hear more calls back from them on Monday

if you haven't already what else I think

that's mostly it we did get a comment

from one of them things to keep

themselves busy they are taking on new

projects and healthier lifestyles trying

to keep a proper diet and exercise which

is all great but we are hearing that

some patients are taking on some

projects that they maybe haven't before

including power tools so they there's

some injuries happen so we're still

investigating many of these new cases up

to now we've seen that all of our cases

are either directly connected to travel

or directly connected to known existing

cases so for that as long as we are

linking them to known transmission

chains then we're not seeing that

sustained community based transmission

we know that more as more and more this

virus is introduced into the province

the more likely it is that we're going

to start seeing that community

transmission we don't have the sustained

transmission as of yet yesterday and I

want to do people just clear up some

confusion some people saying there's too

many people in the park

sanika cakes it's not fat prolonged

exposure to other people if you're just

passing by them just fill it up

communication about what is okay what we

should keep in mind if you are heading

to a busy location market an opinion

that's right so the we definitely want

to reduce crowds so that numbers down to

ten so crowded events public events

where we do want to keep those below ten

getting out and staying active I think

is important but if you're if you're

finding that the parks or trails are

getting crowded where you're around a

number of people you might want to think

about turning back and ensuring that you

can keep that two meter distance between

people at all times that's the that's

the best advice certainly being outside

is a is a good idea it's a lower risk

being out and about but if you're

noticing that group sizes are getting

large I would advise turning back and

finding another place to be outside yes

we're lab is connected well nationally

connected within the province so they've

looked at a number of ways to increase

their capacity and there's a number of

innovative things going on right now the

issue is up to now is that reagent so

it's not lab capacity that is the that

is the rate limiting step it's the

reagent so there's there's lots of

capacity in other places but they would

have the same issue with obtaining that

reagent so we're the labs looking and

the lab has increased its capacity came

up with innovative strategies to

increase to where we are now well

connected nationally well connected

within a province so they're constantly

looking at ways like this

yeah they're a different type of

ventilator but they could be used in

certain situations absolutely I'm trying

to just off the top of my head there are

hundreds of operating rooms so we

haven't been keeping track of those

numbers but I would say it's in the

probably around 200 just a guess but we

can we can go back and get those final

numbers for you but we're more keeping

track of our preferred type of

ventilator which is in critical care and

cardiac areas well if we do need them

right now I'm sorry could you repeat the

question there's any word on the school

situation right now

well we have we've continually looked at

that situation there's likely going to

be addressed in up upcoming week so

there's more more to follow on that

yeah we've ensured we've reached out to

to all groups of mattawin's including

Hutterites the you know crowding

situations within any spaces we know as

a is a risk factor so we've been

providing within them within

Meishan just like all math Tobin

strategies to enhance physical

distancing and so we'll continue to work

with with them with all my ribbons too

to try to find a ways to enhance the

physical distancing strategies and

related to that question I'm wondering

do we have any work yet on the coverage

patients where we can you know we are at

a point where we're going to start

seeing that and it's and it has occurred

I don't have the official numbers we're

still waiting to be able to to report on

that but as we see what we'd expect is

people who are recovering at home 14

days after symptom onset not 14 days

after a diagnosis but 14 days after

symptom onset we would consider them

recovered and so you can see through our

timeline we're going to expect to be

able to report on a number of those

going forward and those rated we didn't

have the numbers this morning from what

was done yesterday so we just continue

to report what we had on Thursday so

we're gonna try to update that as soon

as we can and post it on on our website

we don't have those numbers today they

went through a full another phone

upgrade they have hundreds of lines

available and we don't have the total

volumes but we will report those as soon

as we get them

from the one big pre-press maluca hi

Martin gonna pick um thanks me yesterday

released some new details on its

modeling including some data showing

that they think mitigation efforts are

having a such as flattening curve there

I'm just curious about where we are in

Manitoba relative to an internal

modeling done and also would manage over

consider and sharing some of that as we

go forward as you see I'm right so we

are working on that and we will try to

get something something together all

along we've had early statistical

analyses done certainly if we look at BC

where they've had the case you know

since the end of January we are at

different points in our trajectory to to

do modelling but but we are working on

that right now we have partners at the

national level helping us and we can you

know hopefully have some some numbers

that we can share with Manitobans in the

upcoming weeks

we move on to Eric at Global News

hi this is Eric have we seen any more

hospitalizations the past few days more

hospitalizations yeah so I'm aware of

the one currently in in ICU is what's

been reported to me and we rely on those

reports going through our surveillance

unit so we're going to continue to

update regularly as we get those

official reports in and so currently I

can report on a on a current ICU

admission so sorry that that is there

was the unfortunate death yesterday

there was a ICU patient this is what new

a new hospitalized patient correct this

will be our our second ICU admission she

christened the NPI so that is

operational decision with the Regional

Health Authority and I understand there

was some more conversations happening

within the community about where the

best site would be for a testing center

so I think those commute those

conversations are ongoing

I think there were some concerns

expressed by some community members and

they just wanted to make sure that they

those voices were heard and that they

had a solution that everybody was happy

with okay thank you

um

102.9 Navi good morning

I just found fortunes for dr. Lewton are

the three cases that were announced

yesterday are lethal under investigation

at this point

yeah there will be certain certain

aspects that are ongoing they would be

contacted and and ensured there being

isolated and in the contact

investigations are ongoing so there's

many various contact investigations

going on at the same time so I can't

report on any details of those three

heard that to Abby and I was really

excited to hear that they haven't gone

through me directly but certainly they

any donations are always welcome and

they can connect either through shared

health or a Manitoba Health and we would

have that conversation about how we can

look at what they what equipment they

have available and if we can put it to

good use primary questions in a way for

a reporting system for those who see

people not complying with some of these

orders the status of that that kind of

review

that's right for the for the business

aspect of it it's the health inspectors

we you know we really don't want you to

get to a point where it's the people are

calling to report individuals with that

we really want to have these these

orders in place I guess they are just a

an additional tool that we have to to

get our messaging out to certainly allow

for enforcement if necessary but really

there our messaging is that now's that

time for Manitobans to all know the role

we're all working together we're all in

this together we're escalating our

messaging but but again this is not all

about writing orders it's not about

giving fines or or any things of this

such it's about Manitobans stepping up

doing what they can to limit the spread

of this virus staying home when they can

and in practice mere social distancing

as much as they can they should be

strict adherence to those social

distancing messages and then as we're

escalating it we have those limits on

certain businesses certain public places

so if need be we can enforce it but we

don't want to get this in to where

people are calling reporting their

neighbors or things I got it's just very

difficult to enforce that type of

response not with any fines we've had

very proactive public health inspectors

meeting with a number of businesses

advising them of the requirements for

them to to comply and providing advice

on how they can comply

in store to try to get in one last

Church gathering I would say that we're

we're in a pandemic and that our

messaging now is that we need to to act

now and so we've we've said all along

that social distancing physical

distancing is not social isolation so

you want to ensure people are staying

connected especially with to their their

faith-based organizations to find ways

to remain connected to ensure we're

connected with vulnerable groups but

right now we were trying to reduce the

impact of this virus and so it's it's

causing difficulties on a number of

individuals a number of groups but

everyone's going to do their part to

limit the spread of this virus so that

would include gatherings such as you

just mentioned problem CDC kind of that

Katherine

ggb one okay Jeremy - stinky Winnipeg if

you can clarify again people calling in

with questions rocks about right so the

most common symptoms are respiratory in

nature so fever and cough are very

common features of this you can have

other symptoms of respiratory illness

shortness of breath other people

describe malaise feeling very tired the

runny nose can also be an aspect so

though that fever and cough is by far

the most common but these are all

symptoms that we see as well yes so we

are constantly looking at those type of

factors and we're going to continue to

escalate our response we're going to do

what we can to to limit the impact of

this virus while ensuring that math will

been still have access to necessary

supply chains and and other types of

necessary services so we're we're moving

forward constantly looking at our at our

plans but I would say again that's no

matter Tobin should wait to see if an

order applies to them this is not about

orders this is about Manitoban stepping

up to prevent the spread of this virus

so whether an order applies to you or

not you should be doing whatever you

and to enact the social distancing

strategies that we've been messaging now

for a couple weeks so that's the advice

is that everyone has a role know what

that role could be for you and start

acting it don't wait to see if an order

applies to you're not Josh I'm Josh

Aldous communicate son I'm wondering if

the province is working on the list of

businesses that consumers the central

businesses and looking at public lands

other jurisdictions have and which we

haven't taken anything off the table any

actions that we think would protect the

health and Manitobans so we're looking

at all of those types of options and so

will will continue to message as we know

more about that this really impacted

Manitoba in terms of social distancing

in self-isolation all these types to

this information check stops at the

border a lot of people actually buy

these times most of this is about

ensuring everyone's aware of our

messaging as we want to ensure we're

getting that message out we want to

ensure that Manitobans know that this is

a vital it's vital to act now and so

we're gonna continue messaging and if we

have to escalate that messaging we will

but we see examples of mass have been

stepping up right at from the beginning

of this and doing their part to to

reduce the spread of this virus so we're

we want to ensure

that our messaging escalates in an

appropriate manner for the for the

transmission we're seeing but most of

this is just ensuring that all

Manitobans are aware of the necessity to

for social distance another opportunity

for you to share what message do you

want the public to understand when they

see your eyes like that she put it in

context or how should people it's not

kind of information on board right now

yep and so these are the numbers that we

expected to see these are the numbers

that we've been planning all along to

see and we know that we're going to

expect numbers to increase over time

we're going to see see community

transmission here in Manitoba and so

it's what we've been preparing for we

know that some of these numbers today

reflect a change in our reporting where

we're only reporting once a day some of

these numbers would have been reported

out in in the late afternoon yesterday

due to our old reporting methods so so

for today it does seem you know larger

than we would have seen if we reporting

out twice a day but this is what we've

expected for and again this is not the

time for fear this is the time for

knowledge time for credible information

and it's time for action right and so if

you haven't been able to implement those

social distancing strategies yet start

today it's not too late we can interrupt

the transmission starting today if

everyone starts doing doing their part

and that applies to to everyone all

Manitobans all employers we can make a

substantial difference in the

transmission dynamics but we need

everyone to act

I'm global views Eric that is an

American global why not implement a ban

on on gatherings sooner than later

considering the recent spike in cases

and by that I mean from adding

gatherings in 50 down to 10 so with the

band starts on Monday one when up start

now yeah well my message would be the

same don't wait for an order to apply to

you start social distancing two weeks

ago when we started announcing the

importance of it but certainly start

today this is not about orders this is

about Manitobans implementing actions

right now that will reduce the spread of

this virus

it will protect them it will protect

people around them it will protect all

so don't wait to see if order applies to

you or not act today that's those type

of orders the the federal guidance we've

been we sit frequently with our federal

counterparts and other provincial and

territorial counterparts so those are

all good social distancing messages we

probably won't be specifically involved

in those in those categories of

transport but but the messaging is the

same that's we support that and it fits

with our social distancing messages so

we work with all of our partners and our

messages are our

okay we ice it multiple times a week on

a special Advisory Committee of the

council chief medical officers of Health

and on that table as they as our federal

chief medical adviser a chief Public

Health Officer and so we're connected so

all of these actions are you know after

a lot of consultation and we're quite

working together quite a bit at that

table so so I think we're you know

nationally all the provincial and

territories were quite aligned so moving

forward we're gonna need the support of

the federal government of all the

provincial and territorial governments

to continue these these strategies thank

thank you guys Maddy

hello again a bee balm is 102 9:00 p.m.

now that's a gathering captain is 210

effective Monday is the province more

actively considering having cyber

infrastructure either cells are brought

into communities for self isolation that

don't have those structures in place

already like for example 30 communities

well we are working with the First

Nations communities through the the

federal groups so we do have guidelines

and

suggestions and we certainly are wanting

to support I think each First Nations

community will need to come up with

their local plans so looking at

potentially schools and how do you self

isolate in the home or if necessary what

are some alternatives that we can

support as well so we we are those

conversations are ongoing and they're

they're good conversations to keep

happening and however we can support we

will process and proceeding now and

right so you know this virus is not the

flu there's there's certainly

differences between it from things like

previous pandemics things like SARS h1n1

of 2009 we we learn a lot about our

method of preparedness from some of the

pandemics in the past we've were looking

at the evidence of their social

distancing strategies that they used at

that time we're learning actually from

other jurisdictions right now on the

strategies they they put in and so yes

we learn from these these aspects

certainly each pandemic is unique this

is this is not the flu this this virus

and so there's there's uniqueness on

there and I think that from the from the

evidence that we're seeing in many

jurisdictions good social distancing

strategies are effective at lowering the

impact of this virus and so that's

that's a major thing that we're working

on now thank you hi boys from CBC

Manitoba I'm not sure which one of you

want to take this but have any of the

previous cases done to recover yes right

so it's a good question and and the the

short answer is yes I don't have

official reports of that but from our

from the evidence that we have on

transmission of this virus

a person who is recovering at home 14

days after the onset of their symptoms

they will be considered recovered they

were no longer need to isolate they

won't need a test of cure they will be

recovered and so you can follow our

timeline that we're going to start being

able to report on recovered cases very

soon
