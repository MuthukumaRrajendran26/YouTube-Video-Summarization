Wow

thank you very much good morning

Fredericton and thank you very much for

joining me here this morning we are only

three days away from Canadians finally

having their say on Justin Trudeau's

last four years as Prime Minister

Dhalsim on twice they can dampen ha ha

thanks a proton safe so they Danny a cat

: interesting to know come with premier

means four years of higher taxes endless

scandals massive deficits bigger

household bills and less money in your

pockets now I've spent the last 37 days

traveling this great country outlining

my plan to help Canadians get ahead job

number one we're going to scrap the

Trudeau carbon tax

[Music]

strapping that carbon tax will lower the

cost of everyday of senseless like gas

groceries and home heating we're gonna

go one step further and take the GST off

of home utility bills saving families

over Holland every year we'll introduce

the universal tax cut lowering the first

income tax bracket saving a family with

average salaries eight hundred and fifty

dollars will introduce tax credits for

parents who put their children in sports

math language or arts programs take

public transit or invest in green

renovations for their home we're going

to make maternity benefits tax-free

putting up to four thousand dollars back

in the pockets of new parents

we're going to increase the age credit

helping a senior couple save an extra

three hundred dollars per year and we

will boost the government matching

contribution to our ESPs by fifty

percent to help more parents save for

their kids education

let's do this I will stop sending the

corporate welfare handouts to rich

corporations and and foreign aid to

wealthy countries that

[Applause]

now over the last week I've outlined my

108 action plan the steps a new

Conservative government will take right

away to put more money in Canadians

pockets I will task former BC Finance

Minister Kevin Falcon and former Via

Rail CEO of desert oasis in Seattle with

identified 1.5 billion dollars in

corporate welfare savings so we can put

that money back in the pockets of

Canadians within 45 days of forming

government my finance minister will

table the get ahead fiscal update which

will lower taxes for Canadians before

the end of the year I'll also convene a

meeting of Canada's premiers in Ottawa

on January 6 2020 to begin breaking down

interprovincial trade barriers to usher

in a new era of national unity and

cooperation

I will bring in stiff new penalties of

up to $20,000 for politicians who

violate the conflict of interest act as

Justin Trudeau has done

[Applause]

and as I mentioned that get ahead twist

cloth date will include repealing Justin

Trudeau's carbon tax and taking the GST

off home heating bills starting January

1st so no Canadian this stuck paying

more during another cold winter Okuda

our plan is achievable it's fully

constant and most importantly we're

going to get to work on it right away

now compare that to Justin Trudeau who

in the late stages of this campaign has

left the door wide open to forming a

coalition government with the NDP

so so instead of hitting the ground

running Trudeau had spent his first 100

days scheming behind closed doors with

the NDP negotiating which NDP members of

parliament will get into cabinet and

exactly how high he'll have to raise

taxes to hang on to power so let me be

blunt a Trudeau led government with the

NDP calling the shots would be the worst

possible outcome for Canadians even

higher taxes bigger deficits less jobs

and less investment and even less money

in your pockets this is the coalition

Canadians cannot afford

Justin Trudeau has made it clear he will

pay any price to stay in power and he

will use your money to pay for it shades

of the light they click that to that

bein a poor country gonna stay open for

a in that YouTube is a blood-spatter

Trump will deactivate now we've looked

at the liberal and NDP platforms and a

coalition of the two would run a deficit

a deficit of forty billion dollars next

year alone to pay for even half of these

never-ending deficits the Trudeau NDP

coalition would have to raise the GST

from 5% to 7.5% or cut completely the

Canada social transfer to the provinces

these coalition deficits will raise your

taxes and starve our vital public

services of much-needed funds and so the

choice is clear an NDP government

wearing a Justin Trudeau mask that will

raise taxes kill jobs damage our economy

and take more money out of your pockets

or a conservative majority government

that will live within its means and put

more money in your pockets so you can

get ahead

the Schroeder bomb-maker India declare

in Kalimantan today he fought in mass

building to deliver our Martell example

eliminate his employer and economy a

prominent of a posh a conservative

majority people vivre sanam same way and

they met with a John double posh put her

 on a walkers they might know four

years ago Justin Trudeau made a lot of

promises to get elected

he promised to balance the budget but

then buried our children and

grandchildren under billions of new debt

you promise to fight for the middle

class but then increases tactic

increased taxes on 18% of middle class

families he promised to do politics

differently but now he's prepared to

sell Canadians out in a coalition with

the NDP in a desperate attempt to cling

to power no matter the cost to you and

your family time and time again Trudeau

has proven that he is simply not as

advertised

and perhaps nowhere is that more evident

than here in Atlantic Canada Atlantic

Canadians put their full faith in Justin

Trudeau in 2015 and elected a full slate

of Liberal MPs to represent them in

Ottawa but what have they gotten in

return a carbon tax that makes their

lives more expensive a fisheries

minister not from Atlantic Canada on a

koa minister from Mississauga and

ballooning health care wait times and

doctor shortages in 2015 Justin Trudeau

1:30 to 4:30 - in Atlantic Canada and

ever since Atlantic Canada has gone full

432 every single Liberal Member of

Parliament in Atlantic Canada

voted for Trudeau's carbon tax every

single liberal MP in Atlantic Canada

voted in favor of Trudeau's attack on

small businesses and every single

Liberal Member of Parliament in Atlantic

Canada

stood by and watched Justin Trudeau as

he put thousands of people in the energy

sector out of work

the bottom line is Trudeau the liberal

so the bottom line is Trudeau and the

Liberals have taken Atlantic Canada for

granted and that's why I'm so confident

that our new Conservative government

will have a strong contingent of

Atlantic Canadian and peace including

from right here in Fredericton and all

over

[Applause]

as soon as this campaign draws to a

close and as Canadians make their final

decision I say this joining a viewer the

ability of the Canadian in Asia this

need a vote a conservator that's gonna

vote for mayor for job for a blue Guinea

Okinawa see only okay an objective

nasaan all the party L could present it

was see that have a leasing join the

millions of Canadians who are already

voting conservative because they're

voting for a brighter future for a

closer more united country where no

ambition is to bold where no goal is

that a breach and no project is too big

where Canadians for every province and

territory the First Nation can take part

in and contribute to our shared

prosperity and where the government gets

out of your way so the only thing

standing between you and the life you

want is the desire to make it a reality

so let's turn the page on a prime

minister who long ago lost the moral

authority to govern and a Trudeau NDP

coalition that will cost you thousands

of dollars more every year and let's

choose a conservative majority

government that will lower taxes and put

more money back into your pockets that

will balance our budget to protect

important public services like health

care that will unite Canadians under our

shared values and shared prosperity and

that will get our energy sector back to

work by creating a national energy

corridor and bringing in good jobs in

every province

we have a real plan we have a real plan

to help you get ahead it's a plan that

can work it's a plan that will work but

first we need to elect a strong

conservative majority government and

that's why I'm asking for your vote on

October 21st thank you very much

[Applause]

have you take your questions down

good morning mr. chair Katie Simpson CBC

News there are several things that you

said repeatedly throughout this campaign

that your opponent straight up say are

not true you keep saying the Liberals

are going to introduce a new home sales

tax despite the fact they say it's not

happening it's not counted in their

platform your warning families you went

on the television station yesterday in

Toronto warning families and you've been

warning certain ethnic communities that

a Liberal government will decriminalize

hard drugs even though the Liberals have

said that is not in their plan they're

not going there and just now without any

evidence which you're saying that the

Liberals and the NDP would need to raise

the GST 7% no one has said that so I

wonder why dabble in this kind of

misinformation campaign well it's not

with secretion at all we know that the

Liberals are contemplating these types

of things the Liberal Member of

Parliament star member apartment leading

member of parliament for the liberal

fetches Adam bond was pushing for these

types of policies we know the capital

gains tax on primary residence is

something that was put forward and the

excuse that is not in their platform

Justin Trudeau did a lot of things that

wasn't in his class

and so you'll pardon me if I don't trust

them on that now on decriminalization of

course we know that many liberal

candidates are advocating for this we

know that it was considered by the

liberal members of parliament on the

Health Committee we know it's something

that the NDP supports so this is clearly

the type of thing that Canadians need to

be concerned about during discussions

between liberals and NDP to form a

coalition government now as for the

raising taxes we we can be sure that

taxes will go up to pay for an NDP

coalition this is the coalition that you

cannot afford and so Justin Trudeau

needs to come clean he needs to have the

guts to tell Canadians exactly which

taxes he will hike in order to pay for

the deal between the NDP and the

Liberals to form that coalition he needs

to come clean if he's so sure that

Canadians will endorse that needs to put

that before Canadians in the next few

days so Canadians can make an informed

choice on October 21st

rustic liberal for today consider aliens

come the new attacks or the president's

personnel yeah lady criminal seventy

literally it's a clerical coalition to

end available it was the type war do odd

mentalism for poor people ignore deficit

alone see which things would always see

confidently Kennedy invisible and koala

government coalition on TV le liberal it

was while the collage the xpk exact

amount can involve an augment April pay

supported coalition

do offense at medium or large scale

economy I prefer schewe he form a debate

in October my favorite question is Adam

Vaughan the candidate you keep pointing

out has gone on cbc news repeatedly has

other news outlets and said he was

straight up not true I have obtained the

documents that you're referencing it was

not presented as a proposal it was an

idea that was collected at a town hall

that was included in some documents was

not included in that pitch and as part

of my follow-up the race in the GST no

one has said

that what did you just speak out of thin

air it doesn't know anything back to the

principal residence at Salem is right

under this Liberal government under

direction from this Liberal government

the Canada Revenue Agency has started to

track information related to the sale of

principal residences so that is clearly

something that they have initiated under

this Liberal government and we know that

this was a policy submission to the

liberal platform as it relates to

raising the GST we are showing Canadians

the types of costs that will be

associated with this massive amount of

new deficits they will have to make

choices they will run these massive

deficits forty billion dollars of new

deficits alone to pay for the NDP

liberal coalition promises that money

has to come from somewhere

raising the GST from five to 7.5% is one

option if they are not going to raise it

if they are not going to raise these if

they are not going to raise the GST they

have to explain which taxes they will

raise to pay for it and that is my

challenge to Justin Trudeau today if he

is so sure if he is so sure

[Applause]

if he is so sure that Canadians want an

NDP liberal coalition and these massive

deficits he needs to tell fiends exactly

which taxes he will raise to pay for and

he needs to do that immediately so

Canadians can make an informed choice

you know I respect all Canadians and I

Canadians to show them how my policies

will lead to a better Canada and make

life more affordable and I can disagree

members of my family run for the NDP and

I still certainly respect them and we

we have reasons to be very optimistic in

who's Avaya Dida xno so I'll be there to

support our great candidate as to the

future of that party that is not for me

to decide but I can't say to every

Canadian who is tired of Justin

Trudeau's high taxes massive deficits in

the way he's embarrassed Canada on the

world stage

it's the Conservative Party of Canada

can replace the Liberals and it is me

who can replace Justin true

okay Becky really bad poopy entities but

this particular maintainer of going full

[Applause]

the decision was up to you that you

would seek a judicial review on the

Human Rights Tribunal ruling ordering

Ottawa to compensate First Nations

children G believe these kids do not

deserve compensation all right not at

all what I said was that given the scope

of the decision and the impacts that

would have that it would be appropriate

to have judicial review would you

compensate the last Prime Minister I

believe that that children who have been

mistreated or families that have

suffered because of policies of the

federal government should absolutely be

compensated

your intention is to repeal the carbon

tax legislation that the true government

brought in would you consider this a

vote of confidence and if you lose the

vote does that mean to you that you've

lost the confidence of the house so

these types of discussions are all

centered around what happens after

October 21st and what I'm focused on

between now and October to make her

society nians the choice that is put

forth on the one hand we have a

coalition the Canadians cannot afford

that we'll have to raise taxes for their

massive spending promises during this

campaign cool add 40 billion dollars to

the deficit we know what that means

means more and more of your tax dollar

goes to pay the interest on that debt

and that threatens public services like

health care on the other hand we have a

Conservative Party that is promising to

get back to balanced budgets over a

responsible period of time by cutting

corporate welfare by reducing the

foreign aid budget and ending wasteful

practices like March Madness in Ottawa

and we are going to return that money to

Canadians in the form of tax cuts those

are the choices before that is the

choice before Kings so my appeal to

voters between now and October 24 is to

give our party a mandate to repeal the

carbon tax to lower taxes and to get

back to balanced budgets

[Applause]

a good morning Christie her khalipa

Globe and Mail what is your assessment

of the current DC government given that

Christie Clark's liberals secured the

most number of seats but she is not the

premier I will leave it to the voters of

British Columbia to assess the

performance of the year of the current

government in British Columbia my pitch

to voters between now

October 21st is to vote for stability

vote for a strong majority government

conservative majority government that

can get back to balanced budgets

stop pouring billions and billions of

dollars from future generations from

current generations stop threatening our

vital public services and elect a

government that will get back to

balanced budgets and lower taxes all

with all due respect that isn't what I

asked you I asked you whether the

government is legitimate given that the

party that won the most number of seats

is not actually in government is that

legitimate hi as you know I pointed out

yesterday occurred the modern

conventions

I am also pointing out the choice

between Canadians the choices that is

before Canadians the clear choice

between a liberal and nippy coalition a

coalition that you cannot afford a

coalition that will run massive deficits

even bigger deficits than Justin Trudeau

is running now because he's going to

have to buy off the NDP and that means

higher taxes and threats to vital public

services on the other hand we have a

conservative platform that will get back

to balanced budgets lower taxes scrapped

the carbon tax bill the national energy

quarter that can get Western Canadian

resources to Eastern Canadian markets

something that the people of New

Brunswick here support the people of

Canada all across this country support

that is the choice October 21st I'm

asking for a strong mandate so we can

implement urgent

I'm sure my national I want to ask you

about brexit whether or not you think

the UK should leave the EU under the

terms of the agreement reached the team

inside there's a lot that's ultimately

up to British lawmakers who will make

that decision

fair enough I also wanted to ask you

about something that this is the first

time we're hearing about this today your

claim that the NBP and liberals if they

do form a coalition once they have is a

bit well will raise the GST

why are you dabbling in this kind of

fear-mongering to voters when nobody has

said this sorry I'll just finish my

question as it was partially

interrupting

are you not misleading people by saying

that and one more time where did you get

that number from we are showing

Canadians the types of consequences that

they will face within NEP liberal

coalition it is quite clear than that is

what they are contemplating it is also

clear that they will add billions of

dollars to the deficit and like night

follows day massive liberal deficits

lead to massive liberal tax hikes this

is exactly what happened in Ontario

under Kathleen Wynne and Dalton McGuinty

is what happened it is what has happened

at the federal level level under liberal

governments before so Canadians can now

see they will have to do something to

pay for these massive deficits raising

the GST maybe one of you know is one

option they may raise other tests and

that is why I say Justin Trudeau needs

to have the guts to tell Canadians

immediately which tax hikes he will

implement which policies of the NDP he

will accept in order to stay in power he

has the obligation to tell Canadians

exactly what they are voting for on

Monday Canadians know what they are

voting for when they vote conservative

they're voting for fiscal responsibility

a responsible plan to get back to

balanced budgets and tax cuts that will

help make life more affordable so

Canadians get ahead that is the choice

on

krisily from the National Post he

promised to Quebec all kinds of unique

arrangements more powers of reparation

culture things like that these are ideas

that that or the conservative coalition

apart in the 1990s even to the modern

conservative movement the modern party

and your supporters are you ready behind

this idea of asymmetrical federalism I

absolutely believe that conservatives

acknowledge that the Quebec law form

form an essay on those in Canada you

need that's something that our party is

supported and there are principles that

flow from that we are the party that

believes in decentralization and we are

prepared to sit down with a premier logo

and talk about how the Quebec sculture

and its history and its language can be

protected within a united Canada at the

same time we we are we believe in these

centralized principles for other

provinces we are the only party that

respects provincial jurisdiction that

rejects the Ottawa knows best approach

top down the federal government and

wants to work collaboratively with

collaboratively with the premiers Justin

Trudeau is currently fighting several

premiers in court he is literally

campaigning in this election by

attacking provincial papers we will have

a cooperative approach to sit down with

premiers around the table after this

election to get things done for Cannes

mr. blush a from from the block has said

that he would not you know help them to

support any kind of minority government

that would act the carbon tax and you

guarantee your supporters that is

non-negotiable in any kind of scenario

that happens after October 21st well

I've made a clear commitment to

Canadians we will introduce legislation

to repeal the carbon tax the carbon tax

does not work it is it is raising the

cost of literally everything from home

heating to gasoline to groceries that is

what we were putting forward for canes

that is why we're asking for a strong

mandate so we can get rid of the carbon

tax lower other taxes make life more for

the leaf more money in the pockets of

Canadians

today to declare exactly killing yet

natural premier project ah that's really

you are gradually attached to the carbon

as to say don't let what I'm saying gosh

mom Jennifer map a speculator they said

in Rio after painting October should

amount of Kennedy Amanda for or

equilibria puja a pasted a simple so say

Monica only Daniel quarter the second

theme of the amendment say it's a

hellish one for the Canadian elderly

indeed you've heard your pitch to the

literature is not currently decided

conservative that 70% of voters based on

current polling so we've heard your

pitch but what's your message to those

voters if they vote way that they're

currently looking and you're forcibly

put together in your door you will see

message saluted well my message to

voters who have not yet made up their

mind is clearly there is a choice this

election there's a choice between an NDP

liberal coalition that will add billions

of dollars to the deficit threatened the

capacity of the federal government to

support important services like health

care like education that will lit raise

taxes to pay for and drive jobs and

investment out of this country I mean

which which types of big projects in

this country that create jobs will be

cancelled when the NDP get to start

calling the shots on the other hand we

have the choice of a conservative

majority government that will support

our energy sector that will get big

projects built again in this

that will responsibly balance the budget

at lower taxes all along the way so my

message to voters have not yet made up

their mind is vote for a conservative

candidate vote for our party so we can

make life more affordable and help

Canadians get ahead

Toronto Mayor John Tory has said that

yet significant concerns like the

platform specifically around which the

yoga crisis and structure can you

respond to those comments from the mayor

yesterday and more generally how would

you deal with federal school relations

time you have to do a lot of progressive

leaders visit well I've had numerous

meetings with mayor Tory we've had very

productive conversations I would remind

him that it is only the Conservative

Party I am the only federal labor leader

that has made a full commitment an

unequivocal commitment to the Ontario

and the unlined expansions that is

something that is very important to the

people of Toronto and my commitment is

that we will ensure that the overall

amount first spending on infrastructure

is protected at the same time I would

remind him that we are the only party

that is talking about cracking down on

gang violence and that is a problem all

over the GTA we are going to go after

the real criminals the real criminals

the members of gangs and the drug and

Firearms traffickers that we are the

only party that will make the our

communities in the GTA and all over

Canada safer by going after real

talked a lot about a liberal NDP sort of

coalition but in this particular writing

over entry party is a major factor

what's your assessment of that party and

the platform they're offering to

Canadians well you know when you look at

the types of job-killing policies that

they would bring in the types of

projects that they would cancel leading

to thousands of people being put out of

work the massive spending that is

contained in their platform as well we

can we can see that if those policies

are about the - it will be even costlier

for Canadians so again we see on the one

hand a coalition between the Liberals

and the NDP perhaps supported by the

Green Party that will lead to massive

new deficits and tax hikes to pay for it

or a strong conservative majority

mandate that will balance the budget

yeah so I will note that nothing has

changed in the province of New Brunswick

in terms of this policy from the

previous Liberal government here

provincially and it is only during the

spyder election campaign and with the

Progressive Conservative government

provincially that Justin Trudeau is

trying to make this an issue so it's

quite clear he's trying to pay play

politics with this issue our commitment

to Canadians is that will increase

funding for healthcare services by at

least 3 percent every year

apricots Daily Gleaner you said today

yesterday that modern convention means

that Trudeau must put it as amenable

seats what about in the last provincial

election saw here where Higgs had to

wait his turn Kellogg gallon to attempt

to maintain confidence about the

legislature well as I mentioned I was

pointing to modern-day in history at the

federal level where where Inc prime

ministers who came out of the election

with fewer seats followed that practice

now what we're talking about now in the

last few days I will leave it to pundits

to do their pondichery about what might

happen often

after October 21st right now it's

important that Canadians understand they

have a choice a choice between a liberal

NDP coalition he'll run massive deficits

even bigger deficits than just ensure

that those deficits will threaten

important public services and that

coalition government will have to raise

taxes to pay for it and again I

challenge this material to be crystal

clear with Canadians if he believes that

he will have a right to govern this

country with the NDP supporting him

Heaney said the courage and the backbone

to show Canadians exactly which taxes he

will hike because if he does not then

Canadians will know that he doesn't have

the courage to explain exactly what it

is he's proposing on the other hand a

conservative platform that is fully

costed that shows exactly how we'll get

back to balanced budget is the best way

to help Canadians get ahead we will

lower taxes we'll put more money in the

pockets of Canadians to help them get

ahead
