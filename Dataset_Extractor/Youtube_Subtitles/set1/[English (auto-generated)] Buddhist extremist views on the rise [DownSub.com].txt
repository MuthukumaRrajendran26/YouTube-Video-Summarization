a monk in Sri Lanka yelling death

threats at a police officer this speech

was made by Nana's another openly

advocating violence and young Buddhist

setting the homes of Muslims ablaze in

Myanmar it isn't exactly what most

people associate with Buddhism a faith

largely seen as peace-loving calm and

meditative but increasingly this angry

violent side of Buddhism has started to

take root in some countries well it's a

minority of people using Buddhism as an

excuse for violence there is still a

noticeable rise to understand why we

first need to know that like other

religions Buddhism is broken into sects

there are over 500 million Buddhists

around the world with the majority found

in Asia Eastern Buddhism or Mahayana is

by far the largest group with 360

million followers most followers live in

China and eastern parts of Asia northern

Buddhism also known as Vajrayana has 18

point 2 million adherents this is the

form of Buddhism practiced by those that

follow the Dalai Lama it's concentrated

mostly in places like Tibet and Bhutan

while southern Buddhism or tera vaada

has a hundred and fifty million

followers concentrated in Thailand Sri

Lanka Myanmar and some in Cambodia and

Laos the Sri Lanka Burma Thailand

you have Theravada Buddhism which is the

majority belief of the people in sri

lanka at seventy five percent of the

population in Burma is 88% and in

Thailand 93 years old it's within the

confines of tera vaada Buddhism where

some monks have found a justification

for violence dr. Peter lair has

researched the rise of extreme Buddhism

and says there are a number of reasons

why they feel emboldened to propagate

violence first Buddhism is under siege

we need to defend ourselves second step

a defensive warfare or defensive

violence is acceptable in Buddhism

answered it's not bad to fight against

these people because they're not really

humans most experts agree that the roots

of Buddhist extremism actually lie in

the British colonial past during the

colonial period in Sri Lanka is that

the Brits kind of practiced as they do

in other parts of the world or in other

parts of the world kind of divide and

divide and rule philosophy Buddhist

nationalists saw their own way of life

and religious beliefs as being under

threat from minority communities like

Muslims and that fear boiled over into

violence violence that's being openly

called for by some radicalized monks

today these monks used to take their

message to the towns and communities

they visited but in the Internet age

that message is reaching a wider

audience at lightning speed online it

used to be DVDs and CDs and all the

stuff what is it go straight to YouTube

it's happening everywhere Buddhist

extremists are active and groups like

Myanmar's ma Fatah rebranded as the

Buddha Dhamma Paquita foundation after

being banned in 2017 and the anti Islam

969 movement as well as Sri Lanka's

bhaji polisena

are now using social media to organize

and galvanize I'm in a few of these you

know single a Buddhist nationalist

groups on whatsapp and it's quite

obvious that whenever there's kind of

anti-muslim riding going on

you know addresses get shared in these

groups it's tough to police these groups

till it's too late and last year

Facebook acknowledged that they didn't

do enough to stop violence propagated by

extreme Buddhists on their platform in

Myanmar you can be sure that thousands

and thousands of people watching that

the result fire bombings beatings mob

attacks and forced migrations

we followed a fire engine into this

neighborhood and we went in and houses

were on fire there were hundreds of

young Buddhist men on on motorbikes

riding around the neighborhood with

sticks and with with swords

singing nationalist songs the Muslim

minority had been driven out journalists

have also found themselves targeted and

threatened by Buddhist nationalists

particularly in Myanmar for reporting on

the plight of the rahaga who were driven

out of their homes in Rakhine State and

forced into refugee camps in Bangladesh

that's what happened to me because I

started reporting about this from 2013

and I started getting threats on social

media in Sri Lanka the same story

minority communities targeted by

Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists the main

one that's active today is the Buddha

Bala say now it was founded in 2012 I

believe and they've been at the

forefront of kind of very vibrant

anti-muslim prosing Hollow Buddhist

activism in the country the violence has

largely been confined to these two

countries for now but there is concern

that it could soon crop up in other

parts of Asia where Muslims have a small

yet visible minority community it is

something that we should be worrying

what really surprised me was when I went

to one of this rally or gathering up the

Buddhist nationalist back in 2016 I saw

a few Buddhist nationalists from

Thailand participating in Myanmar and

experts agree it's concerning for the

entire region what's also very ominous

is that Buddhist groups monk groups are

now connecting the dots basically

getting aliens across the country

borders so what's the answer to start

moderate Buddhists need to be the

stronger voices but that's not an easy

feat and even banning groups like ma

bata in Myanmar and declaring them

illegal hasn't stopped the spread of

hate I have to think twice as a moderate

long to do something against this these

features of hate because they are well

organized it's not only other monks that

need to speak up but politicians and

world leaders too many have been waiting

for Nobel Peace Prize winner and Burmese

politician uncensor Chi to take a stand

against violence in Myanmar but so far

she hasn't there could be a lot more

done Hong Sun Tzu Chi for example has

huge support among the population but

it's an issue that she for political

reasons probably feels very

uncomfortable touching for now extreme

Buddhist views preaching hate and

intolerance remains a concern its

consequences far-reaching as persecuted

minorities seek shelter in other

countries around the world and as

nations in the region keep a close eye

on Buddhist nationalist and tolerance of

others to prevent the spread of violence

to other areas in the future
