our public health system was

understaffed and under resourced and

without intervention it could soon

become overwhelmed even as even as the

market shifts from day to day the

coronavirus is slowing our economy to a

near standstill and we're almost

certainly anticipating a recession I

have never sensed a greater sense of

under uncertainty a greater fear of the

future of the unknown we don't know how

long this crisis will last you don't

even know if you've contract contracted

the virus right away or maybe your

spouse maybe your child maybe your

parent the administration didn't pay

attention to tests and now we're paying

the price even though many of us were

hollering for weeks about the emerging

issues with testing well the same

problems about to happen with

ventilators we know that in two weeks

the number of ventilators might become a

massive problem we must get ahead of it

and get ahead of it now I'm calling on

President Trump to use his existing

authority to help address the widespread

shortages of medical equipment

particularly ventilators as a result of

the kovat 19 outbreak

I joined 27 of my colleagues in a letter

to President Trump urging Tim to invoke

the defensive defense production Act of

1950 which authorizes the President to

strengthen domestic manufacturing

capacity and supply in extraordinary

circumstances it's used in times of war

well we must mobilize as if it were a

time of war when it comes to hospitals

beds supplies equipment
