let's take a look at your 2019 fall

forecast I'm meteorologist Anthony Farr

now with a look at the weather for the

next few months from coast to coast to

coast across Canada speaking of the

coast and just off it this is one of the

things we look at when we make these

seasonal forecast sea surface

temperatures where they're well above

normal

well that in the fall tends to favor

these big ridges forming a Bermuda high

as they call it and it's been stronger

than normal for the start of fall over

the last several years and that has led

to this summer weather continuing in

September and even October from the

Great Lakes towards Eastern Canada

something we're looking for this year

meanwhile on the west coast a large area

of above normal temperatures that could

keep it mild right on the coast but once

you get inland the jet stream comes in

here and we do get a trough some cool

and settled conditions for parts of BC

and into Alberta as well so that's

something we're looking at and again in

the fall the pattern is different than

that same setup in the winter so keep

that in mind below normal temperatures

places like Calgary even up towards

Edmonton Vancouver closer to seasonal

meanwhile we're predicting a very mild

start through October really for Eastern

Canada so above normal temperatures

overall but watch out because things

could change in a hurry as we get late

in November and December and we may

erase some of these above normal

conditions that we're expecting for the

next few weeks when it comes to rainfall

the battleground right in between it's

already been quite wet for parts of

Manitoba and Northwest Ontario that is

expected to continue this has been

basically since last winter above normal

every single season and that's going to

continue for the fall so look for quite

a bit of rain and that could eventually

turn to quite a bit of snow later in

November and December meanwhile near

normal for much of the east we are

watching the tropics places like Halifax

already hit by hurricane Dorian last

month well that is going to continue to

be a threat as the active tropics remain

and we have several systems that we're

watching out there so far though no

threat for the east coast of US or

Canada meanwhile out west

because of that warm water around

Vancouver Island we could see above

normal rainfall here through the fall so

a mild start especially in the East it

will turn colder than normal across

Western Canada and wet conditions

continue for Manitoba and also Northwest

Ontario by the way keep this in mind

winter weather it's likely to be

widespread in December and that could

set the stage for what is a cold and

perhaps snowy winter that forecast

coming out in November I'm meteorologist

Anthony far now
