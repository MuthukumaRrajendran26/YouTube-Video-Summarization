see ready this Canadian couple moved

from Montreal to Hong Kong 10 years ago

but lately they've been feeling homesick

worried worried they say about Beijing

tightening its grip on the

semi-autonomous city and those tensions

are boiling over what we are seeing if

the deterioration of just basic rights

that we had enjoyed when we were living

in Canada and then we you know you would

expect to have that same kind of basic

rights in Hong Kong the couple took that

message to the streets adding their

voices to around two million others

protesting a now suspended government

proposal that would have allowed Hong

Kong residents facing charges including

foreigners to be extradited to mainland

China which has a conviction rate of 99%

democracy is us and we are the people

and people Toronto native Ian Chui was

one of a number of Canucks

in the crowd Hong Kong is home to three

hundred thousand Canadians the largest

number in any city outside of Canada and

one of them is leading the charge for

change

really I think this is a very global

issue that we are facing a nice HOH grew

up in Montreal and is now a household

name in Hong Kong

the Cantonese pop music star is also a

prominent activist she recently

addressed the United Nations calling for

China to be removed from the bodies

Human Rights Council and she's now

calling on her home and native land to

stand on guard for Hong Kong there is

not enough pressure from whether it's

the Canadian government or even the

British we are this global community and

if countries came together to deal with

the situation then I think there are

things that can be done this was one of

the largest gatherings in over two

months of protests a strong show of

support for a movement that appeared to

be on the verge of defeat after last

week's protest at the City Airport

turned violent they defied torrential

rain and ominous threats from Beijing

more than a hundred Chinese military

vehicles are now massed along the border

and the top military commander warned

they could be here in ten minutes for

that reason many covered their faces and

refused to talk with reporters the

message is clear those who did speak out

included Canadian Jean Christophe

Clement

worrying his family back home in Canada

I think okay that went too far and for

own security we must leave the country

now but Clement is unwavering in his

support for his second home and he must

be supported

they must be helped in keeping they need

the life that they've been having up to

now and this city is also breathing a

sigh of relief after this day ended

peacefully many were desperately hoping

to avoid a repeat of the violence that

we saw last week and in the end this

protest was both peaceful and
