good morning everyone good morning

Vancouver thank you so much for joining

me here this morning tomorrow Canadians

will finally get to have their say on

Justin Trudeau's last four years as

Prime Minister of Canada

Dimmie Leigh Kennedy and put all all

faith saponin see today Dania Catherine

do you think it'll come Kamiya Minister

for years during which Canadians have

fallen further and further behind with

the cost of living rising and Justin

Trudeau only making things worse

I am extremely proud of the campaign

conservatives have run over the last 39

days it's been a campaign of hope and a

message of brighter days ahead with a

new Conservative government that will

live within its means and put more money

in your pocket so you can get ahead

conservatives like David KB here in

Vancouver Centre have spread that

message far and wide with lots of hard

work and optimism for the future because

that's what this campaign is all about

who do you trust to make your life more

affordable who do you trust to lower

your taxes so you have more money left

at the end of the month and who do you

trust to treat your hard-earned tax

dollars with respect and after 39 days

on the campaign trail the answer to

those questions is clear it is certainly

not Justin Trudeau Trudeau has already

forced the carbon tax on Canadians a

carbon tax that does nothing to lower

emissions as the provincial carbon tax

here in BC has proven but it only makes

everyday essentials like gasoline

groceries and home heating more

expensive and a carbon tax that will

have to go up if he's re-elected now in

the dying days of this campaign Trudeau

is again leaving the door open to a

coalition government with the NDP

dealing away your hard-earned tax

dollars to the NDP and closed-door

negotiations so he can remain as Prime

Minister now with polls opening in just

a matter of hours let me be blunt a

Trudeau led government with the NDP

calling the shots would be the worst

possible outcome for Canadians it would

be the coalition that Canadians cannot

afford because we can only imagine what

the NDP's price would be to keep Justin

Trudeau in power whatever it is we know

Trudeau would pay it

you would pay any price to stay in power

and he'd use your money to do it it's

the costly coalition the Canadians

cannot afford not now not at a time when

everything is already getting more

expensive and when so many Canadians are

barely making it to the end of the month

without the money running out now we

already know that a Trudeau NDP

coalition would run a forty billion

dollar deficit in year one don't just

take my word for it that's right out of

their platforms it's right there for all

Canadians to see but I've spent the last

39 days traveling this great country

making the case for conservative

majority government a government with a

plan that will help you get ahead we're

going to scrap the Trudeau carbon tax

which will the the carbon tax which

makes everyday essentials more expensive

like gasoline groceries and home eating

we're going to take the GST off of home

heating costs we're going to introduce

the universal tax cut and bring back tax

credits the Trudeau government cut for

parents who put their children in sports

math language or arts programs we're

going to make maternity benefits

tax-free we're going to increase the

aged credit to help seniors and we will

boost the government matching

contributions to our ESPs

by 50% now to do it I will put an end to

taxpayer handouts to rich corporations

and we'll stop sending foreign aid

dollars to wealthy countries that don't

need it and hostile regimes that don't

deserve it and I've got a plan to hit

the ground running

a 100 a action plan with five steps that

I'll deliver on right away a task force

to crack down on corporate welfare a

fiscal update that will lower your taxes

before the end of the year a meeting

with the premiers to break down trade

barriers and strengthen our country

stiff new penalties for politicians who

break the law ethics laws and the carbon

tax repeal act that we will pass by

January 1st so no Canadian is stuck

paying more during another winter neckla

planned action they saw premier drove a

new perimeter this symmetric law by they

met no havoc sank just racy included

do I pay proofs on playing either

our plan is achievable it's fully costed

and mostly and most importantly we'll

start working on it right away

now compare that to Justin Trudeau

instead of getting down to work instead

of making your life more affordable

Trudeau will have to spend his first 100

days in backroom negotiations with the

NDP auctioning off your money so he can

cling to power so the choice is clear an

NDP government wearing a Justin Trudeau

mass that will raise taxes kill jobs

damage our economy and take more money

out of your pockets and a conservative

majority government that will live

within its means and put more money in

your pockets so you can get ahead the

Jimmy Trivette pour vous pour votre fami

approval on Danny please Damon now I

must address the bloc québécois leader's

speech

sovereigntist speech from last night at

the eleventh hour of this campaign he's

admitted what we've known all along his

first priority after the election is to

work with the Parti québécois towards a

new referendum that means that a vote

for the block is a vote for a referendum

another sign of the divisiveness

that Justin Trudeau has cultivated in

our country turning province against

province region against region that's

not leadership

so join millions of Canadians who are

already voting conservative because

they're voting for a brighter future for

a closer more united country where no

ambition is to bold

where no goal is out of reach and no

project is too big we're Canadians from

every province and territory and first

nation can take part in and contribute

to our shared process

and where the government gets out of

your way so the only thing standing

between you and the life you want is the

desire to make it a reality

so let's turn a page let's turn the page

on a prime minister that lost his way a

long time ago and on a Trudeau NDP

coalition you cannot afford and let's

choose a conservative majority

government let's elect MPs like David KB

and Kathleen Dixon and Vancouver Quadra

and Chris Corsetti in Vancouver east MPs

that will work to lower taxes and put

more money back into your pockets that

will work as part of a conservative team

to make your life more affordable to

reduce your commute times by supporting

projects like the George Massey tunnel

replacement to fight climate change by

lowering global emissions while not

making you pay more to heat your home

and drive to work we have a real plan to

help you get ahead it's a plan that can

work it's a plan that will work but

first we need to elect a strong

conservative majority government and

that's why I'm asking for your vote on

October 21st thank you very much merci

beaucoup

[Applause]

good morning mr. shear Katie Simpson CBC

News you you hinted at this in your

speech but clearly with the polls so

close at this stage in the game it

demonstrates that Canada is a nation

divided whether you win or lose Monday

night what are you personally going to

do to try to ease those divisions well

we're gonna continue to do what we've

always done and that is to promote a

positive campaign full of positive ideas

that will help make life more affordable

for Canyon's help Canadians reach their

goals and live out their dreams and that

is really the choice tomorrow a choice

between an NDP liberal coalition that

will run massive deficits make life less

affordable more expensive leave less

money in your pocket or a Conservative

government that will lower taxes get

back to balanced budgets and help make

life more affordable that is the choice

tomorrow I'm asking Canadians for their

support I Glen McGregor CTV News mr.

chair four years ago voters in Canada

strongly rejected Stephen Harper's style

of governing you've resurrected many of

his ideas in your platform people have

referred to you their critics as Stephen

Harper with dimples wondering in what

meaningful way you are going to govern

differently well when you look at our

platform we have many new and innovative

policies that help lower the cost of

living and put more money in the pockets

of Canadians I have my own style I have

my own approach and the choice tomorrow

now is a choice between a government

that I would lead focus on making life

more affordable focused on leaving more

money in the pockets of Canadians and an

NDP liberal coalition that we cannot

afford that will run massive deficits

raise taxes to pay for it that is the

choice tomorrow and I believe that

Canadians will choose a party that is

focused on them focused on helping them

live out their dreams and their

aspirations and reach their goal instead

of an NDP liberal coalition that will

run massive deficits make life less

affordable and raise taxes mr. Schurr

Michael cooter with global national last

night at your rallies supporters started

chanting lock him up in reference to

Justin Trudeau that phrase is a very

negative connotation how did it make you

feel to hear that well last night there

were a couple of individuals who started

a chant that was quickly turned into a

vote amout chant

which is the option tomorrow the option

that Canadians have tomorrow's to vote

out a failed Liberal government that has

raised taxes made life more expensive

made it harder for Canadians to reach

their goals

I've run of extremely positive campaign

and I am confident that Canadians

tomorrow will choose our party choose

our platform that is focused entirely on

making life more affordable by leaving

more money in their pockets so that

Canadians can reach their goals and

aspirations sushiro as soon as we can

end up and Donna fell essentially our

lives that we played upon up to Josh

fellow maximum generous a certain show

year a nadie como tear soul a contract

he exists in exists apart yeah I've

called on Justin Trudeau to do the right

thing and lift cabinet confidence so

that the RCMP can get to the bottom of

the SNC level and scandal that's

something that he should have done long

ago he shut down parliamentary increase

yeah he's refused to let Joe D Wilson

speak fully as to this whole scandal and

he should do the right thing and lift

that now tomorrow Canadians have a

choice

that they can choose to elect a NDP

liberal coalition that will keep these

types of things hidden in addition to

running massive deficits and raising

taxes to pay for it or they can choose a

Conservative government that would

restore ethics and accountability lower

taxes and make life more affordable for

Canyon's a good morning Christie kerkoff

with The Globe and Mail you just

referenced the S&C labelling controversy

as well as Jody Wilson Reybold today you

are going to be campaigning against her

in her

so why are you doing that when you have

spent months talking about what she's

done on a personal level and

professional level during this

controversy let me say that I have an

enormous amount of respect for Jodi

Wilson Raible I think she showed real

courage and clearly she was the only one

her and mr. Philpott were the only ones

willing within the Liberal caucus to

stand up to Justin Trudeau's corruption

that being said of course I'm supporting

conservative candidates all across the

country because only a Conservative

government a can lower taxes returns

about balanced budgets and leave more

money in the pockets of kadian why

campaign against hers we're my campaign

in support of all our candidates all

across the country we we want Canadians

to send conservative MPs Ottawa so we

can start the work to undo the damage

that Justin Trudeau has caused to return

to balance budgets lower taxes and help

Katie avoid me the mainsail of race on -

Jeff equilibrant Olivia Bible olive oil

diffuser today lecture mr. siddheshwar

me so we'll see what the results of

tomorrow's elections are but right now

we see the crystal clear choice is

between a liberal NDP coalition that

will run massive deficits and will have

to raise taxes to pay for it they will

have to raise taxes enormous ly we know

that just to pay for some of their

provinces they would have to raise the

GST

two points at least they'd have to raise

personal income taxes it's up to Justin

Trudeau to explain which taxes he would

raise to pay for this coalition that's

one choice the other choice is a

Conservative government that will return

to balanced budgets

lower taxes all along the way and help

make life more affordable we also see

now that the priority for the block as

we've been saying Monsieur Blanchette

has finally admitted it his priority is

sort towards another referendum if

Quebecers want lower taxes and a

government that addresses the needs of

Quebec the only choice is to vote

conservative tomorrow good morning mr.

chair Stephanie levites from The

Canadian Press almost every single day

on this campaign you've willingly come

before the media to take

question after question and we just like

to know should you be elected prime

minister Monday can Canadians count on

you continuing to follow that practice

and all your cabinet ministers to speak

freely to the press as well well as you

rightly point out we have had a very

open and transparent campaign

being held accountable to Canadians

through the media that will of course be

the spirit of openness and transparency

that I will continue on with as

government we are cyclic openness

accompanying a news MOU in the

transparency a Leo Canadian Parliament a

hundred occasionally survivalists plead

in utter a google mo up their domain

good morning mr. schirra yesterday an

image that cbc news no matter what

happens tomorrow i'm wondering if you

can tell us what you hope your legacy is

from this campaign with Canadians and if

you can reflect also what you think your

best moment has been and what you regret

the most well that's obviously a more

focus about what our government will be

able to achieve more so than the

campaign itself the whole the campaign

is about making the case to Canadians

about how our party will lower taxes

return to balanced budgets and help them

get ahead that is something that we will

work that will be the driving force of

our government and we've run a great

campaign it's been a positive campaign

showing Canadians what our government

will do to help make their lives better

the campaign has been full of amazing

moments that that have been a lot of fun

for the entire team I'm sure for many of

you who have been long for the ride as

well but as we enter into this this

final day of the campaign the choice is

crystal clear there's still time for

Canadians to analyze the platform to

look at the options and the option

tomorrow is between a liberal and NDP

coalition that will run massive deficits

raise taxes make life more expensive or

a Conservative government that will

leave more money in your pockets get

back to balanced budgets and make life

more affordable there were warnings from

official sources intelligence agencies

about foreign influence especially from

China and there has been evidence of

people associated with the government of

China with business relationships or at

least sympathies towards the governor

China involved in the campaigns of

Justice Alito the liberal in Richmond

and Mary Inge in the Toronto area first

of all I wonder if the Conservatives

have done any due diligence to make sure

if your campaigns aren't infiltrated

were influenced unduly by people who

were loyal to China and also your

thoughts on these campaigns and what you

might do as Prime Minister to protect

Canada from this foreign meddling well

it's a very important issue we all need

to be very vigilant that Canadians get

to decide who gets to govern this

country and that there is not outside

influence we were very disappointed that

the Liberal government did not take this

seriously

during the study of their bill for for

electoral reform we raised the alarm

about how there's still the possibility

of foreign funds coming into Canada

through advocacy groups that have a

presence in multiple countries that's

something that we highlighted that they

did not take adequate steps to address

this would be something that we'll

continue to monitor

we have appreciated the fact that our

intelligence agencies have shared

information during this campaign but

we've always taken great steps

everything within our control that we

can take we have taken to ensure that

Canadians get to make the decision

tomorrow and Canadians alone and that

choice tomorrow is between an NDP

liberal coalition coalition that

Canadians cannot afford that will drive

up the cost of everything that will

raise taxes and run massive deficits or

a Conservative government that will get

back to balanced budgets

lower taxes and make life more

affordable that is the choice last night

I'll just very quickly did it make you

feel uncomfortable to hear that chant as

soon as I heard that chant I heard

people that she the crowd quickly turned

to vote him out and that is the choice

of course you heard of course it's of

course we we believe in civility and

proper decorum and treating people with

respect and that is why the choice

tomorrow is to vote him out that is what

Canadians have the possibility to do and

that is what I am asking them to do and

vote in a Conservative government that

would get back to balance budgets lower

taxes all along the way and make life

more affordable

thanks very much recently

[Applause]
