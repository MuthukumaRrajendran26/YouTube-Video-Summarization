the NRA and he beat them Joe Biden

helped Barack Obama save the American

auto industry and the most important

reason of all Joe Biden will defeat

Donald Trump

[Applause]

now real quick let me give you one more

really important reason I have the

privilege of serving as the chair of the

Texas House Democratic caucus and thanks

to some amazing gains in 2018

we find ourselves now only nine seats

away from having a democratic that's

right only only nine what that means is

that's only nine seats from putting

Texas kids first in providing real

funding for our public schools that's

only nine seats from passing Medicaid

expansion and funding and past giving

healthcare to more than a million Texans

just like that nine seats from real

property tax relief for homeowners and

we're nine seats away from closing the

background check loophole in the state

of Texas now we've got some great

candidates running here in Dallas Fort

Worth and all across Texas that are

going to help us win those nine seats

but do you know who else we need to help

us win those nine seats we need you we

need you

that's right that's right

we need Joe with Joe Biden leading our

ticket we will win races up and down the

ballot and most importantly we restore

honesty integrity and decency to the

White House that's why for Joe that's

why you're for Joe welcome it's great to

be with you so proud to be right here in

North Texas the epicenter of political

change of the nation you all delivered

historic results in 2018 how many of you

were part of that and it's about to

happen again because the whole nation is

watching to see what Texas does and

Texas is about to do something big why

did we do it last time how do we pull it

off because the this state got pulled in

the wrong direction and now it's

happening on a national level I want to

share with you a little line of a poem

one of my favorite poets it was black

history last month

Black History Month Langston Hughes

great American poet from that Harlem

Renaissance just a little piece of his

poem he said it's a children's poem and

he said when Washington crossed the

Delaware the pillars of tyranny shook he

started the list of democracy that's

America's telephone book well we all

know that after Washington crossed abyss

to those pillars eternity didn't just

crumble they fell but in the last

several years as Donald Trump in his

administration and right ring politics

in the state and throughout the nation

have crumbled our institutions have

eroded our faith in democracy they've

started rebuilding the pillars of

tyranny and it's time for them to come

down again and for us to rebuild it all

now

[Applause]

it is going to take every single one of

us whether you're african-american

Hispanic Asian Anglo every single one of

us working together wherever you are on

that political spectrum we can do it and

there is one person in this country

right now who can pull this all together

and that's the guy the nation needs so

Biden to a Biden needs us let's put him

in office

Wilson of Greater Cornerstone Baptist

Church

able to serve you in Congress it's been

the honor of my life as many of y'all

things and work hard you should be able

to get ahead and in 2018 we did

something special together we did

something special so many folks some of

you in this room came together to help

us flip a district right here in Dallas

from red to blue I knew we were in good

shape I knew we were in good shape when

folks thought they could bring their

families to go block walk when they

promised their kids if you do one more

house Aggie some ice cream that's what I

knew and we were in good shape neighbor

to neighbor text into text and that's

the way we won our race that's the way

we can take back this country and I

don't have to tell y'all how much is

that stake we passed over 275 bipartisan

bills in the house they're not getting a

hearing in the Senate and if they got

through that they wouldn't get signed by

this president we have to have a change

in the White House

all of us are here all of us are here

supporting Joe Biden so we know he's a

good man he's a good man

he's got a deep well of empathy he

understands what people are going

through he suffered in his life and

there's no one better than Joe Biden to

bring our country back together after

this horribly divisive three years we've

been through but the first thing we got

to do the first thing we got to do is

make sure that Joe Biden wins Texas

tomorrow now I know there was a lot of

good candidates in the field I

understand it was tough sometimes for

people to make their mind up but now we

know who we're coming together behind

and Raphael and Chia to the state

legislature next year in the majority we

need to make sure that we grow our

majority in the US House of

Representatives we need to make sure

that we take the majority back in the US

precinct at a time one County at a time

get Joe Biden to 270 electoral votes

that he needs to be the next president

of the United States of America and we

can only do it with your help so make

sure that from this point on that you're

putting all your energy into everything

of our great nation and return some

respect and dignity back to the White

House and now I'm going to introduce to

you the Dean of our delegation from the

great city of Dallas Eddie Bernice

Johnson

[Applause]

[Applause]

hello everyone you look like America

America deserves a great president

someone that we could be proud of

someone we could respect someone who

knows what we want and someone who

stands for all of us

they say news as of tonight has to be

carried through tomorrow and on to

November have you already voted tell

everybody else to go to my heart because

that's the last day

we need this president we need to

destroy it to restore the dignity to the

White House we need someone who respects

working people as a matter of fact he's

a man who's worked all of his adult life

in public service and so so many

candidates had a lot of money to give

out but he only had what we gave him

because we worked just like he has

worked so even though he might not have

the most money he has the most caring

spirit yes history show

he has shown through his work and I've

known him since 1988 I have watched him

I've worked with him I've know him and I

know he stands for what I stand for he

stands for all Americans and he can't do

this without us so we must live here and

carry this enthusiasm with us and make

sure that he is elected in November but

we first got to make sure he gets the

delegates for the nomination and it ends

tomorrow at 7:00 p.m. all of you who got

voted you've got to do it tomorrow

tell everyone that's over 18 that's

registered that they owe it to the

nation to catch that vote

this is a man who work with us to get

that right to vote and to keep it he's

far America just like we are so we need

to make sure we always put someone in

the White House who is for America not

using America

[Applause]

it takes only one boat but each one of

you but it takes every one of you don't

forget to tell all of your neighbors and

all of your friends wherever they live

that Biden is the man of the day

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

how great is it to be here in Dallas

Texas and how great it is to be here

with my family John and Abigail and with

Vice President Biden how wonderful it is

to be standing next to him on a stage

when it isn't the debate stage so I

actually as you all know announced my

campaign for president in the middle of

a Minnesota blizzard just so I could

impress everyone in Texas and in

particular everyone in Dallas so we

didn't let the snow stop us we didn't

let the cold stop us we did continue

through that speech because that's what

we do in the heartland we made a little

in this campaign in my campaign go a

long way and our homegrown campaign with

a tremendous staff that stuck together

from the beginning and volunteers every

way beat the odds and that got me up

here right now on this stage

[Applause]

[Music]

and the most amazing thing was getting

to know so many people across the

country and I know the vice president

knows this as well the the Vietnam vet

who sobbed as he talked about losing his

son to mental illness the rancher who

had voted for Donald Trump but after he

saw him give a speech in front of that

sacred wall with the CIA stars of those

that lost their lives in the line of

duty decided he wasn't going to do it

again the immigrant mom the immigrant

mom who told me she works two jobs all

for her kids and through it all I said

to them and I believe this now standing

with the vice-president if you feel

tired of the noise and the nonsense and

our politics and if you are tired of the

extremes you have a home with me and I

think you know you have a home with Joe

Biden

[Applause]

so many so many people joined us

supported us as we carried forward with

this simple but fundamental message and

that it is time for Americans to join

hands instead of pointing fingers it is

time it is time to turn back the

division and the hate and the exclusion

and the bitterness and it is time to

work together to lift up those who are

left out and to bring people with us

instead of shoving them away I believe

and it's the reason I'm up here that we

are never going to out divide the

divider in chief we must as Americans

dream bigger than that we have to be

better than that because if we spend the

next four months dividing our party and

going at each other we will spend the

next four years watching Donald Trump

tear apart this

[Applause]

we need we need Texans we need to unite

our party and our country and to do it

not just with our words but with our

actions it is up to us all of us to put

our country back together to heal this

country and then to build something even

greater I believe we can do this

together and that is why today I am

ending my campaign and endorsing Joe

Biden

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Applause]

okay I have a I have a few other things

to say Joe Biden has dedicated his life

to fighting for people not for the rich

and the powerful but for the mom for the

farmer for the dreamer for the Builder

for the veteran he can bring our country

together and build that coalition of our

fired up Democratic base as well as

independence and moderate Republicans

because we do not in our party want to

just eat by a victory we want to win big

and Joe Biden

[Applause]

as you know from all the work he has

done that he will not just govern with

his hat and he's got a lot of good ideas

but he will also govern with his heart I

know that you know here in this big

state of Texas that the heart of this

country is bigger than the heart of the

guy in the white house it is time it is

time America for a president that

understands that service is not about

self-interest it is about sacrifice it

is time for a president that represents

all of America including people in the

middle of this country at a time when we

see people in extremes that are trying

to drown out people and most of all it

is time and this is what I feel so

strongly about it is time for a

president that will bring decency and

dignity back to the white

[Applause]

at one of the debates of our many

debates I told the stories you would I

told I told the story of Franklin Delano

Roosevelt that beloved president and

when he died they put his body on a

train that went from Georgia to

Washington DC and the story is that

people spontaneously stood along those

train tracks to show their respect and a

reporter came upon a guy regular guy he

just had his hat in his hand and he was

sobbing and the reporter said to him sir

do you mind me asking did you know

President Roosevelt and the guy says no

I didn't know the president but he knew

me and that is exactly what is missing

right now in the White House we have a

president that has no empathy that

cannot put himself in the shoes of the

people of this country well guess who

can do that

[Applause]

[Music]

if you if you out there are trying to

figure out how you stretch your paycheck

to pay for your rent or your mortgage or

someone in your family is you know Joe

knows you and he will fight for you yeah

you are someone trying to decide how do

you pay for the long-term care for your

parents and the child care or the

college for your kids Joe knows you and

he will fight for you and if you are

trying to figure out how am I going to

fill that prescription for insulin or

some other prescription drug or fill my

refrigerator

Joe knows you and he will fight for you

so I cannot think of a better way to end

my campaign than joining his because

[Applause]

[Music]

because America you gave an opportunity

to the granddaughter of an iron ore

miner to the daughter of a teacher and a

newspaperman you gave me Minnesota the

opportunity to be the first woman

elected to the US Senate from the state

of Minnesota and America you gave me

this incredible year to be a candidate

for president of the United States

[Applause]

because you have faith in what we can

achieve together it is because of your

undying belief that for all of us the

best is yet to come

so before I turn it over to our next

president I want to remind you of

something really practical tomorrow

tomorrow is Super Tuesday tomorrow is

Super Tuesday and Texas you are one big

Super Tuesday state there are 14 Super

Tuesday States including my home state

of Minnesota so what I want all of you

to do is vote for Joe vote for decency

vote for dignity vote for a heart for

our country that is what he will bring

to the White House and with that I give

you the next president of the United

States

[Applause]

[Applause]

thank you thank you thank you for hello

Dallas

[Applause]

as my mom would say I apologize for my

back but you had my back and I promise

I'll have you

[Applause]

folks Amy thank you thank you thank you

you know I want to make clear something

I can't tell you how much

Amy's endorsement the Senators

endorsement means to me it's it's great

to see her family to see John and her

brilliant daughter Abigail who was with

her and and from the moment

Amy ghovat are announced for president

in that snowstorm

it wasn't hard to see she had the grit

and determination to do anything she

said her mind do you know Amy knows how

to get things done

she really does that's why amy has never

lost and she's not Lucy now you're gonna

hear a lot from Amy Klobuchar fun

[Applause]

[Music]

that's why she's one of the most

effective senators the United States

Senate her campaign was all about what

we could get done how to make America

better every day in simple

straightforward ways folks the story

that Amy tells about that person who

Franklin Roosevelt as a train went by

you wanted that she talked about she

believes and that notion that you know

he didn't know I didn't know the

president but he knew me well let me

tell you something it's it's everything

that Amy's about nobody who's ever dealt

with her doesn't think that she knows

them and you know what isn't that

everything that's missing with this

president today you know Amy spoke is

something that I've made central in my

campaign for president as well to

compete and complete the total lack of

empathy and decency in this current

president he cannot stay there he cannot

stay we all know it there is no

of decency honor the way he ridicules

people the way he demeans people who he

talks about and demonizes people who are

different the fact that he's so

self-absorbed he doesn't seem to care

about anything anything else in this

country folks I mean I I know I believe

that he wasn't going to be a very good

president but I have to admit to you

with Donald Trump I didn't have any idea

just how much it was gonna be always

about Donald Trump you know and it's

having a corrosive impact it's having a

corrosive impact on our children folks

were already seen reports of children in

school mimicking the behavior of the

president a large piece in The

Washington Post talked about the the way

in which teachers are finding kids are

bullying other kids and quoting the

president using the president's language

singling out immigrants for ridicule and

harassment

what in God's name did we expect what we

think was going to happen when this

behavior became so clear when teachers

try to deal with this kind of behavior

is that any surprise that the kids would

say well that's what the president does

apparently the Washington Post article

laid out a school and talked about them

saying to the teachers that's what the

president does you know our children are

listening they're listening that's

having a profound impact a pround impact

on our society I've said many times in

this campaign this nation will be able

to overcome four years of Donald Trump

but if this man is reelected he will

fundamentally alter who we are as a

nation for better than a generation to

come and we can not let that happen

[Applause]

so Amy thank you thank you for being

here tonight thank you for your

friendship and thank you for support you

know I want to also thank you for the

voice you're gonna supply in this race

thank you for your endorsement I'm truly

honored to have it and folks I wasn't

joking

amy won all the debates and I'm sure

glad I wasn't on stage debating you

again Amy folks you know just a few days

ago the press and the pundits declared

this campaign dead but South Carolina

had something to say about it tomorrow

Texas and Minnesota and the rest of

Super Tuesday states we're gonna have a

lot to say about it

and when you do we'll be on our way to

defeating Donald Trump in a second term

and my message to everyone every person

who's been knocked down counted out left

behind this is your campaign we need you

we want you and there's a place of this

campaign for you so join us go to Joe

Biden dot-com sign up volunteer

contribute again we need you and we are

going to do this look the decision is

the Democratic Party will make all

across this country tomorrow and

Democratic voters in the next few weeks

to determine what this party stands for

what we believe and what we were able to

get done if Democrats want a nominee to

beat Donald Trump keep Nancy Pelosi

Speaker of the House making sure we take

back the United States Senate

and the Texas State Legislature then

join us the Democrats want to name a

nominee he will build on Obamacare not

scrap it take on the NRA and the gun

manufacturers protect our children well

stand up for the middle class not raise

their taxes and make promises that can't

be kept then join us the Democrats wanna

nominee who's a Democrat a lifelong

Democrat a proud Democrat an obama/biden

Democrat then join us we can either win

big or lose big this that's a choice we

need to build a coalition on a legacy of

one of the most successful presidents of

our lifetime Barack Obama and we'll do

this by bringing the country together

that's what is united a me me all along

the idea we have to unite this country

remember how we were both made fun of by

our opposition saying we're going to

unite the country say it can't be done

we refuse to accept the notion that

there'll be a constant war that

Republicans are our enemies their

opposition look folks

this time we got to bring around

everybody every race ethnicity gender

disabilities our economic situation

Democrats Republicans independents of

every stripe and that's why I'm so

excited about Amy's endorsement of our

campaign she says that view and mayor

Pete was endorsed to our campaign

earlier thank him as well

and all we now have over 1500

endorsements including 36 congressmen

mayors elected officials are joining the

campaign just the last two days though

most Americans don't want the promise of

a revolution they want results they want

a revival of decency honor and character

they want to give all Americans access

to real opportunity to have affordable

available health care for all Americans

an environment that's clean air and

clean water an education system that

funds our schools pays our teachers a

decent wage makes Community College

treaties with the overwhelming

overwhelming burden of student debt

folks we can do this and pay for it the

nation where we stand up and beat the

nra and reform the criminal justice

system and mobilize the world against

climate change the whole world a nation

where we live our values embrace

immigrants and refugees asylum seekers

not slam the door in the face of those

flee persecution violence and a

president that's what's made America

folks folks 24-hour 100 students at

school is Latino it's a non overwhelming

interest that make us better if we

invest look folks a nation that provides

a path to citizenship for 11 million who

are enriching our communities every

single day an economy three words we

words work not just wealth my dad used

to have an expression he's doing jobs

about a lot more than a paycheck

it's about decency about respect it's

about be able to look yourself in the

mirror and know what's going on it's

about be able to look your children I

swear to god this is what he would say

it's about being able to look your child

in the eye and say honey everything's

going to be okay American people aren't

asking for anything other than a chance

an even chance and they're being denied

dad this about your place in the

community

it's about all our families all our

communities look Amy and I look at

everything from the prison there goes

Trump anyway the prison how it affects

you your family your community all our

communities folks it's simple that's why

I'm a Democrat that's why I got involved

in the first place this election isn't a

battle for the soul of the Democratic

Party but it is a battle for the soul of

America and in the most perilous moment

we faced in anyone's lifetime here

winning means u-19 America not sowing

more division and anger it means not

only fighting as president but a

president who will heal the country the

country has to be healed we've got to

beat Donald Trump in the Republican

Party but we but we can't become like

them we can't become like them we've got

to heal the divisions repair our

democracies and I'm absolutely confident

not only Democrats but independents and

Republicans vote errs no we have to heal

this country and once again fight for

the proposition as corny as it sounds

that we hold these truths to be

self-evident that all men and women are

created equal endowed by their creator

with certain inalienable rights folks

that's the uniqueness of America we're

based on an idea

we've never fully lived up to it but

we've never before walked away from it

like this president has I believe with

every fiber of my being

what we've done in every generation is

further open the aperture for a

conclusion in making sure that people

have a shot look I want to recognize

three people who have dedicated their

careers to fighting for more perfect

union call on our he flipped this

district

helped take back the house in 2016 he

did what I only dreamed to doing playing

in the NFL what a hell of an athlete

what a great great congressman and we

need to make sure that he holds that

seat November and Marc Veasey God love

him he's done incredible work help help

lead the fight against the erosion of

Voting Rights Act against the erosion of

voting in this nation half the country

half the nations in this half the states

in this nation have put up barriers it's

the new Jim Crow all over again and

Eddie Bernice Johnson is a legend I'm

honored to share this stage she's a

woman who knows how to get things done

for the people of Dallas and she leaves

nobody behind look the days of Donald

Trump's divisiveness will soon be over I

guarantee you we can build a more

perfect union because the American

people have now seen the alternative

folks there's two way people get

inspired they get inspired by great

leaders like Lincoln and Roosevelt and

Kennedy and Obama well thank you but but

they also get inspired by very bad

leaders no I really mean it

I really mean it this president has sort

of ripped the band-aid off exposed just

how venal he's become and how he has

literally literally strangled a life out

of the Republican Party so folks we got

a shot this is bigger than whether a

Democrat wins this is about restoring

the character of America not a joke

because we've been damaged all over the

world

we've been damaged badly his embrace of

thugs and dictators his way he treats

our military and talks about them the

way he demeans people ladies and

gentlemen at home he's never done

anything other than other than seek

division so folks it's time to get back

out we're decent we're brave were

resilient people believing it are better

than this moment we are better than this

president and so get up let's take back

this country for the United States of

America and there's not a single thing

we cannot do what we do it together

god bless you all and may God protect

our troops

folks thank you I gotta wait one more

minute folks

there's one more person I want to thank

a man who electrified this state nation

one of those incredible runs of the

United States Senate we have ever seen

here in this state

a man who demonstrated an enormous

compassion and courage in the wake of

the shooting in El Paso a man with

unlimited future a million will be

changing this nation for the better for

many years to come

and let me tell you why we need somebody

who can beat Donald Trump the man in the

White House today poses an existential

threat to this country to our democracy

to free and fair elections and we need

somebody who can beat him and in Joe

Biden we have that man we have someone

who in fact is the antithesis of Donald

Trump Joe Biden is decent he's kind he's

caring he's empathetic I don't know if

you saw this last week the Vice

President was at a town hall in South

Carolina and dr. Reverend Anthony

Thompson came up to the microphone and

talked about losing his wife at mother

Emanuel AME in South Carolina in 2015

and Joe Biden listened to him in fact

with his eyes closed so that he could

concentrate on every single word that

that man said and then he spoke back to

him and to all of us from his heart

filled with compassion and love and the

power to heal he wanted to heal that man

he wanted to hear heal Charleston South

Carolina but as someone who lives in El

Paso Texas which saw another white

nationalist rampage where 22 people were

killed solely based on their ethnicity

on the color of their skin on their

country of national origin

I felt Joe Biden healing us at a time

that this country is so polarized so

deeply divided we need somebody who can

bring us together and heal us we need

somebody who can reestablish the moral

authority of the United States we need

somebody who will fight for democracy

here and abroad because

amok recei is under attack here and

abroad we need Joe Biden
