there has never been a greater need for

a whole range of medical supplies all

around the world like there is right now

hand sanitizers gloves masks face

shields and other protective equipment

not to mention ventilators many large

Canadian companies are switching their

production lines to help and as Mike

Armstrong reports smaller companies for

stepping up to this is a brand new

production line being built from scratch

to make a product this company doesn't

sell we have no intention to make this

as a business

Yves done sir how's the president of ad

fast it makes construction products like

sealants and paints usually the goal is

to be up and running producing hand

sanitizer by next week and they're not

talking about small batches well we have

a capacity of approximately 32,000

litres a day dr. Haas says he'll sell

his new product at only the cost of the

ingredients the companies paying to the

labor he's even willing to share the

design of the production line in case

other companies want to jump on board

online available pictures writing

everything the critical shortage of

medical supplies could cost lives more

ventilators are needed for patients

while protective gear is desperately

needed for the health care workers

treating those patients well some

companies are stepping up the right

thing you know aquas Anna if shifting

production at his Quebec Factory instead

of making jeans he's now buying fabric

to manufacture hospital scrubs

Canada Goose is shifting some production

to making gowns and scrubs and Labatt

after brewing beer for 170 years is now

also producing hand sanitizer this plant

north of Montreal has a new product

Bauer hockey says it's now making face

shields for health care workers that in

this crisis everyone's on the same team

well they have teammates a group of 3d

printers in southern Ontario says it's

producing shields to help until big

manufacturers can ramp up what we're

saying it's about time to get back now

dozer is appealing to other companies to

step forward calling on anyone who can

pitch in to

a common enemy my carbs from global news

Montreal we know you're tired and

stressed and that practically everything

in your life has changed in a matter of

weeks that includes millions of people

who are now working from home so we want

to end tonight with a lighter look at

the perils and unpredictability of

working from home here's Mike Jolie it's

official the so called Cove annual

generation is driving us insane this

dad's face screams isolation and if it's

not kids

it's our pets maybe it's the quarantine

talking but I think cats are up to

something

they're always there pawing at something

or sitting in a devious way it's

different with dogs and all their tail

wag isolation has taught us a lot about

ourselves and the tighty-whitey

underwear choice of our colleague

spouses we've also learned about

technology like turning off cameras

sometimes the hard way and my producer

Catherine learned the art of video

bombing from her roommate it's a lesson

he could have learned from this man who

rose to fame because of his kids and who

now is seemingly given up trying to keep

them out of his office perhaps he knows

there's no refuge hey I found you yeah

sure did working from home will either

drive us batty or get us to laugh at

silly

[Music]

like rappers party be jumping through

Jenga we're really Wilson trying to rap

celebrities microlight Global News
