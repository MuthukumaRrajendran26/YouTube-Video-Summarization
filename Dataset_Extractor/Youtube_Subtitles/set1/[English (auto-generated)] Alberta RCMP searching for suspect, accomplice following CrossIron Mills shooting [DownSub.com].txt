I can now take questions

there is yes at this time they're not

being released we will determine that in

time we know that the suspect shooter

fled in a 2019 Dodge Ram four-door

pickup we believe so yes

the victim is currently in hospital with

severe serious but non threatening

injuries

non-life-threatening injuries I cannot

discuss that at this dinner I can't

discuss that at this time we believe

that there was two persons in the black

four-door pickup including the suspect

no one else was injured in this event

happening in such a public place in such

a busy time is concerning it's

concerning to the public but we were

able to attend the scene within minutes

and secure the scene and provide for

victims there for the patrons and

employees safety

[Music]

we can't I can't discuss that at this

time

[Music]

moving forward there is another reason

what so I are our detachment and all of

our resources are solely solely focused

on the safety of patrons I can't comment

on what individual businesses there are

or are not doing that's not our role our

role is the safety of the public which

we enacted last night there may be

photos of the suspect that might be

released we're still going through video

surveillance at this time we were just

looking into that and I don't have that

number for at this time but I will

provide that to you in within Regina

will provide that to you within the hour

the mall was fully cleared at zero zero

fifty hours just just short of one

o'clock this morning I can so thirty

RCMP a uniform respond approximately

thirty attended the scene but there was

also a significant response from Calgary

Police Service and that was the uniform

response we also had plainclothes

approximately twenty plainclothes

resources as well as the city of Airdrie

provided some municipal employee support

here at the detachment for all of the

things we needed at the attachment and

Calgary Major Crimes and Calgary GIS

were also called out

can you speak how many witnesses you

talk to I can tell you that it was it's

been many and we're still talking to

witnesses as you can understand it was

just after seven o'clock in the evening

there was a lot of patrons at the mall

and there's a lot of people to speak to

and there's a lot of people that we

haven't yet spoken to that may have fled

the scene that might have information

and we would absolutely be looking to

speak to those individuals I can't

discuss the circumstances of the

investigation at this time I can't

disclose that it at this time so we need

to go through the video surveillance we

need to access those what victims or

witnesses that may have observed things

and simply fled the scene so our next

steps are really to do those initial

investigational tasks last night was

focused on the safety of our the patrons

and employees at the mall and today and

in the investigation but really that our

primary focus was the safety of our

citizens I can't discuss all right I can

Matt's about that this time

you have a partial license plate or any

other noises not at this time

was the vehicle stolen I can't die I

have no idea

[Music]

there been any

I can tell you on our response to the

the incident as you can understand this

was a rather chaotic incident that came

in to us there were numerous descriptors

of vehicles that were fleeing the scene

in an erratic way we did stop a number

of them and they were the the vehicles

we stopped were all citizens leaving the

scene I believe they were leaving in a

southbound direction out of the mall

[Music]

how hard was it to empty a parking lot

the senseability traffic times during

the decline they kind of back we've done

people just not we did not evacuate the

parking lot at that time our focus was

evacuating personnel people within the

mall safely that evacuation of the

parking lot didn't happen till much

later we actually held the parking lot

as it was a scene right I can't discuss

the circumstances of video surveillance

but as you're all aware there's video

surveillance everywhere and in fact I

anticipate that there's a there's going

to be video surveillance from people's

cell phones that type of thing

and so we are looking for additional

video surveillance if somebody took

images that from their cell phone we

would certainly be interested in that

please

it's everything thank you very much

nothing in French

you

well everyone that deals with trauma in

a different way and so everyone's

response is going to be very unique to

their own some people might experience

changes in sleeping patterns changing in

eating shakiness any of those types of

physical or emotional symptoms so it's

just important to connect with supports

throughout the community and connect

with family and friends and really

discuss the the feelings that you're

having and if then things tend to

persist more than a couple of days and

certainly reach out for professional

assistance
