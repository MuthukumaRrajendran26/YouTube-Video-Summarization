yeah

you

you

in one term and admits that liberals

foresee deficits and higher debt every

year forever that's right

far from their original promise of

balancing the budget this year Trudeau

now says Canada will literally go on

adding debt every year forever now the

56 billion dollars in new promises that

he makes do not even include the extra

15 billion dollars in annual costs for

his promised pharmacare plan a number

that I take from his own liberal

pharmacare czar

this is Justin Trudeau's credit card

campaign he's putting 56 billion dollars

of new promises on the national credit

card before the election and then

sending working-class taxpayers the bill

after the election when he no longer

needs their votes but still needs their

money this is right at a Kathleen

Wynne's playbook we all remember her old

trick where she would promise the world

before an election and then lie about

her plans to raise taxes after the

election what will happen if Trudeau is

reelected a 31:31 sent a leader gas tax

thousands of dollars in new no new taxes

for home heating higher grocery bills

higher income taxes and maybe they'll

actually implement that policy proposal

which Trudeau's top housing adviser put

in writing and called a proposal to tax

the increased value of Canadians homes

in fact the platform promises vaguely

promises unspecified tax increases of an

annual amount of three billion dollars a

year what will those be remember the

last time he did this he said parents

were too rich so they needed to lose

their children's fitness tax

students were too rich so they needed to

lose tax credits for education and

textbooks bus passengers were too rich

and they needed to lose their transit

tax credits so watch other tax breaks

for working-class people and seniors

would he take today would he take away

to raise that three billion dollars of

revenue would he end the exemption on

gap capital gains tax for the rise in

people's home values would he increase

gas taxes even more than he's already

admitted would he hike the GST he won't

say so Canadians are left guessing

Trudeau will Institute massive new tax

increases to fund this irresponsible and

costly platform he expects Canadians to

believe that money falls out of the sky

or grows on trees but we know it only

comes from one place out of the pockets

of the hard-working people who get up

every day and put in a hard day's work

he is trust Justin Trudeau is coming for

their money merci beaucoup de tribunal

home heat only the Conservatives have a

to let you get ahead thank you very much

I about your questions I mean sir Polly

Ava not surprisingly you're critical of

this but we've seen an independent

analysis done by the Institute for

Fiscal Studies and democracy at the

University of Ottawa's to hear Khan and

Kevin page people who know government

spending quite well and they've said the

Liberals plan the deficits are modest

and this spending is sustainable how do

you respond to their analysis versus

yours

well Trudeau had all the same kinds of

tricks up his sleeve last time when he

promised a balanced budget in 2019 and

yet here we are with a deficit over

twenty billion dollars a year and that's

after raising taxes on the average

Canadian family by about $800 we know

that you cannot spend fifty six billion

dollars and expect that no one will have

to pay for it money is real it doesn't

grow on trees and if Trudeau is

re-elected there will be massive tax

increases to pay for all of this mr.

Polly I've just Ralph Goodale was asked

about this today he justified to

spending saying that times are uncertain

and that the the the spendings needed

for jobs and an investment in the

economy what's your response to that

well last time they promised a balanced

budget in 2019 and here we are 20 19 20

billion dollar deficit they lied before

the last election about their deficits

and they're lying now about their plans

to raise taxes in this campaign

Canadians will pay a massive tax

increase as the price of reelecting

Justin Trudeau everyday ordinary people

at their homes know very well that he

that Justin Trudeau cannot deliver

another 56 billion dollars of spending

without raising taxes to pay for it that

is exactly what will happen and if he

were honest he would admit that now your

party pledged before the election that

you bailed a balanced budget in five

years given what you've promised so far

is that still the target I know you

haven't really got a lot for him

accosting but five years yes you

mentioned camping off the top so today

one of their new announcements was 50

million a year for gangs and gun

strategy but they're spending more on

the camping programs that they announced

so in terms of priorities what do you

make of that choice I think that --mess

whole promised to pay people two

thousand dollars to go camping it's

probably the only policy Justin ever

ever thought

on his own and it illustrates how

ridiculous a leader he is it's not just

$2,000 to pay people to go camping it's

35 billion dollars for a new

infrastructure bank that will bail out

construction companies it is billions

for corporate welfare it is writing off

loans to to the Irving family and free

fridges for Loblaws he is frivolously

spraying money in all directions

uncontrollably and he will stick

Canadians with the bill after the

election right to your question though

it shows that Trudeau's priorities are

backwards that he would spend more

paying people to go camping than he

would keeping our streets safe your

thoughts on your leader over the years

has talked about being a licensed

insurance salesman and it turns out he

did not have a license so is that

misrepresenting his past he is an

accredited he was one while working in

the industry and accredited insurance

broker and we think that we know that

people do work without accreditation in

that field and that's a totally

legitimate way to earn one's license in

the future turned out he was elected to

Parliament before he ultimately earned

the license but he did work as an

accredited insurance representative and

I think that's speaks for itself

there's three promises in this platform

with no costing far mcfar macare flood

insurance and guarantee income for those

who don't qualify for UI can I get your

reaction to that first of all you're

quite right some media have been wrongly

reporting that this is a fully costed

platform this is not a fully costed

platform the biggest item of course is

the pharma care which dr. Hoskins a

former Liberal Minister appointed by

Justin Trudeau to oversee the creation

of a Pharma care plan said would cost a

fifteen billion dollar price tag other

estimates are much higher the

parliamentary budget officers estimates

range from 20 billion in an earlier

report to 30 billion in his recent

costing of the plan of Elizabeth May so

you are quite right

the 56 billion dollars that Justin

Trudeau promised in spending today does

not even include full costing of many of

the other measures that he has not put

numbers to already in other words there

will be a massive sticker shock to

Canadians if they react Trudeau as taxes

will go through the roof to pay for

these unaffordable and in some cases

uncaused it promises

hi mr. Paul II have the the first debate

of the full debate with everyone

participating in the campaign's

happening this week well the

Conservatives have their platform out

before that and if not will we have it

out before the Commission debates next

week we will we will have our platform

out well in time for Canadians to

analyze it it will be a fully it will be

a fully costed platform we are giving

all the measures we have given all the

measures in the platform to the

Parliamentary Budget Officer who has

calculated them that platform will

balance the budget within five years it

will lower taxes for everyone on their

first $47,000 a universal tax cut will

reestablish tax credits for kids sports

and arts transit and other measures it

will lower taxes for small business

people and it will do so with numbers

that add up and protect our balance

sheets so that our social programs and

our taxpayers are secure for generations

to come

but the TV ought to be for example leave

is Wednesday night will it be out prior

to that will will that be there to put

that debate on equal footing of platform

release between the committee will have

it out in due course we will have a

costed complete platform out in due

course that will allow you our opponents

and all Canadians to scrutinize it well

before the election to follow up on the

PBO thing where you said all the

promises are gonna be costed by the ppl

core and the Conservatives so the

Liberals is you know they have said they

were only costing their big-ticket items

and their explanation today was that the

PBO gives parties an allotted amount of

time and they used up all of their PBO

time and so that's why some were profit

costed by the PBO and others like

revenue from trans mountain for instance

has not costed so does that make any

sense to you what's your understanding

the process know with the Parliamentary

Budget Officer had two indicated tests

that he was

prepare to cost all of our proposals so

there's two explanations one Trudeau is

promising so much that not even an army

of economists could possibly find time

to price out all of the costs associated

with those promises or to Trudeau is

covering up the true cost of numerous of

his measures in order to hide from

Canadians his real plan to raise taxes

after the election so you think he might

be sitting on and safer the pharmacare

wonders oh yeah well there's no doubt

the farmer care plan will cost fifteen

billion dollars according to dot liberal

former minister dr. Hoskins and mr.

Trudeau does not put that anywhere I

defy anyone to go through the platform

and find where he is included that 15

billion dollar cost you know the only

way he'll be able to pay for that is

through higher taxes to get raise 15

billion dollars Trudeau would have to

increase the GST by two points he should

come out now and admit that's what he's

going to do rather than hiding it until

after the election okay thank you

you
