visiting us and I want to thank the

Honorable Andrew Shearer conservative

leader - for coming into our community

and making this special announcement and

with that I would introduce the

Honorable Andrew Shearer please come

forward and it's beautiful wife well

good morning everyone it is so great to

be here today with Markham Mayor Frank

scarpetti and Richmond Hill Mayor David

barrel both are great advocates for

their communities their constituents and

issues that matter the most

whatever I'm in the GTA I hear it all

the time people spend way too much

sitting in their cars or stuck on

crowded subway platforms every day here

in Toronto the average time it takes for

you to get from point A at home to point

B at work is about 42 minutes that's

almost an hour and a half every single

day spent in gridlock and an overcrowded

transit away from your family and loved

ones now in 2015 Justin Trudeau was

elected on a promise to get much-needed

commuter infrastructure built he made a

lot of promises in that election

campaign to balance the budget to help

the middle class to be accountable and

ethical

and here we are four years later and

Justin Trudeau has broken almost every

promise he's made to you the budget

isn't balanced taxes have gone up and

he's been found guilty of breaking

ethics laws not once but twice

quite simply Justin Trudeau is not as

advertised on the rare case of a fair

me pastor recreate on day that his most

expensive promise was to spend one

hundred and eighty seven billion dollars

on infrastructure across Canada he said

he would build badly needed projects

right here in Toronto we know Justin

Trudeau will do or say anything to get

elected in four years what does he have

to show for that one hundred and eighty

seven billion dollar promise the

Parliamentary Budget Officer states that

for every dollar Trudeau promised to

spend on infrastructure he's actually

spent sixty cents in other words he's

given you the worst of both worlds

massive deficits with virtually nothing

to show for it

the PBO even revealed that Trudeau's

so-called infrastructure plan doesn't

actually exist

Ontario government asked Trudeau to help

pay for two new subway projects to get

Ontarians moving the Ontario line and

the Yonge subway extension but shooter

refused to commit funding not only he

would he refused to commit funding

setting a lack of a business case now

not only is that comical coming from the

highest spending prime minister in

Canaan history but there happens to be a

business case they just won't look at it

as Prime Minister I will not play

politics when it comes to helping you

get ahead for those of you here in the

GTA

that means a new Conservative government

will work with the provincial government

to get shovels in the ground for these

two critical projects the Yonge subway

extension will extend that line seven

point four kilometres connecting Toronto

to Markham Vaughn and Richmond Hill one

of the fastest growing regions in the

province it will replace the

2,500 bus trips per day that service

this part of Yonge Street helping to

reduce greenhouse gas emissions but we

won't stop there will also help build

and fund the Ontario line and make sure

that that gets built this 15 kilometer

project will connect you with work

friends family and reduce travel times

across Toronto with a critical east-west

and north-south route the Ontario line

will have more frequent trains and 30%

more capacity than the current young

line and getting shovels in the ground

will create thousands of construction

jobs for years providing lasting

benefits for Ontario these are the types

of projects that will deliver a real

relief to everyone who drives and takes

transit in the GTA it's about time you

had a government that gets shovels in

the ground gets projects built and works

for you to get ahead these projects are

part of a new Conservative government's

plan to prioritize infrastructure

projects across Canada that reduce

commute times when it comes to deciding

where money goes we'll put in place a

simple criteria one simple question will

this project reduce commute times other

projects across Canada include the third

link across the st. Lawrence between

Quebec City and levy nazo total project

part 2 o Canada so on totally the twazzi

I mean so the Cynara onto a levy a

Quebec and the George Massey tunnel

replacement in Vancouver will work with

provincial and territorial governments

to build these projects at the right

price on the right timelines and we will

continue to find all projects promised

and committed to by the previous

government news elantra avec le

truly project from e para Google mo

pressed a down what's more as Prime

Minister I will get rid of Justin

Trudeau's infrastructure bank after 4

years let's call it for what it is a 35

billion dollar failure in 2018 alone

Trudeau's infrastructure Bank requested

more than 11 million dollars just to

cover operating costs before the bank

even funded a single

project that's eleven million dollars

that could have been put towards

much-needed infrastructure like the

young subway extension and the Ontario

line I will also pull Canada's 256

million dollar investment and the

Chinese controlled Asian infrastructure

Bank there's simply no way

Canadian taxpayer should be funding new

roads and bridges in other countries

when there are so many much needed

projects right here in places like the

GTA four more years of Justin Trudeau

means four more years the delayed

projects and longer more expensive

commutes it means a higher carbon it

means a higher carbon tax that will add

31 cents a litre to the price of gas

which commuters here in the GTA simply

can't afford and Justin Trudeau himself

revealed to be a high carbon hypocrite

when we found out he was traveling all

across the country with a second gas

guzzling plane and his excuse that he

just pays the carbon offsets shows how

millionaires like Trudeau and his trust

fund buddies will always be able to

afford for the privilege of hanging on

to their lifestyle no matter the cost

but hard-working Canadian moms and dads

can't afford his ever increasing taxes

and that is why a new Conservative

government will cancel his carbon tax

will prioritize projects like the

Ontario line and the Yonge subway

extension here in the GTA cutting down

your commute while putting more money in

your pockets so you can get ahead we'll

bring in a green public transit tax

credit making monthly transit passes

more affordable and taking cars off the

road reducing both congestion and

emissions we'll bring in a universal tax

cut for every Canadian that will save a

couple of average salaries eight hundred

back into the pockets of new parents all

while building the Munch needed

transportation infrastructure Canadians

need to get home quicker at the end of

the day October 21st Canadians decide

who they trust to put more money in

their pockets

so they can get ahead and when it comes

to important projects getting built that

choice could not be clearer four more

years of dithering and delays of longer

commutes and higher gas prices with the

Liberals or a new Conservative

government that will invest in projects

like the Ontario line and the Yonge

subway extension here in the GTA

that's shortened your commute and will

make life more affordable so you can get

ahead thank you very much merci beaucoup

happy to take your questions good

morning Mr Shearer

Kevin Gallagher of CTV national news

last night's debate was a different

format of course many viewers were

looking to hear the best you know policy

options from the different leaders do

you feel that last night was a good

showcase for policy within that debate

well I wish the format would have

allowed for a more direct one-on-one

exchange between myself and Justin

Trudeau I believe that Canadians would

have liked to see me explain my policies

and and him defend his unfortunately the

format did not really allow for a lot of

that I am satisfied that I did take many

opportunities to articulate to Canadians

the positive benefits of our platform

the universal tax cut the home

renovation tax credit for green

investments in your home the public

transit tax credit tax credits for kids

sports and activities but but obviously

I wish I had had more time to go

directly back and forth with mr. Trudeau

we are desuka up I will book with this

they may now say Oh Kennedy and this day

I'm on a you know day but I will say I

wish Justin Trudeau had have

participated in the two previous debates

that were scheduled one was cancelled

when he refused to show up and of course

the McLean's debate that he skipped out

on that I think would have given

Canadians other opportunities to to see

the leaders debating but that was the

choice he made given the time

constraints if you're talking about what

was the strategy behind attacking mr.

Trudeau on his black face scandal in

your opening overture rather than

hammering home some of those policy

points you want Canadians to know about

well as I mentioned I was you know I

think many Canadians were frustrated

that he skipped out on the first two

scheduled debates and like like millions

of Kansas just become incredibly

frustrated with him being so completely

fake and phony and saying one thing and

doing another and pretending to be

someone that he's clearly not and I

wanted to set that I wanted to

articulate that early on because I share

the frustration of millions of Canadians

who cannot trust anything Justin Trudeau

says because of his inability to try to

tell the truth we come Emilia on the

Canadians with 10a avec limosaurus named

Collini AG in engagement crack another

pathway of real lead the bad stories on

jury socio comes up hi mister Tom Perry

with CBC your campaigns been pushing a

story that the Liberals want to put a

tax on home sales on capital gains the

Liberals say that's not true it's not

going to happen not in their platform

you showed last night that you can go

toe to toe with Justin Trudeau so why do

you feel you need to keep pushing this

idea that they say is not true well you

know they've said a lot of things that

weren't true last election they said a

lot of things that ended up being false

and Justin Trudeau continues to tell

things that aren't true I mean last

night in the debate he continued to deny

the allegations in The Globe and Mail

story relating to the SNC Laughlin

scandal even though those have been

proven to be true we have audio tape

from Michael Wernick we have Jody Wilson

ray Boltz testimony we have the findings

of the ethics commissioner this was a

policy proposal that their star

candidate their so-called housing expert

proposed it was under this Liberal

government a directive for Revenue

Canada to start tracking sales of

principal residences for Canadians so I

believe that Canadians are right to be

concerned that this is something that

the Trudeau Liberals will pursue if they

are reelected so if you're telling

voters they can't believe Justin Trudeau

when he says he won't tag

their homes why should they believe you

when you say you're not going to

infringe on the rights of women to

choose or on LGBTQ rights because we

I've always held the same position on

our engagement our promise not to reopen

these issues the laws and an axis on

that issue have not changed for 30 years

under conservative or liberal prime

ministers that they will not change what

I'm Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says

things that aren't true he has a track

record of lying he has a track record of

saying things that he knows to be false

and he has a track record of breaking

promises that's why yesterday your

campaign put out a release questioning

why Justin Trudeau left Point Grey

school you said he'd have a chance to

answer for it in the debate you never

asked the question why didn't you ask

the question and what was your campaign

trying to insinuate hmm

well not like the SNC Lavin scandal his

story has changed multiple times and

we've believed that he might have used

that opportunity to come clean with

Canadians why would his story changing

matter what are you trying to insinuate

might have been without making any in

situations we're just asking why he

can't keep a story tracery badly unless

you're supposed to kiss young people

quoi

so say haeseong jean-jacques rule hi mr.

Scheer David Cochran with CBC News we've

sent these questions to your campaign

but we have yet to get even an email

acknowledging they've been received I'm

going to put them to you directly we're

trying to determine what role if any

longtime Republican operative named Mike

Roman is playing in your campaign either

officially or unofficially and what role

does Matt McBain have in your campaign

well I can have I can have people get

back to you on on that as you know we

have hundreds of volunteers from all

over the country who have worked in

different campaigns at different levels

and like all other parties they have

they have experience working on on other

campaigns so are they working with you

or not sorry I don't want this to count

as my follow-up I just are they working

on your campaign yes or no well as I

said we have hundreds of volunteers from

all across the country who have a wide

variety of experiences at different

levels

on campaigns like other parties do okay

so you obviously know what their

experience is you've referenced that

they along with George Ann Burke who we

know is working on your campaigns your

target a writing coordinator they have

experience working with the Trump

campaign how should Canadians interpret

people who have played senior political

roles with the Trump campaign

potentially playing a role in your

campaign as I said we have hundreds of

volunteers with lots of different types

of experiences at different levels

campaigning as other parties do from all

over the country if you want to make

comparisons between Canadian politicians

and Donald Trump let's look at who fired

his attorney general for not doing what

he wanted Justin Trudeau fired his

attorney general when he didn't get the

answer he wanted he then shut down

investigations into his corruption and

lashed out and threatened to sue people

who were standing up to him he

threatened to sue me for telling the

truth about his scandal in corruption

so if Canadians want to look and see

who's following a playbook from US

politics it's quite clear that's Justin

Trudeau and you've watched verdict

Canadian Press Mr Shearer how would you

describe the state of the global economy

and which economic indicators are you

watching to determine whether Canada is

headed for a recession mm-hmm well

obviously there are a lot of troubling

signs around the world anytime you see a

streak of protectionism go through the

world as we saw with with the United

States and other countries as well that

always has a negative impact on global

growth as a conservative I believe in

free and open trade being the best way

to increase prosperity and help all

economies around the world prosper I

also look at foreign direct investment

and I noticed that over the past over

the the Trudeau years that number has

fallen especially in the energy sector

so there are certainly troubling signs

on the horizon which is once again our

reason for Canadians to be very

concerned about the massive deficits

that dot that Justin Trudeau has been

running because he has taken away the

flexibility for Canada to react in the

event of a downturn by saddling us with

almost seventy billion dollars of new

debt and the cost that comes along with

that debt so as Prime Minister how would

you react in a downturn or a recession

that could be coming well we have to

make Canada the type of place that

people want to invest in and that means

canceling the carbon tax

lowering taxes for Canadians it means

getting back to balanced budgets so that

less and less of your tax dollar goes to

banks and bondholders servicing that

debt charge and more and more of it can

go into better services and into tax

cuts which will help individual canes

and also the the economy as a whole

hi mr. shear arjuna on cbc kids news

word thank you we met at the raptors

parade actually which was one of the

greatest moments of my life

unfortunately was with me oh yeah a

great way to celebrate the titles

unfortunately it ended in a sour way

with the shooting and I was scared and

terrified as Sewer many kids as Prime

Minister what would you do in order to

strengthen our gun laws well thank you

for Mary thank you very much for that

question great to see you here today

hope you enjoy the day with with the

campaign and with the media I

fortunately because the the parade had

taken so long my daughter and I had left

before that happened and I can't imagine

what the what that would have been like

for you and other young people who are

there to celebrate such an historic

victory such a great thing for our city

and our country for sports fans all

across Canada it's incredibly important

that everyone who's gathering for public

events walking home from work taking

their kids to the park can do so without

fear fear of drive-by shootings fear of

getting activities our plan for a safer

candidate goes after the gangsters and

criminals we're going to invest in new

resources to help our border service

agents get more illegal guns that are

coming into Canada we're gonna make gang

members face more serious penalties

we're gonna end the practice of

revolving door for bail keeping known

gang members in in custody longer and

we're going to name criminal

organizations as gang so that

prosecutors don't have to keep proving

the same thing over and over again how

can you reassure kids such events will

be repeated well by going after the

gangsters and the illegal firearms that

is the best way to reduce the likelihood

of these types of things happening in

the future police experts from across

the country have said that the problem

with with shootings and our large cities

is gang-related so going after the

gangsters means if you less likelihood

of those things

in the future and a more safer community

thank you thank you very much

hello mr. Shearer my name is Ali from

commercial magazine Persian media in

autocross Canada the question is from

our readership is immigration agenda a

lot of for instance a study permits

self-employed foreign investors they

always have hesitating about changing

immigration and there that happened in

Harper government we want to know your

thoughts is immigration changing is it

getting harder for immigrants what's

happening well under the previous

Conservative government Canada saw some

of the highest levels of sustained

immigration in in generations our party

believes in an open and inclusive

immigration policy that welcomes people

from all around the world based on what

Canada needs obviously there are regions

throughout Canada where there are

shortages for workers we need to

streamline the process so that those

needs can be met much more quickly and

much more efficiently we will ensure

that Canada's economic economic needs

are met through immigration as well as

the compassionate side for family

reunification and refugees as well but

obviously we also want to make sure that

people who come to Canada are able to

work in the field that they were trained

in and there still is a huge problem

with recognizing foreign credentials and

that is something our government will

focus on as well so is it fair to tell

them it's fine and they feel comfortable

to work for you absolutely we are we are

a country that was built by immigration

every one of us can trace our background

to to someone coming to Canada and and

that is a that all of that has made

Canada to be the great country that it

is our Conservative government will

ensure that our immigration system

welcomes people from all around the

world but that we do so in a fair

orderly and compassionate manner and

right now there are a lot of canes that

don't have confidence in the immigration

system because Justin Trudeau has done

nothing about the flow of illegal border

crossers and I hear from new Canadians

all the time I hear from new Canadians

both immigrants and refugees who tell

their stories about waiting years and

years and years and how frustrating it

is for them to see people jump the line

and skip the queue and come into

from upstate New York and avoid the same

process that they had to go through

thank you mrs. thank you thanks very

much everyone

merci beaucoup
