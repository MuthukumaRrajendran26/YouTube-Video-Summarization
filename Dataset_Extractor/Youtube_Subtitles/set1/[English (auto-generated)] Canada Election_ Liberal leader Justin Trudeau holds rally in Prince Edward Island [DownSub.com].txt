day here we did we didn't s the Prime

Minister later on this afternoon but

here we among the work and very

interesting we have four weeks and the

number of days to go with till October

the 21st and that's a big decision to

make

we simply the decision we had was do we

want to go back to the wave walk or do

we want the way it was for the last four

years or do you want to go back for her

for years

that's simply where we are and that's

the decision that we have to make sure

we've had over the years

[Applause]

anyhow

no matter but there has been a lot of

changes made instead of constantly have

progress instead of cuts we have uh we

have increase in the only ASAP is with a

few more dollars for our seniors to be

able to spend all this is so important

it gives people the opportunity to be

self-reliant to be able to fend for

themselves

hello pei hello good road

thank you for that kind introduction

what a warm welcome it is such a

wonderful pleasure to be back here on

francis Macaulay's farm two weeks there

dei and the cross Ito's hurricane door

but when the going gets tough people in

this province can always count on each

other let's hear it for the cleanup

crews the first responders soldiers

volunteers and everyone there for you as

you rebuild and recover I know

Lawrence McCauley will be a part of that

after all as de-ice longest-serving MP

ever I think it's safe to say the people

here know they can depend on him I Wix

work to Florence for years now his

dedication to the people who call a

cardigan home and to the future of this

province is incredible and of course we

have no shortage of outstanding leaders

here on the island

you've got Sean Casey

[Applause]

give it up once again we create in 2015

you believe that we could make real

change happen

you wanted a team that would work for

you not just for the wealthiest few you

wanted the team that cared about the

next generation not just the next

election a team that prioritized people

not power together guided by our shared

values we built that t your ideas your

positivity and your energy your hope and

your hard work we have built the most

open political movement in Canada over

bhatia also change the politic

conservatives in a functioning economy

Canadian it's the owner qusomes real

economy eclair showed up one Hassan's

distillate we ended to sonicujaku second

lost GDP le cuckoo Attila a false a true

well in 2015

Canadians chose a new team that was

willing to invest in people and in their

communities we knew that we know now

that even though we live in the best

country in the world better is always

positive

[Applause]

ahead of us and there is behind us

we've spent the last four years moving

forward we've got the record to show for

poverty is way down

job creation way up and it's because our

team rejected conservative cuts and

austerity and chose instead to invest in

the middle class and people working hard

to join people like Shona from West

Prince whom I spoke with earlier today

she's raising five kids by herself she

has a lot on her plate but thanks to the

Canada child benefit Shona now has the

extra help her family needs her words it

was a lifesaver for me because the

tax-free money she gets every month will

it help her buy a house we didn't stop

there we've invested in our veterans

who've served this country so bravely

reopening the PEI veterans service

office along with eight others across

the country

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

I don't have to tell you too many young

people are leaving the island to look

for work it's up to us to make sure they

can stay in the communities they love

with jobs they can count on in fact I

was just in Charlottetown earlier this

year to announce new funding to create

over a hundred and 50 jobs here in PEI

that protect 300 together for Canadians

we also cut taxes for the middle class

by raising them on the wealthiest one

percent we've been there for our seniors

from making the Canada Pension Plan even

stronger to creating a new Minister of

seniors and after Stephen Harper and

notes from Switzerland that he was

raising the age of retirement we were

there for you we restored the age of

eligibility for Old Age Security and the

guaranteed income supplement from 67 doc

to 65

my friends we're going to continue

making progress on this front we've

taken unprecedented steps to keep our

water safe with a plan to phase out

harmful single-use plastics something

Pei is already leaning on at the first

product the ban plastic bags to create

new jobs right here on the island these

investments are making a real difference

in people's lives all across the country

and this fall

Canadians once again get to vote for the

kind of Canada they want to live in

we've all got a choice to keep moving

forward is build on the progress we've

made or go back to the politics of the

heartbreakers she conservative

politicians like to say they're for the

people but then they cut taxes for the

wealthy and cut services for everybody

else other than deciding they might need

to smile a bit more conservatives have

no new ideas for Canadians they still

think as Canadians know well that's the

wrong approach to take let's not forget

what Stephen Harper had to say about AG

land to Canada but was it a culture of

defeat

let me tell you about Pei in Atlantic

Canada it's a culture of honest hard

work and Islanders that's why we chose

to move town enough forward by investing

in families workers and communities by

having faith in Canadians

they can ID okay whose turn the yoader

to go down when the niggas see the new

bizarre coughs well obviously you see

the very small so place it on a nice

we're gonna seal it up something about

that they found some when I complete my

chefs I mean open throat a politic

insists accepted

but I do believe that Minicozzi church

but I do many pushers they reveal but I

even a bizarre follow me around for that

foreign participants who maybe think

that were her blood don't pull that knee

we've done a walk together these past

four years but the truth is we're just

getting started

you have an important choice today will

we go back to the failed policies of the

past or will we continue to move for

that's the choice it's that clear

important that's why I can't wait to

continue talking with Canadians over the

next few weeks about our plan that keeps

moving Canada forward I'm asking you to

stand with our liberal team I'm asking

you for your help because of you we won

the 2015 we need you now more than ever

so please talk to your neighbors get out

and volunteer with Lawrence with Bobbi

or Sean or even we drive people to the

polls make phone calls

donate if you can and most importantly

do knock doors on October 21st help

Canadians choose a government that will

fight with you and for you for a

stronger middle class and for a better

Canada for all Canadians

so from coast to coast to coast let's

stand as one voice and let's choose

forward

[Applause]
