Canadian troops don't have provincial

healthcare cards they cut them up when

they join the forces their health care

becomes the military's responsibility

and they see military doctors but the

Department of National Defense doesn't

provide full-spectrum care when more

advanced procedures are needed troops

use the same hospitals and doctors as

civilians and the military reimburses

the hospitals but this spring a major

change multiple sources tool global news

orders came from inside DND to cut

health care spending one of the first

targets fees charged by hospitals for

seeing military patients in a move that

stunned the provinces across the country

the military quietly announced major

cuts to what it will pay for hospital

services without warning or consultation

estimates obtained by global news show

drastic cuts to what the military will

now cover from paying three hundred and

fifty nine dollars for an ER visit two

ninety three dollars and seventy cents a

decrease of almost 75% and four-day

surgery a drop of ninety six percent and

the military will no longer pay for CT

scans or MRIs that cost seven hundred to

eight hundred dollars each documents

obtained by global news show hospitals

are anticipating a major shortfall as a

result an estimated ten point five

million dollars in Ontario and in

Alberta at least two million this will

mean an increasing strain on their

resources if they don't have the same

financial amounts coming in which will

mean that they will likely have to cut

back on some of the services that they

offer military sources privately told

Global News that the healthcare budget

has been ballooning for years and they

are under pressure to find savings

defense analyst David Perry warns it

could be a risky move Department of

Defense that spent several years saying

that their people are their priority

it's going to look bad if one of the

areas where there's an effort to reduce

spending is on the health side but some

in the military health care system think

the feds are being gouged by hospitals

and insist the new rates are more fair

Alberta and Ontario disagree saying the

new rates do not accurately reflect the

full cost of delivering health care to

caf members DND acknowledged the cuts to

Global News but insists it's working

actively with provincial and territorial

governments

and civilian hospitals with respect to

the billing changes the fear now that

military members actively serving their

country could be denied services or told

to pay out of pocket two sources told

global news that one Ontario Hospital is

already refusing military members MRI

slots leaving troops in limbo in a

battle they never signed up for Mercedes
