whatever insane pundits claiming that

that conservative the party couldn't

possibly work right they said that we

couldn't really ignite 300 projects I

of course the government is a much

broader capability that is an average of

it is hard sometimes for me physical or

practical considerations for reasons

like that sometimes we hang out in women

certain urban policies but I think 93%

it is pretty good it proved that we are

listening to our grassroots volunteers

and then they were on the right track

also the maritime minute will be judged

by a burden on how we became advocates

to that so let's be honest we took a

Charles to run a negative campaign

against entp maybe here the job crisis

and this little paper the only issue and

then I'm confident we would want to such

a life in his said we decided to take a

big risk by publishing the most detail

[Applause]

we've managed to persuade the Senate to

accept all our proposed amendments

rewriting that bill but because the

demographer cat closes madness we're

going to follow me through that our

promise constitutional challenge to see

69 as a clear and an unacceptable

intrusion into our exclusive authority

to manage our resources they committed

some savage promise

[Applause]

my strategy to sand up around winners

resources so we bought the Canadian

actress the public enquiry into the

Florida campaign block our versus the

indigenous Legal Defense Fund and

remained in the applause so called turn

about the tax legislation on day one

promised a order and how to implement in

front of a balance to be a credible plan

to the budget in this firm of government

thanks to the word of our brilliant

finance minister proud to say that's

another promise made promise but I'm

thinking at the point so let's pause for

just a couple minutes to talk about that

last box to pop get involved as finances

now the day after his reelection I have

got an image and I was really fine see

you public services at the part of the

days I thought the city of apprentice

they were healed

may 6 billion dollar holding used to

this little and the entity of tourism

had over protected revenues in the

fiscal year twenty twenty two twenty

three by more than six billion dollars

nothing to do with other job creation

he'll the Casa Luker fully reflected in

our balanced budget father but and even

though our papa was based on the more

conservative probably second quarter

pass to the NDP sponsor the actual

reject reality is turned out to be for

the billion and a half dollars lower

than what we thought

we can then appointed in the expert

panel on an element of finances chaired

by former and DB finance minister dr.

Katzen King and these independent

experts came back with the survey

findings they concluded that Alberta is

in equals fittest surprises and that the

decisive action is not even it now that

a dad will grow out of control could

assume me in an ever-increasing care tax

dollars an important seat deep painful

process of the plan had been around that

the biggest for kind of been a business

in Canada of the of the fastest-growing

intact

we were on track for a debt of over a

hundred billion dollars on the end of

the business sir we were truly selling

under the four billion a year in

interest payments to the bankers and

borrowers instead of military come up

their medication in operating now the

terrifying ghost a serious problem in a

herd the defective descend twenty

percent more per person than the average

was horrible promises and that if I were

simply to descend to seeing one of those

other two promises we said me ten

billion dollars less than we are we do

not written in a three he really about a

surplus and instead of an eight million

dollar deaths and what's worse we have

the results to justify that in health

care population in the country

the most efficient office is 20 percent

more than in other problems is dead and

yet we have lower life expectancy higher

infant mortality and generally longer

search for weight Sullivan on in higher

education as there's an interest rate

likely to the point that we said 50%

more pursue that Ontario but we have

local university and enrollment and

completion rates folks in the money of

these sites we have a choices to make we

could do about other conferences have

done for too long and cuz it's kicked

head on the road delayed inevitable and

as the debt grows and grows and

threatens to the hability of health care

and education or we could create our

word and a massive resize but they

didn't always like that how do you catch

those are operating on a progress and

then they're tax hikes help the

depletion of inches of rescission

rather to slow it down and we still

haven't recovered

taxes are novice or we could act finally

need to remember to send me in line with

their needs we provinces

[Applause]

the NDP the immediate essentially

interested allies one other words to

believe that our half the balances to

use their words drachma screw but folks

than the numbers to the line they see

for themselves that the truth is that we

have two roses a careful gradual

targeted approach to finding love

protect me to the programs that have

mattered most in it and in particular

those vulnerable the truth is that we

are reducing our overall operating said

by a modest 2.8 percent over four years

or just 1.3 billion dollars over four

years 55 billion dollar budget

that's less than the three sentences at

all just to put this in any respect the

people needed in order to get our

vitamins back 20 percent over two years

the correction to the randomness of the

disaster cuts by six percent over two

years so foolish fellow

let's leave things as intersect is there

anything on Albert anyone who hasn't had

to find savings as a few pennies on the

dollar

the truth is as you know many other

families that have lost everything

recent houses businesses have gone on

surely the most expensive doggery that

in North America can a do what the

families decided to do around their

kitchen tables every year to make

choices we have many choices you chose

to keep our commitment to protect our

care and education in fact on the birth

plan

the health care budget is actually in

Racine and an education budget is why

we've all supposed to protect the most

vulnerable which is significant

increases in community social services

led by a mr. economy of children

services led by name is Rebecca Joyce

that means water sport versus

disabilities and more support for

children in care of course of course if

it's going to each county but from

huge and Samuel 17 increases and the big

age of 17 are men in the contrary in

education

[Music]

so smoothly Contras

some people invited protests someone

today

another reminded of what I creamy

Ralphie to say if the nation will decide

it does not produce 100 what it was

wrong

this really is a balance balance in

terms of novels but in terms of our

social obligations our sense of

compassion and as well as their

determination to start in your future

our approach is soft-hearted but a

hard-headed now that you say another

word and the poor ignore to the good

folks work hard delivery of all the

services

Albert respect the work that you do as I

remember we positive empowering to

create a high-performing government if

there's a literacy services more

efficiently reduce you see an internal

rate a empowerment in front of mining

workers we also want to determine if you

to help us find reasonable sees in what

it is that the biggest send in passing

from a sector in Canada now a word

fullness that the Obama campaign they

look for the best way of benevolence

advisors to the growing a economy and

then the higher taxes workers disciple

rather than in create jobs how the birds

refuse to risk our futures by city that

is promised into the sea of the right

hand the discovery minute is on we did

in a heart longed to lay out for the

people in our souls aussolas or

publishers and amigo work hard to the

minute honesty labor impact of this 2.8%

bothers us abduction said and so he asks

the government and unions work with us

constructively to find cities in some

cases this is like me moderating a

repetitive said focus at the private

sectors do not enjoy a place that a

dozen it certainly does not mean eight

percent salary increases that is some

leaders demanded it in an economy where

private sector mentality

[Applause]

so nice place but let us again choose to

the path of the cooperation not

complication let us already without

words of private economic years and the

diversity and cannot anymore let us

agree that the biggest threat to

publishers and the financial security of

those who know the rhythm it is an

out-of-control that consuming billions

of dollars in interest beings friends at

the end of argument at the end of the

day at the end of our day today I really

need to get over to back to work to

create many jobs and has a certain

living off our to saw a little bit off

our credit card

well that will require a fair deal for

Elgar now I share the profound precision

of many helpers we we have over 600

billion dollars net to the rest of

Canada since 1960 over the last five

years and an average and you should to

the progressive Canada of twenty three

billion dollars a year even while we

have been going through the greatest

economic downturn in our processes Great

Depression as I always say we are burns

were practically share of good fortune

with our fellow Canadians and times were

good here and not elsewhere but what we

cannot to buy what we no longer abide it

is governments and politicians in other

parts make that kind of treaty walking

our ability to develop the resources

itself to the world that a fair price

that the same reserves that paid the

freight and in the Canadian

Confederation

[Applause]

[Applause]

[Music]

folks we helped they'll have total

action with the produces the k-th

reports is on a lock that would like

some hostile distracted it does

discriminatory policies have heated up

over another that we've had the

divisions that the web in Canada to read

the Trudeau government sources turn but

that has happened instead the elec

exacerbated those divisions Albert

resilience and then they want honestly

saw boldly and certainly and so we are

and its creator it is democratic to send

up an augury at the distant crowd

community believe this is the debris

industry this is my picture on the

community to defend a national unity

against those arriving women to see our

country if it is my truck to swing kind

of their destructive economic agenda it

is hurting within the men here in

Alberta and the cross Hannah it is my

mission to make them to understand that

that my relentlessly targeting the

engine of our national economy they are

emitting Canadian and against Canadian

energy policy is a bonanno's primary

decision if we're in 15 discernment as

for economic in Alberta but it's on the

only one

as a result whether they took they have

seven billion dollar bad that we can do

to the global credit strategies want any

of the Dean our civilization which is

only 150 million dollars each 150 that's

one percent of our main emphasis of

France to go to Ottawa that year when it

should have been 1.6 billion dollars the

decedent happen to give an action when

we were shortchanged other 300

many dollars we would have to reflect

with the brass here but we didn't if

it's pretty hard to see a cute ladies

that's what design

it's especially in combination with the

bottom of Oz southern refusal how about

her go to the other serious problems

like the pine the decision industry and

the threat posed by Justice resource
