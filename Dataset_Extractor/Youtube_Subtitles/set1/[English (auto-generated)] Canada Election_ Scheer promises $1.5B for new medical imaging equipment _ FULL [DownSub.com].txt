morning everyone ball methane to the

moon it's great to be here today and st.

John every Canadian has relied on the

Canadian health care system at one point

or another a broken bone the birth of a

child routine check-up or the loss of a

loved one we've all made a trip to the

doctor's office or a visit to the

hospital like the one behind me we all

have a personal story to tell I'm here

today to talk about how a new

Conservative government will help make

those stories a bit better

I want you your elderly parents your

children your loved ones not to worry

about wait times and not to worry about

your bottom line today medical imaging

equipment across Canada is falling

behind we don't have enough equipment to

meet the growing demand for potentially

life-saving tests and the wait times for

important tests and treatments are too

long as a result for the amount of money

Canadians paying taxes they deserve

timely access to quality health services

and the very best in modern health

technology and equipment that's why as

Prime Minister I'll invest 1.5 billion

dollars in our first term to replace

aging MRI machines and CT machines and

increase the total number of machines in

Canada's health care system simple cloth

number adapt away from the system the

Sun take a linear here New Brunswick the

average wait time for a medium wait time

for a CT scan is 56 days and for an MRI

scan 28 days that is 56 days spent

waiting to be tested to say nothing of

knowing the results this investment will

support the commitments made by the

Higgs government to make public health

care accessible and dependable and to

work with regional health authorities to

prioritize expenditures to reduce wait

times

it will help our healthcare providers

across Canada to deliver quality

services with the most up-to-date

technology and give patients quicker

access to reliable life-saving tests so

they can get the treatments they need

when they need it when they need them

hundreds of thousands of pinions are

forced to miss work while they wait for

an important test that is unacceptable

important it's a ten except that it's

also our seniors who are most likely to

use the health care system it's our

parents and grandparents for most likely

to need one of these tests and with

Canada's aging population the demand for

MRI and CT tests is only going to

increase I'm proud to be here today to

deliver real relief to Canadians real

help for you your kids your parents more

help for your health and just before the

election I made a commitment to King's I

wrote a letter to every premiere in the

country and sign my name to a guarantee

that a new Conservative government will

maintain an increase both the Canada

Health transfer and the Canada social

transfer and that we will also maintain

the current funding formula a new vole

grooving among conservative a mania a

augment date the trans fair

transfer Kennedy on idea to program

socio a new salon OSI mania platform in

the finals for actual this commitment

means that provinces will be able to

count on stable predictable funding to

pay for their programs and deliver

quality health care the reality is that

Canada's population is both growing and

aging and this presents new challenges

for the healthcare system but Justin

Trudeau simply doesn't understand how

his reckless and wasteful spending makes

meeting those challenges more difficult

he said he would balance the budget

instead his out-of-control spending and

never-ending deficit

have added so much to our national debt

we are on course to one trillion dollars

in debt by 2035 Trudeau's debt and

deficits mean higher taxes threatened

access to the health social programs you

all depend on the only way to guarantee

a stable responsive and accessible

health care system over the long term is

to balance the budget and the only party

that will do that is the Conservative

Party of Canada

and at the same time will make targeted

investments like the 1.5 billion dollars

I have announced today so you can get

the health care you deserve you deserve

a government that knows it's already

hard enough to get ahead in life without

the government making it harder you

deserve a government that understands

that balancing the budget is the best

way to preserve the services that

Canadians rely on the most

including comforter and you deserve it

new Conservative government that will

live within its means put more money in

your pockets so you can get ahead good

our plan goes after the real criminals

we're going after the illegal firearms

we're standing up for honest Canadians

farmers and hunters people who use

firearms responsibly and legally it's

easy to ask law-abiding canadians to

follow more laws it's harder to go after

the criminals and the illegal farms

conservatives are ready to do the hard

work that will actually improve safety

in our communities

good morning mr. Cheryl vanovech from

CBC News are you order to know where of

any other controversial photos of the

Prime Minister and if so why won't you

release them I'm not aware of any any

further I'm not aware that we are why

won't you commit to implementing the

United Nations declaration on the rights

of indigenous composer as I've said in

the past the there are many laudable

goals in that particular declaration

many conservatives have been working on

in the past and will commit to working

on the future the issue is around

ensuring that we have a process in this

country where big projects can get built

again and the wording around free prior

and informed consent is one that has not

been defined even within the indigenous

communities there's disagreement about

what that means and how that would

implemented and if we want to be a

country we can get big projects built

again we have to be very careful about

the types of things the wording on these

types of things

and so we are committed to improving

quality of life for indigenous Canadians

both on and off Reserve and at the same

time bringing in a regulatory approvals

process that could actually get to a yes

in this country again yeah these

grand project right way costly Mr

Shearer Janice Dixon with The Globe and

Mail um yesterday Justin Trudeau

apologize again for what he did in

Winnipeg the crowd seemed pretty

receptive there what did you think about

what he had to say well I believe

Canadians would have been able to accept

his apology had he been more it might

have been able to accept his apology had

he been open and transparent the first

time if he hadn't lied when he was first

given the opportunity to address it and

again I think people are very concerned

about the hypocrisy the fact that there

is one set of rules for Justin Trudeau

and one set of rules for everyone else

and you know the fact that he won't even

hold himself to the same standard that

he sought other people shikaku the

Kennedy area except date says excuse

that they sing sociopath Monty look for

the opportunity they say cracker of

existential oh yeah in system the

regulatory a in system the vector or

raster noon and did you learn anything

further from your team about when it

obtained that video that it gave to the

media know

good morning mr. shear Katie Simpson CBC

News just to follow up on a point you

just made there so you accused Justin

Trudeau of having one set of rules for

everybody else and another set of rules

for himself but at the same time you

have said that with your candidates if

they say something in the past that

would be deemed offensive in 2019 as

long as they apologize they're welcome

to remain a part of your team with that

in mind are you not sort of doing the

exact same thing by not apologizing for

your 2005 comments on same-sex marriage

well I believe that if you look at mr.

Trudeau's apology and believe James

would have accepted if it hadn't been

sincere and and the first time when he

was given the opportunity to address

these directly in an open and

transparent manner he didn't and again

you know he's he's he's not living up to

the his own standards he had an

opportunity to address this head-on and

instead he he lied that when he was

asked about how many times he did it but

Sir I asked about you yeah well again

you know I've addressed that issue of

the but the issue here is that these

when these photos and these incidents

came to light Justin Trudeau had an

opportunity to address them head-on and

in in doing that he he lied about how

many times it happened so I think

Canadians might have been able to accept

his apology

had he been honest and transparent the

first time hello mr. chair Kevin

Gallagher CTV national I still think

we'd like to hear if you're willing to

apologize for comparing same-sex

marriage to a dog's tail in 2005 well I

have addressed that speech and again

what we're talking about here and you

know what this is such a subject of

these conversations in the last few days

the way Justin Trudeau handled dealing

with the instance that came to light in

his past and I think Dave's might have

been able to accept his apology

had he been open and transparent the

first time do you think Canadians accept

your views back in 2005 same-sex

marriage obviously we had a debate on

that issue Canada Canadians had their

say our country has moved on our society

has moved on and I have moved on

say okay okay are you in the baths of

cetology the Canadian or fellow schwa

associate a except as a result capacitor

settles you a more member fero mem shows

Mr Shearer by cricketer bubble national

won't ask about immigration you've said

that our immigration system is broken

how will you fix it specifically since

immigration is crucial for our economy

what I've said in the past is that

Canadians are losing confidence in our

immigration system because Justin

Trudeau has failed to do anything about

the but how will you fix it sir sorry

it's about you now well you in your

preamble you you framed it so I'm

addressing that Canadians have lost

confidence in the immigration system

because Justin Trudeau has failed to

deal with the tens of thousands of

people who have crossed into Canada

illegally so what we're going to do will

have more to say during the campaign as

addressing that very issue with applying

the principles of the safe third party

safe third country agreement along the

border so that people who have already

reached a safe place make the asylum

claim in that country we do confianza

systemic cause the thing to do is you

eight directly the problem Iraq same

Road

and there's a lot of opportunity open

also coming mister como se la plication

delay Princip long term totally they

pursue a new frontier

I just wanna follow up with a question

on Bill 21 its elected prime minister

you're gonna have to stand up for all

Canadians but how will you not challenge

Bill 21 which a lot of people are seems

discriminatory well-built bill 21 is

being challenged it's it is going to the

courts and the courts will decide on we

may on Quebec Villa wanna bang dear

fellow recoil a call back from shake me

or absent from Canadian Press I asked

you the other day whether or not you

believe there should be any restrictions

on the sale

semi-automatic weapons in Canada and you

didn't really give a response can you

explain today why you think or whether

you think Canadians should be able to

buy semi-automatic weapons in Canada

well conservative support robust regimes

around the ownership sale and screening

process for individuals themselves we

support having gun laws in place that

maximize safety that ensure that Public

Safety is addressed in these substances

there are many restrictions limitations

as part of that that conservatives have

always supported the past we're talking

about is the is whether or not it is

effective to have blanket bans on on on

other types of firearms and what we've

heard is from police experts that it's

more effective it'll lead to safer

communities if we use police resources

to go after criminals and illegal

firearms policy yeah yeah beaucoup yeah

Canadian governments have been promising

internationally for more than a decade

to help phase out fossil fuel subsidies

you said this week you're cutting at

least 100 1.5 billion dollars in

subsidies to corporations will you

commit to living up to Canada's

commitment to phase out fossil fuel

subsidies and over what time frame as

long as there is international demand

for for oil and gas

I believe that candidate should be the

one supplying it the the projections for

consumption of oil and gas well into the

future are only expected to rise and I

believe it's much better for the world

much better for our environment for

Canada to be supplying that energy it's

better for Canadian energy to to fill

Canadian markets and to be exported

around the world then oil and gas

producing countries without

environmental standards like Saudi

Arabia like Venezuela that don't have

the same commitment to human rights so I

want I don't just believe the world

needs more Canadian energy

I believe Canada needs more energy and

that's why I support the energy quarter

which will allow the Western Canadian

energy to reach Eastern Eastern markets

Mr Shearer Silas Brown global New

Brunswick in this region of the province

you have three former MPs who are

running against the people that they

lost you in the last election what's

your pitch to New Brunswickers in this

area who may have voted liberal last

time and you want to reconsider well I

hear that every time I come to New

Brunswick in fact every time I travel

all across the country I hear so many

people who say that they voted liberal

in 2015 and they're they're so

disappointed because Justin Trudeau has

turned out to be not as advertised they

did not get what they were expected from

this government and so we've got a great

blend of candidates in in this region

people who have held the confidence of

voters before have provided excellent

service to their constituents and as

well as new candidates who are running

for the first time for us so that's

gonna be a great mix of some veterans

with experience and a new MPs that can

help bring about new ideas as well so

I'm very very proud of the slate of kids

we have in New Brunswick and all across

the land of Canada

what can you offer to New Brunswickers

specifically that you don't believe

Trudeau Canada well when we look at

Justin Trudeau's failures on things like

NAFTA a failing to address the Safa

failing to get any resolution in

negotiations with United States to do

anything long-term on softwood lumber we

know the carbon tax is having a

disproportionate effect on New Brunswick

where was both on the individual side

and on and

the partnership industries like forestry

we know that the regulatory process that

they have implemented in killing energy

East has had an impact here there is a

lost opportunity so clearly the

Conservative Party is on the right side

of New Brunswickers on several important

issues thanks very much

you
