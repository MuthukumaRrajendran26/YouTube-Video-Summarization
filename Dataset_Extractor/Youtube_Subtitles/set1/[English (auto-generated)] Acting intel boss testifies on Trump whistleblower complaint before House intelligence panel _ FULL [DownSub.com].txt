maybe we'll come to order

without objection the chair reserves the

right to recess the hearing at any time

the presidential oath of office requires

the President of the United States to do

two things

faithfully execute his or her office and

protect and defend the Constitution that

oath of course cannot be honored if the

president does not first defend the

country if our national security is

jeopardized if our country is left

undefended the necessity to faithfully

execute the office becomes moot where

there is no country there is no office

to execute and so the duty to defend the

nation is foundational to the

president's responsibilities but what of

this second responsibility to defend the

Constitution what does that really mean

the founders were not speaking of course

of a piece of parchment rather they were

expressing the obligation of the

president to defend the institutions of

our democracy to defend our system of

checks and balances that the

Constitution enshrines to defend the

rule of law a principle upon which the

idea of America was born that we're a

nation of laws not men if we do not

defend the nation there is no

Constitution but if we did not defend

the Constitution there is no nation

worth defending

yesterday we were presented with the

most graphic evidence yet that the

president the United States has betrayed

his oath of office betrayed his oath to

defend our national

security and betrayed his oath to defend

our Constitution for yesterday we were

presented with a record of a call

between the President of the United

States and the president of Ukraine in

which the president our president

sacrificed our national security and our

Constitution for his personal political

benefit to understand how we did so we

must first understand just how

overwhelmingly dependent Ukraine is on

the United States militarily financially

diplomatically and in every other way

and not just on the United States but on

the person of the president Ukraine was

invaded by its neighbor by our common

adversary by Vladimir Putin's Russia it

remains occupied by Russian irregular

forces in a long simmering war Ukraine

desperately needs our help and for years

we have given it and on a bipartisan

basis that is until two months ago when

it was held up inexplicably by President

Trump it is in this context after a

brief congratulatory call from President

Trump to president Solinsky on April

21st and after the president's personal

emissary Rudy Giuliani made it

abundantly clear to ukrainian officials

over several months that the president

wanted dirt on his political opponent it

is in this context that the new

president of ukraine would speak to

donald trump over the phone on july 25th

president szalinski eager to establish

himself at home as a friend of the

president of the most powerful nation on

earth had at least two objectives get a

meeting with the president and get more

military help and so what happened on

that call Solinsky begins by

ingratiating himself and he tries to

enlist the support of the president he

expresses his interest in meeting with

the president and says his country wants

to acquire more weapons from us to

defend

itself and what is the president's

response well it reads like a classic

organized crime shakedown shorn of its

rambling character and in not so many

words this is the essence of what the

president communicates we've been very

good to your country very good no other

country has done as much as we have but

you know what I don't see much

reciprocity here I hear what you want I

have a favor I want from you though and

I'm gonna say this only seven times so

you better listen good I want you to

make up dirt on my political opponent

understand lots of it on this and on

that I'm gonna put you in touch with

people and not just any people I'm gonna

put you in touch with Attorney General

the United States my attorney general

bill Barr

he's got the whole weight of the

American law enforcement behind him and

I'm gonna put you in touch with Rudy

you're gonna love him trust me you know

what I'm asking and so I'm only gonna

say this a few more times in a few more

ways and by the way don't call me again

I'll call you when you've done what I

asked this is in sum and character what

the president was trying to communicate

with the presidents of Ukraine it would

be funny if it wasn't such a graphic

betrayal of the president's oath of

office but as it does represent a real

betrayal there's nothing the president

says here that is in America's interest

after all it is instead the most

consequential form of tragedy for it

forces us to confront the remedy the

founders provided for such a flagrant

abuse of office impeachment now this

matter would not have come to the

attention of our committee or the

nation's attention without the courage

of a single person the whistleblower as

you know director McGuire more so than

perhaps any other area of government

since we deal with classified

information the Intelligence Committee

is dependent on whistleblowers to reveal

wrongdoing

when it occurs when the agencies do not

self-report because outside parties are

not allowed to scrutinize your work and

to guide us if that system is allowed to

break down as it did here if

whistleblowers come to understand that

they will not be protected one of two

things happen serious wrongdoing goes

unreported or whistleblowers take

matters into their own hands and divulge

classified information to the press and

violation of the law and placing our

national security at risk this is why

the whistleblower system is so vital to

us and why your handling of this urgent

complaint is also so troubling today we

can say for the first time since we have

released this morning the whistleblower

complaint that you have marked

unclassified that the substance of this

call is a core issue although by means

no means the only issue raised by the

whistleblowers complaint which was

shared with the committee for the first

time only late yesterday by law the

whistleblower complaint which brought

this gross misconduct to light should

have been presented to this committee

weeks ago and by you mr. director

under the clear letter of the law and

yet it wasn't director McGuire I was

very pleased when you were named acting

director if sue Gordon was not going to

remain I was grateful that a man of your

superb military background was chosen a

Navy SEAL for 36 years and director of

the National Counterterrorism Center

since December 2018 your credentials are

impressive and in limited interactions

that we have had since you became

director of NCTC you have struck me as a

good and decent man which makes your

actions over the last month all the more

bewilderingly chose not to provide the

complaint to this committee as required

by law why you chose to seek a second

opinion on whether shall really means

shall under the statute why you chose to

go to a

apartment led by a man bill Barr who

himself is implicated in the complaint

and believes that he exists to serve the

interest of the president not the office

itself mind you or the public interest

but the interest of the person of Donald

Trump why you chose to allow the subject

of the complaint to play a role in

deciding whether Congress would ever see

the complaint why you stood silent when

intelligence professional under your

care and protection was ridiculed by the

president was accused of potentially

betraying his or her country when that

whistleblower by their very act of

coming forward has shown more dedication

to country more of an understanding of

the president's oath of office than the

President himself we look forward to

your explanation ranking member Nunez I

thank the gentleman I want to

congratulate the Democrats on the

rollout of their latest information

warfare operation against the President

and their extraordinary ability to once

again enlist the mainstream media in

their campaign this operation began with

media reports from the prime instigators

of the Russia collusion hoax that a

whistleblower is claiming president

Trump made nefarious promise to a

foreign leader the release transcript of

that call has already debunked that

central assertion but that didn't matter

the Democrats simply moved the goalposts

and began claiming that there doesn't

need to be a quid pro quo for this

conversation to serve as the basis for

impeaching the president Speaker Pelosi

went further when asked earlier if she

would put brakes on impeachment if the

transcript turned out to be benign she

responded quote so there you go

if the whistleblower operation doesn't

work out the Democrats and their media

we have candidates quote we have many

candidates for impeachable offenses that

was her quote so there you go

if the whistleblower operation doesn't

work out the Democrats and their media

assets

always drum up something else and what

other information has come to light

since the original false report of a

promise being made we've learned the

following the complaint relied on

hearsay evidence provided by the

whistleblower the Inspector General did

not know the contents of the phone call

at issue the inspector general found the

whistleblower displayed arguable

political bias against Trump

the Department of Justice investigated

the complaint and determined no action

was warranted the Ukrainian president

denies being pressured by President

Trump so once again this supposes

scandal ends up being nothing like what

we were told and once again the

democrats their media mouthpieces and a

cabal of leakers are ginning up a fake

story with no regard to the monumental

damage they're causing to our public

institutions and to trust in government

and without acknowledging all the false

stories they propagated in the past

including countless allegations that

Trump campaign colluded with Russia to

hack the 2016 elected election we're

supposed to forget about all those

stories but believe this one in short

what we have with this storyline is

another still dossier I'll note here

that in the Democrats mania to overturn

the 2016 elections everything they touch

gets hopelessly politicized with the

Russia hoax it was our intelligence

agencies which were turned into a

political weapon to attack the president

and now today the whistleblower process

is the casualty until about a week ago

the need to protect that process was the

Pratt was a primary bipartisan concern

of this committee but if the Democrats

were really concerned with defending

that process they would have pursued

this matter with a quiet sober inquiry

as we do for all whistleblowers but that

would have been useless for them they

don't want answers they want a public

spectacle and so we've been treated to

an unending parade of press releases

press conferences and fake news

stories this hearing itself is another

example whistleblower inquiry should not

be held in public at all as our Senate

counterparts both Democrats and

Republicans obviously understand their

hearing with mr. McGuire is behind

closed doors but again that only makes

sense when your goal is to get

information not to create a media frenzy

the current hysteria has something else

in common with the Russia hoax back then

they accused the Trump campaign of

colluding with Russians when the

Democrats themselves were colluding with

Russians and preparing the still dossier

today they accused the president of

pressuring Ukrainians to take actions

that would help himself

or hurt is a political opponents and yet

there are numerous examples of Democrats

doing the exact same thing Joe Biden

bragged that he extorted the Ukrainians

into firing a prosecutor who happened to

be investigating Biden's own son three

Democratic senators wrote a letter

pressuring the Ukrainian general

prosecutor to reopen the investigation

into former Trump campaign officials

another Democratic senator went to

Ukraine and pressured the Ukrainian

president not to investigate corruption

allegations on involving Joe Biden's son

according to Ukrainian officials the

Democratic National Committee contractor

Alexander Alexandra chalupa tried to get

Ukrainian officials to provide dirt on

Trump associates and tried to get the

former Ukrainian president to comment

publicly on alleged ties to Russia

Ukrainian official sir hey leshenka was

a source for nelly or wife of Department

of Justice official Bruce or as she

worked on the anti-trump operation

conducted by fusion GPS and funded

by the Democrats and of course Democrats

on this very committee negotiated with

people who they thought were Ukrainians

in order to obtain nude pictures of

Trump people can reasonably ask why the

Democrats are so determined to impeach

this president when in just a year

they'll have a chance

in fact one Democratic congressman one

of the first to call for Trump's

impeachment gave us the answer when he

said quote I'm concerned that if we

don't impeach the president he will get

reelected unquote winning elections is

hard and when you compete you have no

guarantee you'll win but the American

people do have a say in this and they

made their voices heard in the last

presidential election this latest gambit

by the Democrats to overturn the

people's mandate is unhinged and

dangerous they should end the entire

dishonest protest spectacle and get back

to work to solving problems which is

what every member of this committee was

sent here to do

judging by today's charade the chances

of that happening anytime soon are zero

to none I yield back

I think the gentleman director would you

rise for the oath and raise your right

hand do you solemnly swear or affirm

that the testimony we'll give today

shall be the truth the whole truth and

nothing but the truth so help you God I

think you may be seated the record will

reflect that the witness has been duly

sworn director McGuire would you agree

that the whistleblower complaint alleges

serious wrongdoing by the President of

the United States

mr. chairman well actually I apologize

director let me recognize you for your

opening statement and you may take as

much time as you need thank you very

much mr. chairman chairman Schiff

ranking member Nunez and members of the

committee good morning I'd like to begin

by thanking the chairman and the

committee for agreeing to postpone this

hearing for one week this provided

sufficient time to allow the executive

branch to successfully complete its

consultations regarding how to

accommodate the committee's request mr.

chairman I've told you this on several

occasions and I would like to say this

publicly I respect you I respect this

committee and I welcome and take

seriously the committee's oversight role

during my confirmation process to be the

director of the National

Counterterrorism Center I told the

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

that congressional oversight of the

intelligence activities is critical and

essential to successful operations with

the intelligence community having served

as the director of the National

Counterterrorism Center for eight months

and as the Acting Director of National

Intelligence for the past six weeks I

continue to believe strongly that the

role of congressional oversight as I

pledged to the Senate I pledge to you

today that I will continue to work

closely with Congress while I'm serving

either in this capacity as Acting

Director of National Counterterrorism or

when I return to the National

Counterterrorism Center to ensure you

are fully and currently informed of

intelligence activities to facilitate

your ability to perform your oversight

of the intelligence community the

American people expect us to keep them

safe the intelligence community cannot

do that without this committee support

preferred I turn to the matter of hand

there are a few things I would like to

say I am NOT partisan and I am NOT

political I believe in a life of service

and I'm honored to be a

public servant I served under eight

presidents while I was in uniform I have

taken the oath to the Constitution

eleven times the first time when I was

sworn into the United States Navy in

1974 and nine times during my subsequent

promotions in the United States Navy

most recently former director Dan coats

administered the oath of office last

December when I became the director of

the National Counterterrorism Center I

agree with you the oath is sacred it's a

foundation of our Constitution the oath

to me means not only that I swear truth

faith and allegiance to that sacred

document but more importantly I view it

as a covenant I have with my workforce

that I lead and every American that I

will well and faithfully discharge the

duties of my office I come from a long

line of public servants who has stepped

forward even in the most difficult times

in austere times to support and defend

our country when I took my uniform off

in July of 2010 it was the first time in

70 years that an immediate member of my

family was not wearing the cloth of the

nation as a Naval Special Warfare

Officer I had the honor of commanding at

every level in the seal community it was

at times very demanding but the rewards

of serving in America's Special

Operations community more than make up

for the demands after my retirement I

was fortunate to work for a great

private sector firm I left the business

world after three years to lead a

non-profit charity some questioned why I

would leave a promising business career

to run a charity the answer was quite

simple it was another opportunity to

serve I led a foundation dedicated to

honoring the sacrifice of our fallen and

severely wounded special operators the

foundation I led enabled hundreds of

children of our fallen to attend college

it was extremely meaningful and

rewarding in the winter of 2018 I was

asked by former director Dan coach to

return to government service to lead the

National Counterterrorism Center

this request was totally unexpected and

was not a position I saw it but then

again it was another opportunity to

serve my country in particular I knew

that many of the young sailors and

junior officers that I had trained 20

years earlier were now senior combat

veterans deploying and still sacrificing

I decided that they could continue to

serve returning to government service

was the very least I could do and now

here I am sitting before you as the

Acting Director of National Intelligence

with last month's departure of dan

coates and sue gordon two exceptional

leaders and friends I was asked to step

into their very big shoes and leave the

intelligence community until the

president nominates and the Senate

confirms the next Director of National

Intelligence I accepted this

responsibility because I love this

country I have a deep and profound

respect for the men and women of our

intelligence community and the mission

we execute every day on behalf of the

American people throughout my career I

have served and led through turbulent

times I have governed every action by

the following criteria it must be legal

it must be moral and it must be ethical

no one can take an individual's

integrity away it can only be given away

if every action meets those criteria you

will always be a person of integrity and

by nearly four decades of public service

my integrity has never been questioned

until now I'm here today to

unequivocally state that is acting DNI I

will continue the same faithful and

nonpartisan support and am added that

adheres to the Constitution and the laws

of this great country as long as I serve

in this position for whatever period of

time that may be I want to make it clear

that I have upheld my responsibility to

follow the law every step of the way in

the matter that is before us today I

want to also state my support for

whistleblower and rights and the laws

whistleblowing has a long history in our

country dating back to the Continental

Congress this is not surprising because

as a nation

we desire for good government therefore

we must protect those who demonstrate

courage to report alleged wrongdoing

whether on the battlefield or in the

workplace indeed at the start of ethics

training the executive branch each year

we are reminded that public service is a

public trust and as public servants we

have a solemn responsibility to do

what's right which includes reporting

concerns of waste fraud and abuse and

bringing such matters to the attention

of Congress under the intelligence

community Whistleblower Protection Act I

applaud all employees who come forward

under this act I am committed to

ensuring that all whistleblower

complaints are handled appropriately and

to protecting the rights of

whistleblowers in this case the

complainant raised a matter with the

intelligence community Inspector General

the Inspector General is properly

protecting the complainants identity and

will not permit the complainant to be

subject to any retaliation or adverse

consequences for communicating the

complaint to the inspector general

upholding the integrity of the

intelligence community and the work

force is my number one priority

throughout my career I relied on the men

and women of the intelligence community

to do their jobs so I could do mine and

I could personally attest that their

efforts saved lives

I would now like to turn to the

complaint and provide a general

background on how we got to where we are

today on August 26th the Inspector

General forwarded to me from an employee

in the intelligence community the

Inspector General stated that the

complaint raised an urgent concern a

legally defined term under Whistleblower

Protection Act that has been discussed

at length and our letters to the

committee on September 16 and 17 before

I turn to the discussion about whether

the complaint needs the definition of

urgent concern I first want to talk

about an even more fundamental issue

upon reviewing the complaint we were

immediately struck by the fact that many

of the allegations of the complaint are

based on a conversation between the

President and another foreign leader

such calls are typically subject to

of privilege as a result we consulted

with the White House counsel's office

and we're advised that much of the

information the complaint was in fact

subject to executive privilege a

privilege that I do not have the

authority to waive because of that we

were unable to immediately share the

details of the complaint with this

committee but continue to consult with

the White House counsel's in an effort

to do so

yesterday the president released the

transcripts of the call in question and

therefore we are now able to disclose

the details of both complaint and the

Inspector General's letter transmitting

to us as a result I have provided the

House and Senate intelligence committees

with the full unredacted complaint as

well as the Inspector General's letter

let me also discuss the issue of urgent

concern when transmitting a complaint to

me the Inspector General took the legal

position that because the complaint

alleges matters of urgent concern and

because he found the allegations to be

credible I was required unto the

intelligence community whistleblower

protection act to follow the complaint

to our oversight committees within seven

days of receiving it as we have

previously explained in our letters

urgent concern is a statutorily defined

term to be an urgent concern the

allegations must in addition to being

classified assert a flagrant serious

problem abuse or violation of law and

relate to the funding administration or

operation of an intelligent activity

within the responsibilities of the

Director of National Intelligence

however this complaint conduct this

complaint concerns conduct by someone

outside the intelligence community

unrelated to funding administration or

operation of an intelligence activity

under my supervision because the

allegation on the face did not appear to

fall in the statutory framework my

office consulted with the United States

Department Justice Office of Legal

Counsel and included we included the

Inspector General in those consultation

after reviewing the complaint and the

Inspector General's transmittal letter

the office of legal counsel determined

that the complaints allegations do not

meet the statutory requirement

definition concern legal urgent concern

and found that I was not legally

required to transmit the material to our

Oversight Committee under The

Whistleblower Protection Act an

unclassified version of that Office of

Legal Counsel memo was publicly released

as you know for those of us in the

executive branch office of legal counsel

opinions are binding on all of us

in particular the office of legal

counsel opinion states that the

president is not a member of the

intelligence community and the

communication with the foreign leader

involved no intelligence operation or

activity aimed at collecting or

analyzing foreign intelligence well as

OLC opinion did not require transmission

of the complaint to the committee's it

did leave me with the discretion to

forward the complaint to the committee

however given the executive privilege

issues I discussed neither the Inspector

General nor I were able to share the

details of the complaint at the time

when the Inspector General informed me

that he still intended to notify the

Committees of the existence of the

complaint mr. Chairman I supported that

decision to ensure the committee's were

kept as informed as possible

of this process move forward I want to

raise a few other points about the

situation we find ourselves in first I

want to stress that I believe that the

whistleblower and the Inspector General

have acted in good faith throughout I

have every reason to believe that they

have done everything by the book and

followed the law respecting the

privileged nature of the information and

patiently waiting while the executive

privilege issues were resolved wherever

possible we have worked in partnership

with the Inspector General on this

matter well we have differing opinions

on the issue whether or not is his

urgent concern I strongly believe in the

role of the inspector general I greatly

valued the independence he brings to and

his debt

patient and his role in keeping me and

the committee's informed of matters

within the Intelligence Committee second

although executive privilege prevented

us from sharing the details of the

complaint with the committee's until

recently this does not mean that the

complaint was ignored the Inspector

General and consultation with my office

referred this matter to the Department

of Justice for investigation finally I

appreciate that in the past was a blower

complaints may have been provided to the

Congress regardless of whether they were

deemed credible or satisfied the urgent

recurrent urgent concern requirement

however I am not familiar with any prior

instances where a whistleblower

complaint touched on such complicated

and sensitive issues including executive

privilege I believe that this matter is

unprecedented I also believe that I

handle this matter in full compliance

with the law at all times and I am

committed to doing so sir I appreciate

the committee providing me this

opportunity to discuss this matter the

ongoing commitment to work with the

Congress on your important oversight

role thank you very much sir thank you

director would you agree that the

whistleblower complaint alleges serious

wrongdoing by the President of the

United States the whistleblower

complaint

involved the allegation of that it is

not for me in the intelligence community

to decide how the president conducts as

a foreign policy or his interaction with

leaders of other countries sir I'm not

asking you to opine on how the president

conducts foreign policy I'm asking you

whether as the statute requires this

complaint involved serious wrongdoing in

this case by the President of the United

States an allegation of serious

wrongdoing by the President of the

United States is that not the subject of

this complaint yes that is the subject

of the allegation

of the complaint and two things mr.

chairman and let me ask you about that

the Inspector General found that serious

allegation of misconduct by the

President credible did you also find

that credible I did not criticize the

Inspector General's decision on whether

it not was credible my question was

whether it not we have whether or not it

meets the urgent concern and the

seven-day timeframe that would follow

but so is notif on my question laughter

I have no no question in his judgment

that he considers it a serious matter

well issue that I don't and you would

you would concur would you not director

that this complaint alleging serious

wrongdoing by the president was credible

it's not for me to judge sir the it is

commuted it is for you to judge

apparently I mean I agree it's not for

you to judge you shall provide it to

Congress but but indeed you did judge

whether this complaint should be

provided to Congress and we can we at

least agree that the Inspector General

made a sound conclusion that this

whistle blower complaint was credible

that is correct that is in the cover

letter that's been provided to other

committee I believe that's also been

public the decision and the

recommendation by the inspector general

that in fact the allegation was credible

can we also agree that it was urgent

that if the President of the United

States was withholding military aid to

an ally even as you received the

complaint and was doing so for in the

various reason that is to exercise

leverage or the president of Ukraine to

dig up manufactured dirt on his opponent

can we agree that it was urgent while

that aid was being withheld there's two

there are two things I'm talking about

the lay the common understanding of what

urgent means because inspector general

said this was urgent

not only in a statutory meaning this was

urgent as everyone understands that term

can we agree that it was urgent it was

urgent and important but my job as the

Director of National Intelligence was to

comply with the whistleblower protection

and that cut here to the definition of

urgent concern which is a legal term and

to adhere to the meaning of the term

shall yes sir in this case you sought a

second opinion or whether shall really

means shall by going to the White House

no sir there were two things as I said

in my statement one it appeared that it

also had matters of executive privilege

I am not authorized as the Director of

National Intelligence to waive executive

privilege and at any time at any time

over the last month that you held this

complaint did the White House assert

executive privilege mr. Chairman I have

endeavored I think that's a yes or no

question did they ever assert executive

privilege they were working through the

executive privilege procedures in

deciding whether or not to exert

executive privilege and so they they

never exerted executive privilege is

that the answer the if mr. chairman

if they did we would not have released

the letter yesterday and all the

information that had been forthcoming no

the first place you went was to the

White House am I to understand that from

your opening statement it wasn't the

department justice first place you went

for a second opinion was to the White

House I did not go for a second opinion

the question was is the information

contained here subject to executive

privilege not whether it not it made

urgent concern and and so the first

place you went for advice as to whether

you should provide the complaint as the

statute requires to Congress was the

White House I am not authorized as the

Director of National Intelligence to

provide executive privilege information

I think it is prudent as a member of the

executive branch to check to ensure that

in fact it does not

I'm just asking about the sequencing

here did you first go to the White House

if you determine whether you should

provide a complaint to Congress no sir

that was not the question the question

was whether or not it has

executive privilege not whether or not I

should send it on to Congress okay is

the first party you went to outside of

your office to seek advice a counsel

direction the White House I have

consulted with the White House Counsel

and eventually we also consulted with

the Department of Justice Office of

Legal Counsel and my question is did you

go to the White House first I went to

the Office of Legal Counsel for advice

yes sir

that well I'm asking which went to first

did you go to the Department of Justice

office legal counsel first or did you go

to the White House first I went to the

office right excuse me my team my office

went to the Office of Legal Counsel

first toured to receive whether or not

the matter in the letter and in the

complaint might meet the executive

privilege they viewed it and said we've

determined that it appears to be

executive privilege and until executive

privilege is determined and cleared I

did not have the authority to be able to

send that forward to the committee I

worked with the Office of Legal Counsel

for the past several weeks to get

resolution on this it's a very

deliberate process well director I'm

just I'm still trying to sign a

chronology so you first went the office

of legal counsel and then you went to

White House Counsel we went and then to

the repeat that please sir I'm just

trying to send the chronology you first

went to the office little counsel and

then you went to the White House Counsel

no no sir

no sir no we went to the we went to the

White House first to determine to ask

okay that's all I wanted to as

pronounced you went to the White House

first so you went to the subject of the

complaint for advice first about whether

you should provide the complaint to

Congress there were issues within this

couple of things one it did appear that

it has executive privilege if it does

have executive privilege it is the White

House that determines that I cannot

determine that as the Director of

National Intelligence but in this case

the the White House the president is the

subject of the complaint he's

subject of the wrongdoing were you aware

when you went to the White House for

advice about whether evidence of

wrongdoing by the White House should be

provided to the Congress were you aware

that the White House Counsel has taken

the unprecedented position that the

privilege applies to communications

involving the president when he was

present involving the president when he

wasn't president involving people who

never served in administration involving

people who never served in the

ministration even when they're not even

talking to the president were you aware

that that is the the unprecedent

position of the White House the White

House you went to for advice about

whether you should turn over a complaint

involving the White House mr. chairman

as I said in my opening statement I

believe that everything here in this

matter is totally unprecedented and that

is why my former directors of National

Intelligence forwarded them to you

whether and not admit urgent concern or

whether it was serious this was

different and to me it just seemed

prudent to be able to check and ensure

as a member of the executive branch

before I sent it forward I just have a

couple more questions on the turnover

the ranking member and he may consume as

much time as I did the second place you

went to was the Justice Department and

you went to that department headed by a

man bill Barr who was also implicated in

the complaint and you knew that when you

went to the Department of Justice for an

opinion correct that bill Barr was

mentioned in the complaint mr. chairman

I went to the office of legal counsel in

consultation with the IC IG he was a

part of that to receive whether or not

this met the criteria yes but that IC IG

vehemently disagreed with the opinion of

the bill Barr Justice Department did he

not he still met considered it a matter

of urgent concern however as you know

opinions from Department of Justice

Office of Legal Counsel are binding on

all of us in the executive branch well

let me ask you this do you think it's

appropriate that you go to

a department run by someone who's the

subject of the complaint to get advice

or who is a subject of the complaint or

implicated in the complaint for advice

as to whether you should provide that

complaint to Congress did that conflict

of interest concern you mr. chairman

when I saw this report and complained

immediately I knew that this was a

serious matter it came to me and I just

thought it would be prudent well I'm not

sure I'm just asking if the conflict of

interest concern to you that well sir I

have to work with what I've got and that

is the office of legal counsel within

the executive branch well when you also

had was a statute that says shall and

even then you said you had the

discretion to provide it but but did not

because it did not meet the matter of

urgent concern that took away the

seven-day timeline I have endeavored to

work with the office of legal counsel in

order to get the material to you which

we you have provided to you yesterday

now I have to tell you chairman it is

not perhaps at the timeline

that I would have desired or you but the

office of legal counsel has to make sure

they make prudent decisions and

yesterday when the president released

the transcripts of his call with the

president of the Ukraine then they could

no longer it's not executive privilege

no longer applied and that is when I was

free to be able to send the complaint to

the committee director you don't believe

that whistleblower is a political hack

do you I don't know who the

whistleblower is mr. chairman to be

honest with you I've done my utmost to

make sure that I protect his anonymity

that doesn't sound like much of a

defense of the whistleblower here

someone you founded everything right you

don't believe the whistleblower is a

political hack do you director I believe

that as I said before mr. Chairman I

believe the whistleblower is operating

in good faith well then they come on the

law they couldn't be in good faith if

they were acting as a political hack

could they mr. chairman my job is to

support and lead the entire intelligence

community that individual works for me

therefore it is my job to make sure that

I support and defend that person you

don't have any reason to accuse them of

disloyalty to our country or suggest

they're beholden to some other country

have you no sir absolutely not I believe

that the whistleblower followed steps

every step of the way however the

statute was one in this situation

involving the President of the United

States who is not in the intelligence

community or matters underneath my

supervision did not meet the criteria

for urgent concern I'm just asking about

the whistleblower right now I think the

whistleblower did the right thing I

think he followed the law every step of

the way and we just got stuck with it

then why director when the president

called the whistleblower political hack

and suggested that he or she might be

disloyal to the country why did you

remain silent I did not remain silent

mr. Chairman I assured a statement to my

workforce telling the admitting my

commitment to the whistleblower

protection and ensuring that I would

provide protection to anybody within the

intelligence community who comes forward

but the way this thing was flowing out I

didn't think it was appropriate for me

to be making a press statement so that

we counter in each other every step I

think it was not only appropriate but

there's nothing that would have given

more confidence to the work force than

the hearing you publicly say no one

should be calling this professional who

did the right thing a hack or a traitor

or anything else I think that would have

meant a great deal to work force mr.

Nunez you're recognized

welcome mr. director it's a pleasure to

have you here and you're gonna be part

of a charade of legal word games they're

gonna try to get you to say something

that can be repeated by the media that

is here that wants to report this story

you I just want to get one thing

straight because one of the quotes are

going to use from you is you saying that

this was a credible complaint that will

be used and spun as you're saying that

it was true and I want to give you an

opportunity to you you do not you have

not investigated

the veracity or the truthfulness of this

complaint

that's correct ranking member the

determination uncredible was made by the

IC inspector general

he made the determination that it is

credible and he also made the

determination of urgent concern my

question was not I did not question his

judgment there the question I had was it

does in fact this allegation of

wrongdoing meet the criteria the

statutory criteria of urgent concern and

the other issue as I said complicated

things did it in fact the allegations

within this whistleblower complaint

involve executive privilege thank you

for clarifying that have you ever you

mentioned it a little bit in your

testimony but have you ever are you

aware of any former dnis who have

testified about whistleblower complaints

in the public not to my knowledge I

ranking member I do not know are you

aware of any cases like this that were

put into the spotlight is would this be

the way to handle it out in the public

like this I am not aware of any but I

want to say once again I believe that

the situation we have and why we're here

this morning is because this case is

unique and unprecedented so why our case

is normally not handled out in the

public all the other cases that came

before either this committee or the

Senate committee whether or not they met

the criteria of urgent concern were

forwarded because they involved members

of the intelligence community who were

in fact in organizations underneath the

dn eyes authority and responsibilities

this one just didn't come that way

because it involved a member an

individual who is not a member of the

intelligence community or an

organization underneath the authority of

the DNI so this one is different from

all others in the past and I am aware of

so I want to get into how this all got

out in the public over the last this has

basically been an orchestrated effort

over over two weeks

if you we were first told about it on a

week and a half ago and we were told

very specifically that the whistleblower

did not want to get any of this

information out they didn't want it to

leak out so there were only a few

potential groups of people that would

have known about this complaint you and

your people within your office yes sir

the people within the inspector

general's office and the whistleblower

and whoever that whistleblower gave this

information to so what I'm trying to

ascertain is how would it run in all the

mainstream media outlets how did they

get even though they got a lot of it

wrong but they had the basics of it that

it involved the the President of the

United States talking to a foreign

leader so did anybody you or anybody in

your office leaked this to the

Washington Post or NBC News rank you

remember I leave the intelligence

community we know how to keep a secret

as far as how that got into the press I

really do not know sir I just know that

it's all over the place and as you said

it's been reported by different media

for the past several weeks where they

get their information from I don't know

so that is you know it was not it was

not from the intelligence community from

me or from my office Thank You director

so this is not the first time this has

happened to this president that happened

with a call between the Mexican

president the Australian Prime Minister

so it's happened twice before the pieces

of transcripts leaked out and of course

this time it was leaked out again and

the president thankfully he was able to

put this out because of the because of

the actions of this of the situation as

you said is that's unprecedented is it

normal

for the president itíd states to have

their conversations leak out miss a

third time I would have to leave that to

the White House to to respond to that

their ranking member but to me the

President of the United States

conversation with any other head of

state I would consider privileged

conversation but clearly I mean those

conversations are being captured by the

intelligence agencies so not necessarily

sir I mean that if if the president

think I should say this they're captured

and then disseminated we're absurd and

disseminated to the intelligence

agencies I have to be careful in this

open hearing about you know how I

respond to that

the intelligence community and the

National Security Agency obviously you

know they collect things that to protect

I just want to make sure because I'm

just I mean are we just gonna foreign

leaders when Isis have either the

president United States not talk to

foreign leaders or we should just or

publishes publish all the transcripts

because that's what's happening here

ranking members then somebody's leaking

this and it's likely coming from from

the agencies that you oversee recognize

I mean I'm not saying that you don't

know but we had the the transcript of

the Mexican president the Australian

Prime Minister and now contents of a

call with the Ukrainian president leak

out ranking member the allegation in the

whistleblower complaint was that there

were about 12 people who listened in on

the conversation members of the National

Security Council and others and then

others were briefed from State

Department as well the transcripts

because they have our area

responsibilities and a region

responsibility then they would be

informed on the interaction so there

were a number of people that from the

White House brief from the call this

would not be something that well I'm

quiet I'm quite sure this this White

House probably didn't leak this out I

wouldn't say the White House but there

are individuals within the White House

that may or may not I don't know but it

would not be from an intelligence

intercept I will say that right I'm not

I'm just saying the dissemination the

dissemination

of these calls is supposed to be sacred

right I mean it's and it is important

for the State Department and the

appropriate agencies to get I'm not

saying it's all in the Intelligence

Agency but when a president talks to a

foreign leader it's confidential those

contents are confidential there could be

some facts of that conversation that you

do want to get to the appropriate agency

not just that not just the IC I want to

be clear about that but but this is now

the third time I'm not aware of this

ever happening before of contents of

calls like this getting out I really

don't know ranking member I'm not aware

I don't have the other numbers to think

it just seems to me though that it is

unprecedented and I would also say I

think that the decision by the president

yesterday to release the transcripts of

his conversation with the president the

Ukraine is probably unprecedented as

well well appreciate you being here and

have fun be careful what you say cuz

they're gonna use these words against

you well I'll tell you what ranking

member either way I wanted to be here

and I wanted to be leading below and I

appreciate your service to this country

for a long time and I'm sure we'll be

talking again soon hopefully not in the

public hopefully behind closed doors

like this is supposed to be done thank

you very much I yield back mr. Himes

Thank You mr. chairman director McGuire

thank you for being here and thank you

for your profound service and the

service of your family to this country

director what I find bewildering about

this whole conversation is that we are

not sitting here today and the American

public is not aware of the allegations

of the president asking for a favor of

investigation into his political

opponent we're not aware of the murky

decision to withhold aid we're not aware

of mr. Giuliani is a parent

establishment of a personal State

Department we are not aware of a

possible retaliation against a US

Ambassador none of this happens but for

the decision of your Inspector General

Michael Atkinson a man who was appointed

by President Trump and confirmed by a

Republican Senate to come to this

committee

seven days after the complaint was

required by law to be transmitted to us

it was his decision personal decision

not the kaleidoscope of fantabulous dick

conspiracy theories the ranking member

thinks is happening here but it was the

decision of Michael Atkinson an

appointee of this President to come to

this committee following not advice from

you or any law but following his own

conscience without his decision to do

this none of this is happening correct

I applaud Michael I applaud Michael's

the way he has done this he has acted in

good faith he has followed the law every

step of the way

the question is congressman does it get

it or did it not meet the legal

definition no no sir I asked a very

different question which was without his

decision it's a simple question without

his decision none of this is happening

is that correct well we got it back up

to the whistleblower as well so okay and

I should have noted that the

whistleblower also deserves the same

accolades that mr. Atkinson does a

director were you ever advised by the

White House not to provide this

complaint to Congress for any reason no

congressman okay and as I understand it

the opinion was that you were not

obligated to convey despite the very

clear wording of the law to convey the

complaint to Congress so the decision

was taken to defy a subpoena of this

Congress the subpoena of sever September

17th to turn over the complaint who made

the decision to defy that subpoena of

September 17th

congressman urgent concerns sir I'm

asking a very simple question who made

the decision to defy the congressional

subpoena somebody said we will not abide

by the subpoena and I'd like to know who

that somebody was congressman nobody did

I endeavored once we no longer had

urgent concern with the seven-day

timeline here to work to get the

information to the committee what I

needed to do was to get work through the

executive privilege hurdle

with the office of legal counsel at the

White House although this was the most

important issue to me you know the White

House has got quite a few other issues

that they were dealt with you know I

would have liked to have had as I said

to the chairman that perhaps this moved

a little faster than it did but this is

a very deliberate process and finally

you know they came to a head yesterday

so with you know when I received the

information on the 26th of August we had

seven days based on The Whistleblower

Protection Act all we did was lose those

seven days it may have taken longer than

we would have liked but you would have

liked but you have the information so

just so I'm focused on the subpoena yes

sir the subpoenas on your desk it's a

subpoena of the Congress of the United

States it's pretty clear in what it

asked for you're saying that a decision

was never taken not to comply with that

subpoena and yet somehow it wasn't

complied with I'm again I'm looking for

the decision-making process to ignore a

legal congressional subconscious but I

did not ignore I dealt with the chairman

of this committee and asked to have one

more week to be able to do what I needed

to do to get this information released

he was gracious enough in this committee

was also so very supportive it wasn't

something that it was ready to go but I

was committed fully committed to this

committee and to the Chairman to get

that information and I finally was able

to provide that yesterday

okay thank you director um director did

you or your office ever speak to the

president United States about this

complaint congressman I'm I'm the

president's intelligence officer I speak

with him several times throughout the

week sir let me repeat my question did

you ever speak to the president about

this complaint my conversations with the

president because I'm the Director of

National Intelligence are privileged and

it would be inappropriate for me because

it would destroy my relationship with

the president in intelligence matters to

be divulge any of my conversations with

the President of the United States but

just so we can be clear for the record

you are not denying that you spoke to

the president about this complaint what

I'm saying congressman is that I will

not disqualify

as the Director of National Intelligence

with the president has the White House

instructed you to assert that privilege

no sir that's just it's just a member of

the executive committee I'm an executive

branch as a member of the National

Security Council and also mount the

homeland committee and that's you know I

had just have to maintain the discretion

and protect a conversation with the

president the United States that Thank

You director I appreciate that answer

apparently the clock is broken but I

will yield back the balance of my time

Thank You congressman mr. Conway I think

my chairman I'd well thanks for being

here you and I are at a competitive

disadvantage because neither one of us

are lawyers and that may be a badge of

honor for some of us you have lawyers on

your staff circle I do congressman and

your lawyers have looked at this urgent

concern definition thoroughly and have

given you advice yes congressman if the

black-letter law was so clear in

black-letter how is it that we've got

different attorneys give a nice you and

I different opinions that's a rhetorical

question that with respect to this issue

just to clarify Mike åkesson was in our

group in front of us last week did a

very good job of telling us what he did

what he didn't do we now know for sure

what it is that he was able to do as

part of his investigation he did not

request records of the call from the

president and the reason he did is he

cited the difficulty of working through

all of that would have probably meant

that he couldn't comply with the 14-day

timeframe so even he did not try to

overrun the White House's executive

privilege over the conversation that

President had with the president izinski

he also said in his letter I also

determined this is quoting Michael I

also determined that there were

reasonable grounds to believe that

information relating to the urgent

concern appeared credible now that's a

different statement than a flat-out it's

credible just again a rhetorical

statement is there anything as statute

from your lawyers in advising you that

says that the determination of urgent

concern lies solely with the IC IG no

sir I was never advised by my legal

counsel

to that effect right has the knowledge

as it Justice Department ever weighed in

to say that the fact that D and I can't

make a separate decision with respect to

this seven day process that the matter

is not a virgin concern as you've as

your team decided the matter of virtue

concern is a legally defining term it's

pretty much either yes or no well

apparently that's not the case Admiral

because I G said it was and and you're

saying it's not on to that legal

definition because it involved the

president he's uh last time I checked

you're pretty familiar with change the

command I know he's not in you're not

he's not a near chain of command you're

in his chain of command and so for very

different reasons appear to be credible

it doesn't meet the statutorily urgent

concerned definition with respect to the

whistleblower protections of the IG and

your team made that they made that call

the Spector general made a different

call no no sir it was the Department of

Justice Office of Legal Counsel that

made the determination that it was not

urgent concern all we wanted to do was

just check and see and to me it just

seemed prudent with the matter at hand

right now to be able to just make sure

that in fact it did and when it didn't I

want to say once again I endeavored to

get that information to this committee

okay so just to clarify the role that

that Inspector General had with respect

to that support lis justice I heard you

say that he was involved in the

conversations allowed to make his case

but also said you gave him the letter

gave the Justice Department letter what

was what was his exact involvement in

making his case to Justice Department to

his decision was he actually their

president physically or his lawyers

their most to the best of my knowledge

the IC IGS transmittal letter as well as

the complaint from the whistleblower

were forwarded to the Office of Legal

Counsel for their determination I

believe that that is what they based

their opinion on okay so they'll think

if I'm incorrect I will come back to the

committee and correct that sir okay

appreciate that

you know tough spot appreciate your long

storied history I apologize if your

integrity was assaulted that happens in

this arena a lot sometimes justified in

most of time not and yours insulted your

integrity was not justified in interests

the fact that we have differences of

opinion when we start losing those

difference of opinion we start to attack

each other call each other names and

those kinds of things and so my

experiences is when you've got a legal

matter I've got lawyers I've got I pay

you've got lawyers you pay a step it's

typically stick with the lawyers that

I'm paying and so you get good legal

advice on this issue and I really tough

so I wanted to make sure that this

whistleblower was protected but at the

same time that if in fact there was

something awry here that it would it

would be get the full airing that it's

clearly getting so thank you for your

service and I yield back

thank you very much congressman masuleh

Thank You mr. chairman and director

McGuire thanks so much for being here I

want to turn to what I fear may be one

of the most damaging long-term effects

of this whistleblower episode and that

is the chilling effect that it will have

on others in government who may witness

misconduct but now may be afraid to come

forward to report it sir I'm worried

that government employees and

contractors may see how important this

situation has played out and decide it's

not worth putting themselves on the line

the fact that a whistleblower followed

all of the proper procedures to report

misconduct and then the Department of

Justice and the White House seems to

have weighed in to keep the complaint

hidden is problematic sir I want to know

whether or not you see how problematic

this will be and having a chilling

effect on members of the I see that you

are sworn to represent and ostensibly

protect congresswoman I think that's a

fair assessment I don't disagree with

what you've said I have endeavored to

transmitted to the intelligence

community my support the whistleblowers

and I'm quite sure that for at least two

hours this morning there are not many

people in the intelligence community who

are doing anything that's productive

besides watching this right and so my

concern I think is a valid one that in

fact what has happened with this

whistleblower episode will have a

chilling effect I just also want to ask

you have you given direction to this

whistleblower that he can in fact or he

or she can in fact come before Congress

director when the president called the

whistleblower a political hack and

suggested that he or she was potentially

disloyal to the country you remain

silent I'm not sure why but I also think

that that adds to the chilling effect

the statute seems pretty clear that you

shall everybody has a role to play the

processing is pretty clear and part of

it also includes you directing the

whistleblower of his or her protected

rights can you confirm that you've

directed that whistleblower that he or

she can come before Congress well

congresswoman that there are several

questions there one I do not know the

identity of the whistleblower - now that

the complaint has come forward we are

working with his counsel in order to be

able to provide them with security

clearance yes sir

I think it's pretty nice my question is

pretty simple can you assure this

committee and the American public that

the whistleblower is authorized to speak

to the committee with the full

protections of the whistleblower Act can

you confirm that that's a guess or no

question right now I'm working through

that with the chair and to the best of

my ability

I believe the chair is was asking to

have the whistleblower come forward and

I'm working with counsel with the

committee to support that can you assure

the American public that the end result

will be that the whistleblower will be

able to come before this committee and

Congress and have the full protections

of the whistled after

what is the whistleblower a statue for

if not to provide those full protections

against retaliation against litigation

congressman I am doing everything to

endeavour to support that will the

gentlewoman yield yes um director I do

have your assurance that once you work

out the security clearances for the

whistleblowers counsel that that

whistleblower will be able to relate the

full facts within his knowledge the

concern wrongdoing by the President or

anyone else that he or she will not be

inhibited and what they can tell our

committee that there will not be some

minder from the White House or elsewhere

sitting next to them telling them what

they can answer or not answer do I have

your assurance that the whistleblower

will be able to testify fully and freely

and enjoy the protections of the law yes

congressman thank you I yield back to

the gentleman

so mr. director I also wanted to

understand what you're going to do to

try to ensure the trust of the employees

and contractors that you represent to

assure the American people that the

whistleblower statue is in fact being

properly adhered to and that no further

efforts would be to obstruct an

opportunity for a whistleblower who has

watched misconduct to actually get

justice congresswoman yeah supporting

and leading the membrane and women of

the intelligence committed in my highest

priority I don't consider that they work

for me as a Director of National

Intelligence

I believe that I you sir I just want to

say and go on record as being very clear

that this will have a chilling effect

and that that is exactly not what the

statute was intended for it was intended

for transparency

it was pretended it was intended and

also to give the whistleblower certain

protections and I think the American

people deserve that thank you

Thank You congressman mr. Turner

director thank you for being here thank

you for your your service and the the

clarity at which you have described the

deliberations that you went through and

applying the laws with respect to this

complaint it is incredibly admirable in

the manner in which you've approached

this now I've read the complaint and

I've read the transcript of the

conversation with the president and the

president of Ukraine concerning that

conversation I want to say to the

president this is not okay

it isn't that conversation is not okay

and I think it's disappointing to the

American public when they read the

transcript I can say what else it is not

it is not what's in the complaint we now

have the complaint and the transcript

and people can read that the allegations

of the complaint and the complaint are

not the allegations of the subject

matter of this conversation what else

it's not it's not the conversation that

was in the Chairman's opening statement

and while the Chairman was speaking I

actually had someone text me is he just

making this up and and yes yes he was

because sometimes fiction is better than

the actual words or the text luckily the

American public you're smart and they

have the transcript they've read the

conversation they know when someone's

just making it up now we've seen this

movie before we've been here all year on

litigating impeachment well long before

the July 25th conversation happened

between the president and the president

of Ukraine and we've heard the clicks of

the cameras in this intelligence

committees room where we've not been

focusing on the issues of the national

security threats but instead of the

calls and for impeachment which is

really an assault on the electorate not

just as president now the complaint we

now have a mr. director is based on

hearsay the person who wrote it says I

talked to people and they told me these

things part American public has the

transcript in the complaint so they have

the ability to compare them what's clear

about the complaint is it's based on

political issues mr. director he's

alleging or she is alleging that the

actions of the president were political

in nature now that's my concern about

how this is applied to the

whistleblowers

whistleblower statute is intended to

better provide those in the intelligence

community an opportunity to come to

Congress when they're concerned about

abuses of powers and laws but it's about

the intelligence community it's about

abuse of surveillance about the abuse of

the the spy mechanisms that we have it

this is about the actually the product

of surveillance somebody has been had

access to surveillance that related the

president's conversations and has

brought us forward to us I'd like for

you to turn for a moment and tell us

your thoughts of the whistleblower

process and that the the concerns as to

why it has to be there so that the

intelligence community can be held

accountable and we can have oversight

because it certainly wasn't there to for

oversight of the president it was there

for oversight for the intelligence

community so if you could describe your

thoughts on that and then I was very

interested in your discussion but on the

issue of executive privilege because

there's been much a made of the fact

that the law says on the whistleblower

statute that you shall clearly you have

a conflict of laws when you have both

the executive privilege issue and the

issue of the word shell so first could

you tell us the importance of the

whistleblower statute with respect to

accountability of the intelligence

community and our role of oversight

there and then your you'll process your

effects of being stuck in the middle

where you have these conflicts of laws

mr. director congressman the

intelligence community Whistleblower

Protection Act is to apply to the

intelligence community and then at it

pertains to financial administrative or

operational activities within the

intelligence community in the under the

oversight and responsibilities of the

Director of National Intelligence it

does not allow a member of the

intelligence community to report any

wrongdoing that comes from anywhere in

the federal government the written and

and so with that I do believe that

that is about the intelligence

Whistleblower Protection Act was the

best vehicle that the whistleblower had

to use it came to me and discussion with

Ric IG who is a colleague and the

determination was made you know by the

well that that he viewed that it was in

fact credible and that it was a matter

of urgent concern and I just thought it

would be prudent to have another opinion

I have worked with lawyers my whole

career whether it was the rule of armed

conflict Admiralty claims or rules of

engagement or just the Uniform Code of

Military Justice and I have found that

different lawyers have different

opinions on the same subject we have

nine justices of the Supreme Court more

often than not the opinions of five four

that doesn't mean that five all right

and four are wrong there are differences

of opinion but when this matter came to

me I have a lot of life experience I

realized the importance of the matter

that is before us this morning and I

thought that it would be prudent for me

to ensure that in fact it meant that

statute before I sent it forward in

compliance with The Whistleblower

Protection Act and I hope that responds

to your question say Beck as an aside I

want to mention that my colleague is

right on both counts it's not okay but

also my summary of the president's call

was meant to be at least part in parity

the fact that that's not clear is a

separate problem in and of itself of

course the president never said if I if

you don't understand me I'm gonna save

seven more times my point is that's the

message that the Ukraine president was

receiving and not so many words

mr. Carsen Thank You chairman Schiff

Thank You director McGuire for your

service director McGuire this appears to

be the first intelligence community

whistleblower complaint it as ever

ever been withheld from Congress is that

right sir a congressman Carson I believe

that it might be and once again I said

in my statement it is in fact as far as

I'm concerned unprecedented it is

unprecedented sir do you know why it's

unprecedented I think it's because the

law that Congress that this very

committee a drafted really couldn't be

clearer it states that upon receiving

such an urgent complaint from the

inspector general you the Director of

National Intelligence quote shall and

quote forward it to the Intel committees

within seven days no ifs ands or buts

and even when the IG has found

complaints not to be an urgent concern

or even credible your office has

consistently and uniformly still

transmitted those complaints to the

intelligence committees is that right

sir congressman Carson in the past even

if they were not a matter of urgent

concern or whether they were not

credible

they were forwarded but in each and

every instance prior to this in involved

members of the intelligence community

who are serving in organizations

underneath the dories from the control

of the DNI this one is different because

it did not meet those two criteria

director does executive privilege sir in

your mind or laws that regulate the

intelligence community preempt or negate

even the laws that safeguard the

security of America's democratic

elections and her democracy itself sir

no chairman Carson it does not yet

notwithstanding director of this

unambiguous mandate and the consistent

practice of your office that you would

held this urgent complaint from Congress

at the direction of the White House and

the Justice Department you follow their

orders instead of the law and if the

Inspector General had not brought this

complaint to our attention you and the

Trump administration might have gotten

away with this unprecedented action sir

you released a statement yesterday

affirming your oath to the Constitution

your dedication to the rule of law but

I'm having trouble understanding how

that statement can be true in light of

the facts here can you explain that to

us sir

congressman Carson a couple of things

the White House did not did not direct

me to withhold the information neither

did the Office of Legal Counsel that

opinion has been unclassified and has

been disseminated the question came down

to urgent concern which is a legal

definition it doesn't mean is it

important is it timely urgent concern

met the certain criteria that we've

discussed several times here so we did

not and all that did sir was then just

take away the seven days now as I said

before just because it was not forwarded

to this committee does not mean that it

went unanswered the IC IG and the

Justice Department referred it to the

Federal Bureau of Investigation for

investigation so this is nothing and

that was working while I was endeavoring

to get the executive privilege concerns

addressed so that it can then be

forwarded it was not stonewalling I

didn't receive direction from anybody I

was just trying to work through the

process and the law the way it is

written I have to comply with the way

the law is not the way some people would

like it to be a head of like could do

otherwise it would have been much more

convenient for me job congressman and

lastly director as you sit here today

sir do you commit to providing every

single whistleblower complaint intended

for Congress to the intelligence

committees as required by the statute

sir if it's required by the statute

congressman Carson yes I will

that's good to know sir and I certainly

hope so because I think the

unprecedented decision to withhold this

whistleblower complaint from Congress I

think it raises concerns very serious

concerns for us and for me and I think

that we need to get to the bottom of

this I yield the balance of my time

chairman thank you Thank You congressman

Carson thank you how much time does the

gentleman have remaining

27 okay well director you are not

directed to withhold the complaint is

that your testimony yes that's

absolutely true

so you exercise your discretion to

withhold the complaint from the

committee I did not sir what I did was I

delayed it because it did not meet the

statutory definition of urgent concern

and I was working through and in

director you're aware we've spent a lot

of time focusing on the definition of

urgent concern you're aware that the

practice of your office has been that

regardless of whether the complaint

meets the definition of an urgent

concern regardless of whether Inspector

General found it credible or incredible

the complaint is always given to our

committee you're aware that's the

unbroken practice since the

establishment of your office and the

inspector general are you aware of that

chairman every previous whistleblower

complaint that was forwarded to the

intelligence committees involved a

member of the intelligence community and

an organization under which the Director

of National Intelligence had authority

and responsibility and but you're aware

that the the past practice has been

we're talking about urgent concern here

that whether you or the inspector

general everybody else believes it meets

the statutory definition the past

practice has always been to give it to

this committee you're aware of that

right I am aware that this is

unprecedented

okay and they said everything and and

with that sir I agree this has never

happened before but they again this is a

unique situation but but you director

made the decision you made the decision

to withhold it from the committee for a

month when the White House had made no

claim of executive privilege when the

Department of Justice said you don't

have to give it to them but you can you

made the decision not to know that true

sir

what the Office of Legal Counsel said

that it does not meet the legal

definition of urgent concerns so it's

say you're not required it didn't say

you cannot provide it it said you're not

required to that is if you don't want to

we're not going to force you you're not

required but it didn't say you can't am

i right what it what it

allowed me and I said that in my opening

statement but even so it was referred to

the FBI for investigation and I was

endeavoring to get the information to

you mr. chairman but I could not

followed it as a member of the executive

branch without executive privileges

being addressed and and I feel that the

White House Counsel was doing the best

that they could in order to get that and

it took longer than I would have liked

that's for sure but that came to well

with conclusion yesterday with the

release of the transcripts and because

the transcripts were released that no

longer was there a situation of

executive privilege and I was then free

to send both the expected generals cover

letter and the complaint to you doctor

there's no time was there any intent on

my part sir ever to withhold the

information from you as the chair this

committee or the Senate Intelligence

director I wish I had the confidence of

knowing that but for this hearing but

for the deadline that we were forced to

set with this airing that we would have

been provided that complaint but I don't

know that we would have ever seen that

complaint doctor winstram Thank You mr.

chairman and I thank you mr. McGuire for

being here today

you know I think it's a shame that we

started off this hearing with fictional

remarks the implication of a

conversation that took place between a

president and a foreign leader putting

words into it that did not exist they're

not in the transcript and I will contend

that those were intentionally not clear

and the Chairman described it as parody

and I don't believe that this is the

time or the place for parody when we are

trying to seek facts nor do those that

were involved with the conversation

agree with the parody that the Chairman

gave us and unfortunately today many

innocent Americans are going to turn on

their TV and the media is only going to

show that section of what the Chairman

had to say but I'm also glad to know

that many Americans have seen this movie

too many times and they're tired of it

but let me get to some questions sir if

I can let's you go to the word credible

credible does not mean proven true or

factual would that be correct in this

situation I find no fault in your logic

congressman

okay so you know the interpretation that

was credible but also was that decision

made by the IG before seeing the

transcript of the conversation I believe

that the IC IG conducted to his best of

his ability the investigation and he

found his ability that based on the

evidence and discussing it with the

whistleblower that he thought that in

fact it was credible but the IG didn't

necessarily have the transcript of the

conversation

okay okay that that's that's my question

so to another point you know one of the

issues that arose out of the Russian

investigation last Congress was a

question over the latitude provided to

the US president to conduct foreign

affairs in 2017 I asked then CIA

director Brennan how he viewed

statements made by President Obama to

Russian President Medvedev regarding him

more flexibility to negotiate after his

2012 election and President Medvedev

replied that he would transmit the

information to Vladimir and that

Medvedev stood with President Obama that

was in an open hearing director Brennan

wouldn't entertain my question and

insisted on not answering do the fact

that the conversation was between the

heads of government that's what he said

he further claimed he was avoiding

getting involved in political partisan

issues which brings me to a similar

question related to this whistleblower

complaint one you said this executive

privilege is unwavering and I think

that's kind of consistent with CIA

director Brennan

was implying Congress been only the

White House and the president can waive

executive privilege the president exerts

a compression of privilege and only the

White House and the president can waive

that director Brennan gave me the

impression and that that was like that's

the rule that's the law so I'm gonna

have to go with that but do you believe

believe the president's entitled to

withhold his or her communications from

Congress if the conversation is used in

a whistleblower case I think that the

president when he conducts diplomacy and

deals with foreign heads of state he has

every right to be able to have that

information be held within the White

House and the executive branch and if

yesterday I think the transmission of

the call is unprecedented and it's also

I think that other future leaders when

they interact with our head of state

might be more cautious in what they say

and reduce the interaction that they

have with the president because of that

release so we may need to change our

process here because I guess if a

decision regarding executive privilege

maybe it should be made prior to

submitting the communication to Congress

well either that I believe that this

committee wrote the law and based on

what we're doing today

you know perhaps it needs to be relooked

I don't know I leave that to the

legislative branch so also if we may

need to change process you know the 14

days that might be kind of tough to

adhere to so I think maybe you know this

is a special circumstance unprecedented

maybe there's to be some leeway in the

timeframe instead of the narrow 14 days

and I and I don't know if you know it

was did you feel or did the IG ever say

that they felt rushed to making a

decision because of the 14 day process

no congressman I believe that he's a

very experienced Inspector General he's

used to dealing with the 14 day process

and when you work under a timeline like

that he worked with his staff and I

think endeavored to the extent because

he was following the statute as he

believed it was written so I would think

that any prudent lawyer would like to

have more time to be able to collect the

facts and do other things but Michael

Atkinson was under the 14 day timeline

and he did the best of his ability to

comply with that did you feel rushed in

any way sir I did not thank you I yield

back

Thank You congressman miss appear Thank

You mr. chairman and thank you director

of maguire for your extraordinarily long

service to our country at any point

during this process did you personally

threatened to resign if the complaint

was not provided to the committee no

congressman I I did not and I know that

that story has appeared quite a bit and

I issued a statement yesterday all right

thank you when you read the

complained were you shocked at all by

what you read

congressman conference woman excuse me

they said I had a life experience I

joined the Navy I understand your record

could you I realize the I realized for

well full and well the importance of the

allegation and I also have to tell you a

congressman congresswoman when I saw

that I anticipated having to sit in

front of some committee some time to

discuss it

alright the complaint refers to what

happened after the July 25th

conversation between the Ukrainian

president and the president United

States and the White House lawyers

ordered other staff to move the

transcript from its typical repository

to a more secure location in order to

lock down and that was the term used in

the complaint all records of the phone

call did you did the that reaction to

the transcript seem to you like a

recognition within the White House that

the call was completely improper

congresswoman I have no first-hand

knowledge of that all I have the

knowledge that the whistleblower alleges

in his allegation the whistleblower

complaint I don't know whether in fact

that is true or not my only knowledge

and situation awareness of that is from

the whistleblowers letter so knowing

that the whistleblower appeared to be

credible based on the evaluation by the

inspector general and knowing that that

effort was undertaken by the White House

to cover it up why would you then as

your first action outside of the

intelligence community go directly to

the White House to the very entity that

was being scrutinized and complained

about in the complaint why would you go

there to ask their advice as to what you

should do congresswoman the allegation

that is made by the whistleblower is

secondhand information not known to him

or her firsthand except mr. McGuire it

was determined to be credible there was

an investor

again done by the inspector general let

me go on to another issue a president

Trump over the weekend tweeted it

appears that an American spy in one of

our intelligence agencies may have been

spying on our own president do you

believe that the whistleblower was

spying on one of our intelligence

agencies or spying on the president as I

said several times so far this morning I

believe that the whistleblower complied

with the law and did everything that

they thought he or she thought was

responsible under the intelligence

community whistleblower protection but

she did not speak out to protect the

whistleblower did you congresswoman yes

sir no sir

I did yes I did within my own work force

I thought that there was enough stuff

that was appearing out in the press that

was erroneous

that was absolutely incorrect and I

didn't think that I needed to respond to

every single statement that was out

there that was incorrect

so what I did is my work force I thank

the President on Monday said also who is

this so-called whistleblower who knows

the correct facts is he on our country's

side do you believe the whistleblower is

on our country's side I believe that the

whistleblower and all employees who come

forward in the IC IG to raise concerns

of fraud waste and abuse are doing what

they perceive to be the right thing so

working on behalf of our country are you

aware of the fact that whistleblowers

within the federal government have

identified waste fraud and abuse of over

fifty nine billion dollars that has had

the effect of benefiting the taxpayers

and keeping our country safe as well

congresswoman I'm not familiar with the

dollar value but having been in the

government service for nearly four

decades I am very much aware of the

value of thanking of our program let me

ask you one final question did the

president the United States ask you to

find out the identity of the

whistleblower I can say although I would

not normally discuss my conversations

with the president I can tell you in

fatica Li no has anyone else within the

White House or the Department of Justice

asked you know congresswoman Thank You

ru you're welcome ma'am mr. Stewart mr.

Gope mr. McGuire thank you for being

here today I want you to know the good

news is I'm not gonna treat you like a

child and I'm gonna give you a chance to

answer your questions if I ask you

something I want to thank you for your

service and I'd like you to remind me

you said it earlier how many years of

service of military service do you have

I have 36 years of service in the United

States Navy 34 of those as a Navy SEAL

okay that's that's great 36 years 34

years as a Navy SEAL

I had a mere 14 years as an Air Force

pilot I proudly wear these Air Force

wings these are actually my father's Air

Force wings he served in the military as

well as five of his sons and for someone

who hasn't served in the military I

don't think they realize how deeply

offensive it is to have your honor and

your integrity questioned some on this

committee have done exactly that they've

accused you of breaking the law and I'm

going to read just one one part of many

that I could from the Chairman this

raises grave concerns that your office

together with the Department of Justice

and possibly the White House have

engaged in an unlawful

effort to protect the President and

there's others that I could read as they

have sought I believe to destroy your

character so I'm going to give you the

opportunity to answer very clearly are

you motivated by politics in your work

or your professional behavior

excuse me sir cups are you motivated by

politics in your work or your

professional behavior no congressman

okay I'm just gonna leave it I am NOT I

am NOT political I am NOT partisan and I

did not look to be sitting here as the

Acting Director of National Intelligence

I thought that there were perhaps other

people who would be best and more

qualified to do that but the president

asked me to do this and it was my honor

to step up

and for the well of the long I'm doing

it to lead and support the intelligence

community okay thank you do you believe

that you have followed the laws and

policies impressive in the way you've

handled this complaint I do I know I do

I have you in any way sought to protect

the President or anyone else from any

wrongdoing I have not what I have done

is endeavored to follow the law thank

you do you believe that you had a legal

responsibility to follow the guidance of

the office of legal counsel the opinion

of the office of legal counsel is

binding on the executive branch thank

you now there's been a big deal made

about the fact that this is the first

whistleblower complaint that has been

withheld from Congress but it's also

true isn't it that it's the first

whistleblower complaint that has

potentially falls under executive

privilege and it's also the first time

that included information that was

potentially outside of the authority of

the DNI is that true to the best of my

knowledge congressman that is correct

okay and I will say to my colleagues

sitting here I think you're nuts

if you think you're going to convince

the American people that your causes

just by attacking this man and by and

impugning his character when it's clear

that he felt there's a discrepancy at

the potential deficiency in the law he

was trying to do the right thing he felt

compelled by the law to do exactly what

he did and yet the entire tone here is

that somehow you're a political stooge

who has done nothing but try to protect

the president I just think that's nuts

and anyone watching this hearing is

surely gonna walk away with the clear

impression that you are a man of

integrity who did what you felt was

right regardless of the questions and

the innuendo that has cast by some of my

colleagues sitting here today I liked

one more thing before I yield my time I

think we can agree that leaks are

unlawful and that leaks are damaging and

for heaven's sakes we've seen plenty of

that over the last three years and

there's a long list of leaks that have

had clear implications for our national

security

meaningful implications for our national

security I want to know do you know who

was feeding the press information about

this case and have you made any

referrals

to the Department of Justice for

unlawful disclosures yes sir do you know

do you know who is feeding information

about this case no okay now think do you

think it'd be appropriate to make to

make a referral the Department of

Justice to try to determine that I

believe that anybody who witnesses or

sees any wrongdoing should refer any

wrongdoing or complaint to the

Department of Justice for for

investigation including investigation

about leaks that is called classified

information yes congressman any

wrongdoing all right well I don't know

what time it is because our clock isn't

working

I suppose my time is up but I would

conclude by emphasizing once again good

luck convincing the American people that

this is a dishonorable man sitting here

good luck convincing American people

that he has done anything to what he

thinks is right and if you think it

scores political points with your

friends who have wanted to impeach this

president from the day he was elected

then keep going down that road Thank You

congressman I would only say director no

one has accused you of being a political

stooge or dishonorable no one has said

so no one has suggested that you because

it is thank you but it is accurate it is

certainly our strong view and we would

hope it would be shared by the minority

that when the Congress says that

something shall be done it shall be done

and when that involves the wrongdoing of

the president it is not an exception to

the requirement of the statute and the

fact that this whistleblower has been

left twisting in the wind now for weeks

has been attacked by the president

should concern all of us Democrats and

Republicans that this was ever allowed

to come to be that allegations this

serious and this urgent were withheld as

long as they were from this committee

that should concern all of us but no one

is suggesting that there is a dishonor

here but nonetheless we are going to

insist that the law be followed mr.

chairman will you yield mr. Quigley

Thank You mr. chairman thank you sir for

your service and for being here

as you know those in public life who

work and deal with other countries

ambassadors secretaries of state many in

the intelligence field they're vetted

they go for approval before the Senate

they have to get clearance and you

understand the policy reasons for that

correct yes congressman do you have any

issues with civilians without approval

without vetting without clearance taking

on those roles yes I do congressman and

and why would you have those concerns

well in order to be in order to be able

to handle sensitive information whether

it be diplomatic or certainly

intelligence information one must be

vetted this is the important part of

preventive of protecting national

security and in order that we just can't

bring people in and automatically wave a

magic wand to put holy olive water on

them to give them a security clearance

it is a matter of vetting for me to come

back into government the FBI went back

for 15 years and my background examined

all of my financial records to make sure

that I was in fact worthy of having an

intelligence clearance and we do the

same thing with the intelligence

community everybody who is subject or

everybody who is privileged if you have

access to intelligence information is a

sacred trust the American people expect

us to keep them safe as I said earlier

in order to do that we need to ensure

that any person who has access to this

sensitive information of the United

States has been thoroughly vetted to

ensure that they are able to handle it

and for me it's not just the Intel

issues it's the issues of national

policy that people have an official role

that they carry out on behalf of the

United States and we know what their

role is correct yes congressman I would

what is your understanding right now of

what mr. Giuliani's role is mr.

congressman congressman Quigley I

respectfully just referred to the White

House to comment on the president's

personal lawyer a okay so so far what

I've declaimed is you see that he's his

personal lawyer

we read in the complaint we read in this

modified transcript he's mentioned five

times your reaction to the fact that

this civilian without any of these

vetting has played this role no sir

all I'm saying is that I know what the

allegations are I'm not saying that the

allegations are true and that's where

the committee I don't think there's any

question the credibility of the

complaint in the in that's in the

transcript the president mentions and

speaks highly of mr. Giuliani a highly

respected man he was the mayor of New

York a graver I would like him to call

you I will ask him to call you along

with the Attorney General

your reaction of civilian dealing with

these in the complaint it talks about

our national security that the specter

generals talks about this as the highest

responsibilities among those that the

DNI has and obviously mr. Giuliani is

playing this role to your knowledge does

he have security clearance I don't know

congressman Quigley I'm neither aware or

unaware whether or not mr. Giuliani has

a security clearance before this all

happened were you aware of his role or

understanding what his role was doing

what you do

congressman Quigley my only knowledge of

what mr. Giuliani does I have to be

honest with you I get from TV and from

the news media I am not aware of what he

does in fact for the president are you

aware of his in communication by mr.

Giuliani and your office about how he

should proceed with this role given the

classified nature the national security

implications that are in the complaint

that there in the transcript in the role

that he is playing well I have read the

transcripts just as you have so my

knowledge of his activity in there is

just limited to the conversation that

the President had with the president of

Ukraine so we respect your role and

while we have differences of opinion we

continue to respect your your integrity

and your honor but we have all this vast

amount of experience you have and we

need to understand how it plays

juxtaposition with the complaint I'm

reading an OMB official informed

departments and agencies that the

president earlier that month had issued

instructions to suspend all US security

assistance to Ukraine your reaction to

that congressman Quigley I think that

anything that has to do with the

president's lawyer in these matters

should be referred to to the White House

and the president for that I'm just

reading the Congress reading that

complained I lead and I support the

intelligence community and the 17

different departments and agencies

underneath my leadership

I do not lead the president and I have

no authority or responsibility over the

White House you're aware with all your

experience of the fact that we have this

relationship with Ukraine that they are

dependent upon us and this complaint

doesn't concern you you can't say that

publicly that it concerns you there's a

lot of things that concern me I'm the

director of national intelligence and

this one here though I just have to

defer back to the conversation that the

President had is his conversation how

the President of the United States wants

to conduct diplomacy is his business and

is not whether or not I approve it or

disapprove of it that is the president's

business on how he wants to conduct that

sir the issue is whether it commits a

crime and that bothers you at the time

of the gentleman has expired director

you may complete your answer if you wish

excuse me sir if you wanted to respond

you may no I'm fine thank you chairman

mr. vadik thank you mr. McGuire thank

you for being here we appreciate your

life of public service my question

relates to prior to the transmission on

August 26th from the IG to the DNI were

there any conversations that you had

with the IG prior to august 26 related

to this matter

congresswoman there's been a lot that's

happened in the last several weeks as

far as the timeline is concerned I think

that I'd like to take that and get back

to you and give you a full chronology if

I may on the actual timeline of events

that will be very helpful to this

committee in terms of if there were any

preliminary conversations

what was discussed and if there was any

action taken as a result of those

conversations I want to turn to the

complaint itself which is made public

for the American for the American public

to read and let me preface this by

saying that I greatly appreciate your

statement that you believe the

whistleblower is operating in good faith

I think that's very important for

Americans to hear but on page one and

I'm not going to improvise for parody

purposes like the chairman of this

committee did I'm going to quote it

directly on page one the complaint reads

quote I was not a direct witness to most

of the events described this seems like

a very important line to look into and I

think the American public will have

questions in particular about that line

so my question to you is for the record

did the IG fully investigate the

allegations into this complaint at this

time has the IG fully investigated the

allegations in this complaint as I said

earlier congresswoman I believe that the

intelligence community Inspector General

did a thorough investigation with the

14-day timeframe that he had and under

that time lane to the best of his

ability made the determination that it

was both credible and urgent I have no

reason to doubt that Michael Atkinson

did anything but his job sure so when

you talk about a full investigation

where the veracity of the allegations in

the complaint looked into there were

many references to White House officials

do you know if the IG spoke with those

White House officials do you know if he

investigated again the truthfulness of

these allegations or was it a

preliminary investigation congressman

I'd have to defer to the IG to respond

to you on that but to all I do know I'd

although I do not know the identity of

the whistleblower

I do know that Michael Atkinson had in

fact you know discussed this with the

whistleblower and found his complaint to

be a credible as far as who else you

spoke with I am unaware of what went on

in Michael Atkinson's investigation into

this matter so as of today the only

individual that we know the IG spoke

with is the auth is the complainant is

the author and the whistleblower

congresswoman what I'm saying is unaware

who else

Michael Atkinson may have spoken to I'm

just unfamiliar with his investigative

process and everybody that he spoke to

in this regard thank you for the answer

on the record again for the American

public they're gonna have many questions

as they read this complaint today and

because on page one it says no direct

knowledge I think it's very important

that we conduct our what that we have

questions answered for individuals that

do have direct knowledge and with that I

yield back

Thank You congressman mr. swallow Thank

You mr. McGuire do you agree that the

definition of a cover-up is an attempt

to prevent people from discovering a

crime say that's close I mean I'm sure

there's others one but I don't disagree

with that sir and in the whistleblowers

complaint that whistleblower alleges

that immediately after the president's

call with the president of Ukraine on

July 25 White House lawyers moved

quickly to direct White House officials

to move electronic transcripts from one

computer system where it was normally

stored to a secret classified

information system is that right

languish woman um should be sir I

apologize Congress is that what was a

legend in the possible or complain

congressman yes or no oh sure

all I know is that is the allegations

that would I'm asking me that that's

what's alleged that's the allegation and

you read that allegation and the first

people that you go to after you read

that allegation are the White House

lawyers who are telling the White House

officials who see this transcript and

move it into a secret compartmentalized

system but those are the first people

you go to well let's say a couple of

things is that yes or no yes but okay so

I'm gonna I'm gonna keep going here so

you get this complaint inspector general

says urgent credible you have no wiggle

room to not go to Congress and instead

you send your concern to the subject of

the complaint the White House so did the

White House tell you after you sent your

concern about privilege did they tell

you to go to the Department of Justice

next we might by team by counsel and

consultation with the intelligence

community Inspector General went to the

office of legal counsel so and then we

were not directed to do that we and mr.

McGuire's you said that this did not

involve ongoing intelligence activities

however the whistleblower says that this

is not the first time that the

president's transcripts with foreign

leaders were improperly moved to an

intelligence community code word system

is that a part of the allegation I

believe that in the letter and I will

let the letter speak for itself sir well

what can also speak for itself is that

if a transcript of the foreign leader is

improperly moved into an intelligence

community classification system that

actually would involve your

responsibilities is that right not

necessarily that is I do not it is not

underneath my authority and

responsibility and once again this is an

allegation that has been made does not

necessarily mean that that is a true

statement

and the allegation was determined to be

urgent incredible by the Inspector

General is that right yes it was so

would you also want to know though

considering that you are the Director of

National Intelligence and transcripts

are being moved into a secret

intelligence system whether other

transcripts perhaps maybe the

president's phone calls with Vladimir

Putin with MBS of Saudi Arabia or air

Dewan of Turkey or kim jeong-hoon would

you want to know if those were also

being improperly moved because the

president is trying to cover up

something congressman how the White

House the office of the executive office

of the president then the National

Security Council conduct their business

is their business well it's actually

your business to protect America's

secrets is that right it's all of ours

yet this committee as well and if

there's cover-up activity because the

president is working improperly with a

foreign government that could compromise

America's secrets is that right

congressman there is an allegation of a

cover-up I'm sure an investigation and

before this committee might lead

credence or just proved that but right

now all we have is an allegation and

allegation for secondhand information

from a whistleblower I am a develop

knowledge or whether or not that is true

an accurate statement

the Department of Justice opinion you

realize

said that you were not responsible for

preventing foreign election interference

is that right that was in the opinion

what the office of legal counsel did was

over eleven pages no they engaged

opinion defining and explaining their

addressed ofin for it not complying with

urgent are you responsible for

preventing election interference

election interference by a foreign

government

congressman election interfere I hope

you know this answer is yes or no are

you responsible for preventing election

interference by election interference is

war the intelligence community is it

your priority though yes it is okay so

this complaint also alleges a shakedown

with a foreign government by the United

States president invent involving a

rogue actors mr. quigley pointed out who

has no clearance no authority under the

United States and an effort by the White

House to move the transcript of this

call to a secret system is that right

that's at least what's alleged

congressman I believe that election

security is my most fundamental priority

however this complaint focused on a

conversation by the president with

another foreign leader not election

security and yield back

thank you Thank You congressman and if

that conversation involve the president

requesting help in the form of

intervention in our election is that not

an issue of interference in our election

once again this was sent to the Federal

Bureau of Investigation do I understand

that but but you're not suggesting are

you that the president is somehow immune

from the laws that preclude a u.s.

person from seeking foreign help in a US

election are you what I am saying

chairman schiff is that no one none of

us is above the law in this country mr.

Hurd Thank You chairman animals pleasure

to be here with you I tell all my

friends all the time that I've gotten

more surveillance as a member of

Congress and I did as an undercover

officer in the CIA

and I think you've gotten more arrows

shot at you you know since you've been

DNI then you did in your almost four

decades on the battlefield a specific

question the letter that's contained in

the whistleblower package it's actually

dated August 12th and I recognize this

may be a better question to be asking

the IC IG

that letter is dated August 12th and

it's to the chairman of this and it's

Select Committee on Intelligence and to

the chairman of this committee do you

know if the whistleblower provided that

letter to those two chairmen

concurrently with the IC IG no

congressman as I said earlier I believe

that the whistleblower and the IC IG

acted in good faith and followed the law

every step of the way good good good

copy we've talked about the way the law

on on the whistleblower statute is is

says you shall share if it's decided to

be an urgent concern however best

practices has always been to share

regardless of whether that urgent

concern do you see any reason a negative

impact on the intelligence community if

that legislation was changed to say all

whistleblower complaints should be

shared with with the committee's that

that's correct and in addition to that

congressman I mean let's just say the

allegation was made against a member of

this committee I you know members of

this committee although you are in the

Intelligence Committee are not members

of the intelligence community and as the

DNI I have no authority or

responsibility over this committee but

my question is do you think that if

every whistleblower complaints that was

brought to the intelligence community

Inspector General was always shared with

this committee would that have any

impact on intelligence equities and I

asked that because I don't know why when

the statute was written that it didn't

say all should be shared rather than

only urgent concern and my question to

you as the head of the intelligence

community do you think if we changed

that law would it have impact on

intelligence equities I I don't think

that a law could be changed to cover all

things that might

possibly happened I think we have a good

law I think it is well written however

as I said congressman this is

unprecedented and this is a unique

situation why this one is it's why we're

sitting here this morning sure and I

hope we're not in this position again

however if we do find ourselves in this

position again I don't want to make sure

that there's not any uncertainty in when

information should be shared to this

committee was the odni or under you or

under your predecessor aware of an OMB

decision to suspend Ukrainian aid as was

alleged in this complaint as far as I am

concerned personally congressman no I

have no knowledge of that and I am

unaware if anybody within the odni is

aware of that I just don't know the

answer to that when in any and I

apologize for lot of these legal

questions that may be best directed at

somebody else but I feel like you have a

perspective when does OLC office of

legislative legal counsel legal counsel

excuse me a guidance override laws

passed by Congress the office of legal

counsel does not override laws passed by

Congress what it does is it passes legal

opinion for those of us who are in the

executive branch and the office of legal

counsel legal opinion is binding to

everyone within the executive branch

good copy and I have two final questions

if I'm gonna ask them together to give

you the time to answer aside then both

what is your assessment of how

intelligence operations in general are

going to be impacted by this latest

episode and when I say episode I'm

referring to the the media circus the

political circus the technical issues

that are related to this whistleblower

revelation you alluded to it in some of

your previous questions but I would I

would like your your assessment on how

this can impact intelligence operation

in the future and I do believe this is

your first time testifying to Congress

in your position right and I would

welcome in the end I know this is off a

little off topic what he used to see or

greatest challenges and threats to this

country as the Director of National

Intelligence well I let me answer the

latter part of that I think that the

greatest challenge that we face is not

necessarily you know from kinetic strike

or with Russia or China or Iran or North

Korea I think the greatest challenge

that we do have is to make sure that we

maintain the integrity of our election

system we know right now you know that

there are foreign powers who are trying

to get us to question the validity on

whether or not our law our elections are

valid so first and foremost I think that

protecting the sanctity of our election

within the United States whether it be

national city state local is perhaps the

most important job that we have with the

intelligence community outside of that

we do face significant threats I'd say

number one is not necessarily kinetic

but cyber this is a cyber world we talk

about whether or not the great

competition is taking place with Russia

and China and we are you know building

ships and weapons to do that but in my

estimation the great competition with

these countries is taking place right

now and is doing that in the cyber

animal my time is I think running out is

like the broader implications on

intelligence operations of this current

whistleblower situation well I will tell

you in light of this I clearly have a

lot of work as the leader of this

community to do you know to reassure

Mike to reassure that you know the

intelligence community that in fact you

know that we I am totally committed to

the whistleblower program and I am

absolutely absolutely committed to

protecting the anonymity of this

individual as well as making sure that

Michael Atkinson who is our IC IG

continues to be able to do his job

unfettered but I think that with that I

certainly have to be proactive in my

communications with my team mr. chairman

I yield back the time I may not have mr.

Castro Thank You chairman Thank You

director McGuire for your testimony

today I want to say thank you also to

the whistleblower for having the courage

and the bravery to come forward on

behalf of the nation thank you to mr.

Atkinson also the Nspire

to general for his courage and coming

forward to Congress you mentioned that

you believe that the whistleblowers

report is is credible with the

whistleblowers credible that the

whistleblower acted in good faith you've

had a chance now as we have and I

believe the American people have had an

opportunity to review both the

whistleblower complaint and the

transcript that was released of the

phone call between the President of the

United States and the president of

Ukraine you've read both documents by

now haven't you yes congressman would

you say that the whistleblowers

complaint is remarkably consistent with

the transcript that was released I would

say that the whistleblowers could

complain is in alignment with what was

released yesterday by the other

president okay I want to read you a

quick section of both to underscore

exactly how accurate and consistent this

complaint is on page 2 of the

whistleblowers complaint the

whistleblower says according to the

White House officials who had direct

knowledge of the call the president

pressured mr. szalinski to and then

there's a few bullet points the first

one says initiate or continue an

investigation into the activities of

former vice president Joseph Biden and

his son hunter Biden and the third

bullet point meet or speak with two

people the president named explicitly as

his personal envoys on these matters mr.

Giuliani

and attorney general Barr to whom the

president referred multiple times in

tandem in the transcript that was

released on page four of the first

paragraph into what looks like the third

sentence president trom says the former

ambassador from the United States

the woman was bad news and the people

she was dealing with in the Ukraine were

bad news so I just want to let you know

that the other thing there's a lot of

talk about Biden's son that Biden

stopped the prosecution and a lot of

people want to find out about that so

whatever you can do with the attorney

general would be great

Biden went around bragging that he

stopped the prosecution etc do you have

reason to doubt what the whistleblower

brought forward getting back into

Michael Atkinson some determination on

whether or not was credible or urgent

concerned as the DNI it is not my place

to ensure that it is credible that is

the IC IGS job as the inspector he has

determined that it is credible my only

trouble was that in fact it involves

someone who is not in the intelligence

community or in an organization under

which I have authority and

responsibilities outside the Director

McGuire you agree that it involved

intelligence matters it involved an

issue of election interference it

involved an investigation of us persons

including a former vice-president if you

had knowledge or the CIA had knowledge

that a government was going to

investigate or drum up an investigation

against a former vice president would

that not class that wouldn't qualify as

an intelligence matter would that

qualify as an intelligence matter yes or

no well I don't mean to say that's kind

of a hypothetical question sir and I I

don't think it's high but that's that's

exactly what's in the transcript that's

what he's asking for what the complaint

they complained but that's what the

president is asking the president of

Ukraine to do he's asking the president

UK crane to investigate a former vice

president of the United States does that

qualify as an intelligence matter that

the CIA would want to know the

conversation was by the president to the

president of Ukraine as you know and it

is mr. McGuire I understand but that

cannot be that cannot be an ultimate

shield against transparency it can't be

an ultimate shield against

accountability the president is not

above the law one thing that you haven't

told us is if if if your office or if

the Inspector General is not able to

investigate then who is able to

investigate a congressman Castro once

again serve as I mentioned several times

so far although it did not come to the

committee the complaint was referred to

the Judicial Department for criminal

investigation this was not swept under

the rug I have I have one more question

for you

why did your office think you

to peel the IGS determination about

quote-unquote urgent concern to the DOJ

that has never been done before it's

never been done before

this is unprecedented in that in the

past that there has never been a matter

that the Inspector General has

investigated that did not involve a

member of the intelligence community or

an organization that the Director of

National one last point I would make

with respect to you keep saying the

president is not part of the

intelligence community I believe he is

the president you agree has the ability

to declassify any single intelligence

document do you agree that's true

the president has original

classification authority out then how is

that person outside of the intelligence

community excuse me

he is the president of the United States

above the entire executive branch thank

you thank you congressman mr. Radcliffe

thank chairman Admiral good to see you

good to see you again sir you served in

the Navy 36 years you commanded SEAL

Team 2 and you retired as Vice Admiral

of the Navy correct that's correct

congressman right and despite the fact

that after that service you became

acting DNI 23 days after the Trump

Solinsky call and four days after the

whistleblower made his or her complaint

you were subpoenaed before this

committee after being publicly accused

of committing a crime correct yes

congressman chairman chef wrote a letter

on September 13th accusing you of being

part of a quote unlawful cover-up and

then the Speaker of the House took it

one step further she went on national TV

and said not once but twice that you

broke the law that you committed a crime

she said the Acting Director of National

Intelligence blocked him meaning the IC

IG from disclosing the whistleblower

complaint this is a violation of the law

you were publicly accused of committing

a crime you're also falsely accused of

committing a crime as you have so

accurately related you were required to

follow not just an opinion of what the

law is but the opinion from the Justice

Department

an 11-page opinion about whether or not

you were required by law to report the

whistleblower complaint correct that's

correct congressman and that and that

opinion says the question is whether

such a complaint falls within the

statutory definition of urgent concern

that the law requires the DNI to forward

to the Intelligence Committee we

conclude that it does not they read that

accurately I better have right that's an

opinion not from bill Barr that's an

opinion from the Department of Justice

Ethics lawyers not political appointees

but career officials that serve

Republicans and Democrats the ethics

lawyers at the Department of Justice

that determine that you did follow the

law so you were publicly accused you

were also falsely accused and yet here

today I haven't heard anything close to

an apology for that welcome to the House

of Representatives with Democrats in

charge let me turn to the matter that

we're here for a lot of talk about this

whistleblower complaint the question is

at this point given what we have why all

the focus on this whistleblower the best

evidence of what President Trump said to

President szalinski is a transcript of

what President Trump said to President

szalinski of not casting aspersions on

the whistleblowers good faith or their

intent but a secondhand account of

something someone didn't hear isn't as

good as the best evidence of what was

actually said and to that point despite

good faith the whistleblower is in fact

wrong in numerous respects and I know

everyone's not going to have time to

read the whistleblowers complaint but

the whistleblower says that I am deeply

concerned talking about the president

that there was a serious or flagrant

problem abuse or violation of the law

whistleblower then goes on to say I was

not a direct witness to the events

described however I found my colleagues

accounts of this to be credible and then

talking about those accounts of which

this whistleblower complaint is based on

the whistleblower tells us the officials

that I spoke with told me and

I was told that and I learned from

multiple US officials that and White

House officials told me that and I also

learned from multiple US officials that

in other words all of this is

second-hand information none of it is

first-hand information the whistleblower

then goes on to cite additional sources

besides those secondhand information

those sources happen to include

mainstream media the sources that the

whistleblower basis is complaints on

include the Washington Post The New York

Times Politico the hill

Bloomberg ABC News and others in other

words much like the steel dossier the

allegations in the whistleblowers

complaints are based on third hand

mainstream media sources rather than

first-hand information the whistleblower

also appears to allege crimes not just

against the president but says with

regard to this scheme to solicit

interference from a foreign country in

the 2020 election that quote the

president's personal lawyer mr. Rudolph

Giuliani is a central figure in this

effort and attorney general bar appears

to be involved as well but buried in a

footnote a couple of pages later a

couple of pages later the whistleblower

admits I do not know the extent to which

if at all mr. Giuliani is directly

coordinating his efforts on the Ukraine

with attorney general bar attorney

general does know because he issued a

statement yesterday saying there was no

involvement my point in all of this is

again the transcript is the best

evidence of what we have and so that the

American people are very clear what that

transcript relates is legal

communications the United States is

allowed to solicit help from a foreign

government in an ongoing criminal

investigation which is exactly what

President dropped Trump did in that

conversation so if the Democrats are

intent on impeaching the president for

lawful conduct and be my guest I yield

back

Thank You congressman rightclick mr.

heck

Thank You mr. chairman director thank

you for being here serve thank you very

much for your service I want to step

back a little bit and kind of put into

perspective I think what's at stake here

obviously yesterday the White House

released the transcript of that July

25th conversation between President

Trump and President szalinski and we now

know that this phone call was indeed a

part of the whistleblower complaint

yesterday the chair at a press

conference characterized the president's

conversation and that call as a

shakedown of the Ukrainian leader it was

not suggesting that it was a shakedown

for either information or money but

instead it was a shakedown for help to

win a presidential election which is

coming up next year

so now let's fast rewind to May 7th of

this year when FBI director Christopher

Rea testified before the United States

Senate that then I'm quoting now any

public official or a member of any

campaign should immediately report to

the FBI any conversations with foreign

actors about quote influencing or

interfering with our election the

director ray is of course the top cop in

the United States of America you agree

with director ray do you not sir

congressman heck I do not disagree with

director ray and is that the same thing

as you agree with him sir yes okay let

me go on pass the word it was referred

to the FBI let me fast-forward

was it referred to the FBI by the

president who actually engaged in the

conversation the note was not let me

fast-forward to June 13th when that's

five weeks in advance of that when the

chair the Federal Elections Commission

made the following statement follow me

please let me make something 100% clear

to the American public in anyone running

for public office it is illegal for any

person to accept solicit or receive

anything of value from a foreign

national in connection with a US

election this is not a novel concept

election intervention from foreign

governments has been considered

unacceptable since the beginnings of our

nation do you agree with the FEC chair

whine tribe mr. director I agree that

our elections are sacred and we any

interference from an outside source is

just not not what we wanted to solicit

or accept it is illegal I don't know

about that I'm not a lawyer sir I don't

mean to be evasive but I think it is

okay for a public official to solicit or

it may be okay you do not know the law

in this regard you think it may be okay

for a candidate or an elected official

to solicit foreign interference in our

election I cannot believe you're saying

that you're not really saying that right

I'm not saying that Congress Ben Heck at

all so we should note that the FEC chair

was prompted to say this because it was

just literally literally the day before

that the President of the United States

sat at the resolute desk in the most

iconic room in the United States the

Oval Office and said that FBI director

Ray was wrong you're obviously

disagreeing with that he also said that

he he would consider accepting foreign

help

and of course yesterday we learned that

the President did in fact did in fact do

exactly that solicited that help

director whether it's this president or

any president do you believe it is okay

for the President of the United States

to pressure a foreign country into

helping him or her win an election

congressman heck I believe that no one

is above the law and we've discussed

what we think applies to the law so it

is illegal to solicit no I can't answer

that I got to kisser I can't reconcile

your two statements is it okay for a

president to pressure any president to

pressure a foreign government for help

to win an election it is on why

it is unwelcome it is bad for the nation

to have outside interference any farting

corn and and by extension it would be

equally unacceptable to extort that

assistance as well I mean all I know is

that I have the transcripts as you have

I have the whistleblower complaint as

you have and I wasn't referring to the

whistleblower complaint but if any

president were to do this and I accept

your answer I I think it's beyond ik

unacceptable director yes sir

I think it's wrong and I think we all

know it I think we were taught this at a

very young age and there's a voice

within most of us unfortunately

evidently not all of us that suggest

that it is wrong it is illegal and it is

wrong and I thank you sir and with that

I yield back

but congressman if I may just ask as the

answer once again I've run out of time

sorry no you've got don't you my answers

thank you director director go ahead

feel free to respond once again it was

referred to the Federal Bureau of

Investigation not by the president

no by the by this office right and by

the office of law by the director ray

said that any candidate or elected

official should immediately report it he

didn't say that the director of all and

I should report it although you should

and you did to thank you but the person

involved did not do what director spray

said should occur period Thank You

congressman Thank You mr. Welch Thank

You director I want to say thank you

there's nobody in this room who can

claim to have served their country

longer and more valiantly than you and I

heard in your opening remarks that your

family before you has been committed to

this country and I say thank you

second I appreciated your candor when in

your opening statement you acknowledge

that the whistleblower acted in good

faith and third i apprec--

your acknowledgement that the Inspector

General also acted in good faith and

according to his view of the law and I

want to say this when you said you're in

an ich unique position that's an

understatement

you've got a complaint involving the

President of the United States and also

the United States Attorney General I

disagree with some of the decisions you

made but I have no doubt whatsoever that

the same sense of duty that you applied

in your long and illustrious career

guided you as who made these decisions

so thank you for that but I want to ask

a few questions about the extraordinary

document that came to your attention the

DNI has jurisdiction over foreign

interference in our elections correct

and of course you're aware as we all are

of the Moller report and his indictments

against 12 foreign nationals Russians

who actively interfered in our election

correct I have read the report yes yeah

so it's just a huge responsibility that

your agency has correct in this case

because of the two things you mentioned

that the president is the one person

that's above the intelligence community

in your sense about executive privilege

you didn't fall you did not forward the

complaint to us correct I did not vote

but yes congressman Welsh because I was

still working with the White House no I

I understand that you've been very clear

on that but let me just ask a

hypothetical just to show the dilemma

that you were in let's say a u.s.

senator who was well-connected or a

private citizen really well-connected

had access to and had a conversation as

a result of that with a foreign the

leader of a foreign country and asked

that person for a favor the u.s. senator

let's say of providing dirt on a

political opponent is that something

that you would see that should be

forwarded to this committee congressman

I don't mean to be disrespectful but it

very difficult to answer hypothetical

questions I'm not sure I understand well

I won't make a hypothetical let's say

instead of being a conversation between

president and the president Ukraine it

was a u.s. senator who let's say was the

head of the Foreign Relations Committee

and was asking for the foreign leader I

understand so would you forward that to

our committee sir that would not be once

again I think I mentioned that a little

bit early in our conversation that the

United States Senator is not a member of

the intelligence community and the

Director of National Intelligence you

know does not have the authority and

responsibility for the US Senate so any

long wrongdoing in that regard should be

referred to the Department of Justice

for criminal investigation well I'd

respectfully disagree with you because

obviously that would be a solicitation

by that u.s. senator for interference in

our elections and that's in your

jurisdiction correct well it elects an

election interferences a date yes

congressman well sure okay and but once

it got congressman although it is as far

as what the legal responsibilities to do

in compliance with the intelligence

reform at The Whistleblower Protection

Act it does not this statute does not

allow for that to be done well I

disagree with that sir but here's the

dilemma that you were in and we're in

but we're gonna now be able to follow up

because the executive privilege if it

existed was waived under your approach

as you saw it it means that no one would

be investigating the underlying conduct

because in this case executive privilege

applies or may apply and number two the

president who had the conversation is

above the law so that's a dilemma for a

democracy is it not the complaint was

sent to the Federal Bureau of

Investigation totally disregarding any

concern for a I could have privileged

answers but the the the Federal Bureau

of Investigation never did a follow-up

investigation right I believe that they

have concluded the investigation I'm not

sure

in addition to being involved with this

matter here I also have other pressing

matters and I apologize in the Justice

Department led by mr. Barr who is a

subject of the complaint is the

department that provided the opinion

that there's no action to be taken I

believe that the Attorney General was

mentioned in the complaint perhaps early

subject of the complaint sir he was made

he was mentioned too sir all right I

yield back

thank you Irishman Wells thank you sir

Thank You mr. Maloney director Maguire

what was your first day on the job my

first day on the job was Friday the 16th

of August and I think I set a new record

in the administration for being

subpoenaed before any yeah yeah you had

it you had a heck of a first week didn't

that much going for me sir the complaint

is dated August 12th whatever else

you've done writing your career sir your

timing is it's got to be something you

worry about congressman I think the Dan

Coates timing is better than mine sir

looking there's been a lot of talk here

today about the process I just want to

just summarize a couple of things if

that's okay so you're you're in your

first couple days on the job sir you're

you're hit with this complaint and and

it says that the President of the United

States pressure to foreign leader to

help him investigate a political

opponent and and that political

opponents son in fact that that

president asked the foreign leader to to

work with a private citizen mr. Giuliani

and the Attorney General of the United

States bill bar on that scheme the

president at that time not in dispute

was withholding 391 million dollars of

assistance holding that over that

Ukrainian President's head that

Ukrainian president raises in the

conversation how US military assistance

javelins defensive weapons he's got

Russian troops in his country the wolf

is at the door the president asked for a

favor complains about Ukrainian

reciprocity not getting enough from you

that's what reciprocity is right we got

to get something from you if we're

giving something to you

he names the political opponents by name

the Biden's Ukrainian president says

he'll do it it'll do the investigation

that's what you're hit with and you're

looking at that complaint that in the

second paragraph alleges serious

wrongdoing by the President of the

United States and the first thing you do

is go to the president's men at the

White House and women and say should I

give it to Congress and in the second

paragraph of that complaint sir it also

suggests the Attorney General could be

involved and the second thing you do is

go to the Attorney General's people at

the Justice Department and ask them if

you should give it to Congress sir I

have no question about your character

I've read your bio I have some questions

about your decision and the judgment in

those decisions scenic conflicts here

congressman Maloney I have a lot of

leadership experience I do and as you

said it came to me very early on in this

the fact that I was just I am the acting

DNI and I was still using Garmin to get

to work that this came to my attention

involving the President of the United

States and the important matter of this

in the past as I said before I have

always worked with legal counsel because

of the magnitude and the important

decision I just sir as it as it as a

naval officer for years I just thought

it would be prudent I understand also

want to say sir if I may my life would

have been a heck of a lot simpler

without becoming the most famous man of

the United don't doubt that at all sir

my question sir is is when you were

considering prudence did you think it

was prudent to give a veto power over

whether the Congress saw this serious

allegation of wrongdoing to the two

people implicated by it is that prudent

I have to work with the situation as it

is congressman Maloney only the White

House can determine or waive executive

privilege there is no one else to go to

and as far as a second opinion my only

Avenue of that was to go to the

Department of Justice Office of Legal

Counsel and you understand you

understand sir that if unchallenged by

your own Inspector General your decision

that prudence would have prevented these

serious allegations from ever reaching

the Congress quick question in response

to mr. Himes I think you left the door

open that you spoke to the President of

the United States about this

whistleblower complaint sir did you

speak personally to the president United

States at any time about this complaint

congressman once again I am the

president's intelligence officer I speak

to the president

I cannot say what's director I know you

speak to the president a lot it's a

simple question sir did you speak to him

about this whistleblower complaint yes

or no congressman Maloney my

conversation with the president United

States is privileged so you're not

denying that you spoke to the present

I'm not asking for the contents or

underspend I want the content

why did you or did you not speak to the

president about this whistleblower

complaint I speak to the president about

a lot of things and anything that I say

to the President of the United States in

any form is privileged not asking for

the content are you denying that you

spoke to the president I am just telling

once again I speak to the president and

anything I say to the president is

confidential thank you sir sorry got me

that's the way it is I understand thank

you and director you understand we're

not asking about your conversations of

the president about national security

about foreign policy about the National

Counterterrorism Center we just want to

know did you discuss this subject with

the president you could imagine what a

profound conflict of interest that would

be to discuss this subject this

whistleblower plane with the president

you can say I did not discuss it with

him if that's the answer that doesn't

betray any privilege and you can say I

did discuss it with them but I'm not

going to get into the content of those

conversations that question you can

answer

chairman chef's once again you know my

conversation no matter what the subject

is with the President of the United

States is privileged conversation

between the Director of National

Intelligence and the president miss

Demmings

thank you so much mr. chairman and

director McGuire thank you for being

here with us today thank you for your

service what do you come I know you said

that you took your first Earth in 1974

that's that's a long time but a long

time to be proud of the service I took

my first oath in 1984 when I was sworn

in as a law enforcement officer and I

thank you so much for saying that public

service is a sacred trust because

regardless of the circumstances or who's

involved public service is a sacred

trust I've had an opportunity as a law

enforcement officer I'm a member of

Congress now but to investigate internal

cases involving other personnel I've had

an opportunity to investigate numerous

other cases criminal cases and never

once just for the record director

McGuire did I ever go to the suspect or

the defendant or the principal in those

cases to ask them what I should do in

the case there's been a lot of talk this

morning the whole discussion the whole

reason why we're here senator centers

around the u.s. relationship with

Ukraine I think you would agree that

Ukraine is very dependent on the United

States in terms of assisting them and

defending themselves could you based on

your many years of experience in the

military and now in your new position

talk a little bit about that

relationship and how important it is for

the United States to assist Ukraine if

they're ever going to be able to to

defend themselves yes congressman I

think that the United States has been

extremely supportive of Ukraine I would

say that they are relying on us there as

they rely on other people in Europe and

I would also say that the United States

is probably paying more of their fair

share for the support of Europe of

Ukraine than the others the threats are

real for the Ukrainian people and the

stake of freedom and democracy is also

where the even though it's in the

Ukraine is also a very much good so

based on that you would say Ukraine

probably could never get there without

the

for it in the assistance of the United

States are from the United States of

America I would say that if others were

willing to step up and support they

might be able to get there but they are

not we are we're we're there and so I

think you've said it would be difficult

for Ukraine to meet that goal of

defending themselves without our support

correct I would say it would be a

challenge as congressman this complaint

outlines a scheme by the President of

the United States and I'm not really

sure what to call Rudy Giuliani these

days what his role is

maybe he's the new fixer I'm not sure

but either way it involves a scheme to

coerce Ukraine this country that you say

is so very dependent on the United

States to defend themselves to coerce

Ukraine and to assist in the president's

reelection efforts in 2020 in the report

from your Inspector General the memo

that was sent to you it says on July

18th the Office of Management and Budget

official informed the departments and

agencies that the president earlier that

month had issued instructions to suspend

all US security assistance to Ukraine

neither OMB nor the NSC staff knew why

this instruction had been issued during

interagency meetings on the 23rd of July

and the 26th of July OMB officials again

stated explicitly that the instruction

to suspend this assistant had come

directly from the president but they

were not oh but they were still unaware

of a policy rationale the 23rd 26th on

the 18th this issue first came up where

the president wasn't sit rescinding or

suspending that assistance that you said

Ukraine so desperately depends on the

Director McGraw we deal in what's

reasonable here and I believe your

Inspector General included that in the

report because this whole issue of is

about Ukraine's position relationship

with the United States their dependency

on the United States

and the president's efforts to coerce

Ukraine and to engage in in an illegal

and improper investigation do you

believe that's why your Inspector

General added that about suspending

their support to Ukraine I think that

Michael Atkinson found it to be credible

and he viewed that it was a matter of

urgent concern to forward to this

committee you think it's reasonable for

the American people and for this

committee on both sides to believe that

there is a correlation or a nexus

between the president suspending the aid

and the conversation that took place on

the Congress with a follow-up

conversation yes congresswoman that is

the allegation that is made and I did

not have access to the transcripts by

only information was the IC IGS cover

letter and the allegation whistleblower

allegation the other information come

into light yesterday as released by the

president changes things in different

light mr. chairman may I just ask one

more just quickly very one more quickly

my understanding is that the attorney

the inspector general is a career

intelligence person he's worked in the

Department of Justice he's received

numerous awards for outstanding

exemplary performance did you have any

reason to deny or not believe his

conclusions in every area of this report

that he was directly involved in

congresswoman Michael Atkinson is a

valued and trusted colleague I respect

him tremendously the question came down

to as we just over and over again

urgent concern and whether or not the

intelligence community Whistleblower

Protection Act as written allows me to

forward it to this committee that's

where I got stuck ma'am and I'm sorry

thank you direct Thank You congresswoman

I want to ask you a couple questions

about the time surrounding July 25th to

the time that you came into office as

DNI as you know the phone call between

President Trump and the Ukrainian

president happened on July 25th of this

year correct I believe July 25th I

believe sir at least one of them

happened on July 25th at that time the

DNI was dan dan coates and his deputy

was sue gordon as you know the

whistleblower claim was filed on August

12th of this year and then you took

office on August 16th

four days later yes sir prior to taking

your new job or since did you discuss

the July 25th call or the whistleblower

complaint with DNI coats I wouldn't have

taken the job if I did no sir and how

about with Sue Gordon no not at all

I don't believe up to the best of my

ability I do not think that either

director coats or our principal deputy

Sue Gordon have any sense whatsoever

about this whistleblower complaint or

that Michael Adkins had had it before

your current role did you discuss

Ukraine with President Trump no

congressman I haven't discussed I

haven't discussed Ukraine with anybody

let me put it to you that way

you haven't discussed Ukraine with

anybody in your current role as the

Acting DNI well as we intelligence

reports we you know we've got about 190

countries out there so whatever the

president's Daily Brief is and matters

to pertain to that but as far as

intelligence equities in that region

right now this has just not been

something that has come to my attention

in the six weeks that I have been to the

acting DNI now turning to the

whistleblower and the inspector general

you don't know the identity of the

whistleblower right congressman I do not

and I've made it my business to make

sure that I do correct and you don't

know his political affiliation obvious I

do not I do not know this or her

political affiliation and of course you

believe that the whistleblower was

operating in good faith I do and without

bias I don't know about that I do not

know about that I do believe that but

you have no reason to believe that he or

she was

with bias correct I just believed that

the whistleblower was acting in good

faith but you have no reason to believe

that the person was biased I would not

know whether he bias or not by a sir I

just don't know and of course you will

do everything you can to protect the

whistleblower from any attempts to

retaliate against him or her correct I

will not permit the whistleblower to be

subject to any retaliation or adverse

consequences for going to the IG I am

absolutely committed to it and unlike

the whistleblower you do know the

inspector general obviously I hold him

in high esteem and like the

whistleblower he also operated in the

highest faith right I believe that

Michael Atkinson yes and interestingly

mr. Atkinson was actually appointed by

President Donald Trump right yes he was

he's a presidential appointee at what

lens real credibility to the

whistleblowers complaint is the fact

that mr. Atkinson an appointee of the

president would actually bring forward a

complaint against his boss and that's

something that is especially courageous

what I want to hear from you is that you

will also do everything you can to

protect mr. Atkinson from potential

retaliation

congressman absolutely very good now the

White House released a Memorandum of

telephone conversation from the July

25th 2019 call right I believe that was

what was transmitted yesterday morning

sir and they call that a telcon in the

jargon of these memoranda is that right

I am familiar this is the first time

I've ever seen the transcript of a

presidential conversation with the

foreign leader okay have you been melt

on would be short for telephone

conversation though exactly and have you

been a party to a conversation between

the president and a foreign leader on a

phone call when I am in the office to

provide the intelligence brief to the

president some foreign head of state

might call in the president may either

ask us to leave or just stay there for a

brief call from time to time yes sir and

there are note takers who actually

scribble down furiously what's being

said on this call if they are no takers

they would not be in the room Oval

Office with us they might be listening

or somewhere Elser like from the

Situation Room and in this point where I

don't know but somewhere within the

White House you and and within this

particular situation

maybe more than a dozen people were on

the phone call it that's not like that's

the allegation yes and they were all

taking notes presumably if they're a

good public servants yes congressman

we're here too and and were you ever a

party to a call where the notes that you

took were then given to someone at the

White House for keeping I have never

been party to any call other than my own

and I would take notes from my own at my

level or as the Director of National

Intelligence counterintelligence tants

I happened to be there and he felt

comfortable enough to leave me for a

brief conversation but it's not anything

that I would be in that office

particularly for that matter thank you

for your service well thank you Congress

been very much thank you and I'd like to

recognize the ranking member for any

final questions that he would have Thank

You mr. chair mr. McGuire I just want to

thank you for your attendance here today

congratulations for surviving legal word

challenge to raid today I suspect

hopefully we'll see you behind closed

doors like this is supposed to be done

and I would just urge my colleagues on

the other side of the aisle if they

would like to impeach the president they

need to go to the floor of the house and

actually call for a vote the

Intelligence Committee is not an

appropriate place to try articles of

impeachment so there is a process in the

Constitution that I would advise you all

follow the meantime director McGuire I

am I want to apologize to you for being

accused of crimes that you have not

committed it's totally inappropriate

behavior for anyone to accuse someone

that served for decades like you I hope

you do not have to go through this any

longer and with that I yield back the

balance of my time Thank You ranking

member I appreciate history director I

have a few more questions

just to follow up because I thought I

heard you say a moment ago that you had

no communication with the president on

the subject of Ukraine did I understand

you to say that I have not particularly

had any conversation with anyone on the

subject of Ukraine that didn't deal with

the matter that we have right now in

regard to the whistleblower complaint so

I'd not particularly with the office of

legal counsel as far as mentioning

Ukraine or as far as the Justice

Department all I did was send the

documents forward the allegations are in

there and I just let the document speak

for themselves so you're saying that you

did not have any conversation on the

subject crane that did not involve this

complaint that that's correction I mean

I mean I've been to the acting DNI for

six weeks there I have I'm just trying

to understand because that is suggested

that you did have a conversation

involving the complaint with the

president no no no that is not what I

said she okay

director you mentioned early on when we

were on the subject of what the

Inspector General was able to

investigate or not investigate whether

the president is within the intelligence

community or subject of the intelligence

community and by the way the statute

doesn't require that the subject of the

complaint be within the intelligence

community

it requires the whistleblower to be an

employee your detail he doesn't require

that the subject the person complained

of be an employee of the intelligence

community

but you have adopted an interpretation

by the Justice Department that

essentially says the president is above

the director their prayer therefore the

president is not subject to the

jurisdiction of the director therefore

it doesn't meet the definition of urgent

concern therefore the Inspector General

is done jerem extra general can't

investigate any more that's the

Inspector General's reading of the

department opinion that he is no longer

a

to investigate this is that you're

reading as well

chairman not necessarily the president

but the allegation has to relate to the

funding administration an operation of

an intelligence activity with the

responsibility and the authority of the

Director of National Intelligence

I'm just trying to get to whether the

president is somehow beyond the reach of

the law yes certainly they don't know

Merced in this country's beyond well III

that's the way it should be but I'm

trying to figure out whether that's the

way it is as a practical fact the

Inspector General believes that based on

the opinion that you requested of the

Department of Justice he is no longer

allowed to look into this because it

doesn't meet the definition of an urgent

concern because it involves the

president is that your understanding of

the department opinion as well that the

Inspector General no longer has

jurisdiction to look into this it is my

understanding that both the Inspector

General and I and my team are waiting

for that we were waiting for the

resolution of executive privilege to be

determined it is now no longer executive

privilege I'm not sure exactly what the

statute has as far as what Michel can do

but we also are looking for a way now

executive if if I did not send it

forward as you know under urgent concern

within two seven days then the statute

would allow the whistleblower to come to

you and still be protected the director

but because my committee my point is

this the Department of Justice has said

because this doesn't meet the statutory

definition because this involves the

president the Inspector General has no

jurisdiction to investigate now if this

Inspector General has no jurisdiction to

investigate because the president is

above the agency no Inspector General

has jurisdiction to investigate that's

the that is the effect of that opinion

which do you disagree I believe that the

opinion was based on the

reading of the statute and whether or

not the situation here is compliant and

comes underneath the statute the office

of legal counsel opinion was that based

on the criteria that you're required to

have in order to support this legal

statute it does not and also said that

because of that it is not a matter of

the intelligence community but once

again as well that that however you met

so forward and that's the that's the key

issue director because it involves the

president it does not involve the

intelligence community that is the sum

and substance and the effect of that is

the Inspector General has told us that

he no longer has jurisdiction to

investigate and by the logic of that

opinion nor does any other Inspector

General now as you point out this was

referred to the Justice Department's

referred to the FBI and Justice

Department that Department under Bill

Bar and with breathtaking speed decided

there's nothing to see here decided that

we don't believe that this constitutes a

violation of the campaign finance laws

and therefore we're not authorizing an

investigation the FBI is not authorized

to investigate any of this any of this

so the IGS can't do it according to the

Department of Justice the FBI can't do

it because it doesn't meet their

threshold that makes it were the

investigation so at this point only this

committee and this Congress is in a

position to investigate and I want to

ask you going to the whistleblower

complaint whether you believe these

allegations are worthy investigation

whistleblower says I have received

information from multiple US government

officials that the President of the

United States is using the power of his

office to solicit interference from a

foreign country in the twenty twenty

u.s. election you would agree that

should be investigated would you not

chairman the horse has left the barn you

have all of the information you have the

whistleblower complaint you have the

letter from

I see IG you have the office of legal

counsel opinion yes but anyway yes we do

but would you agree that if there's a

serious and credible and investigation

that you agree there should be an

investigation I believe that it is a

matter to be determined by the chair and

this committee well I'm asking you as a

career military officer someone who I

greatly respect and I admire your

service to the country do you believe if

there is a credible allegation by a

whistleblower corroborated by apparently

multiple US government officials that

the president states is using the power

of his office to solicit interference

from a foreign country in the 2020

election do you believe that should be

investigated I don't believe in who's

corroborated by other folks the

whistleblower says that he spoke or she

spoke to about a dozen other people this

is second-hand information yes but they

have criticizing the whistleblowing yes

but the Inspector General took those two

weeks as you well told us to corroborate

that information now we don't know which

if any of these officials the inspector

general spoke to and found it credible

and you've told us that you have no

reason to believe otherwise am i right

I had no reason to doubt a career

inspector general lawyer in his

determination on whether or not it was

credible that is something for Michael

to determine and and and let me ask you

this the whistleblower also says over

the past four months more than half a

dozen US officials inform me of various

facts related to this effort to seek

foreign interference you would agree

that we should speak to those half a

dozen US officials would you not I think

that you have all the material that the

committee needs and I think it's up to

the committee how they think they need

to proceed I'm asking your opinion it

has the head of our intelligence

agencies why do you think that we should

talk to those other people and find out

whether the whistleblower is right my

responsibility too is to get you the

whistleblower Letter the complaint and

the other information released I have

done my responsibility that is on the

shoulders of the legislative branch and

this committee let me ask you mr. ector

the whistleblower also says I am also

concerned that these actions pose risks

to US national security and undermine

the US government's efforts to deter and

counter foreign interference in u.s.

elections you would agree if there's a

credible allegation along those lines

that we should investigate it I agree

that if it was an election interference

the complaint do is not about election

interference it was about a classified

confidential diplomatic conversation

involving election interference by the

president sought by the president that

doesn't take it out of the realm of

seeking for an assistance it makes it

all the more pernicious wouldn't you

agree I I guess I said I don't disagree

with the IG I cease assessment that it

was a credible matter the whistleblower

further says namely he the president

sought to pressure Ukrainian leader to

take actions to help the president's

2020 reelection bid you would agree that

that should be investigated not

necessarily sir I mean as far it was

investigated by the Federal Bureau of

Investigation

no it wasn't yes went to know that the

Department of Justice concluded that

this wouldn't violate the election laws

now no one no one can understand how

they could reach that conclusion after

the two years we've been through but

nonetheless they didn't authorize the

FBI to investigate it you would agree

someone should investigate this wouldn't

you I referred it if I didn't I would

not have referred it to the Justice

Department and to the FBI

well then I'm glad that were in

agreement the whistleblower says they

told me that there was already

discussion ongoing with White House

lawyers about how to treat the call

because of the likelihood in officials

retelling they had witnessed the

president abused his office for personal

gain you would agree that that should

have be investigated wouldn't you all I

know is that that's the allegation right

and it's credible and therefore should

be investigated right well it again it

is hearsay secondhand information it

should come to this committee for

further investigation thank you and I

mean you have it you'll have the

document I just wanted to confirm that

we're an agreement that you think the

committee should investigate it the

whistleblower also says

Donald Trump expressed his conviction

that the new Ukrainian government will

be able to quickly improve Ukraine's

image and complete the investigation of

corruption cases that have held back

cooperation between Ukraine and the

United States this is the whistleblower

citing the Ukrainian readout you would

agree that if the Ukrainian readout when

they're talking about corruption cases

is talking about investigating Biden and

his son and that that is held back the

failure to do that is held back

cooperation between our two countries

that should be investigated right that's

of a national summation I don't agree

with with any of that what I did not

agree that it should be investigated

what I said was that I complied with my

requirement to send you the documents by

his committee and then it is up to the

chair a ranking member and this

committee members to decide what to do

with that information I'm in no position

well tell the chair or the committee to

do an investigation and not do an

investing

I find a remarkable that the Director of

National Intelligence doesn't think

credible allegations of someone seeking

foreign assistance in a u.s. election

should be investigated let me ask you

this the whistleblower further says in

the days following the phone call I

learned from multiple US officials that

senior White House officials had

intervened to lock down all the records

of the phone call do you have any reason

to believe that the whistleblowers

allegation there is incorrect I have no

idea whether it is correct or incorrect

sir someone should find out though right

excuse me someone should find out if

it's correct don't shouldn't they I

don't know if that is a incorrect

allegation I mean I just do not know

again that that is the work that is the

business of the executive branch of the

White House and the Office of the White

House no corruption is not the business

or it shouldn't be of the White House or

anyone else House decides to do with

their privileged communications and

information I believe is the business of

the White House do you believe that's

true even if that communication involves

crime or fraud I'm sure you're aware

there's a there's an exception to any

claim of privilege the privilege can't

be used to conceal crime or fraud before

any crime or fraud or instances of

wrongdoing should be referred to the

Justice Department for investigation as

I did

whistle blower further alleges that

White House officials told the whistle

blower they were directed by White House

lawyers to remove the electron

electronic transcript that is of the

call from the computer system in which

such transcripts are typically stored

and instead it was loaded into a

separate electronic system that is used

otherwise used to store and handle

classified information of especially

sensitive nature one High White House

official described this act as an abuse

of electronic system I do not know

whether similar measures were taken to

restrict access to other records of the

call such as contemporaneous handwritten

notes taken by those listened and we

should find out shouldn't we German

chief when I received the letter from

Michael Atkinson of the 26th of August

he concurrently sent a letter to the

office of White House Counsel asking the

White House Council to control and keep

any information that pertained to that

phone call on the 25th it was a lengthy

letter Michael would not be able to

address it better but I do believe that

the I ciji know that the IC IG has sent

a letter to the White House Counsel

requesting that they keep all of that

information but you would agree that if

there's a credible allegation from this

credible whistleblower that White House

officials we're moving these records

into a system that was not designed for

that purpose in an effort to cover up

essentially potential misconduct that

that ought to be looked into you would

agree with that wouldn't you I to the

best of my knowledge when this

allegation came forward this

whistleblower complaint on the 12th of

August I have no idea what the timeline

was as far as whether or not the White

House the National Security Council or

anybody involved in that conversation

what they did with the transcripts where

they put them I just have absolutely no

knowledge nor the timeline of that

German it is not something that would be

under my authority or responsibility

the whistleblower makes a series of

allegations involving mr. Giuliani sites

reported the New York Times about his

planned trip to Ukraine to press the

Ukrainian government to pursue

investigations that would help the

president in his 2020 re-election bid

you would agree that if the president

was instructing his personal lawyer to

seek again foreign help in a u.s.

presidential election that that would be

improper I believe Muller described such

efforts to seek foreign assistance as

unethical unpatriotic and very possibly

criminal would you agree with director

Muller that that to seek foreign

assistance that way would be unethical

unpatriotic and very possibly a

violation of law I believe that mr.

Giuliani is the president's personal

lawyer and whatever conversation that

the president has with his personal

lawyer I would imagine would be by

client attorney a privilege I am in no

position to criticize the president that

the United States on how he wants to

conduct that and I have no knowing of

what mr. Giuliani does or does not do

let me ask you about the last couple

allegations of the whistleblower I

learned from US officials that on or

around 14 May the president instructed

vice president pence the cancellous plan

traveled to crane to attend president

zelinsky's inauguration on 20 May

Secretary of Energy Rick Perry led the

delegation instead according to these

officials it was also made clear to them

that the president did not want to meet

with mr. Solinsky until he saw how

szalinski quote chose to act unquote in

office I do not know how this guidance

was communicated or by whom I also do

not know whether this action was

connected with the broader understanding

described in the unclassified letter

that a meeting or phone call with the

president and president Solinsky would

depend on whether szalinski show the

willingness to play ball do

whether mr. pence vice-president Pence's

trip was pulled because of an effort to

find out first whether Ukraine was

willing to play ball chairmanship no I

do not I have no knowledge of any of

that until this information came to me

from the IC IG I have absolutely no

situation awareness or no knowledge of

any of those facts would you agree that

if the vice president's trip was

canceled in order to put further

pressure on Ukraine

to manufacture dirt on mr. Biden that

that would be unethical unpatriotic and

potentially a crime I do not know why

the vice president of the United States

did not do that I do know what the

allegation was within the whistleblower

complaint and I don't know whether that

allegation is accurate or not mr.

chairman finally the whistleblower says

on July 18 and Office of Management and

Budget official informed departments and

agencies that the president earlier that

month had issued instructions to

dispense suspend all US security

assistance to Ukraine

neither OMB nor the NSC staff knew why

this instruction had been issued Senator

McConnell said the other day that he

spoke with the Secretary of Defense and

Secretary of State and he didn't know

why the instruction had been given

doesn't that strike you as suspicious

director that no one on the national

security staff no one in the senior

leadership apparently of the party here

in Congress that had proved the aide

understood why the president was

suspending a doesn't that strike you as

just a little suspicious

chairman chef I'm just unaware be honest

with you how those decisions are made

and at once again I just know situation

awareness of what happened well with the

only funding for as a military man if

this military aid was withheld from an

ally that is fighting off Putin's Russia

and it was done so to be used as

leverage to get dirt in a u.s. political

campaign don't you think that should be

investigated I have no reason to believe

I do not understand

I have no situation awareness if that

was withheld or why it was withheld mr.

chairman well I can tell you we are

going to find out director I want to

thank you for your tennis today I want

to thank you again for your service as

my colleague underscored mr. Welch and I

completely share his sentiment no one

has any question about your devotion to

the country no one has any question

about your acting a good faith I want to

make that very clear I think you're a

good and honorable man

like my colleagues I don't agree with

the decisions you made I agree with the

Inspector General's view of the law and

I'm deeply concerned about the message

this is sent to other whistleblowers

about whether this system really works

if the subject of a complaint can stop

that complaint from getting to Congress

then the most serious complaints may

never get here and I want to thank the

whistleblower for their courage they

didn't have to step forward indeed we

know from the whistleblower complaint

there were several others that have

knowledge of many of the same events and

I would just say to those several others

that have knowledge of those events I

hope that they too would show the same

kind of courage and patriotism that this

whistleblower has shown we are dependent

on people of good faith to step forward

when they see evidence of wrongdoing the

system won't work otherwise and I have

to say to our friends in Ukraine who may

be watching just how distressing it is

that as their country fights to liberate

itself from from Russian oppression as

it fights to root out corruption in in

their own country that what they would

be treated to by the present United

States would be the highest form of

corruption in this country that the

president United States would be instead

of a champion of democracy and human

rights and the rule of law would instead

be reinforcing

with you the new Ukrainian president who

was elected to root out corruption that

instead the message that president would

be you can use your Justice Department

just call bill bar you can use our

Justice Department to manufacture dirt

on an opponent that that's what

democracy is you can use foreign

assistance military systems vital

assistance as a lever to get another

country to do something unethical the

idea that that a a fellow democracy is

struggling democracy would hear those

messages from the President of the

United States I just want to save the

people of Ukraine we support you in your

fight with Russia we support you in your

struggle for democracy we support you in

your efforts to root out corruption and

what you are witnessing and and what you

are seeing in the actions of this

president is not democracy

it is the very negation of democracy

this is democracy what you saw in this

committee is democracy as ugly as it can

be as personal as it can be as

infuriating as can be this is democracy

this is democracy I thank you director

we're adjourned thank you very much mr.

chairman

you
