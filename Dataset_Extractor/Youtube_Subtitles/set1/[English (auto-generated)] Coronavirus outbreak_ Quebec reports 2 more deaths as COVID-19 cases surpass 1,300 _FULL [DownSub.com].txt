colleagues welcome to this press

conference to have an overview of the

situation in Quebec about Cove 819 the

Premier of Quebec

mr. logo is together today with the

Minister of Health and Social Services

Miss Anna McKenna as well as the

National Director of Public Health of

Quebec

dr. Horatio Buju mr. premier hello

everyone we'll listen first I wish to

tell you that I'm hearing a lot of

comments I've been speaking with a lot

of people from a lot of different

regions

please analyse the tests on a main event

see Melissa car negative four million

account the releases 3000 waiting for

results so once you analyze the numbers

when you take into account the great

increase in the number of tests they are

still today I have

say results that are encouraging but we

haven't won yet and we have to keep on

with our good habits so two more extra

deaths and a total of a thousand three

hundred and thirty nine confirmed cases

so now I wish to confirm everybody we

all we have all the protective equipment

that is necessary

I admit that we had a few difficulties

in the distribution of the material in

the different establishments we are

correcting this right now so there is

nothing that is going to be neglected to

protect our healthcare staff there is no

reason because we have all the equipment

to protect them now I'd like to go back

to the residences and homes for the

elderly right now we have three of these

homes that are infected one is in that I

know down region one is in the Montreal

region and one is he is in the history

region first of all I wish attire that

in all three of these all the necessary

measures have been taken but it is very

important and we've said it since the

beginning to do everything to make sure

that we increase the number of

residences that we protect them it's

important because even if it happens and

we've seen cases where they can be

serious consequences for young people it

remains that the probabilities are much

higher in the elderly of having serious

consequences and of course when there

are homes for the elderly everywhere

whether it be in Canada or the United

States that is where there is

unfortunately the most serious

consequences once the infection arrives

there so I'd like to repeat the

guidelines I know that it's hard but no

visits to any homes where the elderly

dwell the residents when they leave they

must be supervised and now I've gotten a

half a message for all owners of

residences for the elderly whether it be

public or private it is important first

of

to make sure that all the necessary

measures have been taken so that the

staff is safe and that they keep the

residents safe and that all the measures

you know around food and have to be

taken in case there's infection around

the food so very very important to

really take care of those residences for

the elderly the other phenomenon that is

continuing to go on and which will go on

in the next few days is the arrival of

the snowbirds

those who go and spend the winter in

Florida or other Sunshine destinations

it is very important you must self

isolate for two weeks very very

important you are at risk so you stay

home in for two weeks

Harrod everybody that is coming back

from Florida or any other such places

now a word for the people who are

financially worried of course the

government's our main role in the

present crisis is to make sure that

everybody has enough money to be able to

eat and keep a roof over the head of

course the rent is coming up on the

faced of a pole and checks should happen

as of the 6th of April the federal

government once so I want to call out to

all owners to please be understanding

and to be able to wait for a few days

before getting the rent it doesn't mean

that those who are able to patient

because there are I mean owners also

count on that to be able to have a

source of income but let's be

understanding the first check so the

federal government is going to arrive as

of the 6th of April and there's sprint

to be paid on the first now in each

region there are food banks we've

announced an improvement of the funding

for the food banks

it is important well being careful to

Tech to yourselves the volunteers that

are going to be working in those food

banks follow the guidelines and I wish

to really thank you

we're going to be needing you in the

course of the next few days because

there are people unfortunately who will

not have the money to be able to buy

food stuff and we all have a

responsibility to help out so thank you

to those who are helping out in food

banks everywhere in Quebec a word as

well on the homeless we are right now in

the next few hours we are finding places

to be sure that our homeless not be in

common rooms and at risk so there's also

it's all sorts of alternatives being

examined for your example at the Royal

Vic in Montreal and other places so we

are very conscious of this challenge and

we have been talking about it and we are

taking care of it now

my daily thanks are for this stuff that

do the cleaning and disinfectants

everywhere starting of course with the

health network but everywhere in Quebec

your task is more important than ever so

thank you so much to all the staff that

works in home maintenance and

housekeeping and cleaning so right now

we have a kind of army of eight million

and a half people to fight the virus and

let program batter it is going to be our

lives biggest fight and we'll be talking

about this for a long time to our

grandchildren in 20 years in 50 years

our grandchildren are going to remember

how the Quebec people managed together

to win the fight so this is a big fight

that we are in right now and we'll have

will be proud to have won it now

convinced that we'll win it but I don't

say everyday what is important is to

you everything to limit physical

contacts limit contagion limit the loss

of lives and we can win this we will win

this together this fight this war but I

need you and I'm counting on you thank

you a few words in English yes is United

as an army of 8.5 million people in the

fight against the virus every action we

take will bring us closer to victory our

children and grandchildren will remember

how we won this battle so let's make

them proud let's continue our efforts

together our Health Network continues to

prepare for the fight were ramping up

the test and we are implementing all

measures to protect our guardian angels

to help us in our efforts I asked our

snowbirds that are coming back to

isolate themselves for 14 days it's very

important to do so you're at risk of

spreading the virus the faster were

we'll all do our part

the faster we will save lives and win

this battle thank you very much miss you

mr. life communists color Thank You mr.

premier questions

hello mr. premier talking about

encouraging results but it is a third

day in a row where we see a very

important increase we have an extra 326

yesterday we had an extra 385 a lot of

people think that it is in Quebec where

we have the most you know in Ontario the

head there is fourteen million they're

testing more and they have the most

important airport in

the profit in the country and yet they

have pure cases is it all because of

spring break is it not worry son

especially since up until now we're

really saying that we're ahead of

everything going on in the other

provinces well as you can see at twenty

six twenty six thousand six hundred

negative cases we are ahead of the

canadian average per capita so that is a

very large increase in the number of

tests being done and test results today

and an increase of three hundred and

twenty six so if you keep all

proportions in mind that is a ratio that

is encouraging however if you look at

the totals well now we come back to what

that means

still today about sixty percent of cases

are cases of people who traveled we have

a lot of people who traveled at about

this worst time during the spring break

so we have to take that into account

what's interesting is to look at the

progression and today taking into

account the number of new analyses and

screenings that were done it is

encouraging it also must be said that

the choice that was made which was the

correct choice the choice made by doctor

arruda is that we started testing those

people who were coming back from

traveling as well as presenting symptoms

so we put all the chances on our side to

find positive cases we didn't just test

those who had symptoms we tested first

and foremost those who had traveled as

well as had symptoms now we're at the

second step and we are testing people

just people who have only symptoms and

so now our results when you look at the

new results they are in the averages

what is being seen in other provinces or

states dr. Ruden well yes you know it is

very difficult to compare what is going

on in one place or another because it

depends on the kinds of flights you'll

understand you know P some people ride

China we had friends in Italy there was

a spring break and we still for all of

Quebec units and

I already was a majority of cases are

associated to travel ins that is why

it's so important that the message that

the premier logo said about the people

who are traveling those people were

outside during a period where there were

even more cases than we had drink Spring

Break because there's more in France

there's more elsewhere there's more in

the United States so it is still very

important to do so and one thing that

I'd like to mention here as well is that

at the same time that we put up measures

of social distancing and right now we

are on a break so that will allow people

to decrease transmission the local

transmission that is being that is

starting up in certain regions there are

people who are going to be calling you

up or going to make epidemiological

investigations we're not looking at

guilty parties who are not looking to

you know the other people who aren't

isolating we are looking for cases and

contacts to help to diagnose the disease

earlier and if you need treatment to do

so but especially to advise those people

who may have been exposed to not

contaminate others so if you get a call

from your public health from a nurse or

a doctor or another collaborator you

have to collaborate in the same way as

if you go into a clinic you have to tell

people if you travel you have to say

that perhaps you were in contact with

somebody who is positive don't hide that

information because when you hide it you

are preventing the doctor and our

guardian angels - from protecting

themselves

if you don't collaborate with Public

Health you're preventing that we'd be

able to investigate to help people to

know whether they have been exposed so

it's still major we have increased in a

very significant way the capacity of

Investigation of Public Health but you

have to help us out and you have to

respect the guidelines the elderly who

are going out through the back door in

order to be able to not leave supervise

are putting themselves in danger or not

putting endanger their own friends in

the center we're not doing this for fun

I'm telling you for some people it will

be a question of life or death and you

could be in that secret where somebody

at the end of the line is going to die

because you will not

respected those guidelines I know that a

majority of Quebecers understand this

and do it but we cannot let those little

clusters of people who don't listen and

don't get it we want to convince them

but at one point if we have to I mean

we're not there yet but please I beseech

you do what we have prescribed this is

like a treatment for the community to

decrease the impact and decrease the

number of deaths in the past few hours

we saw the government of New York say

that there's over 30,000 cases of

infected people in his state the number

is doubling every two or three days we

understand that the border is closed to

visitors

but isn't that worrisome it being a very

close neighbor to come back there's a

lot of truckers that go through there a

lot of people who are coming back from

the southern United States who are going

to be going through New York are there

additional measures that you or the

federal governor going to be taking

first when you look at the results for

the state of New York you also had to

take into account that this is a test a

state that is testing a lot more than

the average in the United States so we

could ask ourselves you know if we had

tested so much if they had tested so

much in the other states might there be

a similar situation in the rest of the

United States or in many states at least

in the United States so let's be prudent

I'm gonna go back to the state of

Florida since there's a lot of Quebecers

coming back that is why it is so

important all Quebecers coming back to

Quebec from the United States regardless

of where you must self isolate you must

stay home you should not go out for a

two-week period because there's an

extent that is very broad in scope in

the United States of course in the

United States in general there's been a

lot fewer tests if we you look at it

proportionally compared to Quebec so we

don't really have a clear idea of the

state of situation of the situation in

every state in the United States so

let's be prudent with people arriving

from the United States in particular

can we show ya some address I'll remain

there yeah the commune I'm speaking now

to the human being behind the premiere

before being at the Premier of Quebec

you are first and foremost a son a

husband and a father

how are you personally getting through

this situation do you have the necessary

support morally etc do you feel

sufficiently strong to be able to

continue being in the front lines as you

have been for now almost three weeks

well listen life goes on

and I'd like a mr. Dyk ought to take

advantage I know that you are a

grandfather and you're always going

better you're a little mirror life goes

on

there's good news as well I've also had

good news you know births and my family

you have to look at the after the crisis

period and our challenge is to say we'll

be able to tell the story like a big

anecdote that took place during a period

of our lives but we can get through this

I feel good I mean of course I can't see

my two sons who are in Montreal but I

feel good I'm telling you right away I'm

gonna take a day off Saturday it'll

provision vehicle will be here so I'm

being careful I'm taking care of myself

and I'm also being careful with the

people around us but we of course have

to take this seriously it's it's serious

what is happening but we'll get through

it it's a difficult period and it's

temporary we have to look at it this way

how's the Premier of Quebec I'm proud of

what is happening Quebec I'm proud I was

saying it at the beginning I'm proud of

the reaction of Quebecers for following

the guidelines those Quebecers who are

helping one another out and there's a

lot a lot of people calling us and

saying where can I go help so we're

going to help them getting the address

of organizations that need help so it's

beautiful to see that even if it's hard

it's beautiful to see the human reaction

of Quebecers second question

city of Quebec yesterday announced that

up until now they have laid off 2,000

people who were working for the city

employees you took the decision right at

the beginning of this crisis to

maintaining or to give people their

wages to not leave people off even if

there's people who can't work they can't

work from home and they are at home you

decided to maintain that length of

employment first how do you welcome the

decision of the city of Quebec and are

you thinking of dismissing people at the

government no we have no intention of

laying anyone off we have to understand

that as far as the city of Quebec are

considered these are not permanent

employees regular employees these are

people who were temporary or not even

quite sure what the exact word is but

anyway people who are not permanent

employees so we do have to make that

distinction as far as we are concerned

the only thing that I can tell you is

that those people who were being paid by

the government in the networks or

elsewhere who have time please go out

and help it's time to help one another

out it's not time to cut things you

goddess use to a lot of transparency you

sent a message to the health network

earlier on you are aware aware of the

note circulating in the health network

or perhaps not your Minister is aware

I'm gonna send you one that was sent to

the Eastern Townships because of the

shortage of individual protection we

have to ration their uses throughout our

establishments so the person said she

believed you that there was equipment

she but she says managers please help us

to have access to them when we need them

what I'm gonna let then yet complete but

for me the order is very clear and I

repeated regularly at my meetings with

the people from the health network there

is no question of letting anyone be at

risk there is no question of neglecting

equipment in the Health Network now I

admit and I said it earlier on

we had a few problems in the

distribution we are not missing any

personal protective equipment in total

in Quebec but there's been a problem

with their distribution perhaps there

were problems with direction as well or

but I want to be very clear we have to

put all the necessary material at all

times everywhere in the network yes and

I am making this as being my main

priority we want to know as it was said

to us yesterday there were a few places

where there were problems we looked at

them and we are correcting the situation

and we wish to know and we're going to

make sure that we do know as well I

asked my cabinet had to contact all the

unions that are aware for example the

president of the thick for the nurses

and as well to have the information of

what is going on in the field and I

asked the deputy minister to ask the CEO

to have a phone meeting every single day

with the unions we want to know what is

happening what we said is we're going to

correct the situation whether it be

nurses respiratory therapists because

other prime minister said it's a problem

of distribution we have the capacity

however of course what we're doing right

now is different from what we were doing

before the way that we are managing the

masks people were used to having masks

you know very close but we did have

people still and we had to put them

under lock and key but that doesn't mean

that they're not there for their stuff

so what I'm saying

today is that the nurses the respiratory

therapists all the staff they have to

have the necessary material and that is

what we're doing right now and we're

going to have communication channels we

want to know what is going on in the

field and we will remedy the situation

another big worry of the Union is the

clothing there's still health care staff

who go outside and bring back the their

clothes at home to wash them at a time

I've opened Emma is that normal no and

we will have a look at this we should

make sure that in establishments we have

cleaning services

I was in the network you know for many

many years and if this is a situation

that I don't find normal even at regular

times and we will see and we'll make

sure that the uniforms can be washed

within the establishments if I said I

saw like a doctor who does it possible

to know what region the new dust came

from and is it possible to have the

profiles of hospitalizations has it

changed can we get the ages of people

first you'll understand that when we

name two cases and we're talking about a

region it becomes possible to identify

particularly when it happens in small

regions so what I can tell you is that

those two people are not in the

metropolitan area if I can say it that

way

and there are still at least there's

still one out of the two people where it

was linked to trip the reason why I'm

saying that is that people don't think

that there is community transmission

there is starting to be community

transmission we told you the profile of

certain territories I mean as we go

along I would tell you that people

coming back from travels are really

going to be isolated so they are no

longer gonna be generator of cases in

Quebec will see more proportion of cases

that caught it here but we're not there

yet everywhere in Quebec we are

concerned with this we're dealing with

it and I'm not telling you that we can't

consider that people who didn't travel

are not at risk

there are territories we're hearing the

stories and that is why it's important

to collaborate with Public Health as

such the borders are closed there are

people coming back from the United

States we have to look at that and we

have to investigate every single case

every single contact and those two

people are people who were at an

advanced age you must understand and

we've always said it that we're gonna

see in the proportion of test people who

are 50 who are 35 because we're testing

them those people fortunately don't

necessarily end up at the hospital they

are

are isolated at home they'll have the

flu they'll have a cold and everything

will get back to normal it's still the

elderly with chronic diseases that are

going to be those most affected we have

never included that somebody who's young

could have a pulmonary respiratory

problem is a little bit like SARS it did

take place but it won't be at the same

level as in the elderly we're going to

be following the situation very closely

and we have to consider ourselves at

risk of doing so especially of doing so

and of transferring it to somebody else

so let's all protect ourselves because

even if a child for example won't have

an important syndrome they might infect

their grandmother or somebody else in

their family who has cancer so even if

you're not at risk yourself do it for

others and that is what will break the

transmission chain that is what will

reduce the cases that we'll see in the

elderly since yesterday we went from

12,000 to 26,000 negative cases I

imagine that is because all sorts of

results took place yes I'll explain that

to you that's why you want to avoid

comparisons with other provinces in fact

we went from one lab that was testing

only with a high quality test that was

validated by Winnipeg at one point we

said when he picked his mother necessary

the Quebec test is good and good enough

that is a current practice we capped at

a laboratory quality control and since

we decentralized that test when we

create 38 centers where the test can be

done there is a validation period that

is necessary and so we would call

probable cases that what was real cases

because her labs did perform well and

one point taking to account the

information that we had about all the

labs even though the process was not

entirely finished we decided to say that

now it was probable so what we've done

is and I told you let's increase tested

let's test and test and test and people

started getting tested and tested and

tested very important quantities and the

statistic which is very important for me

because it gives me

data was not as important as to test

test test and taking care of the patient

so during that period of time of three

or four days of adaptation

since we changed our system the data

change as we go along and as we

implement computer systems that are

being done so right now we'll get even

more data because right now I have

numbers without knowing what it means

now we're gonna know is was it a man or

a woman what the what was each group was

this a case of travel so our idea

logical research from a statistical

point point of view will improve so that

was a backlog and we had the impression

that we're testing a lot less in others

but in fact we were testing a lot but we

didn't know because it was at the

central lab and it's normal that we do

that because we choose a priority it was

to test and test and test and the

statistic even if dr. root is waiting

after it well dr. Arruda has to wait

after it because what we have to do is

to take care of the cases and patients

dr. arruda along the same vein the

public has seen more cases in Canada but

as you said there's been fewer tests

than in other provinces how a set

strategy better for this fight I want to

correct one thing we tested more than

the rest of Canada but there are two

provinces that tested a little bit more

than ourselves British Columbia and

Alberta but right now if we keep in mind

proportions we test more than Ontario

and we tested more than the rest of

Canada to fight against a pandemic we

have to use a whole array of strategies

let's say that I had tested without end

without any preventive measures I would

have simply tested and tested and tested

with no prevention what we did is that

we took very quick measures to stop

things as if everybody were infected if

you allow me to save that way and the

strategy of test it's too early for me

to be able to say exactly what happened

in the field in Ontario and even on my

own territory because I am convinced

that at the time that we say that we

test only travelers there are doctors

who you know because of clinical

suspicion they tested others and only

test people we have a higher chance of

having positive cases so if you have a

population of people you know a place

where there's none and and I make tests

and I

finally I can do thousand tests I won't

find any but if we have tests and we go

towards the places with this more

probability that we'll find people it's

more efficient we call that positive

predictive value but I'm not gonna get

in that it's too complicated but we took

the strategy and in function of our

capacity was the most profitable to

identify things and that there's

different ways of doing it but for me

what was most important is that even if

we were not to test right now even if we

just said people stay home they want to

rank themselves it's not going to jump

from one house to another but the test

is allowing us to have a diagnosis and

it's too early we'll see it in the

evaluation because what we think that

others are doing or that is being done

is might not be not might not reflect

the reality even in Quebec but we did

that with our experts mr. premier will

you help Quebecers who are who have lost

their jobs and who will have no access

to federal help before a few weeks you

are mentioning yesterday the date of the

6th of April it seems it will take even

longer than that what can Quebec do well

we are preparing ourselves that there

may be cases by the 6th of April people

who will need money for food for rent

services essential services that we need

to pay in life so we are having a look

at all that but of course most of the

health should arrive in the week of the

6th of April from the federal government

I heard mr. Trudeau earlier on who is

going to improve even more the

individual health that will be given

with an amount of $2,000 per month so I

believe that there is help and of course

it's everyone's priority whether it be

the federal government's or ours to help

individuals in the very short term and

in fact in the upcoming days we will be

ways rumbling look at what we can do to

help exceptional cases what would it be

about the two new deaths you said that

you didn't want to give too much

information but were these people who

lived in elderly homes

nor is the old all right there are the

people who are contaminated right now to

my knowledge no and you will understand

that there's also level of information

that cannot go not get out because of

questions about fidelity but to my

knowledge note but it was elderly people

so even elderly people who live at home

who have chronic diseases because it's

not all Quebecers that are in homes for

the elderly a lot of people live in

their homes it means that they can also

be at risk

New York you talked about New York and

in the United States there's a huge

America cases and trucking is essential

a lot of people go through the board and

have to come back are there any

particular measures that are being set

up for Quebec truckers coming back from

United States who do a lot of back and

forth so that we can make sure that they

do not spread the coronavirus in Quebec

also veiled that is making sure that

there are safe places for those who need

for example to go to the bathroom

obviously you understand that truckers

have those needs as well but it is very

important in the balance of

inconveniences you find that funny don't

you it's very important with that food

deliveries keep going so yes maybe we're

taking a little bit of risk to let the

truckers circulate but we need those

trucks of food right now miss Trudeau

what is the best data right now that we

should use to be able to compare Quebec

to the other provinces is it the number

of confirmed cases or the methodology is

it two different between the provinces

should we look at for example the number

of hospitalizations

if we should compare ourselves what

reference should we use well I'll tell

you it'll depend on the testing strategy

right now I don't have enough

information to be able to give you a

rigorous version of an answer as we

evolve in time we'll probably have will

pie have standardized approaches more of

course we have to compare the rates and

of course right now we'll have to have

about the same rhythm of screening tests

but hospitalizations the serious cases

usually that's a good indication for

comparisons because it's the people who

end up at the hospital and whether they

be in Ontario or here they wouldn't up

at the hospital but we're still at the

beginning maybe you find that it's not

enough at the beginning but we are at

the early stages and it must be

understood as well that in order to

categorize and stratify the data as we

call it we need enough cases for example

on a small territory there's one case in

gas busy we artificially increase the

impression because it's a small

population one case there's instability

in the evaluation so we tell you that

for the moment first thing I would tell

you the official site is the best data

because people go and see you know sites

here and there and there's people very

good in in Excel spreadsheets that are

doing that at home and doing curves and

projections but but go see the official

ones and most particularly yeah everyone

has to look at their own situation right

now I've been very concentrated on what

is happening elsewhere in the world but

now the virus is in Quebec and I'm

looking at what's going on in Quebec and

I'm making sure that the diagnosis in

Quebec be the input for the treatment

that I am recommending and maybe just a

nod because I love statistics as well

I've asked my people to try to see in

the other provinces to what extent have

we chosen because you know up until

yesterday morning we were testing only

those people who had traveled and had

symptoms so I would like to see whether

there's other provinces that have

followed the same approach because if

it's not the approach that they took and

they've only tested everybody with

symptoms well the numbers cannot be

compared

so even myself with the resources that I

may have to get statistics I can't make

that comparison the objective of

measures that you've announced until now

to put Quebec on hold until the 13th of

April was to you know stop the spread of

the fire of the virus and the

hospitalization rate the prediction was

higher than what we have right now which

is positive but even by the 1st of May

we know we won't have a vaccine

are we safe from a second wave and if

there is a second wave later in the

spring could we economically to go back

to such drastic measures as now well

we'll have a decision to be made on the

13th of April depending on what will

have happened and of course we're going

to look at the curve well we have

succeeded to flatten the curve as we

often say is the growth lower have we

reached a plateau these are the

questions that we'll be asking ourselves

in order to be able to make the decision

on what will happen as of the 14th of

April and if there's a very large risk

that it will continue increasing we're

going to have to continue question in

French deaths the two new deaths must it

be understood that those people died

isolated and isolated from their

families well we do have a measure where

where when we know that the person

whether it be covered 19 or another

cause when we know that the person is

about to die we're not going to going to

prevent the family from coming to see

their parents for the last time we do

take the measures masks for everyone etc

but it depends on each case did it

happen very quickly I mean we remain

humans but at the same time I repeat it

there's a lot of people writing to me

because they want to go visit their

mothers their fathers in elderly homes

this is really not a good idea and this

is the worst thing that we wish now we

have three homes for the elderly that

are infected

that is where our three biggest risks

are and we have to stop it we have to

limit the number of elderly of homes for

the elderly that are infected and

earlier when when you started speaking

you said I'm not a possibility but a can

that the food of residences might be

infected could you talked about that

well we just had to make sure that the

food that has received even the food

delivers that come and bring the food

not be in contact with the people inside

the residence that the treatment of the

food you know cleaned and all that that

it be done properly and that the staff

as well that is in contact with the

elderly that they have taken every

single precaution

from what I know it's not because I've

heard anything negative about this at

all when I talk to owners of homes for

the elderly they tell me well listen we

have three risks we have the food we

have our staff and we have our residents

when they go out and that is why they

asked me to say can we limit that third

risk but let's not forget the first two

I have the impression that elderly home

owners are taking care of the first two

risks very well and we've announced

measures for the third one but let's not

forget in the next few days we can't

relax those measures we can't splash in

them we have to keep them tight good

afternoon talking about the lockdown the

partial lockdown

there are received calls from different

workers and there are businesses

requiring people to come to work even

though on the list of essential services

so how can workers can complain about

this without risking their jobs and can

you impose fines or some type of

enforcement for those businesses at some

point yeah we can impose fine but we

don't want at this point but people that

see that they work in a service that is

not on the list they can stay around and

they can communicate with us

also I'll come back to you - which

number but I guess that the main number

can be a good one but of course we want

only companies

in the in Central Services to continue

to work you were talking about snowbirds

coming back asking them to isolate

themselves you're probably aware that in

that now the federal government is

imposing a quarantine of 14 days and

there is a fine up to 1 million dollars

since people are not respecting this are

you would you say that it's about time

that we have this law in place and

snowbirds coming back can they go for a

walk outside okay no they cannot go the

snowbirds they cannot go for a walk

outside please stay inside for 14 days

regarding the define coming from the

federal government or our government

what I said to John Jeff did boo this

morning and she is she will repeat or

she's already repeating that to police

forces is that at this step we want to

inform so we want to inform the

population were not I think in the step

where we have to start giving fines but

we have the power to do so but at this

time we only want to inform the

population work with the federal

government with this quarantine that is

mandatory the federal government needs

our police people in Quebec to manage

that we don't have the RCMP in Quebec so

it's going through the police people the

SQ and spbm

and the other police people in Quebec

and now a few questions sent by email

the first one is from Rachel Fletcher

Global News a homeless person as tested

positive will you start testing in the

shelters in anyone who's gonna be

positive it's going to be anyone who get

symptoms is in shelter or not on the

street and everywhere they will be taken

care and they will have a story of case

and contact

as I was telling and we're gonna may

take the same measure as anyone in in

Quebec and as a su-kyong now there's

community spread and the fact you can

infect someone else without showing any

symptoms why haven't we started testing

anyone who feels they need to be tested

first of all you do test is going to be

negative if you don't have the symptoms

and perhaps as I what we were telling as

when we're gonna have enough rate less

people from coming from outside and more

people with no story of contact there's

gonna be tests for people who are

symptomatic but and even I will tell you

if you there is a case there is a family

person who gets sick we won't

we will stop testing them because it's

were gonna be we call it a linked

epidemiologic with the case so but we

will change the strategy as the

epidemiology is gonna change in Quebec

and now questions from fellow team

Montreal Gazette starts with good day

for mister arruda the numbers of new

kovin 19 cases continues to grow we are

the iose in Canada is this what you

expected expected to see can you explain

the increase yes it's it's what we

expected to see and already and then I

want to be to present I want to be

present we you know we had times when we

double every day the number of cases

getting out we have almost the same as

yesterday we'll see what is gonna happen

tomorrow but it's actually that what we

see is what we plan there is always

small variations so in fact and I not

the only one who looks at it I got my

experts too we are not in the situation

even if there is a higher rate don't

forget that we're looking at the Quebec

of eight millions of population when you

compare with Italy China its millions

and millions so we are getting virus

it's clear there is virus we are

exporting virus from the outside and

there are still now which is some cases

coming here again in Quebec

we will have like to ask you to head to

mr. wood see that right now we cannot

compare our figures with the figures of

other provinces because the people we

choose to test in Quebec we chose to

test only people that have travel plus I

have same Tom's in other provinces we

don't know if what if it is what they

did

mr. Hodes ot also have a question for

you mr. logo do you have a special

message in English for children in this

crisis yes Matthew Lacombe will try to

answer questions for his children and I

am asking parents to explain to their

children what's happening I can

understand that some children need some

explanation okay and our last questions

are for CTV the World Health

Organization's advised that some

ambulance transport be designated and

reserved for covered 19 patients

eventually we may have lots of people

who will need to be transported to

hospital because they are so sick as

Quebec done this

what we're doing is adding a very very

clear protocol with the ministry with

all the enterprises who have ambulances

to protect the paramedic so that this is

done and one last very question the

mayor of level 3 says is not getting any

specific information to tell his

community will there be a special

measure put in place in level 3

considering there have been for death

and seniors are still going outside

there's no special directives for the

city of level 3 the measures that needed

to be put in place in were in the place

where we had those people infected and

they were put in place that's all the

time we have messy we don't know them I

thank everyone see you tomorrow
