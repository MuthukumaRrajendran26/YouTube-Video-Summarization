good morning I appreciate the

opportunity to be here today we look

forward to the hearing and very focused

on everything we can do to continue to

enhance aviation safety but first and

foremost today on the anniversary of a

lion air flight 6:10 I think first and

foremost it's important that we remember

the lives lost and again express our

deepest sympathies to the families and

loved ones and we will never never

forget and that will be our reminder as

we look to aviation safety and the

future Dennis what do you say to the

families of the victims families whose

day you coming here is too little too

late yeah Phil again on this day our

deepest sympathies go with these

families and we thought long and hard

about both of the accidents that

occurred we've learned a lot as a

company we're humbled it has only

amplified our focus on safety going

forward as I said we're never gonna

forget but can you guarantee this would

never happen again

once this plane gets recertified Phil we

uh we're gonna commit to doing

everything we can to ensure accidents

like this never happen again we have

made updates to the max where we believe

accidents like this will not happen

again

and we're never gonna stop focusing on

safety and continuously improving mr.

Muhlenberg a lot of families want to see

you resign I'm I'm focused on the job at

hand you know I came to Boeing because

we care about building safe airplanes

for the world that's what it's always

been about these two accidents occurred

on my watch and I have a keen sense of

responsibility to see that through to

William Schine

that's that's not where my focus is my

focus is on the job at hand focused on

safety and we're gonna do everything we

can to ensure safe flight going but and

as have there been discussions with the

board that maybe once this is certified

in the plane returns to the service it's

time for you to transition out of

yoga fill those aren't discussions that

I'm involved in or is that my focus my

focus here is on the job at hand we have

important work to do for the world we

know that the work we do matters safety

is at the very forefront of that we have

always been focused on safety quality

and integrity as our core values and

that demands a sense of excellence in

how we do our work that's where my focus

is but you do know that you'll hear from

senators today and congressmen tomorrow

who will say you are not the man to run

both again we understand those

criticisms and those views and fill my

responsibilities the responsibilities

the Boeing Company is to design and

build and provide safe airplanes

our job is is to provide safe travel for

the flying public that's where my focus

is how did Boeing let this happen how

did Boeing let a plane it's a it's

something that we've spent a lot of time

thinking about over the last over the

last year and now we have a keen sense

of responsibility we're responsible for

our airplanes and any accident any

accident with one of our airplanes is

unacceptable and we reviewed both of

these accidents we know what needs to be

fixed we own that we have a

responsibility to do that that's exactly

what we're doing

and we're confident with the updates

that we're making that once the max

returns to the skies it'll be one of the

safest airplanes ever to fly we've been

challenged and changed by these

accidents we've made mistakes and we got

some things wrong we're improving and

we're learning and we're continuing to

learn the instant-message conversation

was between the 737 max chief technical

pilot and a colleague and it expresses

concerns about the operation of the

MCATs

boeing knew about this instant message

for months but failed to share it with

the FAA until recently

when were you made aware of the

existence of the November 2016 messages

mr. chairman

as I recall I was made aware of that

message earlier this year it was

discovered as part of a document

gathering process in response to a

government investigation so it was after

the crashes you were made aware of it

this year sir as I recall I believe it

was prior to the second crash on a

syringe was it your decision to wait

months before disclosing this to the FAA

mr. chairman at that point it had been

identified as a document in response to

an ongoing investigation and I relied on

our our counsel to provide that to the

appropriate authorities as I became

familiar with the details of the

document over the last few weeks as I

expressed our our disappointment and and

concern with how this came to the FAA I

think you heard the same from

Administrator Dixon I called him and

apologized for how this had come through

the process again I wasn't involved in

the document production process but it

counted on our team to make sure all the

right authorities were notified okay so

we should look to the team then in March

I chaired a hearing of the aviation

subcommittee on these two crashes Boeing

did not see fit to give this committee

that exchange

nor did Boeing give it to the FAA or the

Department of Transportation but what I

find most stunning is your testimony

here today that you said you first

learned to this exchange a couple of

weeks ago these are senior leaders at

Boeing in an exchange saying and I will

quote again so I basically lied to the

regulator's look I practice law a lot of

years you had your lawyers look over

this document and they read a senior

leader after these crashes has occurred

saying they lied to the regulator's mr.

how in the hell did nobody bring this to

your attention in February when you

produce this a Department of Justice how

did you just read this a couple of weeks

ago senator begin to clarify my earlier

comments I was made aware of the

existence of this kind of document this

issue as part of that discovery process

in the investigation early in the year

as you pointed out at that point I

counted on my council to handle that

appropriately and did you read this

exchange that look I was made aware

documents were being produced that is

passive voice and and disclaiming

responsibility you're the CEO the buck

stops with you did you read this

document and how did your team not put

it in front of you run in with their

hair on fire saying we got a real

problem here how did that not happen and

what does that say about the culture at

Boeing if they didn't give it to you and

you didn't read it it if you didn't say

I want to read and see what happened

your testimony here earlier today is

well we're not sure what they were

talking about because he's not at Boeing

anymore how did you not in February set

out a 9 alarm fire to say we need to

figure out exactly what happened not

after all the hearings not after the

pressure but because 346 people have

died and we don't want another person to

die Thunder as you mentioned I didn't

see the details of this exchange until

recently and we're not quite sure what

mr. Fortner meant by that exchange his

his lawyer has suggested he was talking

about a simulator that was in

development in that time period that's

where he was working that could be the

case we don't know I fully support

diving deep into this and understanding

what he said and what he meant but I can

also tell you that in that same time

frame where his original message was

made mr. Gustafson still works at Boeing

correct her he yes he does have you had

that conversation with him senator my

team has

talked with Patrick as well have you had

that conversation with sender I have not
