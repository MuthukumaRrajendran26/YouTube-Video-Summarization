facility this morning with four of our

great candidates Bob Philomena Bruno and

Jasper along with Mayor Fred Eisenberger

a whole bunch of great supporters and

volunteers and the extraordinary members

of the Hamilton firefighters we know

applause for the firefighters

[Applause]

firefighters are among the bravest

Canadians out there they step up they

serve their communities day-in day-out

they're there for us in the most

difficult times that we face as citizens

and they continue to inspire us always

to think about serving others the way

Canadians always do at their best that's

why we created the memorial grant to

make sure we're caring for the families

of fallen firefighters or folks who were

injured in the line of duty and succumb

to those injuries we know that

recognizing these everyday heroes who

serve Canadians so extraordinarily every

day is an incredible privilege for all

of us to say thank you to our

firefighters

Canadians are facing as we work hard

together from coast to coast to coast to

stop conservative cuts to invest in

making life affordable for Canadians

to get guns off our streets and to fight

climate change

we know the choice is very clear on

Monday the Conservatives are proposing

fifty three billion dollars worth of

cuts four times the cuts that Doug

Ford's bringing in we need to stop

conservative cuts because over the past

four years our approach of investing in

Canadians and in their communities not

only has seen the lowest unemployment in

40 years and record job creation over a

million new jobs most of them full time

created but at the same time we lifted

900,000 Canadians out of poverty

including 300,000 kids

but we know there is so much more to do

and that's why we're working from coast

to coast to coast meeting with Canadians

talking about this important choice

they're facing and how important it is

to elect a progressive government not a

progressive Opposition Andrew Shearer

has promised that the very first thing

he'd do is rip up the only serious plan

to fight climate change

Canada has ever had we need to continue

to fight climate change we need to

continue to do more and for that it

takes Canadians pulling together to vote

Minister good morning David

younggren from Reuters there was no

history in Britain either of a formal

peacetime coalition until 2010 if

British politicians can do it why can't

Canadian politicians do it I'm focused

on the important choice that Canadians

are making right now as they reflect on

their vote on Monday as they listen to

their kids

talk about the importance of fighting

climate change of building a better

future Canadians across the country are

facing a very clear choice one that will

allow them to stop conservative cuts and

elect a progressive government that will

stand up to Jason Kenney and Doug for it

and demonstrate that we will invest in

our future together minority governments

in this country tend to last about two

years some economists are predicting

that given the chaos out there we could

well be in a recession in two years time

but it surely not be better to have a

government you knew was going to be in

place for four years as opposed to one

that Mike laughs at any point perhaps

during a crisis as happened in 2008 I

think Canadians know how important this

choice is that's why we're working so

hard to stop conservative cuts to make

life more affordable to get guns off our

streets and to fight climate change

right across the country

mr. Trudeau good morning at Bruce camp

in Smith's the Toronto Star just sort of

what your personal view is of minority

governments do you see them as workable

productive or unstable and unproductive

right now Canadians are looking right

across the country at the choice they're

gonna make on Monday they're gonna look

at their kids in the eye they're gonna

think about the future that we're

building together they're gonna make a

choice about what the coming years hold

for Canada for their communities for

their family and for the world and I

know Canadians want a strong progressive

government that will stop conservative

cuts that will invest in the fight

against climate change that will get

guns off our streets and it will make

life more affordable for families right

across the country

you didn't answer the question I'm just

wondering what your personal view of

minority governments is when you look

back at the track record over Canadian

history when I look back at the last

four years we were able to bring in a

national plan to fight climate change

and we pushed back against conservative

premiers like Doug Ford and Jason Kenney

who didn't want to do anything to fight

climate change and that's exactly the

kind of strong progressive government we

need to continue being in order to fight

against climate change to make life more

affordable by investing in families by

getting guns off our streets instead of

weakening gun control the way

conservatives want to and mostly a

strong government that will stand strong

against conservative cuts

Stephen Harper's approach on pipelines

did not work because he didn't

understand that the only way to get

projects built is to work to protect the

environment at the same time to work in

partnership with communities with

indigenous communities and be

responsible about how we move forward in

social acceptability that's why we put

forward a new approach that combined

environmental responsibilities with a

willingness to get big projects built to

work hand in hand with indigenous

peoples because that's how we move

forward in the 21st century Stephen

Harper got nothing built because he

didn't understand that protecting the

environment is an integral part of

growing the economy and now the choice

is clear for Albertans

for Canadians right across the country

do we continue to grow a strong economy

with great jobs for our kids and

grandkids while protecting the

environment at the same time or do we go

back to the failures of the Harper years

good morning Joanna Smith with the

Canadian Press you have said there is no

relationship more important to your

government than the one between Canada

and indigenous peoples and yet your

stump speeches do not mention First

Nation Metis and Inuit last night at the

rally you described what a progressive

government it is and what progressive

issues are and not once did you mention

indigenous issues not once did you

mention fixing safe water drinking

advisories and I was listening for that

last night why I have continued to talk

about the investments we've made in

indigenous communities and relationship

with indigenous peoples throughout this

campaign and will continue to we know

how important it is to all Canadians

that reconciliation that Economic

Opportunity advances and we're very

proud that the grand chief of the

Assembly of First National chief of the

Assembly of First Nations Perry Belgard

has pointed out that no government in

Canada's history has done more to invest

and partner with indigenous peoples than

our government but we also know there is

much more to do yes we have lifted 87

long-term boil water advisories but

there are more to do before we reach the

deadline that we impose ourselves and

we're going to meet that deadline we're

moving forward on historic agreements on

self-government on settling land claims

on investing in schools investing in

water investing in health we know that

for all Canadians indigenous and

non-indigenous making sure we are being

the country we know we need to be we

know we want to be in our hearts is what

this election is also all about and

that's why that choice on Monday of

going back to the broken relationships

with indigenous peoples of the Harper

years or continuing to move forward in

investing and things like affordability

in safety in education in health is the

choice Canadians are facing and why I am

so looking forward to voting day on

Monday

that same national chief you just quoted

also said who is very disappointed with

your government's decision to ask for

additional review of the tribunal you

have said that you don't have time an

election campaign that's one thing but

you did have time leading up to that

looking back is there anything that you

feel your government could have done

better to avoid reaching to the point

where you feel it was necessary to ask

for review we agree with the tribunals

decision that kids deserve compensation

for the mistreatment they went through

in child and family services we

absolutely agree and we will be moving

forward to compensate them but more than

just looking back we've been focused on

reforming Child and Family Services to

make sure that kids in care get to stay

in indigenous communities in their

language get the support they need so

they don't lose their culture and

identity which is so important to them

that's at the core of how we move

forward as a country in partnership with

indigenous peoples that's what we're

going to continue doing and that's one

of the things that's at stake in the

choice the Canadians are making on

Monday do we continue to move forward on

reconciliation on making life more

affordable on getting guns off our

streets on fighting climate change and

do we stop conservative cuts that's the

choice on Monday

mr. Trudeau Tom Perry with CBC News

you're setting off on a marathon

campaign swing gonna take you right

across the country and back this late in

the campaign should we look at this as

an act of ambition on your part or as an

act of desperation this campaign is

about getting out there and talking to

as many Canadians as possible about the

important choice they're facing and

there's many things that remind me of

that 2015 campaign including this last

swing across the country where we get to

talk to everyone about how important

their choice is on Monday because it is

a moment where Canada gets to determine

what our future will look like but not

just in this election our future for the

next four years our future for the next

40 years as well because the fight

against climate change needs action now

we've seen tens of thousands hundreds of

thousands of kids in our streets over

the course of this campaign saying to

their leaders that we need more action

on climate change and we agree and on

Monday right across the country

Canadians get to make a choice for their

kids for their grandkids for making life

more affordable for keeping our

community safer by getting money it guns

off the streets and by fighting and

stepping up in our fight against climate

change

that's what we need a progressive

government for we're not going to get go

for the conservative cuts and the

approach on climate change that does

absolutely nothing and leaves it to

future generations on Monday Canadians

right across the country are going to

choose forward

very excited and confident about the

choice Canadians are making

and I know I know Canadians are right

across the country you know turning

their minds to this election and

specifically to the vote they have to

cast they get to cast on Monday and the

question they're facing is with that

vote do we stop conservative cuts do we

invest in our families and in our future

and make life more affordable for them

do we continue to strengthen gun control

and get guns off our streets and do we

step up in the fight against climate

change and I feel great about the choice

Canadians are making to keep moving our

country forward

good morning Michelle zillio with The

Globe and Mail the Global Mail reported

yesterday that Warren Kinsella and his

consulting firm worked on a secret

campaign to quote seek and destroy the

People's Party and keep Maxine Burnie

out of the leaders debates a source with

direct knowledge of the project said

that the client was the Conservative

Party mr. Kinsella has also come after

you online being a loud critic are you

concerned the Tories also hired him to

target you and discredit your party I

think we've seen throughout this

campaign that the Conservatives have had

to use the politics of fear and division

and indeed just make stuff up in order

to try and get their message across why

it's because they have nothing to offer

Canadians except 53 billion dollars

worth

the choice on Monday is so clear we need

to stop conservative cuts we need to

invest in our future invest in our kids

but making life more affordable we need

to move forward on fighting climate

change and getting guns off our streets

we need to continue the plan that has

lifted 900,000 Canadians out of poverty

and created over a million jobs most of

them full-time that's the positive

vision that we're putting forward is a

will you stay on as liberal leader if

Canadians I meet right across the

country who are incredibly excited with

the opportunity to continue the hard

work we've done over the past four years

that has lifted 900,000 people out of

poverty including 300,000 kids and seen

and seen over a million new jobs created

at the same time our approach to both

fight climate change

and build a stronger future with better

jobs for our kids our approach on

strengthening gun control not weakening

gun control like the Conservatives want

to do are the things the Canadians are

gonna vote on on Monday and from what

the conversations I've had right across

the country

Canadians are excited about continuing

to move forward John is the National

Post following on the comments about

your candidates comments about c69

are you concerned that there's the

potential for political and civil unrest

in Alberta maybe as soon as tonight when

we arrived there we know that Albertans

have faced difficult times over the past

few years with oil prices with

challenges they faced and that's why as

a government we've stepped up we

approved the trans mountain pipeline

expansion and shovels are in the ground

we've invested and helped for AI for

albertans we've invested in many many

more infrastructure projects than the

Conservatives under Stephen Harper ever

did for Alberta and we're doing that

because as we're reminded when we're in

a fire hall Canadians stand up for each

other and are there to help each other

in difficult times and that's why all of

Canada will always be there to support

Albertans

we

we also recognize that Stephen Harper's

approach didn't work to help Albertans

and that's why we know that in Alberta

and right across the country people are

serious about building a better future

for their kids and that includes a real

plan to fight climate change and make

life more affordable for Canadians which

is exactly what the liberal plan does

the public polling suggests that you've

only got a 10 percent chance of forming

a majority government you still think

that the path to majority is there I

know that Canadians are focused on that

positive choice they're making and

Canadians are looking at Monday two days

from now as their opportunity to move

Canada forward to make a choice to stop

conservative cuts to fight climate

change to get guns off our streets and

to make life more affordable for all

Canadians and I can't wait to keep

working with all Canadians on exactly

that

every winter at Hamilton Community News

I'm wondering that this is your third

time in Hamilton what what is the

strategy in Hamilton now do you think is

this Hamilton a bellwether for the for

your government I'm incredibly happy at

the positive response we've gotten right

across the country from Canadians who

know we need a strong government that

reflects our values that invests in

Canadians invests in making life more

affordable for people that gets guns off

our streets that fights climate change

and that stops conservative cuts sorry

just started over again I can't you talk

about yeah there we go

you talk about getting guns off the

streets yet Hamilton had another

shooting last night how will that get

guns off the streets we have moved

forward with the strongest gun control

proposals in Canada's history not only

did we strengthen gun control

significantly over the past four years

but we've put forward a plan that will

ban military-style assault weapons right

across the country because there is no

place in our communities or in our

country for guns that are designed to

kill the largest number of people in the

shortest amount of time on on top of

that we are giving cities like Hamilton

the opportunity to ban and limit

handguns because we know that protecting

our kids protecting our communities is a

priority shared by Canadians right

across the country and the Conservatives

want to weaken gun control they want to

make it easier to buy guns with less

background checks and they don't want to

ban military-style assault weapons that

would be the wrong choice and that's

another reason why folks in Hamilton

folks right across the country will

choose forward on Monday

NDP leader Jack meets Singh when he ran

for the leadership promised that as a

condition of a minority government he

would put electoral reform that would be

PR proportional representation

specifically NDP members voted to ensure

that proportional representation would

be the condition and a minority

government are you willing to revisit

your stance on electoral reform and

specifically enact proportional

representation should you be in a

minority situation Canadians across the

country this weekend are focused on

their vote on Monday are looking forward

for the opportunity to make a choice

about how our country is going to move

forward and what we're going to do for

future generations that's why our plan

is focused on stopping conservative cuts

on investing in affordability on

fighting climate change and on getting

guns off our streets and that's what

Canadians get to decide on on Monday

I know that you have a job to do and

repeating your message we have a job to

do and asking you questions because you

at least try to answer the question I'm

trying to ask you you said no to

electoral reform you argue that it was

unstable a proportional representation

system would create the pizza Parliament

you didn't want to work that way

polling suggests that Canadians actually

want to send a minority government to

Ottawa that they don't trust you they

don't trust Andrew Scheer do you regret

your decision to Nick's electoral reform

Canadians right now this weekend are

reflecting on the choice they get to

make on Monday

that's what Canadians are thinking about

from coast to coast to coast those are

the conversations we're having about

whether or not they're going to be able

to afford to send their kids to

university and that's why we have a plan

that's going to make sure that you don't

have to start paying back your student

loans until you're making thirty five

thousand dollars a year this morning I

got to meet with seniors who were

focused on being able to afford their

medications when they found out that we

were going to be increasing old age

security by ten percent for seniors over

seventy-five they were massively

relieved along with the fact that we're

going to be moving towards implementing

pharmacare one of our candidates just

yesterday

heard from a dad in the writing who

admitted to her that he has always voted

conservative all his life and was

planning on doing that again but decided

that in this election he was going to

give his vote to his 13 year old

daughter because it was our future and

her future that we were talking about

and he was going to vote for the only

government that has had a real climate

plan in the history of this country he

was going to vote liberal for his 13

year old daughter because of the fight

against climate change these are the

conversations that Canadians are having

this weekend the

is the choice Canadians face on Monday

do we stop conservative cuts do we

invest in affordability for Canadians do

we invest in the fight against climate

change and do we gate make our streets

safer by strengthening gun control those

are the conversations Canadians are

having across the country and that is

the choice they're facing on Monday good

morning this is a question for my

colleagues at power and politics

obviously voter turnout was very

important for you last time around they

want to know what your final pitch is to

Canadians first off on why they should

vote full stop and second off why they

should vote for you I think this is an

election that is more important than

just the next four years it will decide

whether Canada continues to step up on

the greatest challenge of our time the

fight against climate change

Andrew Shearer and his Conservatives

have promised to rip up the only real

plan to fight climate change that Canada

has ever had as their first thing and

then they're gonna offer four times as

much cuts as Doug Ford has over the past

years we know that this choice is

important and Canadians right across the

country need to make the right choice

they need to pick a progressive

government that's going to make life

more more affordable for our seniors for

our young people for students for

families it's going to invest in small

businesses and a brighter future that's

going to fight climate change because

you can't build a strong economy unless

you're at the same time protecting the

environment everyone knows that except

the Conservatives and it's going to

strengthen gun control to make sure that

more of our kids and families and our

streets are safer at a time when the

Conservatives want to loosen gun control

and make it easier to buy guns this

choice in this election is do we

continue to move forward with a strong

government that has demonstrated its

ability to lift hundreds of thousands of

people including kids out of poverty and

create millions of jobs

or do we move back to the failed

policies the Harper years

I am excited and I've seen Canadians so

excited about the possibility to come

out and keep choosing forward as a

country

thank you

[Applause]
