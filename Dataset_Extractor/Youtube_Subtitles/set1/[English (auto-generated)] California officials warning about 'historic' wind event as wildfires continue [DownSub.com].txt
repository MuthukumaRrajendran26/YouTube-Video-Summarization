this is the team that's deploying and I

want to first of all thank the state

because they have sent the Armada we

have a fleet out there right now going

after the fire the Kincaid fire in a way

that it needs to be done in the next two

to three days to prepare for another

wind event which is really making us

bristle a little bit and but at the same

time we've had the partnership and the

resources deployed and I've had a lot of

people who have told me out of all the

incidences I've seen they have not seen

this kind of force come in and this kind

of coordination so have them gone

through this two years ago and you

coming out with us it's a crazy time to

say here we are again but we are more

prepared than ever you can tell by the

sense on the ground and the individuals

there's not that same Friends frenzy

that was there before but at the same

time this is going to test us so we're

in a situation right now thank you for

being here and taking a lead on an issue

that none of us decide to be leaders on

but we have to embrace and go with so

I'm gonna pass it on over to the

governor and thank you all so much thank

you thanks for all your leadership and

let me thank the elected officials

assembled by me but more importantly let

me thank the men and women out on the

front lines that are keeping you safe

and doing heroic work not only those

that wear the badge of your local

jurisdiction and the state cAL FIRE but

folks that are providing mutual aid from

all throughout the state of California

and from outside of the state of

California I was just down in Southern

California a new fire sparking in San

Diego we are monitoring two fires in Los

Angeles County and two fires here in

Northern California though the Muir fire

seems to be substantially under control

the biggest concern obviously in the

northern part of the state is Kincaid

and while we are enjoying a moment of

respite away from the wind events as the

supervisor said we're expecting those

winds to whip back up on Saturday

evening into Sunday potentially

dissipating we hope on Monday and so the

expectation of these now commonly

referred to PSPs the de-energization

it's likely to occur at scale again

into the weekend despite the fact that

now we're down to about 6700 customers

that are currently be energized in the

PGE territories so this is multifaceted

we are a nation state so we are

conducting ourselves all across this

state by allocating appropriate

resources and as the supervisor said

we've never had more resources in this

space than we do today will be bringing

in 747 into the area for exclusive use

in the state of California you'll see

that aircraft in the very near future

meaning in the next number of hours

we've got our DC tens up there we've got

other suppression equipment in the air

those that often don't see that

suppression in the air should just know

this there's a reason it's not because

we're neglecting it's because of

conditions that are not appropriate for

those aircraft not only the issues of

suppression in the air related to wind

conditions or literally clarity issues

inversion that layer where you need to

get low and if you can't actually get

low there's no point in bringing those

aircrafts up but that does not deny the

work that's being done underneath the

hand crews that are out there the

bulldozers that are out there and the

lines that are being drawn in and around

the fire to contain it

well I say should be outraged they

should be infuriated and they should

direct their ire at the mismanagement of

Pacific Gas and Electric who for decades

have created conditions that led to this

moment that said what we're anticipating

right now we're down about what sixty

seven hundred customers that are

currently de-energized and we should

expect most of those customers to get

back on today probably the latest view

I imagine scattered tomorrow but we

expect more power outages Saturday

evening at the moment into Sunday

hopefully turning back on on Monday and

we are doing everything in our power to

mitigate the scale and scope of that and

to make sure that they turn back the

power on as quickly as they can let me

on that subject make a point that's

important to make when the determination

to turn back on power is made you can't

do it unless you investigate the lines

to make sure that they're safe and that

takes time what we have done so you know

where the state has been we are

providing air resources infrared

technology so even during night time the

California Highway Patrol in its planes

can do a lot of that investigation to

supplement the work that's being done by

PG&E all in an effort to as quickly as

humanly possible get those lights back

on

they have specific prescriptive

Ultimatum I would encourage you to go

back to the legislation we passed in

July which was historic in a heroic

effort to get ahead of ourselves before

the fire season in that legislation are

specific measurable roles and

responsibilities that we all will play

the state Public Utilities Commission

the AIA use the city and counties with

support from the state but more

importantly the the utilities themselves

that have a five billion dollar

obligation to invest in public safety

hardening undergrounding vegetative

management etc including technology that

allows them more precision to

de-energize without having to turn off a

switch where the entire house goes out

but one room at a time all of that is

laid out in that legislation legally

required if they're ever to access the

capital that we're willing to put up to

help PG&E get out of bankruptcy and

secure the other IO use so that they can

go out in the bond markets with higher

ratings and be able to access capital to

complete their improvements I don't mean

to complicate this but we spent six

months on a daily basis working to put

together that package and I cannot

impress upon you more to look at what

now is required

we're not reacting to this moment we

specifically laid out a framework in a

direct pathway for them to get back to

solvency and get back into the business

of being a good business
