I have such great news to serve up with

we are only a few days away from getting

rid of the tax hiking deficit running

you know everywhere I go across Canada

always beating people who come up to me

and they put up their hand and they say

Andrew I'm so sorry and I always think

that's a very Canadian way to introduce

yourself they say and I'm so sorry I

voted liberal in 2015 but I'm voting

conservative this time it's okay because

in 2015 they were lied to Justin Trudeau

made so many promises that he had no

intention of keeping

remember he promised that he would

balance the budget sorry though the

budget would balance itself and Stan

we've got endless deficits and all the

tax hikes that go along with it and they

know they can't trust Justin true this

election is coming down to the simple

question who do you trust to run a

government that lives in Venice means to

put more money back in your pocket

Saturday

you sell of Chanukah bagua coffee also

Justin's below we know that we can't

have the faith in Justin sure but he

said so many things that he know wasn't

sure that he knew wasn't you remember

what he looked billions of Canadians in

the eye and he said that the story and

the global mail about the FCC libel and

scandal was false

[Music]

he said that Jodi Wilson Raybould never

came to him with her concerns shut down

parliamentary investigations into his

wrongdoing and now he's not even letting

the RCMP get to the bottom well come

October 21st October 21st we're gonna

have a Conservative government that will

launch an inquiry into this yeah

they just true he loves telling people

that they've never had it so good he's

running around telling that everyone

that they that they're lucky to have

miss prime minister the things have

never been better

well he's not hearing from the same

people that I'm hearing from I'm hearing

from thousands and thousands of

hard-working case who are doing

everything right

paying their bills on time going to

university providing for their families

and they're feeling like they are

working harder and harder but falling

further and further behind and we know

that under Justin Trudeau over half of

Canadians are feeling like they're less

than $200 away every month from not

being able to pay their bills and over

80% of middle-class Canadian families

are paying higher taxes today than they

were just four years ago and seniors are

being hit by many of those tax hikes and

negative policies and that's why that's

why we have such an exciting plan that's

why we are going to run a government

that lives within its means so that we

can put more money in your pocket

because it's time for you to get ahead

just introduced deficits being more and

more of your tax dollar goes just to pay

the interest on that debt and

conservatives know that we should be

sending your tax dollars to banks and

bondholders we're gonna get back to

balanced budget so we can put more of

your money into better services and tax

cuts and it starts with job number one

job number one the very first piece of

legislation that our new members of

parliament will be voting on will be

called an act to repeal the carbon tax

we're going to go one step further we're

gonna go one step further than just

canceling the carbon tax we know the

carbon tax has made everything you have

more expensive we know that it's raised

the cost of gasoline home heating and

groceries and that's why we're going to

go one step further than just cancelling

the carbon tax ladies and gentlemen

we're gonna recognize that in Canada

heating your home in the winter is not a

luxury it's a necessity so we're going

to scrap the GST off of home

[Music]

we're running back in your pocket of the

universal tax cut lowering the first

income tax bracket so that every

Canadian taxpayer gets a break now we're

going to bring back popular tax credits

like the public transit tax credit and

the tax credit for kids sports and

activities you know Justin Trudeau might

not you know he says that things have

never been better I'm sure in his world

that may be true and remember and

remember when he you saw high gas prices

and he said that higher gasoline prices

were exactly what he wanted

well it might be exactly what

millionaire liberals want but it's not

what hardworking Canadians want labels

go an under Justin Trudeau under Justin

Trudeau Canada has become a country of

no no to hardworking entrepreneurs who

create jobs and opportunities in our

society no to big projects that unite

our country together no to our energy

sector that creates thousands of jobs in

every single province and no to running

an ethical and accountable government

ladies and gentlemen I am going to turn

Justin Trudeau's Canada of no into a

Canada of yes

yes the UPP more of your hard-earned

money yes to Canada's energy sector yes

two big projects that unite our country

with the national energy corridor no

spending can replace the jobs created by

small businesses and entrepreneurs no

amount of government spending can match

the innovation created by a free market

and no amount of government spending can

replace the generosities that come from

individual Canadians and communities

every single day

and that is the biggest difference

between liberals and conservatives

liberals put all their faith in

government conservatives we put our

faith in people you know the dollar is

always better spent in the hands of the

hard-working Canadian taxpayer who've

earned it than in the hands of the

politician who taxed it and so their

choice is becoming even more clear

clearer by the day we now know that an

NDP liberal coalition will pay

I agree we know that Jeff's insurer will

pay any price to cling to power the

problem is he's going to pay that price

with your money and the bracele will

have to pay the NDP to stay on as Prime

Minister will come right out of your

pockets and make life even less

affordable

the massive deficits the taxes he will

have to hide the big projects in this

country that he will have to cancel the

jobs and investment that will be driven

from this country to placate the NDP

will set Canada back ladies and

gentlemen it will make life less

affordable it will raise your taxes and

it will make you fall further and

further behind and that is why the only

thing that can stop a Trudeau NDP

coalition is a conservative majority

Canadians know exactly what they're

going to get on Monday take it is exact

mo exactly Marcus Duvall I walked

epidemics young where Justin Trudeau

will abuse the power of his office to

reward his friends and punish his

enemies I will restore ethics and

accountability and

[Music]

where he will call small business owners

tax cheats and insult them I will always

defend them and allow them to do it

eight your best grow and provide jobs in

our society where if you will permit the

dumping of billions of litres of

untreated wastewater into the st.

Lawrence I will ban the practice of

dumping raw sewage into our rivers lakes

no around on the world stage again

pushed and bullying around I will always

defend Canada with strength and

professionalism

where he will look a war hero in the eye

and tell our veterans and they are

asking for more than liable under their

sacrifice of their dedication to this

country by thinking sure they googled

divide Canadians and insult people just

for having a different point of view I

will always stand up for freedom of

speech freedom of thought and freedom of

religion and where he will go after law

abiding firearms owners and ask them and

force them to follow even more laws I

will make our community safer by going

after the real criminals the gang

members and the illegally traffic fire

and he will raise your taxes run massive

deficits adding billions and billions of

dollars to the debt and make life more

expensive I will run a government that

lives within his means

so we can lower your taxes put money

back in your pocket so that you can get

ahead that is the choice let's go get a

majority
