so we have everything from movie

monsters to animation we have famous

people and krump ecad so pretty much

everything something for everyone and

nothing too scary

okay and the cat face for that because

it was smiling and that's what that's

what I love I kind of like the suction

where they did the tributes to the

people who have passed but they were

really authentic they looked real I like

to break into our one fact

we think this is awesome it's such an

awesome opportunity for the kids to go

out and use their imagination be outside

I almost have it straightforward but um

I think it's specially because um I mean

it's fun for kids to get to see them and

everything and it's a great way for like

families to get together to come and see

it so that's really fun
