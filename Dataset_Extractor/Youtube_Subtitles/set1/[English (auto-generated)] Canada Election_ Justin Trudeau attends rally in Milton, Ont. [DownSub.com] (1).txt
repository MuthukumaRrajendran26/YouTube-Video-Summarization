people from Hamilton here from Toronto

here how are we doing are there any

liberals here sorry are there any

liberals here so there's a few liberals

here and why are we liberals we're

liberals because when we were walking in

here we are in front of the escarpment

the Niagara Escarpment we're on the

Greenbelt we're in one of the nicest

parts of southwestern owns here one of

the nicest parts of the world and we're

liberals because we care about the

environment we acknowledge that science

and the facts and the evidence and the

research that says we got to stand up

and do something we got to change our

ways a little bit we got to listen to

experts and the research and the facts

and the evidence and move forward

together that's why we're choosing

forward right little over ten years ago

I got to walk into the opening

ceremonies the Olympic Games in Beijing

China carrying our flag for Team Canada

and I'll tell you as I was walking in to

the bird's nest stadium I looked out

into the audience the parade of athletes

and I saw a lot of countries and a lot

of athletes from different countries and

somebody behind me on Team Canada

there's 300 of my sporting heroes behind

me I was marching in with them and as I

marched and I heard one of them start

singing o Canada so I started waving the

flag and turning around and I saw all

the countries as I was turning around

the parade of athletes was in front of

me and as I turned her on her face Team

Canada I didn't see a country that look

like one country I saw a country that

looks like the world and Milton Milton

is a town that looks like the world and

Halton as a region looks like the world

and Ontario is a province that looks

like the world and that's what we stand

for as liberals because we know that

diversity is our strength in Canada as a

first generation Canadian my mom Fiat is

right here as a first generation

Canadian we acknowledge that a Canadian

is a Canadian is a Canadian there's no

difference between any of us we also

know that Canadians are born every day

all around the world in every country

Canadians yet but one day they will be

hello Milton oh wow what a crowd what a

room how about another amazing round of

applause for head Robertson and what to

say about Adam I have known Adam

Vancouver den for over 15 years now and

I've never met anyone so hard-working so

focused and so determined to be the

great MP for Milton that Milton deserves

Thank You Adam for stepping up but thank

you all for stepping up for the

conversations you've led over the past

weeks and months for the doors you've

knocked on for the conviction you've

shown that every day we can fight for a

better Canada and we can choose to move

forward and I can't help but think as we

approach the end of this election

campaign think back to 2015 and the

choice Canadians made then to close the

book on the Harper decade a decade of

underinvestment in Canadians and in

their communities of nothing done on

climate change of a withdrawal of

defense of women's rights of LGBT rights

and instead we chose to move forward in

2015

[Applause]

Canadians stepped up it came together

and picked a government that would focus

on investing in them on fighting climate

change on restoring Canada's place in

the world and over the past four years

that's exactly what we did

what it meant was that through investing

in families investing in things like

lowering taxes for the middle class by

asking the wealthiest 1% to do a little

more by delivering a Canada child

benefit that helps 9 out of 10 Canadian

families with hundreds of dollars a

month and has lifted 9 300,000 kids out

of poverty the choices we made over the

past four years worked not only if we

see the lowest unemployment in 40 years

and the creation of a million new jobs

most of them full-time we also lifted

900,000 Canadians out of poverty that

approach of choosing investment

investment in infrastructure investment

in our communities investments in

building a stronger future for all

Canadians is why we have a strong and

growing economy and are helping millions

of Canadians right across the country

[Applause]

but the truth is for all we've done

we're just getting started and that's

why this election is so important you

see the Conservatives have put forward

exactly the same plan that Stephen

Harper failed at for ten years

although you got to give them credit

this may be the first time on record

that the Conservatives decided to

recycle something but no Andrew Shearer

kept his platform hidden for the first

stretch of the campaign didn't release

it until late in the game after the

debates indeed on a Friday night of a

long weekend and why did he do that well

he did that because there's nothing for

Canadians in that platform but cuts cuts

cuts fifty three billion dollars worth

of cuts that's actually four times as

much in cuts as Doug Ford is currently

inflicting on Ontarians

I think people in Milton and indeed

right across the province right across

the country understand that now is not

the time to double down on conservative

cuts and the other thing the only other

thing Mr Shearer is offering other than

cuts and a couple of tax breaks for the

wealthiest because that's just what

conservatives do is to rip up the only

real plan to fight climate change that

Canada has ever had Nephilim oval wall

sucks I was passing that's why this

election is so important this election

is so important because we are facing a

choice that is not just about the next

four years it's about the next 40 years

will we keep supporting families will we

keep making life more affordable will we

lead in the fight against climate change

or will we go backwards I know what

Milton wants to choose that's right and

that's exactly and that's exactly the

plan we have we'd make it that made the

decision to even do more to invest in

Canadians and that's why we need a

progressive government to lead in the

fight against climate change and to make

life more affordable for everyone all

[Applause]

know

the Canadians understand how important

it is to continue with a government that

is progressive not just an opposition

that is progressive because to be quite

honest I was part of a very progressive

opposition that watched Stephen Harper

do nothing on climate change and

actually pull us out of Kyoto the

watched Stephen Harper cut our military

cut services for our veterans cut public

safety by cutting border security

loosening gun control these are the

things that a strong opposition couldn't

stop what we need is a strong Liberal

government

[Applause]

you know we talk a lot we use that word

progressive a progressive government

what does that mean

well tell you what that means that means

when we see a senior who's lost her

partner of 50 years

who's mourning it who's trying to figure

out what her life's gonna be now

realizes that on top of all the

challenges she's facing she just saw her

pension benefits cut because she lost

her husband's pension well we're gonna

help her out

that's what a progressive government

does a progressive government is one

that understands how important it is for

students to be able to get that

post-secondary education they need which

is why we're further increasing student

grants and making sure that you won't

have to start paying back your canada

student loan until you're making at

least thirty five thousand dollars a

year that's what a progressive

government does and a progressive

government is one that understands that

measures like the Canada Child Benefit

don't just help out millions of families

across the country thousands upon

thousands of families right here in

Milton it creates economic growth for us

all because more confidence in your

future more confidence in your kids

future that makes all the difference and

a progressive government well we're

going to increase the Canada child

benefit by 15 percent for kids under one

Aleut occultations mathematic a

progressive government understands that

you cannot build a strong economy for

the future if you were not also fighting

climate change and protecting the

environment and that's exactly what we

did four years ago Canada had no

national plan to fight climate change

and we made sure over the past four

years that now in every single province

it is no longer free to pollute and

we're putting more money back in

people's pockets with it we're banning

single-use plastics phasing out

coal-fired plants brought in a historic

oceans protection plan and when we took

office in 2015 there was only one

percent of our coasts and oceans that

were protected and we said we're gonna

hit ten percent by 2020 20 and actually

we didn't quite do that because it's

only 2019 and we've already protected 14

percent but we need to do so much more

we need to get to 25 percent of our land

and 25 percent of our oceans protected

by 2025 we need to surpass our 2030

targets and hit net zero by 2050

[Applause]

we need to plant two billion trees you

know I was talking with one of our MPs

one of our candidates in Markham Mary

yang and she was telling me that about a

gentleman who told her his story he

voted conservative last election and

pretty much all his life he's a

conservative but he sent Mary this time

I'm voting liberal and she said okay

that's great but why he said because

this time I gave my vote to my 13 year

old daughter and she says the

environment and my future is too

important so I'm voting liberal and I'm

choosing forward that's the choice we

are facing today it's a choice that's

going to echo we need to make sure that

young Canadians talk to their parents

talk to their friends get out and vote

and make sure that we stay on this path

of fighting climate change of making

life more affordable of getting guns off

our streets and stopping conservative

cuts we've put forward the strongest gun

control legislation in Canada's history

we're going to be banning assault

weapons and ensuring that cities can ban

handguns and not only are the

Conservatives not going to do that but

they're going to reverse some of the

stronger regulations we already put in

that's not moving forward

so my friends over the coming two days

we need to keep working incredibly hard

we need to keep reaching out to

Canadians and talking about the

important choice they're facing we need

to make sure that everyone understands

that this election is about our

collective future and the choice

couldn't be clearer do we step up or do

we go backwards and right here in Adam

Vancouver Dan's future riding of Milton

I can't help but think of something my

father used to tell me and that I passed

on to my son as I'm teaching him how to

canoe you see my father used to say that

when you're crossing that big lake and

the crowds the clouds roll in and the

wind picks up and the waves start to

break over the edge of your canoe

there's only one thing to do sing louder

and paddle harder so let's go doors on

let's choose forward

[Applause]
