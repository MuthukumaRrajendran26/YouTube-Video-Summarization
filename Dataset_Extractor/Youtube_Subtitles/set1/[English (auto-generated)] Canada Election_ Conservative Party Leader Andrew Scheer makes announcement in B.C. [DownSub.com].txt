we good

everyone good yeah you guys good

good morning everyone good afternoon

it's great to be here in Coquitlam in

Greater Vancouver now Vancouver is

always ranked as one of the most livable

cities and it's easy to see why the

coastal mountains the Pacific Ocean and

as someone who splits their time between

Regina and Ottawa the weather Vancouver

is just one of the many growing

world-class cities we have in Canada but

unfortunately far too many Canadians

spend more time stuck in traffic than

out enjoying their surroundings or more

importantly at home with their families

and loved ones whether you drive or take

public transit the fact is in many

Canadian cities such as here in Greater

Vancouver getting yourself from point A

to point B has become a nightmare

traffic jams service disruptions and

delays all this leads to less time with

your family according to Statistics

Canada in 2016 1.5 million Canadians

spent at least an hour commuting to work

and a good chunk of them right here in

Greater Vancouver and as many commuters

know an hour is often on the low end it

can often be much much more now in 2015

Justin Trudeau made a lot of expensive

promises in order to get elected among

them was a 170 billion dollar promise to

build much needed infrastructure in

cities like Vancouver it's four years

later and like so many other promises

this one was not as advertised for one

thing the Parliamentary Budget Officer

has noted that for every dollar Trudeau

promised to spend

he's only actually spent 60 cents and

the PBO analysis further showed that for

all the money he did actually spend and

for all the spending announcements he

made and photo ops he staged there were

no significant results to show for it in

other words he did spend some of your

money but got nothing done in one of its

many scathing reports into Justin

Trudeau's infrastructure boondoggle the

PBO said the plan for how to spend the

money quote does not exist meanwhile

commuters in Vancouver and another major

urban centres face more traffic

longer drives to the office and less

time with their families when it comes

to building infrastructure the Canadians

need Justin Trudeau is not as advertised

it's about time that commuters had a

government that was less concerned about

front-page photos and fancy spending

announcements and more concerned about

shovels in the ground and about getting

things built so you can get to and from

work faster and so your family can get

ahead first and foremost I want to

assure Canadians that as Prime Minister

I will ensure all infrastructure

projects that have already been

committed to will move forward and we

will put in place simple criteria for

the transportation infrastructure

projects that we will find there will be

a very simple question will this project

reduce commute times if the answer is

yes then that project will be put to the

top of the list on the approvals process

to double the video or Canadian L

Greater Vancouver that means the George

Massey tunnel replacement a badly needed

project to address the significant

congestion issues Vancouver commuters

face every day whether it's getting to

and from work or to hockey practice for

the kids in Toronto that means the

Ontario line and the young subway

extension okay Beck come today d-mac

ready soir

Lata CME on to the Quebec a levy so ha

my priority the time for talk is over

now is the time for action these are the

kinds of projects that make a difference

in people's lives by reducing gridlock

and speeding up commute times getting

them home faster after a long day at

work these projects could take many

forms road construction and upgrades

subway or rail expansion will put in

place

new standards of efficiency and

transparency for infrastructure spending

comparable to private sector standards

so you can see exactly how your tax

dollars are being put to work and rather

than a confrontational approach like

Justin Trudeau will work collaboratively

with all provincial and territorial

governments of all party affiliations to

build the right projects at the right

price on the right timelines

oh yeah Devon passed on the

confrontation effectively prevents a

territoire come Justin Trudeau New

Zealand collaborate to layer govern

among very important relations Coryell

further I will eliminate Justin

Trudeau's Canada infrastructure Bank a

thirty-five billion dollar failure that

has not lived up to its promise this

government knows best boondoggle in the

making was supposed to boost investment

and get more projects built but two

years after it started the

infrastructure bank has completed

nothing while costing taxpayers millions

in operating expenses I will also pull

Canada's ridiculous 256 million dollar

investment in the Chinese controlled

Asian infrastructure bank there is

simply no way

Canadian taxpayers should subsidize new

roads and bridges in other countries

well important projects like the George

Massey tunnel replacement go unfunded

here at home so that's the choice this

election re-elected Justin Trudeau led

government that will make your commute

longer and more expensive with further

delays to critical infrastructure

projects and a higher carbon tax that

will add 31 cents a litre to the price

of gas and a new Conservative government

that will prioritize projects such as

the George Massey tunnel replacement

here in Greater Vancouver the Ontario

line and the Yonge subway extension in

Toronto in a quasi Omni Ultima Quebec

Olivia projects that will cut down your

commute and put more money in your

pockets so you can get ahead it starts

by eliminating Trudeau's carbon tax

which just keeps going up as this

campaign goes along for transit users

will bring in the green public transit

tax credit this credit will make monthly

transit passes more affordable and

cars off the road reducing both

congestion and emissions Levent in

Canadians decide who they trust to put

infrastructure spending that choice

couldn't be more clear a choice between

liberal announcements and conservative

action a choice between liberal

infrastructure banks and conservative

shovels in the ground a choice between

scandal-plagued liberals trying to save

their own jobs and conservatives with a

plan to get you to and from yours thank

you very much

merci beaucoup have to take your

questions do you think that your absence

from today's climate demonstrations is

out of step with the tens of thousands

of Canadians who are currently out

marching in the streets well first of

all I believe it's always encouraging

when you see so many people especially

young people show their concern for this

very important issue and that is why we

have many candidates and members of

parliament who are there it's also why

I'm making this announcement today and

why we have made announcements in the

past about how we have a real plan to

battle climate change by taking the

climate change fight global and I think

Canadians see those people protesting

today see that Justin Trudeau's plan is

failing it is not as advertised we see

two spirit on the wall they grow number

the the person special only lesion he's

engaged only isn't really important

shikaku well he's doing the plunge they

intrude on the functional part tasks and

repair avoid aspect Lobell don't some

plan but Sir you are running to be the

Prime Minister of the country there were

three major party leaders that

participated in pride you decided not to

three major party leaders are

participating in climate demonstrations

today you are not what does this say

about you personally your personal views

well you mentioned the party leaders

marching today including Justin Trudeau

I find it interesting and I

that Justin Trudeau was actually

protesting his own government's record

on the environment and he'll be marching

today with so many people who realize

that his plan is not as advertised it

will lead to higher cost of living while

while not achieving our targets and I

think they see the the insincerity that

he has on this issue but on you as I

said I'm here making announcement today

that will lower commute times which

means less time people people will be

stuck in traffic less which means a

reduction of emissions as well as

finding important public transit

projects those are real concrete actions

that will help lower emissions here in

Canada yeah come see and also should we

give a trade we're late on college

automobile East Pass

Donna traffic sir very lazy Monsieur OSI

lacks mercy on the project for the

transport crewman allows only Zack the

concrete give a video nosy miss Jana

Kelly Malone the Canadian Press many

experts say that reducing congestion is

more about design of urban areas and

better public transport so how will

creating and expanding tunnels and new

road links reduce traffic congestion

well I can speak to the Matthew tunnel

replacement here when you have a tunnel

that does not have the capacity to

handle the number of motorists who use

it

that means there's huge backlogs and

that's time spent with cars idling or

moving very slowly that leads to higher

emissions so these types of upgrades to

help increase the capacity not only

means that people get to and from work

quicker more time at home spend with

their families but also less time in

their cars meaning lower emissions as

well so how precisely do you plan to

prioritize projects given the provinces

make decisions about what projects get

forward for federal approval or federal

infrastructure spending which is always

slower so what specific aspects of this

policy make you think that you could

speed it up well I'd point to the fact

that the trio Liberals have been

completely unable to get a project spill

to the Parliamentary Budget Officer

indicated that there is quote no plan

and that this money that was spent

didn't lead to new projects being built

or completed so what I'm announcing here

today is that we all work

collaboratively with

province we will be establishing this

criteria as to whether or not

transportation projects lead to reduced

weight commute times and that will be

the federal government's position as we

negotiate these agreements we've had a

great track record in the past the

previous Conservative government had a

record amount of projects built the

record levels of investments in

infrastructure that were completed on

time on budget and that is the type of

model that we'll be pursuing with with a

collaborative approach with the

provinces

obviously provinces and municipalities

will have their priorities as well ours

will be reducing commute times harvick

conv adopt a CB circle is not a neo the

syllable the priority their credit on

traffic become common a project with the

enemy good afternoon mr. chair JB Tasker

CBC News the can occur campaigning with

today mark Dalton a former BC liberal

Emily has supported the carbon tax in

the past of course he was in a

government that brought it about he said

that it's a way to reduce to change

behavior and reduce emissions are you

comfortable with having a pro carbon tax

person in the conservative fold and has

he renounced his position on this

Conservatives know that Justin Trudeau's

carbon tax is not working

conservatives know that under Justin

Trudeau we're falling further and

further behind while the cost of

literally everything is getting more

expensive and that's why our real plan

for the environment includes cancelling

the carbon tax bringing things like the

green home renovation Tax Credit and

taking the climate change fight global

and that is the the piece that Justin

Trudeau just does not understand on this

that Canada can do so much more to

reduce global emissions by exporting the

things that we can do well here at lower

emissions and exporting clean technology

on this day of national climate action

your and asking more money for roads

bridges and tunnels does that not strike

you as a bit tone-deaf because obviously

cars are a huge source of emissions in

this country well obviously when you can

shorten commute times you reduce the

amount of time that people spend in

their cars with their engines running

so that will lead to lower emissions

as well as I mentioned today we will be

supporting public transit projects

specifically the Ontario and Yonge lines

so we have a balanced approach that will

speak not just to make reducing traffic

times but also expanding public transit

post you mentioned the Parliamentary

Budget Officer you've mentioned the 31

cents that you think gas prices are

going to go up by that you have an ad

out which says that a $2 a litre gas is

just around the corner

yeah the Parliamentary Budget Officer

says that's gonna happen sometime around

2030 are you misleading voters not at

all we point to the added combination of

the carbon tax as well as the liberal

fuel standard that the leanest of that

figure we also highlight the fact and I

call on Justin Trudeau to come clean

with Canadians he will not tell people

what his carbon tax will increase to he

is making these types of announcements

today with no details and refusing to

answer how much Canadians will have to

pay for it but we do know that that

carbon tax will go up after the election

when he doesn't need your vote but he

still needs your money he's gonna raise

that carbon tax and that means more

money out of the pockets of Canadians

making life more expensive with all due

respect that the PBO suggests that's

gonna happen in 10 years time including

the fuel standard 31 cents but in 10

years not just around the corner well

III don't believe anything Justin

Trudeau says when it comes to costing

when it comes to tax hikes he is not as

advertised he cannot tell the truth to

Canadians I don't believe there's a

single Canadian out there that thinks

that there'll be a richer by by paying a

carbon tax we know his carbon tax will

go up

we know he's raised other taxes and

that's why it's so important this

election to defeat Justin Trudeau so

that we don't get hit with an even

higher carbon tax after the election CTV

um you mentioned your children your five

children in your in your speeches around

the country I'm wondering if you think

that global warming is a threat to your

children's future I believe it's very

important not to leave children an

economic deficit a fiscal deficit nor an

environmental deficit and that was one

of the inspirations behind our real plan

for the environment so I absolutely do

believe in order to leave our children a

better environment than we inherited we

have to have real action on the

environment concluding climate change

so there are about eight there are about

eight climate events here in and around

Vancouver will you be at any of them

I'll be showing how we're taking this

the climate change issue seriously with

announcements like this investing in an

expansion of public transit in reducing

commute times and highlighting other

aspects of our environment to plan like

the green public transit tax credit and

our plans to take the climate change

fight global recognizing that we can do

more to lower global emissions with an

environment plan that that speaks to

what Canada can do well here

exporting clean technology around the

world that is actually going to be

better off for the planet than a carbon

tax that chases away jobs and investment

to other countries with lower

environmental standards with a worst

track record on on making these types of

improvements and raising the cost of

living we should we do in Canada yet

I'm Daphne Brennan from the bank on her

your candidates in these two Coquitlam

writings as well as your candidate

they're all committed to they are

committed to you versus your candidate

believes that even in conversion therapy

can you explain how having candidates

like this I understand that your

position is you would not reopen the

abortion debate but you say that you're

letting your MPs will be able to bring

in private member's bills what can you

say the Canadians about who don't

believe in things like conversion

therapy this will not be well first of

all I can assure you that our government

will always stand up for LGBTQ Canadians

and their fundamental human rights I

will also point out that I made very

clear in the past that I will not

support any effort to reopen these types

of debates on on these types of social

issues and Cannes can have confidence in

that nothing has changed for our party

on this issue and it will not change

under my my Lucia yeah Vienna shows a

poor naturopathy dollar settle it

about what a consulate 10 major their

university back by choosing candidates

such as this one of the candidates in

this ride and the neighbouring riding

was actually brought in by the party not

was not the other candidate who wanted

to run was was pushed aside does that

not say that what your party is trying

to do is to use the abortion debate to

in fact get people elected

mr. Sherr you frequently cite the

Parliamentary Budget Officer that she

began your remarks today by citing him

and the Parliamentary Budget Officer has

written that the carbon tax and rebate

will leave 80% of Canadian families with

more money at the end of the day and at

that net benefit will increase over time

now if I go to the supermarket and I say

well this markets like $100 of my money

but I fail to mention that I got $100 of

groceries that would be misleading so I

want to ask you why do you not talk

about the readings so first of all I

don't believe there's a single Canadian

that believes that they're richer for

paying a new tax or a higher tax

secondly I will point out that the

Parliamentary Budget Officer had to take

the figures that the Liberal government

provided so there was so they were I

don't have any confidence in the in the

figures that Justin Trudeau is giving we

know that Justin Trudeau gave a massive

exemption to large industrial emitters

big industrial emitters have negotiated

themselves up to a 90 percent exemption

from the carbon tax hard-working moms

and dads and three years they have to

pay the full brunt of it and we know

that when you add in the higher fuel

costs higher home heating increased

expense with with goods and services

where small businesses have to pass on

their costs that Canadians will be worse

off under the carbon tax and you also

cite British Columbia as an example of

why carbon taxes don't work and haven't

worked in the past and I just want to

read to you some comments from the

legislature by your own candidate

marking our carbon tax appears to be

working independent studies have found

that between 2008 and 2012 fuel eosin BC

dropped by 16% per capita in 2015 a

review of seven independent studies

suggested that B sees carbon tax has

reduced emissions in the province by 15%

the world bank is called a model program

fuel use has declined here since 2008

increased in the rest of Canada and BC

now has the lowest income taxes

so where do you get your information

that the carbon taxes failed in the last

year that figures are available co2

emissions went up in British Columbia so

it went higher what we do know is that

Justin Trudeau's carbon tax is making

Canada fall further and further behind

our targets well adding the cost of

everyday essentials so that's what we're

basing our figures on afternoon Monsieur

David David from Global News thanks very

much thanks for bringing the m2 BC so in

2012 you may remember called Joe Oliver

was the natural resource Minister and he

put a letter out in which he described

the kinds of groups that organize

today's climate action things that they

had a radical ideological agenda he

referred to environmental and other

radical groups and was quite clear that

you know environmental groups were just

bad for Canada

you were speaker at the time I don't

recall if you weighed in on that so

that's gonna weigh in now did you agree

then with Joe Oliver's assessment do you

agree now that environmental groups are

a bunch of radical ideologue the ones

that are organizing the things today I

believe the Canadians who want

government to take the environment

seriously are justified in expressing

their concern and that's why we have a

real plan to tackle co2 emissions to

reduce co2 emissions not just in Canada

but around the world and that's the

piece of that the Trudeau Liberals are

missing in here we could shut everything

down tomorrow shut it all down power

everything down and in a matter of days

emissions from China India Indonesia it

would replace everything we did here so

if the goal is to lower the amount of

co2 that's in the atmosphere any plan

that does not have a global context is

doomed to fail our plan has that global

context we're gonna export clean

Canadian technology we're going to do

more of the things here in Canada that

we can do at a lower emissions rate that

is actually going to be better for the

planet

than a carbon tax that makes everything

more expensive and just drives jobs and

investment out of our country so given

that today's climate action strikes are

a global event and I'm certain hundreds

of thousands Canadians are demanding

global action from the likes of China

and

they may agree with your plan and you've

missed what seems to be such an easy

opportunity to show your solidarity with

Canadians who want that kind of global

action I'm kind of thinking you're

getting the point you're so hard on

these things that if the Rough Riders

won the Grey Cup you'd skip the parade

and Regina why would you just take an

easy option to go and say - Ryder -

Ryder for you said right see the

traffic's so bad so yeah so just again

it just seems like such an easy thing to

show up and be with other Canadians who

think this is important what on earth

was the downside for you not to take a

few minutes out of your campaign and say

I'm with you guys with all yeah I know

what you're talking about a pre marches

and events that Justin Trudeau is

participating in and again I'll say it's

extremely ironic that Justin Trudeau is

protesting his own government's record

of failure what I'm doing here is

showing my support for those who want

real action on the environment by making

announcements that will lower commute

times and thereby lowering emissions and

as well as expanding important public

transit projects those are concrete

steps I've seen so many of the signs in

these marches saying action not words

and I agree that's why we're committing

to concrete actions hi good afternoon

mr. chair I'm from NTD uncover my name

is a Vivienne I just

no question that a Chinese community

really care about Cara Hong Kong SEO

what's your comments on that thank you

well we of course support the peaceful

displays and and and protests in Hong

Kong Canada the Conservative Party will

always be a strong voice for democracy

for freedom for human rights and we do

support the rights of the people of Hong

Kong to to make their views known in

addition we've called on this Liberal

government to increase consular services

for Canadian citizens who are in Hong

Kong I know that they have not it that

they have not done that other countries

have they have not so we are continue to

support the one nation to one one nation

to systems of policy but absolutely

stand up for the rights of the people in

Hong Kong to protect their rights and

their ability to make their their voice

heard

thank you very much
