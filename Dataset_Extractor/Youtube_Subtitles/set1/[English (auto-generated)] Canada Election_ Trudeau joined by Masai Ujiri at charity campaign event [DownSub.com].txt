happy Thanksgiving everyone what a

pleasure to be here today with all these

incredible young people who I chosen to

spend part of their day filling campers

and making sure that everyone has a

Happy Thanksgiving

of course very glad to be here with a

Madison Police are a candidate here in

New York southwestern also someone that

I have had a tremendous pleasure working

with over the past four years as we

fight to build a better Canada also very

happy to have been joined here by Masai

Ujiri who is a extraordinary leader who

I got to know a number of years ago in

following the tragedy in the lodge where

he wanted to stop up and used his his

connections within the Raptors

organization to support give experiences

to kids from that community that had

been devastated by tragedy but his

leadership not just in the basketball

world but around the world empowering

young people and building a better

future is something that continually

inspires all of us and it is a an honor

to have him with us here today

we are focused of course on this

election and the choice that Canadians

are making it's a very clear choice

between continuing to move forward or

going in the direction of conservative

cuts that's not what people want we need

a progressive government is going to

keep focusing on it keep focusing on

young people which is why we're making

so many investments in education

investments in a brighter future for

everyone

it's getting personal deities about that

consider awesome Salameh - open up -

Issa reminisce pour like last on the

rafflesia Penelope - Nevada one in

common remembers one element publicist

but the conservatives say larger we can

offer constantly the club is always a

happy moment together with young people

and talk about the future we're building

and that's very much what we're doing as

we all choose to move forward together

Global News what can you tell us about

what happened last night and why there

was an increased security presence my

first concern was for the safety of my

family and for all Canadians in the room

this will not change at all how I

campaign but I'm not gonna make any

further comments on the community is

that my security the Metheny it is

although Mossad is several portions eg -

that's our song another question Simon

and me offended there's no mythology

can you speak to how it felt personally

to have to wear a bulletproof vest at

the event you know what this election is

so important that choice Canadians are

facing is so important and the the

importance of getting that connection

with people talking to people about the

very very clear choice they're facing

between conservative cuts or a

progressive government means that I am

as motivated as I have ever been to get

out and connect with people every chance

I get

so people really understand what is it

stake in the choice in this election

good morning Michele so Leo at The Globe

and Mail last night your wife was

supposed to be on the stage

but she never appeared if the security

concern was so great that you had to

wear a protective vest and your wife

didn't appear on stage why didn't you

just cancel the event for the safety of

the 2,000 people there my priority was

the safety of my family and the 2,000

people in the room I took advice from

the RCMP work with them but I will not

make any further comments on this

incident and on a separate matter the

Conservatives have been running Facebook

ads in Chinese accusing the Liberals of

wanting to legalize drugs can you

clarify your position on this and

comment on any concerns you have about

this information on this issue I think

we've seen that the Conservative Party

is continuing to mislead and even lie to

Canadians because they cannot explain

why they want to cut fifty three billion

dollars from Canadians four times as

much as dug for so instead they have to

lie about our platform I think it is

reprehensible we have been very clear we

will not be legalizing hard drugs we

will continue with the approach that we

have that has been working on fighting

this terrible opioid epidemic but we

will continue to be honest with

Canadians about the choice they're

facing between conservative cuts that

would be four times greater than what

Doug Ford has put forward or continuing

to move forward and invest in Canadians

with me 12 Monty who Canada pass give

birth purposely evolve apparently the

Cooper is announce the austerity

implement support so Creek and

shareholders when are grooving America

exists in all the conservatories a

security officer should we do and even

occasionally be negative about our work

surah al-kahf BlueGlass the fly so she

actually can attend what fun I think we

are seeing an increase in polarization

in election campaigns around the world

increased politics of fear negativity

and now as we've seen from the

Conservative Party flat-out lies to

Canadians we need to make sure that we

choose a positive vision for the country

and we are strong in our contrasts with

our proposal to continue to invest in

Canadians invest and fighting climate

change invest in support for families

where the Conservatives are promising

cuts four times bigger than what Doug

Ford has inflicted on Ontario Ombudsman

there's all manner of conspiracy theory

circulated a baseless

about last night's security incident

wondering what extent do you hold that

polarization you just referred to as

being responsible for creating that

environment where that kind of

specialist or I think we are seeing

unfortunately a extremely high level of

misinformation disinformation on online

and people who are really trying to

further polarize and make fearful

Canadians the reality is the

Conservative Party is continuing to

spread falsehoods to Canadians to try

and scare them into voting for them or

against us and I don't think that has

its place in Canada we need to continue

to make strong contrasts with we within

competing visions of this country and we

know from the Conservatives platform

which they finally released at you know

late on a Friday night of a long weekend

near the end of the election campaign

that they plan on cutting fifty three

billion dollars worth of investments in

Canadians and that choice is very very

clear for Canadians right now do we give

in to the polarization and the fear and

the division and the misinformation

being spread on the lines or do we

continue to move forward pushing back

against conservative cuts and choose a

progressive government is going to

continue investing in people and

continue fighting climate change no

so effective that negativity meters were

African government not racist of Donna

Maria I reckon group conservator a

fairly good mr. shears made some very

personal attacks against you he's called

a liar a fraud fake feminist his

campaign put on a press release

also baseless with suggesting something

some malfeasance on your part do you

think they hit that kind of language

from Mr Shearer puts you at your safety

at risk and does that encourage the kind

of things that could lead to security

problem you see this is the thing that

the Conservative Party of Canada does

now but not just now the very day after

I won the Liberal leadership they

launched massive personal attack ads

against me they feel that personal

attacks and lying to Canadians is the

only way they can get elected because

they know their platform is promising

cuts and austerities that will hurt

Canadians so the choice is very clear do

we continue with the progressive

government or do we double down on

conservatives and accept conservative

cons Cisco what does a party conservator

just gonna accept the conservatories us

coming from the perspective of someone

who thought you weren't doing enough

climate change we know now the

guttenberg will be heading out to

alberta shortly do you have any concerns

for her safety out there I think I am

concerned in general with the

polarization that we've seen in this

election we have seen this in in our

friends and allied countries around the

world where increased divisive

discourses misinformation deliberate

misleading of electors has led to some

very toxic elections but I have

tremendous faith in Canadians I know

from coast to coast to coast people have

gathered together with their families to

reflect on the kind of future they want

to be they're thinking about you know

what's in store for their kids what

opportunities are there for the next

generations

how we're gonna fight climate change how

we're gonna pull together and make sure

that everyone has a real and fair chance

to succeed and the choice people are

facing is a very simple one do we

continue with the progressive government

or do we go backwards to conservative

cuts those are the conversations people

are having and the kind of

misinformation and personal attacks that

the Conservatives are putting out there

it's not something that Canadians are

going to fall for thinking of some of

those conversations around the

Thanksgiving table I'm just wondering do

you think this may come out do you think

head is a racist country I think there

are many many Canadians who face

systemic discrimination every single day

and that's why I pledged myself and my

government to continue to fight against

racism fighting against intolerance

intolerance and fight for inclusion

clear you in a sense blaming no I think

it's very clear that that there is a

general polarization right now that

various parties have contributed to over

the past past months and more

specifically

for the past days but the decisions

around last night my concern for the

safety of my family and for the people

in the room were based on that

particular policy the parties have their

platforms up but in some ways it sort of

seems they're coming down as a

referendum on you and Andrew Shearer

wants to make this election about me

this elections know about me

this election is about Canadians and the

choice that they have to make about how

we move forward and the choice is very

clear do we move forward with

conservative cuts or do we keep with a

progressive government that's going to

invest in Canadians and fight climate

change

mr. shear ever I see a fellow John

Kasich except upon one see Felix your

putti Canadian it is Walker River Fire

2's gone except the Cooper

Conservatory's Wisconsin Erica Google

Emma

and I'd like to talk about your

sharpened attacks in the speech last

night you mentioned the NDP for one of

the first times how much of that is a

bit of desperation on your party's

partes you kind of see them eating at

your support I think it's very clear

that Canadians are worried about what a

Conservative government would do and

people need a progressive government not

a progressive opposition and the

opportunity to make those choices is and

what we're gonna be talking about over

this coming week what do you say to

those who say though this is a typical

liberal attack sort of when you when you

see the the vote starting to split on

the progressive side I think we've seen

what the what happens in places like

Ontario

you know the NDP wasn't able to stop

Doug Ford the NDP wasn't able to stop

Stephen Harper if you want to stop

conservative cuts you have to elect a

progressive government not a progressive

opposition

blood for illegal animal exists for

Swasey assist the the toxic replicas

please is right across the political

spectrum and if so would you urge your

supporters to dial back that rhetoric i

think one of the things that we're

seeing is even though we have a very

very positive plan to continue to invest

in canadians we've shared over the past

number of weeks in sharing our full

platform and continuing on the approach

that has worked to lift a million almost

nine hundred thousand Canadians out of

poverty and seen canadians create over a

million new jobs

most of them full time there is a

divisiveness in this election that i

think Canadians are noticing and

reflecting on and the choice is do we

give in to the misinformation and fear

like unfortunately so many of our

neighbors and allies around the world

have given into in their political

discourses or do we stay true to who we

are and make a choice based on building

a better future for our kids and

grandkids over the past four years those

are their investments we've made and

we're going to continue not choice is

the choice facing teenage

yes do we go for conservative cuts or do

we elect a progressive government

incitement to violence is almost

commonplace on role for government to

make take further action we have

committed to move forward on the

Christchurch declaration which in which

governments and Internet companies have

agreed to stand strongly against

terrorism online and we have also

committed to looking carefully at what

we can do to move forward in a way that

will both protect free speech which is

extremely important but also ensure the

Canadians online are safe from toxic

intimidation and threats of violence

this is something the Canadians expect

the rules that apply in the public

sphere should also apply in the virtual

sphere and the way we move forward on

that will require careful analysis and

thought and working with a broad range

of partners but I know Canadians expect

to be safe when they're online as well

never alone thank you

those knows a plug for a

you
