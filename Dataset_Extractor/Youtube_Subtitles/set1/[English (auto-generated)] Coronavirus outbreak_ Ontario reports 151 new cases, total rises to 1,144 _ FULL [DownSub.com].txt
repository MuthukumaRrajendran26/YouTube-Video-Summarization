hi guys same as every day 30 minutes one

question one follow-up and dr. Yaffe and

dr. Williams will give brief remarks

okay good afternoon and yesterday we

were talking about the number of cases

we thought they were going to go up by

extensively and they did not go up

further from what we had on Thursday but

there was some times of lab ramping up

and more of a quality assurance of our

new labs that are coming on board all

the time so we're going to talk about

our lab testing today as well as some

other measurements of how we're doing as

we're completing this first week of the

two-week period instead of one of high

intensity and high and I guess adherence

to the social distancing and the

physical distancing in that line there

with the ongoing aspects of the

essential businesses and shut down a

number of aspects there as all the

levels of government both federal and

provincial and different provinces and

territories are taking steps to stay the

course in this ongoing struggle and

issue to limit flatten the curve we'd

like to think planked occur but let's

try make sure we flatten the curve about

Kovach 19 at this time as we watch the

various scenarios unfolding in different

countries around we'll talk about that

in a moment but first over to the

Ontario data

let's get those numbers from dr. Yaffe

today okay thank you very much so we now

have a total of 1140 to laboratory

confirmed cases of kovat 19 in Ontario

fortunately we haven't had any new

deaths since yesterday we're still at

the total of 18 which includes two that

were not laboratory confirmed they were

linked in an outbreak in a nursing home

so which means our

total number at this point is 1144 cases

this is an increase of 151 over

yesterday the the exposure information

in terms of where these cases may have

acquired the infection still missing in

about 45 percent of cases but in those

where we have the information 29 percent

traveled 10 percent were a close contact

of a confirmed case 16 percent were

community acquired ie no travel history

no history of close contact of those who

had traveled the United States is the

top destination they came from the

United States at this point has reported

a hundred and eight seven hundred and

forty five thousand cases and this is

already quite higher than China which

had 81 thousand three hundred and

ninety-four cases the most second-most

common destination was Europe in terms

of the people in the ICU at this point

we're aware of 63 patients with kovat 19

who are in NICU and of those 46 are on

ventilators the lab data which we can

speak about more is showing that the

backlog of numbers is going down we were

over 10,000 now we're just around 8,500

and so more work to be done but it's

going the right direction thank you all

right and so with that we also have been

monitoring known than the backlog in the

laboratory testing and how we're making

headway as the other satellite

laboratories are opening up and then

picking up speed after they've gone

through their quality checks and that's

excellent news in that line there the

other aspect is that as we're looking at

the hospitalizations

trying to keep the numbers and that we

look like there's currently there's 63

people at this time in ICU 46 nice you

and 17 are not ventilated in those

settings there so we continue to see

that number slowly coming up the actual

number of the hospital anytime we

haven't got those exact numbers in there

because it tends to fluctuate with

people being mitad and discharged with

the more concerning ones of course

related to intensive care unit

admissions and a ventilation as

necessary in that regard I think the

other aspect is we watch on the Canadian

situation here while we have now 1144 in

Ontario Quebec our neighbors to the east

are moved up quickly to a 2021 and

British Columbia is holding just around

about 790 in that regard and the other

provinces are each dealing with

increases gradually in their own

respective jurisdictions so you can see

the the issue is continuing to move in

around there we've heard some comments

from the federal government around their

quarantine order we are still trying to

get clear on how they're going to

actually implement that again on each of

the ports of entry where it's at

airports land border crossings some rail

in a few places not much as far as

Ontario concern with water and looking

at the as I said to tabulate that with

the Canadian Border Security

Administration and trying to the numbers

there and then how are these individuals

going to be denoted how it's gonna be

documented and how are we going to

participate and work with federal

government in that regard to ensure that

the individuals are come into this late

date from traveling one are informed of

what they're supposed to do and known it

wasn't be informed but they educated and

what they need to do be assisted in

doing that and we want to be able to

help them in that regards because I

think for most part they want to do

what's right

understand what they're supposed to do

and then to get advice on how and what

they can or can't do so they can honor

the order properly for their period of

14 days assuming the fact they're all

coming across asymptomatic

in that and then how they would be

tested if they needed to be if they

develop symptoms and so that it's coming

back in the country they would need to

be informed what's currently going on

how does it work how does a

self-assessment tool work how does

telehealth work how does your primary

care doctor system work and because

they've been out for a bit and may not

be up to all things as you're aware have

been changing day by day and you heard

today the premier and our Minister

speaking on various issues around supply

chain gouging and monitoring the

ordering and supplies and materials this

is a very critical thing as we try to

ramp up all the air shoes around

personal protective equipment and our

supplies and orders many things coming

in from different areas orders from the

federal government promising and we're

trying to keep on top of that and making

sure that the everyone gets some but the

priority ones get first but we don't

want anyone left out so we have to keep

monitoring that through our regional

offices of Ontario health to ensure that

when we need it and when we ramp up with

any further cases of that those various

sectors will be ready to do that and

that's why we keep seeing that with the

limitation of elective procedures still

trying to address those that are not

totally elective that still need to be

dealt with in a timely fashion to

understand those individual cases and

make sure they're taken to the right

tables with their healthcare provider as

well as with a facility to understand

what the perspective is and that they

would get the care they need if it's not

elective then it's on urgent or simiiar

jan basis because during this time of

preparation we want to make sure that no

harm is done and that people need to

care originally get the care they need

in an urgent basis in a timely way so

we're still trying to monitor all those

aspects in that regard and with that our

mergency department visits with the

assessment centers large known them up

and running because we have almost 77

sites up and running so our emergency

two visits have been dropping so that

gives them the buffer if you may if all

of a sudden have to deal with a sudden

increase if it did occur as well as the

hospital

and the occupancy rate is down to quite

a bit of a low in ten years so they're

building up that resiliency to be able

to respond and that we can work with our

long-term care ministry and AHS Wells

with our seniors ministry around the

long-term care facilities and the

retirement homes and other venues that

we're looking at on a fairly rapid basis

of what we might be able to open up

quickly to increase our capacity looking

at all different scenarios and how we

might have to proceed so all things are

moving in direction

we continually have more briefings again

with our decision-makers both of the

premier and our minister deputy premier

as well as with a cabinet and update on

that so that they are fully appraised

and responding as they see fit

falling on their emergency order and

actions they're in so those are the

general summary of where we're at today

this is the end of the first week of the

two week of intense monitoring this

coming week which will be the second

week of the initials to school closures

post March Break is one to be monitored

where the numbers of tests and positives

I'm a little surprised they're staying

in the mid 100's and upper 100's I

thought we might be over 200 shortly but

we're getting moving on the backlog of

tests so well a few tests are only a

thing to monitor we need to see how the

trend goes over the next four or five

days so my general message is again do

you're doing well keep at it keep doing

all those inventive ways so staying

connected while being separated and it's

like communal gathering and isolation

all at the same time it seems like a an

oxymoron but people seem to be doing it

really well I applaud the Ontarians for

doing that the retail industry for

stepping up and helping in a way that

still delivers the essential services

while protecting their employees and the

shoppers that they get what they need

when they need to get it in a safe and a

timely way while trying to stay home and

to honor that aspect as well so with

that I'm going to open up for questions

and thank you for your time okay we'll

take the first question

your first question comes from Terry

Maremma with BBC national news please go

ahead hi there I asked the Minister of

Health about this could you move closer

to your microphone you faded there who

are you we can't hear you can you come

closer to your phone please

and maybe take it off for you graviton

you know not on speaker it's I'm just

hearing a bit of an echo that's better

so sounds like a new market is reporting

6 of 15 ICU beds are in useless coated

patients and are warning that their ICU

will fill up in the coming days with

COBIT patients are there any other

hospitals in the province providing

similar warnings the minister of health

related to the possibility of shuffling

caseload another Hospital is not

happening anywhere in the problem oh

thank you and to my knowledge that we

haven't heard others talk about that

current load they're talking about

concerns about imminent and that could

increase soon and that's all part of the

act of reporting the the if there are

cases they don't all present equally

throughout and so part of that is to

ascertain if one Hospital is being

overburdened can we reassign them to

other facilities around and handle that

and that that's part of the regional

model that's part of the reasonable

issue of shifting and moving first of

all within the facilities within the

region with our regional Ontario health

planning and then those coordinate up to

our command table about moving on a

larger basis and how we might be

reassigning when they're being

transferred by state paramedics to a

different location at that time and how

we would do that to and maintain at

least some buffer capacity at each

hospital knowing that this is going to

be a challenge if we get an increase it

won't all occur equally across the

province

happen different areas in different

times and it'll wax and wane and some

extent in that so we're gonna have to be

nimble and to keep the data up and keep

responding

hello either sorry about that how many

kovat tests are we currently processing

daily you talked about working to clear

the backlog the government suggested the

target will hit 5000 tested day by week

then are we going to hit that target and

what is the estimate on being able to

clear the backlog so you ought to try I

did my own back-of-the-envelope

calculation but I'll let you comment on

the general issue dr. you have okay sure

I know where we're doing over 3,000 a

day at this point and aiming for 5,000

by early this coming week and aiming for

something are close to 19,000 by

mid-april their doctor wondering

Portugal passed away last night in the

ICU of London Health Sciences Centre I'm

wondering if that death is included in

your updated numbers and also what the

recovery rate of people in Ontario that

go into ICU for treatment is for coma 19

well we are not aware of the of that

honor you know the death in London

Health Sciences

it hasn't if it was from kovat 19 it

hasn't been reported at this point

perhaps they haven't figured out the

cause of death yet so that as soon as we

know we would add it to our data

although I was on your second part of

your question there it's a good question

we know some who have recovered from

intensive care inventing our our number

there is still small but where that

would be a good one to collect or to

understand as we go forward to see what

is our recovery rate in that aspect and

so I have been advised many statistics

and again as dr. Yaffe said the London

case if it came in late it wouldn't be

part of our report today it'll be

for the report tomorrow and they may be

in the process of having sent samples in

for testing and we have to wait to see

it hasn't entered into our positive lab

test but it may be a suspected case in

that and just needs laboratory

confirmation okay next question about

the supply of fifty five million not

that were stockpiled after SARS they

know that those men have expired have

they all been destroyed and it's not how

many masks are from a stockpile are

available to be distributed to well you

have to remember it when those were

stockpiled after SARS in 2003 by 2013

most them are already 10 years old so

all were actually taken out of that

amount way back nearly five six years

ago there are some left or because

anywhere at all purchased at the same

time and there has been some

replenishing of certain supplies and

stocks of that so some have expired

quite a while ago and some of just

expired as a result we're trying to get

direction from the manufacturer for

manufacturers and also from Health

Canada about the usage of expired in 95

you have to have some level of

inspection what they can or might or

could be used for we're certainly have

clear direction that they could be used

for fit testing because then it's an

elastic band that's the weakness

sometimes it's the actual event and then

the other aspect that one might use them

for is that they could still suffice

quite well in place of a surgical mask

but then we'd have to make sure they

were at least visibly denoted on the

mask that it was not a 95 anymore it was

a surgical mass equivalent so we're

looking at all those ideas there as we

continue to ramp up our supplies and

orders with all the other ones coming in

and we've been encouraged with the

various sources that are coming and

promises and that so we're it's a

full-time court press and that matter by

our team working on personal protective

equipment next question

comes from snowman cookies from Canadian

Press please go ahead hi there

the province is announce that they want

to reduce gatherings to just five people

eventually and I wanted to ask if this

would have any sort of effect somehow

businesses like grocery stores would

operate and whether you'd recommend any

for changing

yeah we're in active discussion of what

we might want to do one thing we're

trying to differentiate is the big

concern of a lot of the other provinces

is the public gatherings of more out in

public places and parks and on the

streets etc and that meanwhile there are

what you call essential services such as

retail food groceries we're to have more

than say number five in a store dating

time would not be surprising when you

have employees and shoppers but having

you know 300 people in would not be

acceptable so lemon them are already

doing and in retail and essential

services taking steps to maintain the

physical and social separation which is

the key in there and also to have the

proper things to protect their cashiers

and vendors in that light so that's some

so you have to differentiate between

numbers and public gatherings versus

events or events that are actually

tabled or you're talking about internal

things as in essential services and

business how would they continue to

operate in a way that people can acquire

those essential services and yet not

compromise on their aspects of physical

and social separation so all these

things are an open and dialogue at this

time and if there any changes we would

hope to have that out to you in in a

short time to stop people from traveling

domestically if they have symptoms other

would affect overall rates in Ontario

and whether there might be any plans in

Ontario to also include a ban on travel

because the ban currently only includes

trains and

because the the federal government

announced concerns with travel and

domestic within Canada if you're

symptomatic and of course our thing if

they were leaving disembarking or going

on a flight or something here across

into other provinces if you're

symptomatic you shouldn't be at the

airport anyways you should be home and

so you should not be flying you should

not be traveling the train you should

not be going the bus you should not be

out in the public you should be staying

home and we can't emphasize that's

strong enough and you may feel that

there's pressures and issues but by

doing that and by succumbing to that

kind of pressure you can put a lot of

people at exposure at risk and cause

quite a bit of consequences so we

actually take that seriously as far as

how that might affect all the different

types of travel and how I might monitor

that that's all being worked out because

you just heard some announcement today

by the prime minister and so it's just

fresh out at the same time how does that

impact us so far on our our cases and

issues and concerns we haven't had a lot

that would say travelled from province X

or province Y we've had a few and as

chief medical officer of health if we

knew of cases that have come over from

our province of theirs they want to

share the information or the other way

around

because we would want to do a case

contact back here that they might have

been symptomatic already in one province

and they need to know that information

so we share it as much as we can between

each other it hasn't been a huge number

fortunately but we have to monitor that

as we're getting more and more so-called

case communities arise and related

unrelated to contacts and international

travel next question your next question

comes from Kelly grant with the

globodyne go ahead Kelly we're having

trouble hearing on you

we're just having a little trouble

hearing you okay I'm gonna be louder now

am i ladder now can you hear me okay

okay I'm close to the bonus I can't be

here I wanted to ask about the nursing

home cases and I'm wondering if you're

planning to stick with this sort of flu

outbreak needs policy of stopping

testing after three cases I I understand

the reasons why on the ground but I

imagine terms of tracking the cases

we're gonna see a lot of deaths in

nursing homes would it be beneficial to

know for certain that they had tested

positive yes we've been we looked at

that we're trying to assess because when

we have a outbreak in a nursing home or

a long-term care facility that's based

on when you have a cluster of syndromes

a syndrome week of respiratory you don't

say well we have to wait for the test

results to come back so then we would

declare if you have two one or two or

more in a certain area you would declare

an outbreak and start your investigation

which includes a lot of steps and

processes that are laid out in our

protocols part of that if you identify

the organism and in normal flu season

since flu is quite endemic in the

province after a while you know which

areas of the province has lots of

circulating there is not much need to go

any further that because you'd already

undertaken your steps to previously to

vaccinate all those residents for flu

and you start using Tamiflu to treat

them proactively so you try and curtail

any outbreak with Cova 19 we don't have

a vaccine and with kovat 19 are anti

virals such as Tamiflu or also tama vir

do not work in the case of corona virus

so we don't have that venue there

therefore how should we alter our

programs and services so we've looked at

that to say well and talk to our

consultants on how we could assess and

pick up quickly on any type of outbreak

in there again it was syndromic

respiratory but sometimes we're finding

with the Cova 19 some of our elderly

people in these residences don't give

very much evidence of the symptoms some

do not mount much of a fever they don't

have a very significant change in their

coughs I'm going to be coughing all the

time anyways and some have certain

always a certain level shortness of

breath because of their comorbidity so

it is the channel

for a long-term care staff - to notice

that there's been a change if you may in

the person status and that they would

alert them the fact that something's

going on and so we continue to delve

into that and as far as our testing we

may choose to test more at this time in

the case of an outbreak simply because

people are asking those questions so

we're looking at how we're altering our

protocol to make it more addressing the

uniqueness of the Cova 19 as as we're

learning presenting itself in this

high-risk vulnerable population but our

priority mostly is keep it out of the

long-term care facility that means

putting a real I guess someone might use

the term wall around them and that means

careful screening of all visitors

limiting visitors only essential ones

and over your staff and making sure

you're not moving infections from one

facility to another by staff movement

etc so these are all steps that were

certainly directing and dealing with and

discussions with the Ministry of

long-term care say you're thinking about

it why not just go ahead with it two or

three reasons one is that if you went

tested everyone in all the nursing homes

all the time we wouldn't make much

progress on our other testing of cases

that are symptomatic so it would use up

all our laboratory testing capacity Plus

that means then some of the priority

ones would not get seen right now we

decide that cases in a long-term care

facility that we were suspect as an

outbreak is a priority testing of those

individuals to test everybody all the

time each time a negative result doesn't

tell you much except that you didn't

find at that time the chance of just

find a positive now and again on regular

testing is a little bit like you know a

fishing expedition so you've got to do

something a bit more timely and

effective and efficient than doing

testing all the time so we're looking at

many ways we might do that tomorrow that

better and if we have to do an outbreak

investigation how we might do wider

testing without compromising our overall

provincial lab or laboratory system

which still is

mostly driven by a lot of people from

the public sector traveling sector

returning symptomatic and of course

meeting the needs of testing our

inpatients the ones in intensive care

and emergency departments if and when

they do arrive our health care workers

to assess them as well and then are

always concerned about some of our more

isolated remote communities as in our

first nation citizens to make sure we

have those tests those tests done in a

timely fashion so it's all a matter of a

right balance and to get it the best

result for the best procedure trying to

gain the best protection and if it

doesn't move the yardsticks much on

protection then we should look at other

things that we're trying to do and

that's we're really trying to drive it

this time next question please go ahead

last week you was said that you would

reach 5000 tests per day by bah-bah 5 by

the end of the week and I believe dr.

Jaffe just says that will be breached

sometime early next week now instead why

has it taken you longer or beat that

mark well doctor having a the the the

number there I was doing my back of

envelope was the ones we sent out to

some other labs out that they haven't

give us having to process them all yet

my total that I got or that ones that

today moved out was around about 4100 so

we're getting close to that number and

so that's a matter of how their dad is

going to come into our system from those

other labs and that we're still working

out the logistics of that if you may so

I see in potential there we did we could

have done probably about 4,200 today so

we're pretty close to mark and so I'm

still optimistic maybe even by the end

of the weekend early part of next week

we'll be at that 5 but it's all these

different different labs and components

and groups coming together that takes a

coordination and timing to get it to all

come with the results so we have them in

front of us to speak of the table here

if I could just add to that you know I

think as we add these new labs they have

to go through testing to ensure that

their tests are valid so the first 500

or so

that they that each lab does have to be

verified by the Ontario public health

lab so that's a very you know quick step

but it has to be done before those

numbers can start to go up as well on

modeling or various scenarios and so on

in in the British Columbia yesterday

they had didn't walk through showing

what kind of modeling they currently

have and what that means um have you

done your own modeling or different

scenarios that might happen and uh would

you be willing to hear those numbers we

have been doing quite a bit looking at

modeling over while now not just one

model number models we have used our

public health Ontario to develop some

models and assess some of the other ones

the inferior model looking at what some

of the similar to the BC model what the

UK is doing we also have a group of

academics with public with the dalla

Lana School of Public Health

combined with University of Toronto and

other experts to look at their modeling

and what are they putting forward

because there's different ways to do it

and different ways to care at the

analysis and our sense is that instead

of just having one model can we look at

a number and then ask our experts to say

so which ones closest to excuse me our

Ontario scenario and we're going those

discussions lifetime right now a number

of things are carrying out so I can't

give you that analysis today but

hopefully be coming up with something

very short on that because we want to

make sure we're looking uniquely at how

does Ontario figure and where do we

place ourselves in the various modeling

thing and modeling projections such that

we can plan with various scenarios

around Hospital resources ventilation

equipment PPE etc so this is all in a

very much dynamic conversation at this

time next question

question comes from Rob Ferguson with

the Toronto Star please go ahead

I've heard they're doctors today the

federal government did 30 percent of the

people in hospitals with koba 19 across

Canada are under the age of 40 so I

wondered if that jive with the

percentage here in Ontario and if you

have a breakdown people and I can do

that

so have you said 30 percent yeah okay

that was pretty close to what they put

out last week that it's interesting and

most the ones are in the ages between 40

and 69 but by demographics we have about

30 odd percent that are over 70 and 80

in the hospital at this time the number

seems to be changing and shifting fairly

quickly there so it's it's a ballpark

that I would say if you say the age

group 40 to 60 30 40 50 that'd be about

30 percent 20 to 30 it's a small number

so we want a bit more breakdown the way

they're clumping them together that

might be misleading that saying okay

majority are 20 to 25 that's not true so

I think they're doing the 20 to 40 group

so we're trying to as our numbers are

we're getting enough numbers across

cameras are getting large enough that we

can do some better analysis so we're

getting these updates and we I would say

we segmenting of the different

categories as the numbers get larger we

can break that down even better so I

think you're 30 percent was correct at

this stage but how that breaks down into

the younger part of that age group and

the older one I haven't seen those

numbers ever follow up do you I'm trying

to mind outta here

no dr. Jaffe has that number I'm talking

on my large sheet here and I let me just

have a look here I'll try and get that

back to you Robin

okay moving on next question your next

question comes from Kate Allen with the

Toronto Star please go ahead

oh I'll just step in here Rob I found my

number right now the total across the

board of health care workers that is we

don't know if they're from in the

hospital or from travel or from case

contact the number I have here is about

91 since the start of the whole episode

in the end of January but again that's a

cumulative total and it doesn't break it

down those were on the job at the

healthcare setting okay moving on

[Music]

category is trying to say by in the

eight stratified categories sorry yeah

the aged ones arisen we had ones I've

been receiving from the national data

where in the 60 and above and then there

was the 40 to 60 and then sorry 46 7

there was 20 to 40 I had some in the

numbers under 20 but that was a really

small number when those numbers gets big

enough it doesn't looks misleading you

know just happy 3 alerts and whomp under

the age of 40 or whatever right thank

you I misunderstood your question yes it

would be my anticipation like I'm not

hoping for large numbers of course but

when you have a larger end and we can

stratify it so it makes sense we would

be doing that

we don't have that that data this at

this moment but we could get back to you

okay next question your next question

comes from please go ahead first of all

thank you for doing this thank you dr.

really not you're happy for a particular

question we I hear lots of reports about

some preliminary concepts that people

are putting forward using various

techniques to produce it and different

methods to use to carry out the research

but I right now from our federal people

who are getting back to us that there's

nothing imminent at this time and

remember in vaccine world imminent means

like four to six months off so we're

waiting to hear some we hear some

problems does something could be very

quick but then of course there haven't

undertaken any clinical trials and

safety always has to be a key factor as

you're dealing with any new products

coming in so yes certainly we've heard

about that and I believe there are

studies ongoing currently but at this

point there's no evidence that it works

for kovat 19 it is an effective

medication for some other things like

malaria in certain cases and so it's not

recommended at this point we're waiting

for the results of the studies next

question

my question is Ontario announced the

proclamation of the supply chain

management Act Saturday and its effort

to purchase an employee critical

equipment my question is what benefit

will just act be to residents as opposed

to participation in federal collective

purchasing I think the aspect there is

one how to help Ontario citizens

certainly the aspect of a federal

procurement our own procurement whatever

way we can do the procurement is going

to be critical to ensure that our health

care workers our health care facilities

and all those involved in in in those

essential services whether it's dealing

with the homeless and different groups

like that is there at their provision I

think the aspect that we're trying to

deal with here is that in order for the

the government the cabinet the premier

and our Minister of Health and and of

course our command table to understand

what we have we do have to have a clear

declaration of what everybody has in

store in stock at this time so that we

can ensure that there's a fair and

reasonable distribution what's out there

knowing that some may have stockpile a

certain amount and may be reluctant to

tell us what's there by the same time if

that was present and why were waiting

for supplies to come in and there was

another facility that was running out

why would we not remove that material

from that place over to deal with that

because in another few days the supply

would come in and we compromised one

facility because one was unwilling to

either declare or make it known what was

there so in essence we're in this

together and there's just one major

stockpots all of us and we need to move

it to where it needs to go to ensure the

ongoing care and the safety of all our

healthcare workers as you undertake to

take care of these citizens when they

become ill with Kovac 19

tend to participate in federal

collective purchasing oh that's why I

said the outset we are and we have our

orders in we're calling phoning emailing

we want we're doing that as assertively

as we can so yes that's a always of

trying to procure we're going there

please go ahead hello thank you for

taking my question it seems like a

little daily now this week we've been

hearing about more employee Doni

essential services testing positive for

lives but grocery surplus for example

are you considering which I guess the

risk to both employees and customers are

you at all considering any more measures

to protect people who visit these

essential services I would say we heard

of a case we haven't heard a lot we hear

some with a number of people that out

there moving around so it's something

we're watching or we continue to get

questions from various essential

services and their employers about how

they might improve their services better

we're gonna preserve that and monitor

that and we're asking say some essential

companies that are doing their

businesses there may be some components

of their business that are not that

essential and they could curtail those

while still offering the essential

components they could do things to

decrease the size of the workplace area

that people are not in close contact

they could do things more virtually

order online so as various ways that

were continually nudge that because some

of the people in the case some occasion

referring to we're talking that they

might have got infected before we came

the essential services almost like 8 to

10 days 1214 in the cases we're talking

about so it's a matter of ramping up all

these protection things and to ensure

the safety of the employer and the

employer staff as well as the customers

who are coming to get those essential

services and they don't have to come

physically more and more are being done

by virtual by delivery and by extension

so we're getting better at it all the

time but doesn't mean we can't keep

working at it more follow up and this is

the last question okay the numbers

announced today much lower than what you

had anticipated you still expect to see

I guess during this critical time in

number of cases to jump 200 that was my

anticipation when we had it I assumed

that we'd be up in the twos mid twos

especially we were doing with the

backlog of the tests we still have a

backlog of 8400 or so to get the deal

with so I was surprised we haven't

jumped up that fast and we'll have to

keep marking the situation these are

trends and directions one day or two day

doesn't tell us everything so let's wait

to see what the next few days bring and

we'll get back to you on a daily basis

okay thanks everyone

you
