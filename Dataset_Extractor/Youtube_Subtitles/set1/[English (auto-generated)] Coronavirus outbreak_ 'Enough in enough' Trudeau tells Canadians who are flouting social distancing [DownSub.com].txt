I want to begin by recognizing that a

lot of people have now been stuck at

home for a week or more because of kovat

19 if that's starting to take a toll

it's understandable but we can't afford

to stop now I want to be clear social

distancing physical distancing is the

single best way to keep the people

around you safe what does that mean it

means keeping two metres between

yourself and someone else

it means avoiding groups it means

staying home as much as possible if you

choose to ignore that advice if you

choose to get together with people or go

to crowded places you're not just

putting yourself at risk you're putting

others at risk to your elderly relative

who's in a senior's home or your friend

with a pre-existing condition our nurses

and doctors on the front lines are

workers stocking shelves at a grocery

store they need you to make the right

choices they need you to do your part

we've all seen the pictures online of

people who seem to think they're

invincible

well you're not enough is enough go home

and stay home this is what we all need

to be doing and we're going to make sure

this happens whether by educating people

more on the risks or by enforcing the

rules if that's needed

nothing that could help is off the table

today we're launching federal

advertising campaigns you'll see faces

that you know and trust people from our

cultural sector getting out the

recommendations from our health care

workers not having heard this message

won't be an excuse we're reaching

everyone listening is your duty and

staying home is your way to serve I

think people need to get the message

that this isn't just about them this is

about their neighbors this is about

vulnerable seniors this is about health

workers who are on the front line

trying to keep us all safe Canadians can

and must do their part to keep us all

safe when we see images of people out

enjoying the sunshine in large groups

that is extremely concerning because

they are not just putting themselves at

risk they are putting everyone else at

risk we need to slow and stop the spread

of this virus if we are going to come

through this strongly as a country

without losing too many of our loved

ones every single Canadian has a

responsibility to engage in keeping

their distance in staying home whatever

possible and ensuring that those who

have to go out for essential services

and to keep keep us healthy and alive

and fed are not at risk themselves

apostasy first

pour beaucoup de Canadian key so she's

er there walk dr. John nurse with the

protocol recommendation he sees if we

sample beaucoup John he was a junkie

kiss whisperer I think it's frustrating

for a lot of people who are listening to

medical advice and staying home for

their safety to watch other people out

there putting not just themselves at

risks but everyone who is staying home

at risk as well
