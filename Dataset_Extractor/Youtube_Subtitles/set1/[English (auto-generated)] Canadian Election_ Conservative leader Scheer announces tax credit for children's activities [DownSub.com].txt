well might a bordo to limo it's so

wonderful to be here in this incredibly

beautiful part of the country and no

matter how often I come back here I'm

always blown away by the scenery this

election is very much about the kind of

country Canada will be for you it's

about your future will it be a country

where you struggle to get by where life

gets more and more expensive and your

dreams and goals are out of reach or

will Canada be a country where life is

actually affordable and the life you

want is within your reach that is what

this year's federal election will come

down to who do you trust to leave more

money in your pocket so you and your

family can get ahead voila so sore

but let action further hell this

attorney on key federal conference for

Metro Pluto

Dumbo posh poor Kovu hey Butler femi we

see a mea but record EDM one of the

first things the Trudeau Liberals did

four years ago was eliminate tax credits

for families he took away the public

transit credit and he took away

important support the parents need why

because at the end of the day Justin

Trudeau thinks he can spend your money

better than you but we all know that his

poor judgment leads him to spend money

on things we don't need then he sticks

you with the bill over the course of

this campaign Trudeau is going to make a

bunch of big spending promises but he's

already proven he can't be trusted on

the things that truly matter to families

if he's re-elected his endless deficits

will force him to raise taxes even

higher his carbon tax will go up and

make gas groceries and home heating even

more expensive up to $2,000 more

expensive per year per family his debt

will consume public services like

education and health care and his poor

judgment will lead to more scandal at

home and more weakness abroad I have a

posit

vision for Canada and a plan for all

Canadians to get ahead a new

Conservative government will live within

our means so that we can lower your

taxes to put more money in your pockets

for you for your kids and for your

retirement and over the coming weeks we

will propose new concrete measures to

relieve the pressure and ease the

burdens that families face every day

just yesterday I announced that a new

Conservative government will cut income

taxes for every Canadian the universal

tax credit the universal tax cut will

save a typical to income family with

average salaries eight hundred and fifty

dollars a year that's eight hundred and

fifty dollars back in your pocket each

and every year I have a plan for all

Canadians to get a hand to get ahead a

plan for you and your kids to have the

life you've been working so hard for now

I'm a dad to five exceptional kids my

wife Jill and I know firsthand that when

families grow so do the expenses that

come along with it a my plan to help

Canadian parents is focused on helping

those hard-working moms and dads who

just want to give their kids the best

life they can whether it's hockey

programs or dance lessons basketball or

soccer

whether it's piano lessons musical

theater our little extra help with math

science or even studying a second

language every parent wants to give

their kid the chance to get ahead

Crysta swaboda hockey who they call the

dance to basketball to soccer this is

why they called the piano do the music

we do theater one coffin per did pull a

mathematic license or prendre Nouvel on

to labor on will Daniel or some phone

lash on stereo see down levy as Jill and

I have learned five times over having

children is a blessing but giving kids

the chance to play a sport learn an

instrument or work with a tutor is

beyond the financial means of many

Canadian families that is why I'm so

proud today to announce that as Prime

Minister I will introduce the children's

fitness

tax credit that will allow parents to

claim up to $1,000 per child per year

for fitness and sports related expenses

will make that credit refundable so

lower-income families benefit most and

parents of children living with

disabilities

we'll be able to claim an additional

$500 but we won't stop there a new

Conservative government will introduce

the children's Arts & Learning tax

credit for parents to claim up to $500

per child for arts program expenses or

for other educational activities outside

of school this credit will also be

refundable just we fear that on say or

did we count on Oprah - Shiva a story

be flexible so if you choose language

lessons or math tutoring this credit

will apply to those activities too and

parents of children living with

disabilities will be able to claim

double the amount up to one thousand

dollars per child per year every single

family with children sixteen or under

will be eligible for these new credits

this will help parents ensure that if

their child needs a little bit of extra

help to succeed at school they can get

that help if their child wants to learn

an instrument or take an art class

parents can give them that chance as

well and if a child wants to be active

try a new sport or play on a team

parents can provide them that

opportunity as well Justin Trudeau has

spent the last four years fighting for

his billionaire friends and his powerful

connections I'm running to be Prime

Minister for all Canadians who just need

a break the people who are doing the

right thing is getting an education

getting a good job working hard paying

their bills on time but who still can't

seem to get ahead in life

the parents who sit around the dinner

table crunching the numbers to figure

out how they'll make it to the end of

the month like my parents often did

that's who I'm fighting for and that's

who a new Conservative government this

fall will govern for Juma present

Vogel more conservative a governess at

is clear

between a prime minister who will make

life more expensive and a prime minister

that will help you get ahead we're

Justin Trudeau will use the power of his

office to reward his friends and punish

his enemies I will uphold the rule of

law

bring ethics and integrity back to

government and shine a light on his

scandal and corruption where he will say

no to the dreams and aspirations of

Canadians I will say yes and where he

will cost you more and make your life

more expensive I will run a government

that lives within its means is I have a

plan to put more money in your pockets

so you can get ahead our family-friendly

tax credits for fitness

arts and learning are part of helping

young families get ahead and they are

part of my positive conservative vision

for Canada and that is what I'm offering

to Canadians on October 21st

thank you very much merci beaucoup hi

mr. shear Janice Dixon The Globe and

Mail

you've criticized the Liberal government

for running deficits the large income

tax cut you announced yesterday could

make the deficit even larger you

mentioned cutting funding to the Asian

infrastructure bank that's 250 million

what else will you not be spending money

on well as I've indicated we are going

to get back to balanced budget over a

responsible period of time that is that

is going to be over the five year time

period we will do that will show

Canadians exactly how we will get back

to balanced budgets during this campaign

it's incredibly important that we do

that because we know that

massive deficits for years and years and

years threaten social programs it means

more and more of the tax dollars of

Canadians are going to pay the interest

on that debt that's why we have to get

back to balanced budgets and we'll be

showing Keynes exactly how we're going

to do that the liberal war room is

running attack after attack how do you

think your your team has handled that so

far and is your plan of running a

positive campaign working

I believe that when Katie and see what

each party is focused on they're going

to see that the Conservative Party is

focused on concrete measures to make

life more affordable and help them get

ahead if the Liberals want to focus on

on these types of attacks I will say

that the candidate that I am most

concerned about is the Liberal candidate

for Pappy know someone who is broken

ethics laws twice who has invited a

terrorist along to a state event who is

pictured with Joshua Boyle and who is

blocking attempts at the RCMP to get to

the bottom of the SNC Lavin scandal that

candidate would never pass conservative

Quebec the opportunity to share its

hydroelectricity with other provinces as

well and I'm the only candidate for

Prime Minister who has a plan to get

that done good morning mr. Sherr me

Rabson from The Canadian Press

there are some some young people on

Parliament Hill and across the country

today they're saying that they are there

making a pledge that they will not have

children because they are so concerned

about about climate change and they will

not have children until they see proper

action from the government

what do you say to those kids who don't

even don't actually want to have a

future have children let alone have a

future well I mean obviously I've

someone who has five children I believe

children are a great blessing and they

are the future of our country in the

future of our society I will say to

anyone who's concerned about climate

change and Canada's environment global

environment is that we are the only

party with a real plan for the

environment we have concrete proposals

that will reduce canada's co2 emissions

take the climate change fight global and

put money back in the pockets of

Canadians under Justin Trudeau's plan

everything is getting more expensive

with a carbon tax and we're falling

further and further behind our targets

so I understand why they would be

frustrated with this Liberal government

your your tax credit today it's the

second time so far that you've announced

her resurrecting a tax credit that the

former government had in place when

those were canceled the the Liberals

said that they were doing it in part to

increase the Canada Child Benefit which

you are also saying that you're going to

maintain and that that was their choice

is that what what's choice are you going

to make in terms of tough choices to

balance the budget and on these how many

more of these tax credits are you gonna

be resurrecting okay

well I can assure you that throat the

rest of this campaign will be proposing

new ideas to leave more money in the

pockets of Canadians these were

incredibly popular tax credits thousands

of hundreds of thousands of Canadian

families appreciated the extra help with

paying for kids activities that is why

they were so disappointed when just

Trudeau canceled them and again it goes

back to choices Justin Trudeau believes

that he can spend your money better than

you can and that is why he canceled

these types of very popular tax credits

we will be bringing them back we will

also have a fully costed platform that

shows Canadians exactly how we're going

to get back to balanced budgets while

still maintaining increases to important

services like health care and education

it's a question of controlling the rate

of growth of government departments and

some philosophical differences you know

we don't believe that Canadian taxpayers

dollars should be sent to the Asian

infrastructure bank to build roads and

bridges in other countries that's just

one example of how we're going to invest

in the priorities for Canadians we al

mister sure good morning Omar stretch

Edina from CTV News you and several of

your candidates are claiming that the

Liberals will raise the capital gains

tax on the sale of principal residences

the Liberals say this is 100 percent

false will you stop making this claim

and direct your candidates who are also

making this claim to do the same well

let's keep in mind that just because

Justin Trudeau says he'll do something

it doesn't mean he'll do it you can't

trust him he has raised taxes on

Canadian families even though he said he

wouldn't so when we see that this is the

type of idea that liberals are proposing

we I think Canadians are rightly

concerned about it this is this idea was

put forward by a hand-picked Liberal

Member of Parliament someone who's very

close to Justin Trudeau and these are

the types of the ideas that Justin

Trudeau will need to implement after the

election when he doesn't need your vote

but he still needs your money

the Liberals are saying that this was a

summary of opinions that it was never

a policy proposal and that it was never

under consideration so you know get

given that one of their own candidates

has also gone on radio the party says to

say that this was false and a bad idea

is what the candidates said will you

stop making the claim that that they are

gonna do this well Justin Trudeau has

lost all confidence from the Kenyan

people to tell the truth when he says

he's not going to do something people

just can't trust him he said he wouldn't

raise taxes on the middle class he did

he said he would balance the budget in

2019 he didn't he said Joe D Wilson

Raybould never came to him with her

concerns turns out she did he has lied

in the past he has broken promises and

one thing Canadians can be sure of is

that this is the mindset of liberals

they are not looking for ways to put

more money in the pockets of Canadians

the ideas that are coming from their

caucus in that that they're putting

forward are all about getting new

revenues from Canadians because they're

running these massive deficits that have

to be paid back at some point we say

schirra a good morning can all get from

Colona now nice to see you

this year up until 2015 this was

considered an ultra-safe conservative

writing and then it was lost to the

Liberals is is that part of the reason

why we're seeing you here this morning

of course you know I'm gonna be going

all across the country visiting writings

that that we

that we held in the past but lost in

2015 and I've already heard this is not

I've been to Kelowna several times since

becoming leader the liberal of the

conservative party and I've heard from

so many people who said they voted

liberal in 2015 and they regret that and

now they're voting conservative in 2019

so we're very optimistic we also have a

situation where the local Liberal Member

of Parliament had let so many people

down the small business community here

in Kelowna is so vibrant and it's

essential to the economic well-being of

the region and when the local Liberal

Member of Parliament voted in favor of

all those tax hikes on small businesses

I heard it directly our candidate here

heard it directly they were so

disappointed that their MP was not

standing up for their interest so I

think people are looking for a change at

the local level and of course people are

looking for a change on the national

level as well thank you

hi mr. Shearer Katie Simpson CBC News I

want to pick up some on something that

my colleague just asked you about you're

accusing Justin Trudeau and the Liberals

of misleading Canadians and in some

cases lying but are you not doing the

exact same thing they're accusing Justin

Trudeau of by pushing this line on the

capital gains tax that's it's they say

it's not true and it was part of a

policy proposal so are you not putting a

lie out there to Canadians they've said

a lot of things that aren't true they've

said a lot of things they said they

wouldn't do things that they ended up

doing and they said they wouldn't do

things that they that they would do

things that they ended up not doing and

that's very clear Justin Trudeau is

running around spreading fear and

misinformation about our campaign I've

made it very clear to Canadians that

we're going to maintain increases to

social services like health care and

education he refuses to accept that so

if they are passing around policy papers

and and putting forward ideas that give

a glimpse into the mindset of but give a

glimpse into the mindset of a government

that is desperate for new revenues

because they're running these massive

deficits I think Canadians have a right

to know that this is the type of thing

that's being contemplated my follow-up

question has to do with what you told

reporters on Saturday night about the

process of a past comment coming forward

yesterday while you were in British

Columbia while you're still British

Columbia but yesterday the liberal war

room again targeted two of your

candidates under prayer wall and John

Hirst I've reached out to your team and

no one's gotten back to me so I'm

wondering given the common

they've made in the past whether it be

on social media or those past comments

did they apologize and are you gonna

still stand by them and how did that

process happen yeah so as I said our

party and all our candidates are

committed to the Equality rights of all

Canadians and and all 338 canit's will

be promoting a message of inclusivity

and respect and if we're going to talk

about candidates let's talk about the

Liberal candidate in Papineau who broke

ethics laws twice who brought a

convicted terrorist along to an official

state function who is now interfering

and blocking an RCMP investigation into

the SNC Lavin affair let's also I'll

also look forward to Justin Trudeau's

response to allegations that he took

faith golde out for drinks so I'd love

to hear what his responses to those

allegations mr. Sherr Mike lukather from

global national yesterday today and I'm

assuming you're gonna be announcing a

lot more of these targeted tax cuts just

like you did last week with the transit

tax experts have already said that they

don't change behavior at all so why are

you going back to these well one thing

that we're hearing from Canadians is

that life is getting more and more

expensive and these types of tax credits

do make life more affordable these are

costs that families have to bear you

know taking public transit to work or

putting your children activities or

things that families have to do and want

to do so this is part of our

affordability message I will also point

you that with things like the public

transit tax credit we do have statements

from people like the president of the

Toronto Transit Commission who said that

this will that the cancellation of these

tax credits had a negative impact on

ridership I'll also point out that

yesterday's tax cut announcement is a

universal tax cut that benefits every

single Canadian it is a broad-based

income tax cut that will provide relief

for Canadian families so we're gonna

have a great package of tax cuts that

include some targeted measures as well

as some broad-based measures as well we

have a cyclical accrediting Pokemon I

don't say Oh surely a lesser man passing

comprehensive key let's say

love but also campaign all that were in

embalm a launch portal a canadian just

as a follow-up you are announcing all

these things will take revenue away from

the government and promising a balanced

budget now one of my colleagues asked

you and you didn't really answer the

question so other than the asian

infrastructure bank contribution can you

just name one other place that you're

gonna cut to get to a balanced budget

well we'll be really releasing our fully

cost a platform that will show exactly

how will do that in the coming days will

be making further announcements of some

philosophical differences that we have

with the liberal party as to how they

think they can spend money better than

canadians we know that a dollar left in

the pockets of a hard-working canadian

is always better spent than in the

pockets of a politician who taxed it so

we'll be making further announcements on

that but one thing is clear we will

lower the cost of living put more money

back in the pockets of canadians while

bringing us back to balanced budgets

over a responsible period of time and

maintaining increases in funding for

essential services like health care and

education we are on that what is
