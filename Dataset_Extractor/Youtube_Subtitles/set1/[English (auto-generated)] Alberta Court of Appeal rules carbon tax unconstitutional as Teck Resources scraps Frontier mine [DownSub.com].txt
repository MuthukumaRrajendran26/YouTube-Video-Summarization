now to Alberta and what premiere Jason

Kenny calls good news and bad news first

the carbon tax in a four to one decision

the Alberta Court of Appeal ruled

federal carbon pricing is

unconstitutional the Alberta government

argued a federally imposed carbon tax

was a stepping stone that would allow

Ottawa to interfere in provincial

sovereignty the court agreed calling it

a Trojan horse heather murex west joins

me from Calgary tonight Heather tell us

more about the ruling and what it means

well Donna this isn't the first time

that a province has challenged the

federal carbon tax but it is the first

time a province has won courts in both

Saskatchewan and Ontario upheld the tax

last year and of course this is frame

court well here Saskatchewan appeal this

spring the federal Environment Minister

says audible will wait to see what the

Supreme Court ultimately decides but

says he feels confident that the federal

position will be upheld

Alberta's premier however disagrees

maintaining that provinces Chev

jurisdiction when it comes to planning

climate policies Donna all right thanks

Heather and we'll come back to you in

just a moment the other big story in

Alberta is about tech frontier it's

pulled the plug on a huge oil sands

project in Alberta just before the

federal cabinet was poised to give it a

final yes or no it had support from

indigenous communities and it passed all

environmental reviews yet the company's

CEO said there is no constructive path

forward Dawn's Lindsay says global

capital markets are changing rapidly and

investors and customers are increasingly

looking for jurisdictions to have a

framework in place that reconciles

resource development and climate change

in order to produce the cleanest

possible products and Maddie says

doesn't exist in Canada to be viable

this project also needed higher oil

prices more pipeline capacity and more

foreign investors it's another sign

Canadian political leaders need to stop

fighting and work together on a coherent

climate policy

here's Heather's report on that the

massive frontier mine proposal was seen

as a beacon of hope for this small

oilfield servicing company there were no

real major projects that were being

announced to hear the news this morning

I think was really devastating for for a

lot of people tech resources spent nine

years and a billion dollars working the

oil sands mega project through Canada's

regulatory process it had the support of

indigenous

communities in the region and despite

questions around whether the project

would be financially viable with oil

down to fifty US dollars a barrel the

company believed it would be

commercially viable instead in his

letter to the federal Environment

Minister Sunday tech CEO Don Lindsay

placed blame on the political

uncertainty around climate policy and

the energy sector the promise of

Canada's potential will not be realized

until governments can reach agreement

around how climate policy considerations

will be addressed without clarity on

this critical question it will be very

difficult to attract future investment

it's going to take some strong and clear

leadership to send a different message

to global investors because right now

it's pretty easy to see this as a

negative on the end of a string of

negatives Alberta's premier who has been

calling on Ottawa to approve the tech

mine since December has been quick to

place blame on the federal government

but the federal Environment Minister

says he agrees with the points raised by

tech that all levels of government need

to get on the same page we agree and we

say we are taking strong action on

climate change we need to be working to

collaborate with all of the provinces

and territories we need to be all on the

same page not fighting with each other

all over the price on pollution and

those kinds of things we need to be

working together and there is support

for a carbon tax across the energy

industry tech CEO stated that support in

his letter Sunday the Canadian

Association of Petroleum Producers

reiterated that support today as well

it's were only really only a small group

of provincial Conservative premiers

Donna that are opposed right Heather

Eurex West in Calgary tonight thanks

this balance between energy growth

environmental policy and indigenous

rights poses a big challenge for

political leaders federal and provincial

are Ottawa bureau chief Mercedes

Stevenson joins me Mercedes there's a

lot of anger a lot of finger-pointing

and now this Alberta Court of Appeal

ruling that the carbon tax is

unconstitutional where does this leave

the prime minister well Donna it's

another challenge for Prime Minister

Justin Trudeau who is face test after

test of his leadership and government

since being reelected and today's carbon

tax decision adds to that mess playing

into heated partisan rhetoric across the

country mr. Trudeau was elected on three

key promises the environment the economy

and reconciliation and now all three of

those priorities are colliding in a

perfect storm that has rocked his

government

mr. Trudeau managed to dodge the bullet

of having to make a cabinet decision on

tech frontier but in the eyes of some

out west he is responsible nonetheless

weighing in the CEO of tech frontier

said that what was missing was a clear

framework untainted by politics that

would lay out how the country could

reconcile resource development with

climate change that's something that mr.

Trudeau has not managed to produce

instead there's a failure of a highly

symbolic energy project and also no plan

to meet the Kyoto targets much less the

zero carbon footprint he's promising mr.

Trudeau's commitment to reconciliation

is also on trial with indigenous leaders

condemning today's opp arrests and the

promise of more protests and blockades

with the slogan shut down Canada has the

business community warning that there

could be fleeing foreign capital from

Canada and saying more big projects

could be sidelined with the economy

being damaged if there isn't a solution

soon but make no mistake this is not all

on the Prime Minister no other party has

proposed a viable way forward on any of

the three issues there's lots of

finger-pointing but no constructive talk

several premiers refused to bend on the

carbon tax as Heather said and the same

goes for major contenders for the

conservative leadership like Peter

MacKay despite shifting public opinion

on the environment there seems to be a

vacuum of leadership and a plan on all

sides Donna okay

Mercedes Stevenson and Ottawa Thanks
