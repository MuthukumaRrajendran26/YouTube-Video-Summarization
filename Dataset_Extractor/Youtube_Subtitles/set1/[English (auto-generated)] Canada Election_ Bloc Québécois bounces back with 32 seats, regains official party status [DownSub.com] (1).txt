he didn't quite get everything he was

after but ethos WebLogic came close the

block leader and supporters had hoped

for a weak enough minority government

that they'd have the balance of power as

it turns out the Trudeau Liberals won't

necessarily need bloc support to govern

or blush a insists his party is strong

enough to push its priorities I expect

us to have quite a good living the wave

that carried the bloc québécois back to

relevance wasn't the one the party road

in other elections instead of pushing

Quebec independence it pushed

nationalism to do that Russia aligned

the party with the popular provincial

caq government and promised at every

campaign stop to defend bill 21 the law

banning religious clothing in the civil

service webex premier says he met every

federal leader and warned them bill 21

was popular but that the block was the

only one to say it would defend it that

meant

even people who didn't support

independence supported a party that

wants to separate it wasn't easy for

Quebec users to choose because the vast

majority of Quebecers support the bill

21 but the majority of Quebecers are not

sovereignist there was another party

rejoicing at a rejuvenated bloc the

separatist pops québécois once the flag

bearer of the sovereignty movement this

is a meeting of its entire caucus it's

the fourth party in the National

Assembly and doesn't even have a leader

but the interim leader sees inspiration

in the bloc success people thought they

were dead not yet

so you can tell that we look at this

election saying okay we could be back

just watch us that's basically a warning

that sovereignty is on the back burner

but only for now my carps are global
