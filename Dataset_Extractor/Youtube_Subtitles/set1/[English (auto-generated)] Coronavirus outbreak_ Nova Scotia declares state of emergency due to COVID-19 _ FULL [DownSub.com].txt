good morning and thank you for joining

us my name is Tina Tebow and I'm the

director of Media Relations for the

province of Nova Scotia I will be your

moderator for this morning's news

conference joining us today

the Honorable Chuck Porter minister

responsible for the emergency management

organization premiers Stephen McNeil the

premier of Nova Scotia dr. Robert Strang

the chief medical officer of health for

Nova Scotia and the Honorable mark fury

Minister of Justice and attorney general

we'll start with the premier feel heavy

Thank You tedium good morning everyone I

want to thank all those Nova Scotians

who continued to follow the public

health advice and the businesses like

grocery stores that have remained open

and are taking extraordinary measures to

protect the public and their employees

while helping slow the spread of this

virus but today I need to focus on those

who are not following public health

advice over the weekend I saw and heard

of far too many incidents of people

gathering blatantly disregarding the

social and physical distance rules of

staying six feet or two meters apart

hundreds gathering on our beaches in in

our parks large groups of people

congregating young people playing street

hockey cars parked everywhere people

disregarding law enforcement we are

dealing with a deadly virus and this

behavior is unacceptable and so today

effective immediately I am declaring a

provincial state of emergency Minister

Porter is here to explain what that

means and Minister Furi Furi is here to

explain how we will enforce it we are

also reducing the size of gatherings

effective immediately

people cannot gather in groups of more

than five you could still go outside but

you walk to exercise not to socialize

stay in your neighborhood walk around

the block

or down the street our provincial parks

are closed if you go there you are

trespassing and your vehicles will be

towed you can get groceries you can go

to the pharmacy but do not do it in

packs identify a single family member

who can do those errands and if you are

an individual helping neighbors please

continue to do so we are working with

our municipal leaders and our First

Nation leaders it is imperative that all

of us follow the state of emergency and

use common sense currently if you've

traveled outside of Canada

you must self isolate for 14 days we are

now taking this to a new level

effectively tomorrow the borders of Nova

Scotia will be tightened as of 6:00 a.m.

if you have travelled anywhere outside

of Nova Scotia

you must self isolate for 14 days when

you return this will be managed two

points of entry into our province the

fairies in Digby and North Sydney are

airports and Halifax in Sydney and our

land border with New Brunswick we are

making exceptions for those who provide

essential service including trucking

health care child protection workers and

law enforcement if you are coming into

our province you will be stopped at

every entry point questioned and told to

self isolate for those who are not

essential service and want to enter our

province for social purposes please stay

home this decision was not made lightly

but we must continue to act and use

every tool available to flatten the

curve and reduce the spread of kovat 19

in our communities and the virus

significant impact on our health care

system we have a social responsibility

to focus on the public good a failure to

follow Public Health guidelines to limit

the spread of kovat 19 puts our civil

liberties at risk we have no choice but

to put more stringent measures in place

to contain people to their own home

and or help help prevent the spread of

kovat 19 each of us has a moral and

legal obligation to ensure that we

adhere fully to the orders and advice of

our chief medical officer and there will

be no exceptions I will now turn to

Minister Porter to explain what this

order means Thank You premier this

declaration of a province-wide state of

emergency underlines the seriousness of

the current situation as it relates to

covin 19 and enables the province to

enforce its directives the Emergency

Management Act gives us the authority to

further protect the health and safety of

Nova Scotians and to provide for the

broader public good the state of

emergency does not replace the powers of

the chief medical officer of Health

instead this order sins the provinces

authority and adds to the important work

that has already been done under this

order government can control or prohibit

assembly as well as travel to and from

areas the order also provides the

authority needed to coordinate commerce

activity and emergency responders so we

can ensure people are safe we need all

Nova Scotians to appreciate the

seriousness of this virus and the harm

that it can cause now is the time to

follow the direction of our public

health officials and support each other

and our neighbors thank you thank you

mr. Porter now LLL ask Minister fury to

explain how we will enforce this order

Thank You premier upon the

recommendation of doctor Strang we are

taking immediate action to authorize

police to enforce orders under the

Health Protection Act related to both

self I saw self I saw is a isolation and

social distancing the Health Protection

Act authorizes the chief medical officer

to request police assistance to enforce

his orders this means that people and

businesses will now face fines for

violations or orders made under the

Health Protection Act

many Nova Scotians have taken dr. Strawn

Strang's advice and are following the

order to self isolate however as the

premier indicated many are not we

therefore have no choice but to call

upon the police and law enforcement

community to enforce self-isolation and

social distancing in addition effective

today social distancing will also now

form part of the chief medical officers

order and police are also now authorized

to enforce this order starting

immediately police now have the

authority to issue summary offence

tickets to people who are not adhering

to dr. Strang's order to self isolate or

adhere to social distancing the fines

under the Health Protection Act are for

individuals found in breach of the order

a thousand dollars for each fine for

each day and for businesses and

corporations $7,500 in the first

instance and for each subsequent day

people can be fined on multiple days if

they fail to comply with the law police

and law enforcement have been notified

of these enforcement measures and are

ready to begin implementation today

we've engaged our police leadership they

have requested and we are able to

respond to provide them this level of

authority and I want to take this

opportunity to thank the men and women

in uniform who are on the front line and

as the premier indicated their efforts

and actions yesterday were dismissed

they now have the authority to find and

arrest if necessary Thank You premier

Thank You Minister fury and now I'll ask

dr. Strang to update you on the covert

19 cases here in our province Thank You

premier and ministers today we're

announcing seven new cases of kovat 19

and like earlier cases they

either travel-related or close contacts

of previously announced cases at this

point none are related to local

community spread this brings the total

to 28 cases of kovat 19 in Nova Scotia

and 13 between yesterday and today the

individuals affected range from people

and their upper teens to into their 70s

and cases have have been identified in

communities across the province Public

Health every time we have a confirmed

case Public Health rapidly moves in

understands where that individual has

been at the time they could have been

infectious and identifies all contacts

and and and works closely with those

contacts to put put them in self

isolation for a 14-day period and if

there are community exposures like

you've heard in the last couple of days

of the basketball tournament we make

public announcements but as much as

possible we work with individuals and

their families behind the scenes to

ensure contacts are in isolation we've

had almost 20 100 total tests done here

in Nova Scotia and I'm pleased to be

able to announce that today at the qe2

Health Sciences Centre microbiology lab

is now able to report both positive and

negative tests for covered 19 as

confirmed this is a good thing no our

tests will no longer have to be sent to

the National microbiology lab for

confirmation and we'll speed up our the

ability to identity let people know the

status of their of their test results as

you've heard and as I've said before

there are no cases right now that are

related to community spread however as

we continue to have cases occurring in

in Nova Scotia we can expect that we

will soon see this occurring that is why

we're taking the actions that were that

have been announced earlier we need to

minimize and slow down the introduction

and spread of code 19 in this province

it's critical it's how we keep people

safe and how we're gonna actually

minimize the impact on our healthcare

system everyone is at some level of risk

there is severe disease occurring at

almost all ages so everybody is at some

risk but we know that there are all of

us have people in our families or our

communities who are at the highest risk

of getting severe disease people who are

elderly people with chronic health

conditions we also all have healthcare

workers in our communities who are

continued to put themselves at risk

working on the front lines to treat

people at screen and treat people with

this disease so we all need to work

together to pray even though we're all

at risk but it's not just about

ourselves we also need to work together

to protect those most vulnerable in our

communities to protect our health care

workers who are stepping up and willing

to put themselves at risk to look after

us I can't stress that enough

so we are still seeing people going in

large groups I did I have said

previously going for a walk or a bike

ride is okay it is still okay but we

need to do that safely adhering to

public health principles and quite

frankly using some common sense now is

the time if you haven't traveled and

you're adhering to social distancing go

for a walk around your block or in your

neighborhood as long as you're making

sure you're respecting the social

distancing but now's not the time

do not pile into a car go for half an

hour park next to a hundred other

vehicles at a beach and and and then and

then crowd onto a beach or into a park

that is not calm using common sense that

is not adhering to public health

measures around social distancing and

and not getting and not having mass

gatherings if you need to go out to a

grocery store or pick up things from the

pharmacy have one person do that don't

all go don't take your kids to do that

if people are on self-isolation from

travel or thir and a No

contact of a case you need to stay home

you can do if you're able to you can go

out into your yard or your balcony but

you can't do not go further you need to

get help to get groceries to get the

pharmaceuticals you need this is where

all the rest of us need to step up to

help those people who to help them stay

in self-isolation

I recognize that for people in

apartments multi-unit dwellings this

isn't very challenging but I'm hearing

lots of stories about how their their

neighbors are are reacting to them

negatively because they're there they're

out in the hallway or trying to take

their dog out for a walk or get their

mail so rather than reacting negatively

why don't you step up and say how can I

help you what do you need so you can

stay in your apartment keep the rest of

us safe how am I gonna help you it's

really important but this is this is a

time where we can come together we have

that we're at the beginning of this in

Nova Scotia jurisdictions that have have

been able to minimize the impact and

slow down the spread of CO 419 are the

ones that have applied the very strict

measures that we are have been applying

throughout the last week and

strengthening today and the time is

right in Nova Scotia we can make an

impact we actually have the fortunate

opportunity even within Canada some of

our neighbours Ontario British Columbia

Alberta are further ahead of than us by

several weeks there have been struggling

in the last couple of weeks to apply the

same measures we are applying but with

not not as much success partly because

they're further down the curve so we

have this window of opportunity to and

learn from our Canadian neighbors and

internationally and do things better

so it's really important that we

actually take this seriously it's not a

time to react with fear but I would

appeal I use three C's let's approach

this with caring and the sense of

community and common sense thank you

thank you very much dr. Strang and now

we'll open up for questions go to the

phone lines for questions again we will

take one question

one follow-up from each reporter we have

13 reporters on the line we will try to

get to all of your questions we have

approximately 25 minutes we will go to

Shana luck from CBC go ahead Shana good

morning Nova Scotians have had until now

unrestricted travel throughout Canada

and visitors from other provinces have

had unrestricted access to Nova Scotia

given that other provinces have said

they have community transmission why are

you limiting testing to international

travel only we're we're not all that

doctor string into this so a part of

self isolation so anybody now as of 6 6

o'clock tomorrow morning anybody who

comes into the province needs to self

isolate if they become symptomatic they

then go through this online screening

process then call 8 1 1 they will if

they screen in there they will then go

in for testing we're this morning we're

already working on changing that

screening process within the within the

8 1 1 process we are also looking at

ways that we're starting to increase

people who haven't traveled in a limited

way to start to detect signs of

community spread we're also have we have

been for for a number of days looking at

building on what we traditionally do for

influenza surveillance tracking the

number of people with who going into

emergency rooms with with flu-like

symptoms looking at if there are any

outbreaks of respiratory disease in a

long-term care facility or another

community setting so we are continuing

to do that building on what we do for

flu season and if we see any of those

signals which we haven't to date we

would absolutely move in very quickly

and start to do testing for kovat 19

follow-up testing is this now opened up

to anyone who is showing symptoms so

where anybody who's with a travel

history and as of tomorrow it'll be a

travel history outside of Nova Scotia

who develops fever or new cough will

they'll screen in through the one:1

process then go to the

covert assessment center for treat for

for testing we are working we just have

further conversations later today

with the lab with our my clinical

colleagues of how we actually do some

testing to look at people out in the

exam we're making sure we're picking up

signs of community spread in a timely

manner we need to work up the details of

that we are rapidly working to within

the next day or two to double the

testing capacity in the lab what we have

to be cognizant of we can't test

everybody we need to test the people who

are most likely to be positive while we

maintain the ability to be able to test

people with significant illness Thank

You Shana next we'll go to Nick Moore

from CTV go ahead Nick all right good

morning if somebody does see people

violating the state of emergency order

people gathering in large crowds or

people who should be self isolating that

they're not self isolating is there a

way for them to report that to the

proper authorities yes we're those

circumstances are observed we are now

encouraging people to contact their

local police agency of jurisdiction and

at that time with the information and

authority the law enforcement community

has now they will take appropriate

action so I think it's also important

going back to my previous comments that

we we all have to work together that not

judge not just rely on authorities to to

enforce this so if somebody's out there

that you think maybe should be in self

isolation first of all is engage them if

you can and and feel comfortable doing

that and safe in a conversation maybe

there's a reason maybe maybe they

actually your your judgement on them may

be incorrect maybe they need to be

social distancing rather than self

isolation but maybe there's something

they're struggling with that they need

help with that's forcing them to come

out of self isolation so rather than be

negative about each other I'm

encouraging people as the first step is

let's figure out how we support each

other to help those who need to be in

South isolation States

isolation before we go to an official

complaint Nick did you have a follow-up

question I do have one thank you for

that my follow-up is can I get

clarification on whether or not this

order issue today if this does

effectively close shopping malls

throughout the province effectively not

not at this particular moment they will

have to adhere to the five-person rule

doctor Strang and I will having further

conversations today but the next phase

but they will and as shops will have to

also look at the five-person rule but

there will be no a public gathering in a

shopping mall

as of today you'll still have access to

it thanks Nick Nick next we'll go to

Elizabeth McCaffrey from Global News go

ahead Elizabeth hi there what the state

of emergency will mean in terms of

protocol changes at the airports will

there be any beefed up

beefing up the testing or criteria in

the airport here mr. Porter thank you

the airports are currently being

monitored by provincial staff at the

current time through our enforcement

office or sort of environment that will

continue we will upgrade information and

we will go through the same process we

will do it all other points of entry

which we'll be asking the appropriate

questions and whether they travel where

they travel from and other questions

Elizabeth's do you have follow-up

criteria for testing but are showing

symptoms of course they're to self

isolate but what you may be doing at

home to treat themselves and care for

themselves while they eat pleasing they

have so mid-nineteen what should they be

doing at home so we're asking people

with any symptoms as always they should

try to isolate themselves as best they

can within their home if you've got

fever or cough

whether it's influenza whether it's

kovin 19 staying away from the public

spaces and even within your home as much

as possible

distancing yourself from anybody else

within the home so staying that six six

feet or two meter space apart as best

you can

staying if you were able to in in your

own room with your own bathroom having

somebody bring meals to the to the

doorway I know that's not always

possible for for all living

circumstances and all families but as

best you can adhering to those public

principles of of social distance seeing

that that six foot space and and really

really careful frequent hand washing by

everybody in that household cleaning

down common surfaces I think it's also

important if I can whether you travel or

not and you're at home and you've been

sci-fi salaita because you know someone

who's traveled and you are showing those

symptoms a call eight one one they will

direct you we have a couple of cases

where people haven't necessarily travel

but someone very close to them has and

they've received the virus in them so I

don't want a a couple of questions here

is has only been that only the people

who've traveled are being tested that's

not accurate what's happening is if you

follow the online tool and it identifies

these symptoms you call eight one one

and you will be directed to the

appropriate place to ensure that that's

happening of course travel history is an

important part of that but as dr. Strang

has said a number of times and I've been

sitting here with and we have some that

ever connected to people who have

traveled they themselves have not so

follow the symptoms follow the online

tools call eight one one and we will be

there to work with you thanks Elizabeth

next we'll go to tim arsenault from the

Chronicle Herald

go ahead Tim thank you wondering why the

Dennis LC outlets are still open I'm

wondering given what's being said this

morning and can you speak to that well

they've been kept open at various

degrees across the province hours have

changed access to them has changed

we've now closed them on Sundays we will

continue to monitor that as we go

forward I think there's also an

important part there

there are quite frankly those Nova

Scotians new health requirements needs

access to this product and we also know

there are family situations where people

are living in very difficult

circumstances well those domestic

violence or abuse that the restriction

of this product it could escalate that

but we are monitoring what that looks

like as we continue in time and will

continue to follow advice of Public

Health do the follow-up Tim mobility had

to be restricted even further measures

or plans for how people would go about

getting things like groceries

prescriptions well in my remarks I've

said you can do you can continue to do

that just don't do it as a group don't

do it as an entire family identify an

individual to go do that many of our

retailers have put online opportunities

where you can do online shopping and

they'll bring it up and put it in your

car but you can go of course and do

those things and then come home and I

would also encourage you as dr. Strang

has mentioned a few minutes ago how can

we support those who may have more more

challenges for your single mom with kids

at home and your other neighbor asked

can you help if you're a senior living

alone in your neighbors a senior living

alone asked how can you help if you're

going to pick something up for your

family think about identifying whether

you can pick something up for them

that's how we can actually restrict the

mobility and quite frankly slow down

this virus from impacting all of our

families thanks Tim for that question

next we'll go to Devin Stevens from all

Nova Scotia

go ahead Devin can you talk a little

more about what triggered today's

announcement I know the premier

mentioned you know overflowing parking

lots at beaches and there was some

social media posts about that today the

government monitoring social media for

this type of thing are you getting calls

from the public or provincial you know

game wardens and park officers noting

this stuff just a little bit more about

what specifically triggered today's

announcement well the vast majority of

Nova Scotians are following

public health advice and they become

frustrated quite frankly when a small

percentage of Nova Scotians don't so

they they certainly identify they call

in to whether it's in our apartment of

Forestry who manages the parks across

the province they would call in to

Department of Health and yesterday when

those calls came in we dispatched law

enforcement to deal with the issue and

quite frankly they weren't taken

seriously they weren't people were

disregarding the men and women in

uniform and we cannot allow a small

percentage who choose to do as they wish

in our province to put at risk the

health of the rest of us and that's

literally is what this is if you've

watched this virus globally and quite

frankly in Canada in some of our other

Canadian provinces the spread of this

happens rapidly and quickly and it will

require all of us to do our part to self

isolate to protect our neighbors and to

respect law enforcement health

professionals who are working day and

night to provide us the security that we

require and quite frankly the health

care that we need and I part of I want

people to fully understand this the

spread of this virus in itself is bad

enough but the stress that it will put

on our healthcare system will be

crippling it will not only impact about

how we deal with this virus it will deal

with how do we deal with cardiac arrests

it will deal with how do we deal with

all of the other emergencies that flow

into our hospitals on a daily basis I

cannot allow a certain level of Nova

Scotians to disregard the order of the

chief medical officer or law enforcement

when it comes to insurance we protect

the health and safety of all Nova

Scotians and that's why we were forced

to do what we're doing today seven give

us all up yeah for dr. Strang we're

probably going to have people coming off

of self isolation in the next five to

ten days here what is your guidance to

them on on day 15 can they go grocery

shopping can a grandmother coming home

from Florida go visit her grandchild if

there's no

willness and neither household Justi

just what how will life change for those

people on david p so once they come off

self-isolation they move into the bigger

bucket of all other Nova Scotia's Nova

Scotians who were and we're asking and

telling you need to maintain the social

distance so that's the group that that

still has to be careful about shopping

for essentials not in groups wanted you

know one person from the family they can

have some outdoor activity in their yard

and they're come in their community but

not doing it in groups not and doing it

in a way that respects the six-foot

social distancing so to become like like

the vast majority of us but we're gonna

be in this for weeks and we all have to

pry it all of us have to be practicing

the social distancing and there will be

people that move up into other

categories of stricter self isolation

and and and even maybe even as a case I

want a very very strict at home self

isolation they don't have to be in the

hospital and then move back down but all

of us have to keep practicing that it's

strict social distancing and I emphasize

who it's really about physical

distancing at the same time we need to

find ways to increase our social

connectedness using our devices but as

as the premier said as I said earlier

today how do we find ways to reach out

and support each other in our

communities while we still respecting

that that physical distancing but it's

critically important that we are

connecting with each other in

non-physical ways that supports each

other through this very difficult time

Thank You Devon next we'll go to Matthew

more from News ninety-five seven go

ahead Matthew yes thanks Tina III think

my question is just the confusion about

malls can you discuss the finds that if

someone went to a mall tomorrow and

there's ten people there what what's

that going to do because it seems like

that's a little ambiguous right now I

suppose no I well you would find is that

law enforcement has the ability to go

into a mall and if you were hanging

around in the in the general space of

this the public space of a mall you

be asked to disperse if you choose not

to you'll be fined if you're going into

the mall to go directly to a particular

store then that's what you do you go in

you enter them all and you go directly

to that store you purchase what you're

looking for and you exit them all the

common area will be treated like common

space Odin community do the follow up

yeah just one quick one what does this

do for like dealerships and call centers

too because those are kind of confined

spaces too I suppose oh we have a number

of employers who have worked very hard

to ensure that they've created the

appropriate self distancing protocols

inside of their businesses some have

double shifts so they take fewer people

in they've separated whether it's a call

center the connection how close people

are to one another many of those

workplaces that are still functioning

I've followed the advice of the chief

medical officer and insured they put the

protocols in place we have about 10

minutes left we only have time for a few

more questions we'll go to Jake Boudreau

from the Port Hawkesbury reporter go

ahead Jake music you guys are kind of

going close to calling on people a

quarantine but there's usually some

public confusion as to the difference

between quarantine and social isolation

which you know aren't eaning being the

more I guess extreme or whatever you

want to call it term is there any way

you guys can kind of clarifies I didn't

seeing a lot of comments on social media

so quarantine is that's the technical

term the quarantine is somebody who has

potentially been exposed but is not yet

yet sick and then ice technically then

isolation is somebody who was sick we

because of the of the language piece

across the country or talk we're using

self isolation as the term both for

people who may have been exposed and and

need to stay at home away from others as

well as for people who are even if

they're sick they're self isolation so

it's social distancing for everybody or

though

physical distancing with increased

social connectedness then people because

of travel or if we know that they've

been exposed that self isolation which

in a technical term is quarantined and

then for people who are sick it's a very

strict house isolation which the

technical term for that is isolation you

next will go to David jela from the Cape

Breton post go ahead David

we'll go to Tim Bousquet from the health

acts examiner go ahead Tim to beat this

drought but this widespread public

concern and questions that were testing

and doctors obvious that you can't

everyone and I suppose that that's true

but can you say what the limiting factor

is is this lack of availability of the

FAC of fab is it time is too much money

what what is is that proof that is

keeping you from running so as I said

we're rapidly working and and and to

double the capacity for testing and

that's doing things at the lab bringing

in extra staffing for other components

of the lab changing their processes

we're also looking at using different

types of swabs to make sure we actually

have adequate swabs that are available

we're looking at possibilities of even

increasing the the sophisticated

equipment that's there that's not easy

because there's a global demand for that

but so we're doing everything we can to

increase our lab capacity but also we've

got to be careful that our that our

testing strategy maintains the

likelihood of identifying people who

have the highest possibility of having

this disease and not overwhelming our

system by testing absolutely everybody

so we're continue to work on though both

those strategies enhancing our testing

maximizing and testing the appropriate

people as we try as we

working diligently to maximize our lab

capacity follow-up Tim recognizing that

you can't test everyone why aren't

people at airports in crossing the

borders why aren't they being there so

we the evidence is from either other

pandemics epidemics is that sea

temperature testing is not actually very

helpful the clay we use that during h1n1

in other parts of the world that has

clearly showed that that doesn't really

make a difference because you're only

that's a one point in time the reality

is that most people are going to be feel

well as they're traveling they're gonna

get home and then it's going to be in

those next few days so if I do a

temperature check on somebody just as

they cross the border it really tells me

nothing about what their likelihood is

of of becoming sick in the next few days

the information that people are given

now as they can the airport and as

starting tomorrow as our ferries and our

land borders includes information about

if you have or develop these symptoms

online screening and then calling eight

one one is appropriate and that is the

best strategy to get to pee help people

to understand with a type of symptoms

they need to watch for and how they

manage and reach out that fer to get it

appropriately tested when they develop

those symptoms rather than just

screening temperature checks at at

border entries which are not effective

to be clear around travel and our

borders that was described a few moments

ago if you are coming into Nova Scotia

you must self isolate for 14 days no

matter where you're coming from if you

are coming in to any one of those

borders you must self isolate for 14

days I just wanted to be clear on that

thank you we'll go to David jela once

more time for a must the Cape Breton

post David are you there and that's all

the time we have from the phone line but

I will ask Minister fury we did get a

question from the phone he unfortunately

if he had to drop off it is from CBC

News Network in Toronto and the question

Minister is around Nova Scotia police

what sort of summary offence tickets can

be a

so there are two offenses one by an
