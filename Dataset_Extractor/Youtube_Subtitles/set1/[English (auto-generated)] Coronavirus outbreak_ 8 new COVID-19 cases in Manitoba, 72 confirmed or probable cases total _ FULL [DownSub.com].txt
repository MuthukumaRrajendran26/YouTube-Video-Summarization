good morning I'm Brent rusyn Manitoba's

chief provincial public health officer

today we are announcing eight new cases

at kovat 19 bringing our total cases to

72 the total number of deaths related to

codeine colvett 19 remains at 1 at this

time there is one individual receiving

care in ICU and another admitted to

hospital all other cases are recovering

at home currently we have reports that

two individuals are listed as recovered

public health investigations are

continuing and to confirm details and

information will be updated on our

website once it's available as a Friday

7000 147 tests have been completed for

covin 19 at the cat and provincial lab

on Friday there were 919 tests performed

additional data will be vided later

today on our website once it's available

Manitoba has its first covert 19

clinical trial underway this study will

test if a rheumatologic drug known as

hydroxychloroquine can prevent people

from contracting kovat 19 I want to note

that Matt Tobin should not use any drug

without medical advice this trial is

being led by a team at the radial T of

Health Sciences at the University of

Manitoba this team is recruiting

volunteers to participate in the study

the trial will determine if the drug can

be safely used as a treatment for cove

at 19 people who are eligible include

those that have been tested positive for

kovat 19 those who live with individuals

who have tested positive as well as

health care workers who were exposed to

patients with confirmed positive

infection

the university is hoping to get as many

Manitobans as possible enrolled in a

clinical trial as fast as possible if

this study has proven successful it

could lead to lead way to treatment

options for Manitobans Manitobans who

meet these criteria and wish to

participate should visit covet - 19

research CA we want to remind Manitobans

that public health does not recommend

the use of masks and public spaces for

people who are not symptomatic this

virus is spread through droplets created

by coughing or sneezing and it is

contagious through close contact to

infected individuals coughing into the

sleeve good hand hygiene or are one of

our best ways to protect ourselves from

the virus if individual is sick or

experience symptoms wearing a mask can

prevent the spread of this infection of

course those individuals who are ill

should be at home and can call health

links for further advice an updated

public health order under the Public

Health Act comes into effect 12:01 a.m.

on Monday March 30th this will limit

public gatherings to no more than 10

people at any indoor outdoor place or

premises I want to reiterate that we are

not helpless against this virus that now

is the time for action the social

distancing strategies that we've had on

in place for over two weeks now that we

continue to escalate our best ways to

interrupt the transmission of this virus

because this virus is spread through

those droplets and through close contact

with other individuals practicing social

distancing consistently will interrupt

that transmission of the virus we all

have that role to limit the impact of

this virus on Manitobans the best way to

pur to limit that impact is to stay home

stay home if you can if you must go out

then practice

we though social distancing strategies

stay two meters from other people

frequently wash your hand certainly if

your homestay if you're a sick stay home

this is also quite important to those at

increased risk of the severe effects of

kovat 19 those over age 65 those with

underlying medical conditions those with

immune compromised should be staying

home as much as you can to limit the

chances of being exposed to this virus I

want to remind Manitobans that one of

our tools to battle this virus is

credible information please visit our

website at Manitoba CA /

Kovac 19 for up-to-date information I

again want to thank all Manitobans that

have stepped up in our battle against

this virus many Manitobans who are

taking extra measures to reduce the

spread of this virus we want to thank

our health care workers at the

frontlines and want to ask all

Manitobans do your parts to protect our

health care workers on the front line so

thank you very much and I'll pass it

over to Lynette so I'm Lynette Siragusa

from shared health and I'll just give a

quick update on the operational things

are happening within the system so just

to let you know healthlinks has made

lots of changes they now have hundreds

of lines increased staff and have a

cloud-based technology so they're in the

process of testing and validating the

numbers so we won't have those reports

until later next week but at that time

we will make sure that we share the

volumes and the wait times our online

assessment tool has garnered almost

10,000 views as of yesterday launching

or sorry

yesterday and then since we launched on

March 17th there's been about 330

thousand views so it's great to see

everybody using that tool a new

community testing site will officially

open tomorrow in Pine Falls at a coal

power view the

ours will be 94 Monday to Friday and as

a reminder those community testing sites

are not walk-in clinics the I referral

is needed to go there

dinah care as mentioned yesterday is now

working with us to report those negative

results so they will be back at it on

Monday and so expect a phone call soon

if you have been tested with negative

results a reminder that if you are

positive the public health team will be

calling you

expeditiously and just a comment

yesterday dr. rusyn sent me an email

from altona about some great community

spirit that's happening in the face of

all this adversity and it really speaks

to what a great province we have so

we've heard about wonderful gestures of

kindness and great acts in every

community over the past couple of weeks

so I just want to share with you some

information that we received about

Altona the residents in that community

are placing pictures in their windows so

that passers-by can can see and there's

kids who are writing with sidewalk chalk

words of encouragement so so that it

lifts the spirits of the community

there's also a local salon that's now

shopping for customers and delivering

goods to their home and a local church

is collecting random cards of

encouragement to deliver to people in

personal care homes so just a really

nice letter from Bonita beige and we

want to thank her for reaching out and

finding the silver lining in this

difficult time so we appreciate that

very much and we will open it up to

questions

will be Eric from Global News so you

said in the past that

rather than public officials are

monitoring people coming to hospitals

under respiratory stress that would be

the indicator of possible community

transmission can you tell me anything

more about that had there been an

increase in people who went into

hospital in West respiratory distress in

the past few days or it's just

consistent I can speak to that because

I'm looking at the numbers the data

right now and we do know that influenza

A specifically is still circulating out

in the community so we're watching those

test results as well as covet 19 the

volumes coming in through emergency with

influenza like respiratory issues are

are definitely they're still there but

they do look like they're trending lower

than then they would have maybe a few

weeks ago so we continue to watch and

monitor will suggest to avoid that a

possible increase or possible community

transitions I'm sorry I didn't catch

that question to prevent community

transmission can you just kind of go

over those again and what what what

we'll mention right yeah so great

question so we know that the this virus

is spread through droplets in the air

could be on on surfaces that those

droplets fall on but it's from

symptomatic individuals mostly and from

close contact with with them so all of

our social distancing strategies put

that in into play that if we limit our

contact or close contact with others

then

are not going to be able to spread that

virus to others and we're not going to

be able to be exposed to that virus to

others so we've continually decreased

the group sizes so we've gone from 50

down to 10 starting tomorrow to limits

you know limit the possibility of close

prolonged contact we've given the

message to stay home if you're able to

stay home then you're not going to be

exposed to this virus and nor if you did

have the virus you're not going to be

able to expose others to that self

isolation guidelines we know that still

the majority of cases in Manitoba

related to travel if you returned from

Manitoba

you must self isolate for 14 days and

monitor your symptoms you call health

link should you develop any symptoms but

many of these cases that we are

detecting have been doing just that

they've been self isolating they attend

care after calling health links and then

they're back in isolation so they've

done their part we've limited the risk

of community transmission from those

individuals but we need everyone we're

turning from travel whether it's

international or other places in Canada

you must self isolate for 14 days it's

it's one of our best tools right now to

limit the importation of this virus as

well as limiting the risk of community

spread and then link to that is now is

not the time to travel right we should

all be cancelling our travel plans who

were in a pandemic right now we're

seeing this virus spread at a community

level around us in at other

jurisdictions in Canada certainly to the

south of us so now is not the time to

travel now is the time to cancel those

plans now is the time to stay home wash

your hands frequently and and follow our

you know credible information on our on

our website from the progressed hi dr.

Shannon the shared vision that you hear

from the free pass I just want to talk a

little bit so I know that in other

jurisdictions there have been

complications are those

Kayson areas or key scenarios and

everything ever my document from

Saskatchewan that was like to the media

shows that the worst case scenario there

that's could be as high as 15,000 but

estimates are between 9,000 and 15,000

you know why I cannot get any talk so

far of course key scenarios can you

comment on that number right so we have

been right from the beginning of this

doing different forecasting but the

earlier your forecast the the wider that

range of possibilities certainly before

you're seeing that community based

transmission so we've had a number of

different forecasting models in place so

we could start preparing the the system

but as we get more and more cases as we

have more evidence from other

jurisdictions we're going to be able to

tighten up those those models a bit more

knowing that no matter what model you

come up with there is a large range you

know we continually put different

interventions in place and so there is a

lot of variables with these numbers so

we are working on that we're you know

likely to have some numbers that we'll

be able to share in the upcoming weeks

but certainly we've been preparing based

on a number of different tools but but a

lot of variables in place there okay

have you been in touch with words we've

got some health authorities and consider

our population sizes or any chance that

we may see similar numbers choose

discretion we're in we're in touch

constantly with all the provincial and

territorial governments our special

advisory committee we meet many times

weekly discussing all these these issues

so we're constantly in touch and we're

looking at our numbers compared to

jurisdictions outside of Canada we look

at jurisdictions within Canada so we've

been working on all of these these

aspects

from a big Sun Josh I listen Josh

Aldridge from the unified Sun I learned

if you tell us more about this

this colorful childhood treatment what

kind of a treatment have been looking at

and I guess puts the potential of this

treatment right so it's so it's an

important work because we do not have a

proven pharmacologic intervention for

covert 19 at this point and so the only

way to find those things to show that

they're effective is through trials such

as this so this medication is

hydroxychloroquine it's been used for

malaria also for rheumatologic

conditions and so right now it's not

proven therapy but we don't have a

proven therapy so these are these trials

are essential to to try to you know give

us those results on whether we may have

an effective pharmaceutical intervention

so it's cautiously optimistic but it's

not proven to be effective but we need

trials like this in order to do so I

need the trial in a trial like that

effective or not and this trial for

people who may be so the for trials such

as these that typically you need large

large numbers that's there's various

calculations on that but this is part of

a multicenter trial so Matt Tobin's will

be linking into other areas that are

running a trial so that immediately

gives us the benefit of those large

numbers when we when we start looking at

the results as far as the risks of the

medication and a trial I would direct

anyone interested in it to the

information that was provided and and

the the research team are our best to to

list through the requirements the and

and the risks

you can say to be one of the Jeremy Oh

Jeremy some things we gonna take I'm

wondering the public health officer of

camera has talked about if it increase

in cases in younger people and that

something you're seeing here in the

problem as well as you want people kind

of under the age of forty contracting

the virus we do we do see all all age

groups now with with have contracted

this virus we know that the the highest

risk individuals are those those with

underlying medical conditions as well as

those over age 65 but we have seen

severe outcomes in younger individuals

as well so this this condition is is

important for everyone it doesn't matter

what what's your age is because even if

you do not have a severe outcome by not

practicing physical distancing you could

be passing this on to someone who will

sustained a severe outcome so so we do

see positive tests through pretty much

all age groups at this point and so it's

just important for all Manitobans to be

aware of their role to play in this wash

your hands frequently stay home if you

must go out practice physical distancing

at all times maybe some abuse to you sir

I'm wondering can you confirm whether or

not there has been a case in any

long-term care I have not received a

report of that

from CDT origin Canada Catherine - Logan

from CDC heard you Canada I'm just

filling it could you tell us what the

current capacity is kind of mom is how

many tests can be processed daily yeah

well this is this figure is shifting

daily due to a lot of their innovative

methods and so right now I would just

say that our last report that received

from Friday as they were able to test

919 samples and so that would is what I

would report as their current capacity

we're still waiting on on their numbers

from yesterday and so will will be able

to publish that later today hopefully I

could you - use of the criteria or who's

eligible pretences so for right now

those that are at highest risk are

returning travelers within the last 14

days who have symptoms of aspire to her

illness and and those symptoms are

really a key for any eligible group

we're only wanting to test symptomatic

individuals fever cough respiratory

illness short of breath those type of

things in addition to the returning

travelers where testing is available to

all symptomatic healthcare workers as

well as those that are symptomatic in

congregate settings such as Corrections

or homeless shelters and this would also

apply to First Nations communities thank

you very much for you how many come

between go by between the time that you

know of new cases and the time that you

tell the public about these new cases at

these conferences

the so a contact investigation so

typically it would it just depends on on

the turnaround so once public health is

aware of a of a positive result they

will contact the case immediately and

right at that time then a contact

investigation starts and so once they

become aware of contacts those are again

contacted immediately and so it's you

know the the actual time frame is is

different it depends on how many

contacts an individual may have it

depends on how much information that

case can remember right off the top so

there's a lot of variables in there but

the investigation starts immediately and

contacts are you know contacted as as

soon as as soon as possible

so you don't really have like a working

average in what you can expect no that

would be a real difficult average to

come to so certain you know certain

cases may have two or three contacts

others could have up to twenty and so

it's a real tough thing to to average

report back we're we're focused on

getting that work done not necessarily

recording all that all the times

involved I just wanted a new cases

announced but we have occurred the ages

or the sector gender these folks where

they're found can you expect to get that

information for the cases from yesterday

and today that's going to be posted on

our on our website as soon as we get

that information so again in our

commitment to report cases as soon as we

know tomato beans then often we don't

have that information right at hand and

so there will update our website as soon

as that's available

from City news George

doctor it's a with the ring ten person

that limits coming in tomorrow

can you just expand for folks watching

this what exactly this applies to if

they go into work tomorrow and just fun

people there will way then being only

recommending that home home I guess how

they explain that a little further right

so these are our public public

gatherings indoors or outdoors so that

ten limit does not does not apply to

workplaces but again as I've been saying

is that we as Manitobans are in this

together we were seeing increasing cases

we've seen severe outcomes so we all

need to be doing what we can to

interrupt the transmission of this virus

so we have orders in place we have some

tools but there is no need to to look

and see if order applies to you you

should act right now to limit the spread

of this virus and so this order doesn't

apply right now to workplaces but that

really shouldn't matter we're in a

pandemic we need all Manitobans to step

up now to reduce the transmission of

this virus either yesterday the day

before already are you speaking

specifically about the visits to

emergency yeah yeah so what we're seeing

is probably people are staying home more

and and people are social distancing and

there may be the fact that people aren't

aren't wanting to come to the hospital

and may be going to access

instead so we're seeing the trend not

just an emergency but also on the

inpatient medical units as well as

critical care the numbers are lower than

what we usually live with so it's it's

hard to know what all is happening we we

consider it it's good I wouldn't I don't

know that we've flattened the curve yet

it's quite early on but certainly that

would be our goal and intention and as

we look at it the rates and the growth

in other jurisdictions I think

Manitoba's doing pretty good but we

still have to be vigilant and and follow

our social distancing staying home when

we're sick and washing our hands

frequently alright we're going to have

time for second round that to America

global kind of just spend enough of what

an odd question but how would we know

whether we applied the curve and then

think that answer seems obvious but just

I just some clarity on so I guess

and dr. rusyn can jump in as well but

when we look at other jurisdictions like

China and Italy and Spain there there's

a sudden spike so the goal is that we

can we can manage the volumes and we

know there's going to be spread and we

know the volumes are gonna increase but

increase at a manageable rate would be

our goal so we know that there's been

two admissions to critical care we've

had one death and we have one patient in

hospital right now so that to us is it's

it's pretty flat with that but we'll

have to keep watching like it's really

too early to say we're gonna have to

watch the trends and watch the volume

over time

ah yeah I think that's exactly right

it's it's it's too early for us to talk

about flattening a curve we want to

we're still in a bit of a containment

right now and and case-finding if we

look at a jurisdiction like BC where

they have over 800 cases then they can

do some modeling to show that their

interventions have been having an effect

so for us we'll continue to be

aggressive in our social distancing

strategies and then absolutely that's

our goal as is to flatten that curve

again it's maybe here at the pre-crash

just going back to the first stuff that

we had had heard about on Friday as long

as you guys are able to comment on how

that how that individual contracted for

the 19 was back a shallow attitude so

we're not going to release details about

an individual case it was a coded 19

related death and like we've mentioned a

you know a tragic day for us here in

Manitoba but we're not going to discuss

specifics on a lot of the individual

okay from what you guys have been seeing

all Manitobans following because what if

you think well I shouldn't Lee you know

I think so I think that Manitobans the

majority Manitobans are taking too

seriously I think more and more are

taking the time to learn about the

importance of it every day and we were

strengthening our messaging because we

want to just ensure that message gets

out there but and so it encourage all

Manitobans to go to our website but

really it's you know we talked about the

this modeling data and we look at

worst-case and different numbers in a

way that implies that we're helpless and

we're not right we don't have a number

right now that we're going to hit

because we can change that

if all Manitobans work together if we

all do our parts to practice social

distancing then we don't we don't need

to worry about worst-case scenarios and

so that's what we're really trying to

trying to push forward right now with

our messaging is that we're not helpless

on some modelling number we can make

changes starting right now today to

interrupt the transmission this virus

and thank all Manitobans that are doing

that right now and encourage Allman's if

you haven't yet start today

[Music]

yeah as part of our planning processes

we are looking at different settings

where where we could expand capacity if

we needed to and that's remembering that

the majority of kovat 19 patients are

okay in the community not most of them

won't need to go to the hospital but

they do need a safe place to isolate and

get through that 14-day period so for

sure not everybody has that opportunity

to self isolate in a family or in a

dwelling so we're looking at all options

and we will be reporting something in

the near future in terms of what those

alternatives are do you have yeah we

have a few

a few things in the works right now and

once once we have a better idea in

conformation I'll get back to you from

CTV Winnipeg Jeremy last couple weeks

water for several days of the crime and

then we just talked about the importance

of having hot water at a time like this

be able to wash your hands shower how I

need on that is try and help so I use

cook you know certainly the ability to

wash your hands frequently is is very

important and so encourage all

Manitobans to wash your hands as

frequently as you can if we don't have

that water soap available then then

alcohol-based hand sanitizers are are

effective as well so frequent hand

washing is a very important aspect to to

flattening this curve and public for a

little qualification on the numbers when

how at 72 cases in the province

approximated by two patients that has

worked covers are those two more

complications included in that total

won't back down that's a great question

so the this is the the issue with our

total numbers is that they can only go

up so we will expect them to go up and

so that's not the only thing we need to

focus on as Manitobans looking at this

we're gonna look at those recovered

numbers an important number to look at

that we're going to start trying to find

a way to report is the is the rate of

increase because that's what's going to

tell us what's flattening our curve or

not and so those total numbers they they

can only go up and so that's not the

only indication of how we're how we're

doing against this virus so it's a good

a good question and our recovered

numbers are going to go up as well but

they're not going to take away from the

total cases

sorry I just caught my sorry kid so that

means any Republicans will not be

attracted from the total number that's

correct

thank you from my point of view in terms

of monitoring the number of people in

public spaces like parks come Monday

when the gatherings are limited to ten

or less you are taking federal parks

called entrances here in the port that

people are flooding into virtually

yesterday for instance yep so we there's

a number of methods in place to to

monitor those type of things so these

groups of ten you know in in large large

open spaces they you know it's the

groups of ten within within that close

contact is what we're concerned about

right so we're going to have things in

place to to respond to such things but

again it's we're just getting that

message out to Manitobans to ensure that

they know the importance of staying home

you know getting out getting some

exercise in certainly is important we

need to take care of ourselves during

this time we need to be not mele

isolated we need to be reaching out to

to others and keeping in touch but if

you're getting out to to a park and you

notice that there's crowd starting you

need to turn back this is not the time

to to ignore our social distancing

strategies we have to maintain that two

meters between other folks and we have

to keep keep ourselves healthy but right

now is that time strict adherence to

social distancing strata

geez okay thanks this might be for

Lynette Dennis follow up it's outside

senator isolated people who are

traveling in from northern Manitoba like

they were you know returning from

international travel no the answer is no

they they they rely on us for their

health care and especially if it's based

in facilities and acute care so we we

continue to serve them thank you very

much that concludes today's media

briefing thank you thank you
