hello I'm Eric Sorensen and this is the

West block politics perspectives and

players

as families search for answers to what

happened to flight 752 over the skies of

Iran some suggested is the unintended

consequence of the hostilities between

the u.s. and Iran and that both sides

bear responsibility it was flying in a

pretty rough neighborhood David Frum is

a staff writer at the Atlantic and a

former speechwriter for President George

W Bush and the author of Trump Achra see

the corruption of the American Republic

we spoke with David Friday about the

blameworthiness of both the Americans

and the Iranians the Iranians have just

bulldozed the the crash site removing

all evidence they are holding back the

black box which they claim they have

found there are questions about whether

or not they will have tampered with it

and Iran can it can it just continue to

be opaque in this matter well I ran is

going to have an internal political

problem this is not like Russia striking

a Plane full of people from other

countries this is this is a case where

Iran struck a plane with many people who

have family in Iran

so as heart-rending as this catastrophe

has been inside Canada many of the

people of course were Canadian citizens

or Canadian residents they all have

relatives back in back in Iran and Iran

is a repressive Society it's not a

completely closed society and the grief

that Canadians feel just is going to be

amplified inside the land were so many

relatives of the victims lived

now there's consensus pretty widely that

Iran is blameworthy in this but after

the reports of the missile strike and

the US president said well there's been

a mistake on their side you produced an

article in the Atlantic almost instantly

that said the u.s. cannot shove all of

the blame on Iran why yes there has been

a chain of escalation of violence

between the United States and Iran

beginning about the 27th of December

their strikes and counterstrikes in this

case would the United States the the the

second and third last rounds of the

cycle of retaliation the United States

carried out an assassination of Qasem

Soleimani an Iranian terrorist general

who has much blood on his hands and

course is a person deserving of a

violent death but the United States gave

an explanation of the Trump

administration gave an explanation of

its actions that's obviously not true

they said that and he was killed in

order to avert an imminent attack that

story is already disintegrating and

indeed it doesn't make logical sense

kasam soleimani was the man at the top

of the chain of command if you can stop

an attack by killing the top guy then

the attack is not imminent if the attack

is imminent killing the top guy won't

make a difference it wouldn't have

stopped 9/11 had the United States

killed Osama bin Laden 48 hours before

the plan was already underway that's

what it means to be imminent so the

United States escalated dramatically by

killing Soleimani the Iranians then

counter escalated by firing at the

United States from inside Iran something

they had not done before two hours after

the Iranians unleash their barrage of

missiles they see a blip on their radar

it's the civilian airliner but Iran is

not a first world country it doesn't

have sophisticated technology what it

looks like happened was the Iranians saw

this blip and thought that's the

incoming American retaliation for the

thing we just did to punish them for the

thing they just did so it's a rands

crime the Iranians acted and the

Iranians killed but this crime occurred

in the context of an escalation that the

United States also contributed to and

contributed to under false pretences

American political policy now is like

geology that there are 55 percent of the

country is very strongly opposed to the

president and about 45% of the country a

little less is strongly supportive of

the President and really whatever the

question is those are the numbers what

Americans are clear about is that they

do not want to get involved in a war in

Iran three-quarters of Americans oppose

any kind of confrontation with Iran the

Trump administration has been stumbling

toward exactly that kind of

confrontation partly by accident partly

because of the president's bad political

calculation that escalating in Iran will

help him with impeachment but but the

the confrontation keeps getting more

violent and president Trump is deluding

himself if he thinks he's going to find

any political relief from using violence

against Iran Canadians are asking the

questions you're asking but but do you

have a sense and that Americans are

asking it like I'm

trying to get a sense whether you think

that Donald Trump's image is going to be

burnished by this or if he'll pay a

political price we have early I think we

know the answer to that the USA Today

and Ipsos did a poll that they took

conducted over Tuesday and Wednesday of

the week just preceding where they asked

Americans a series of questions and bait

and the they showed by large majorities

that Americans did not agree that

killing soleimani had made the United

States more safe and a majority 55% that

familiar 55 percent thought it was now

more likely that Iran would develop a

nuclear weapon and we know that we can

surmise we don't know we can surmise the

White House internal polling showed them

the same thing because what was the

first sentence out of the president's

mouth at his press availability after

the shoot-down he said I guarantee that

Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon

he was responding to polls showed that

55 percent of Americans now think it's

more likely that Iran will get a nuclear

weapon because of what just happened

yeah you're aware of the and you've

mentioned at the the toll on Canadians

in that flight Prime Minister Trudeau

said it's too early to assign blame as

he put it in whatever proportion which

suggests there is some blame to assign

in more than one direction how do you

see I guess the effect of all of this on

the canada-us relationship and the

Trudeau Trump relationship um

it's obviously going to be estranged so

to have 30 people meet a violent death

in a town the size of Edmonton I mean

that is a real dagger blow at a

community so I think Canadians are going

to be grieving I'd myself for just in

casual conversation on the phone with on

other lines of business have in the past

few days talk to two people who knew

someone who was on that flight

so the grief is going to be very widely

shared in Canada I think Canadians are

just going to be I don't think is gonna

be a big impact because you know what

can be done but president Trump's lack

of human feeling about it I mean it's

not going to change anybody's mind you

knew he lacked human feeling but it's

just every time you confront his lack of

human feeling it's a shock David we're

out of time we could talk to you all day

but thanks very much for talking to us

today

appreciate it thank you

you
