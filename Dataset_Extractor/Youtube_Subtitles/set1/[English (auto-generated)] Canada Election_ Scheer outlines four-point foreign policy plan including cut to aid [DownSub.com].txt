foreign policy and like so many

Canadians from coast to coast I'm

extremely disappointed that this debate

will not take place this was supposed to

be your opportunity to hear Canada's

major party leaders debate their

respective foreign policies and Canada's

place in the world and I was very much

looking forward to standing on a shared

stage with Justin Trudeau Jagjit Singh

and Elizabeth May challenging their

policies and having my policies

challenged in return and whatever our

differences I want to commend mr. Singh

and ms May for being prepared to defend

their foreign policy plans in public so

Canadians can make an informed decision

we should all be clear there's only one

reason where we are not having this

important debate because Justin Trudeau

has something to hide four years ago he

eagerly participated in this exact same

debate of course back then Trudeau

claimed to value openness and

transparency those were the days and now

we know that Justin Trudeau was not and

is not as advertised

he has spent this campaign avoiding

accountability hiding from debates and

refusing to answer difficult questions

you Tsavo met no Kirsten to donate a

path in a to zaraba said we can put on

there declare it past said campaign at a

beat a Toronto take on F we led by arif

is a dark upon the occasional deficit

now I get part of the reason his

disastrous India trip made international

headlines in turn Canada into a

laughingstock around the globe but

Trudeau's failure on the world stage

goes far beyond his personal behavior it

is about a record of failure in our

international commitments

it's politicized the Canadian Armed

Forces and betrayed veterans surrendered

Canadian jobs and one-sided trade deals

and abandoned our allies in the fight

against extremism and terrorism

humiliated himself Acadians by inviting

terrorists on foreign trips and sent

Canadian tax dollars abroad to enrich

some of the wealthiest and worst regimes

world whether we are talking about

Justin Trudeau's previous praise for

China's basic dictatorship or his

gushing praise for the repressive Castro

regime in Cuba or his ten million dollar

payout to Omar Khadr it is clear that on

foreign policy and human rights like so

much else Justin Trudeau is not as

advertised

la Clare per se la politique atone Jaya

a later model a person staying true

though the past said we will put it on

day that you deserve better because make

no mistake foreign policy is important

particularly for Canadians whose

families come from places like Hong Kong

China India Pakistan Israel the Middle

East Ukraine Venezuela or Russia or for

Canadians who want to evaluate Trudeau's

failure to fight global climate change

or for those worried about their jobs

after all of Trudeau's concessions to

Donald Trump on NAFTA there is a better

way and that's why this morning I'm

going to share with you the points I

intended to make during the monk debate

and my four-point plan for Foreign

Affairs and national security first we

are going to reprioritize foreign aid so

that it is focused on countries and

greatest need while using the savings to

help Canadians like you get ahead second

we are going to reinvigorate our

traditional allegiances with countries

that share a Canadian values third we're

going to reprioritize human rights in

our international affairs and embrace

new legal tools through which we can

hold hostile regimes accountable and

fourth will deep politicize military

procurement to prevent future partisan

abuses a mana on cattle planes today's

what start by talking about foreign aid

Canadians are generous and we want to

help those around us in need the vast

majority of Canada's foreign aid is well

spent on humanitarian assistance to

countries mired in structural poverty or

facing a humanitarian crisis but under

Justin Trudeau a significant chunk of

Canadian foreign aid money does not fit

that description the Trudeau government

today sends 2.2 billion dollars of

so-called foreign aid to middle and

upper income countries like Argentina

Barbados Brazil China Iran Italy Mexico

and Turkey we're still some of that

money is shoveled to repressive regimes

that are adversarial if not outright

hostile to Canadian interests and values

countries like Iran North Korea and

Russia Trudeau has also spent 110

million on the United Nations Relief and

Works Agency which is openly

anti-semitic and continues to support

terrorist organizations like Hamas at a

time when Canadians are working harder

than ever and not getting ahead Trudeau

is using their hard-earned tax dollars

to support anti-semitic organizations

and prop up foreign dictatorships it's

time for Canada to put our money where

our mouth is and only use foreign aid to

support the Canadian values we hold dear

a new Conservative government will

review Canada's overall foreign aid

funding with a target of reducing the

overall envelope by approximately 25%

we'll cut 25% in foreign aid currently

going to corrupt regimes and middle and

higher income countries it will start by

taking the money that Justin Trudeau is

currently squandering overseas and

spending it at home to provide

much-needed and long overdue health to

Canadian families so they can get ahead

these are only delayed it from share the

very same person

leave some coop a some sell actually No

FC at the Asian camp you ad pay and

Revenue my elevate will spend that money

here at home on things like our

universal tax cut that will save every

single Canadian taxpayer hundreds of

dollars a year our children's tax

credits that will make your kids hockey

registration and art classes more

affordable our increase to the aged

credit that will put more money back in

the pockets of every senior our boost to

the RESP that will make it easier to

save for your child's post-secondary

education our tax-free maternity

benefits so new parents have more money

to spend those to spend on those

expensive first months of life our green

public transit tax credit that makes it

more affordable to take the bus or the

train to work and our green home

renovation tax credit that will lower

emissions and help Canadians pay for

green upgrades to their homes in short

our plan will take your hard-earned tax

dollars away from dictators and

relatively wealthy countries and put

them back in your pockets so that you

can get ahead there is still an

important place for foreign aid and in

fact we will redirect 700 million

dollars in aid to countries with grave

humanitarian or refugee challenges such

as much of sub-saharan Africa which will

receive even more aid than they do now

we will ensure a special focus on

support for children in conflict zones

under my plan will work with leading

Canadian aid organizations including

volunteer focus groups who provide

much-needed assistance to developing

countries and we will continue to

consider proposals which support non

development objectives such as minority

rights and peaceful coexistence taking

place in any country this is the kind of

global leadership the world needs more

of one area where we look to build a new

international consensus will be on

protecting children in conflict zones

second will reinvigorate allegiances

with countries and allies that share

Canadian values will renew and

strengthen ties with Canada's Democratic

alliances such as NATO NORAD the five

eyes while at the same time

strengthening relations with like-minded

countries like Japan and India will take

a leadership role in building a strong

Kansa alliance between Canada Australia

New Zealand and the UK my government

will also renew Canada's historic

support for Ukraine and take steps to

help Ukraine secure its borders and

defend its people

this will include expanding on current

missions to support Ukraine and

providing Ukraine's military with the

equipment they need to defend their

borders I'll also push for a Canadian

leadership in a United Nations

peacekeeping mission to secure those

borders

Gao c-in-c states of the leadership

Canadian and misión the maintained

alleppey the national Eenie a feint the

protege la frontiere at the same time

we'll pull Canadian funding from

international organizations that run

contrary to Canada's interests such as

the Asian infrastructure bank and use

the savings to help pay for our plan to

help you get ahead

no longer will Canadian tax dollars

subsidize the government of China's

foreign policy third we'll introduce new

tools to support Human Rights around the

world

Canada has Magnitsky human rights

legislation that targets foreign

officials who are complicit in human

rights abuses but Justin Trudeau has not

used it where its most needed we will in

particular we will target Iran which

routinely abuses human rights as murder

Kane and citizens sponsors terrorism and

has violated nuclear trees at the same

time we'll list Iran's Islamic

Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist

entity under Canadian law

we'll also amend the investment Canada

Act so that the takeover of any Canadian

company by any foreign state owned

enterprise automatically triggers a

national security review and will reopen

the office of religious freedom Trudeau

shut down in order to protect the rights

of religious minorities all over the

world fourth we'll take steps to

depoliticize military procurement

Canadians saw firsthand how partisan

politics corrupts military procurement

during the mark Normand affair Justin

Trudeau's attempt to destroy Vice

Admiral Norman a competent dedicated and

accomplished military hero was a

national disgrace that is why my

government will reintroduce the Cabinet

Committee on defense procurement and

create a procurement Secretariat

within the Privy Council office

to ensure that priority projects are

progressing on time and on budget

the Canadian enroute come on the politic

partisan but Kampala prob is no military

Lord Allah fair mark Normand that

tentative distance below the date will

be said Merle Norman in error military

competent Dave away accompli at their

own national say procurement government

valet tabria the committee the cabinet

soul a provision on the default it

creates a criteria ala provisional of

saying the concept leave a for a survey

clip Roger priority some rail is a at

all a salon the Buju just as importantly

we will refocus the House of Commons

Committee on national defense on matters

of military procurement to foster a

multi partisan consensus we will not

delay in selecting a new fighter jet to

replace our aging cf-18s while

negotiating with Davie shipyards to

provide a second supply ship icebreakers

and federal ferries these four pillars

prioritizing Canada's but prioritizing

Canadians over foreign dictators in

foreign aid recommitting to our allies

putting human rights of the forefront of

our global agenda and taking the

partisan politics out of military

procurement those pillars will form the

foundation of our conservative plan to

reclaim Canadian leadership on the world

stage let me close by making this point

because in the context of foreign policy

it is a very important one Justin

Trudeau ultimately has to answer to the

Canadian people at the ballot box on

October 21st in so many other countries

people are unable to hold this graced

and dishonest leaders accountable for

their conduct but in Canada we do and it

is up to all of us to use that franchise

and get out in vote

Canadians deserve a prime minister who

will not break the law who will not

abuse his power to cover it up and will

not embarrass them on the world stage

instead they deserve a prime minister

who will do everything in their power to

return Canada to a place of honor and

leadership around the world while doing

more to help hard-working families right

here at home get ahead that is my

promise the Canadian people

humbly ask for your support on October

21st thank you very much

merci beaucoup how to take aggressions

do it morning mr. should you sit there

by the end to the Canadian Press I

noticed that during that during the

speech you just gave me speak about

abortion or maternal health for women

and girls internationally that's

something that was important to the past

to revenues of Canada what a

Conservative government led by you

commit the funding of abortion services

internationally so the announcement that

I've made today does not effect groups

who are currently receiving funding this

is not about which types of groups will

see fighting this about which types of

countries will receive those findings

and so those types of those types of

groups will not be affected by this

announcement we need a fair engagement

there pathway over your sediba Leno

story that Woking impact so the group

key key key or swallow large on Canadian

Donnie P comeback continue it up quick

so just because a couple of months ago

the local government introduced about

700 million new dollars I think it's

about 1.4 billion by 2023 specific

million specifically for reproductive

health for women and girls so a

conservative government would not touch

that funding so exactly what what this

is about is which countries are

receiving the funding not which types of

programs or which types of groups this

is a measure to take foreign aid funding

away from countries that rike relatively

high on the development index and

prioritizing that to countries that need

it more and bringing that funding back

here at home to help Canadians get ahead

so this announcement today will not have

an impact on groups that will continue

to receive funding in countries that

will continue to provide support for so

that that is that is our community pas

non-canadian like la Paix come Italy

Brazil a horn to see elephants entre je

ferme our mantra so this is a very clear

choice the selection between Justin

Trudeau's record on foreign policy and

on foreign aid and can Canadians now can

see the choice that between setting more

of their hard-earned tax dollars to

countries that ranked relatively high on

the development index countries like

Italy like Brazil like Turkey and the

hostile governments like Iran Justin

Trudeau has made his choice I have made

my choice will redirect that money here

at home to help Canadians get ahead

Janice McGregor from CBC News Canada is

currently in a campaign for a seat on

the United Nations Security Council what

impact do you see a substantial cut in

the foreign assistance budget having on

Canada's bid well Canada our allies

around the world know our capabilities

when it comes to pulling our weight on

the world stage and the commitment that

we've made in many conflicts over the

past 150 plus years so I'm confident

that our allies will see that but it's

more important to me that I help

Canadians get ahead than curry favor at

the United Nations I am more interested

in making sure that hard-working Kane

and families get ahead that they have

more in their pockets that they're able

to provide for their families raise

their children and achieve their goals

that is our priority that is our focus

as you see blue intensity I don't

callate TV for the Canadian Canadian

same on priority Georgia Quokka News le

a pre-comp Ron that's the contribution

panel at least lock control a day -

global minimum priority a derailleur saw

the Canadian

by their gang the the that we day

necessary me I want to make sure I

understand the vision you're

articulating here would you would have

future conservative governments in

Canada pursue more of a go-it-alone

strategy like we've seen in the United

States recently would this be a

withdrawal from some of the

multilateralism that has been part of

Liberal foreign policy pulling back from

other things perhaps like the World

Trade Organization in our efforts to

reform there this is a specific quite

the contrary what I've called for today

is a more reinvigorated partnership with

our traditional allies through NATO and

through countries that share our same

commitments to democracy the rule of law

and peace and security stronger ties

with countries like Japan and India what

this is is pulling money out of things

like the Asian infrastructure bank which

does not further Canadians interests

which is controlled by the government of

China to build roads and bridges and

other projects in other countries so

this is about reinvigorating our

relationship strengthening our

relationship on a multilateral level

with our traditional allies and

countries that share our same values and

ensuring that Canadian taxpayers dollars

are not going to countries would that

have a relatively high income or a

relatively high Development Index so

this is about reprioritizing that money

here at home to help Canadians get ahead

and also focusing part of that foreign

aid budget to countries that need it the

most well as I said I don't see any

reason why Canadian tax dollars are

going to the Asian infrastructure thing

that is a choice if Justin Trudeau

thinks that Canadians are happy with

their tax dollars going to build roads

and bridges and other countries he can

certainly make that case this is a

choice for Canadians to make we've made

it very clear where we're going with

foreign aid money and with foreign

policy stronger relationships with our

traditional allies and countries that

share our values and foreign aid money

going to the countries that meet at the

most with a significant portion of the

existing budget being repatriated coming

back home to help Canadians to get ahead

to put more money in the pockets of

Canadians so that their quality of life

can increase

hi Mr Shearer Janice Dixon The Globe and

Mail I'm wondering if you can tell us

what your what you're hoping to achieve

at tomorrow night's debate and

specifically what your message would be

for would be block boaters well I'm

hoping to to show Canadians that Justin

Trudeau does not deserve to be

re-elected and I'm just looking forward

to the fact that he's actually showing

up so that's a big step for him and and

I am confident that Canadians will see

that he is unable to defend his four

years of high taxes massive deficits and

scandal and corruption my message to all

Quebecers to all Quebecers is that a

Conservative government respects the

rights of provinces we believe in

respecting provincial jurisdiction and

that we and that we are committed to

addressing some specific challenges and

specific issues in Quebec like a single

income tax return so I don't have a one

message for one group of people I have

the same message for all Quebecers and

indeed all Canadians we jata finalement

that one opportunity that weren't a bad

back to Justin Trudeau lamont gala

some proper belong have a click on

Beckham is so affordable unique okay and

you said for a couple of years that

you've completed your university degree

in Regina but there are records that

show that you've completed it in Ottawa

University after you became an MP so can

you just clarify exactly sure with your

education sure I've always been very

clear I took courses at the University

of Regina

my degree is granted from the University

of Ottawa where I took the the bulk of

my my classes the overwhelming majority

of my classes were from all of you

I think mr. schlimmer chef GCP see you

talk about deep politicizing the system

yet in the policy it also talks about

negotiated contract with Navy shipyards

to build a supply ship I just wonder

what sort of message that sends when of

course davia is located in a

conservative riding in Quebec in terms

of when you were talking about D

politicizing processes well it's

actually undoing the politicization that

the Liberals created when they pulled

that original contract Davi shipyards

had an innovative model that delivered a

supply ship on-time and on-budget

actually under but under time and that

was precisely what Justin Trudeau

interfered with with the mark Normand

case so it's actually undoing the damage

that Justin Trudeau has right but as I

said that that contract would have gone

through had Justin Trudeau not have

interfered and not canceled that so it

was actually it's actually deep

politicizing it by going back to the

original plan where Hainan taxpayers got

more bang for their buck and the

military got the equipment that they

needed so it's a key part of deep

politicizing its undoing the

politicization of the Trudeau liberals

we are Sinclair

DCC under state law it is easily politic

pursue Labour's windin of no force army

Sarika come DVF avec le premier premier

contract alone for a pulley conservative

antonio Ambuja lucas mayer a new start

in time Mr Shearer you've been pretty

consistent throughout the campaign when

questions about the same-sex marriage

policy of kebab gonna be very consistent

we're not gonna reopen the debate that

was 2005 is 2019 I get all that I just

want to clarify one thing not how you

would govern but just who you are what

you believe in your heart basically do

you feel that same-sex marriage is just

as morally equivalent as traditional

marriage as I said I have at the time of

this debate was before Canadians like

many

many members of parliament that who

voted on different sizes of this issue

there are liberals and NDP even voting

on different sides of this issue

Society has moved on I have moved on I

will always defend the rights of LGBTQ

Canadians I respect them I believe that

government must be a champion for their

rights and I will continue to be like I

understand it mr. chairman this is

that's not what I'm asking this is a

straightforward yes-or-no about who you

are not interesting perspective Prime

Minister just Andres you're the person

do you feel yes or no that same-sex

marriages is morally equivalent this

traditional I believe in the Equality

rights of all Canadians I believe in the

Equality rights of LGBTQ Canadians I

believe that the law must be there to

protect them and give them the same

access in the same types of supports in

the same institutions and I will

continue I will continue to get to

govern that way I have been I was proud

to participate in the historic apology

to America to LGBTQ Canadians who were

persecuted in the public service because

of their sexual orientation

I have called on the government to do

more to help my people being persecuted

because of their sexual orientation

other countries I'll continue to be a

champion for LGBT for kitty's a clemency

continues did you clarify what you said

a few moments ago about maternal health

and abortion rights as related to

foreign aid funding you said you

wouldn't touch the agreements were in

place already what about moving forward

will will abortion rights factor into

any foreign aid decisions that Canada

makes oh so I as I said I'm very clear

on this

we are not reopening this Abeyta at any

level what this is about is which types

of countries will receive financial

assistance and so groups that are that

occur that are receiving funding will

continue to receive funding going in

future this decision does not affect

groups or programs going forward well

one of your candidates in Quebec said

that he would like to have seen you

participate in the climate marches last

Friday when you see the footage from

those marches the hundreds of thousands

of people all across the country do you

think maybe you've miscalculated this

issue that that you are out of step with

Canadians on this not at all and again I

find it completely ironic almost funny

but certainly hypocritical that Justin

Trudeau was protesting his own record

and he doesn't seem to be aware of

of his actions on that and the message

that that was singling at that I was

very proud to make it announcement

talking about improving the quality of

life of Canadians and investing in

public transit and our plan for the

environment it gives Canada the best

plan to the the the best opportunity to

achieve our Paris targets so while

Justin Trudeau can make you know

symbolic acts he's always been terrible

on actually following through with

results that's what our focus is on

right well look we we have sent a

message to every Canadian who is

concerned about the environment that we

have a real plan that we're taking this

seriously that we're gonna get rid of

the carbon tax because it raises the

cost of everything without doing

anything for the environment and replace

it with a real plan that takes the

climate change fight global and as I

said I've seen lots of footage and lots

of pictures from that from the from

those demonstrations a lot of signs

saying actions not words that's

precisely what our party is focused on

real results to help tackle global

climate change by lowering global

emissions by Charlie Mitchell times at

London and do you have any regrets about

publicly supporting brexit given the

upheaval that is caused so as I've said

in the past I've always believed in the

rights of people in rights of countries

and the people in those countries to to

chart their own course and to have

sovereignty I've always felt that that

that is a fundamental principle and I'm

focused on foreign policy issues here

today like Canada's development aid

which countries that receive funding

from hard-working paying tax payers just

as a follow-up have you been approached

by any British officials about the

prospects of a trade deal and if so what

was the progress of those discussions

well I was very proud to have visited

the United Kingdom last year where I

specifically met with British members of

parliament including then Minister of

Trade Boris Johnson and now Prime

Minister to talk precisely about

ensuring that Canada's trade access with

the United Kingdom could proceed no

matter the eventualities of

of negotiations with the European Union

I'm just quickly one one follower are

you willing to roll over the C ETA to

the UK exit well look I think there's a

lot of there are a lot of hypotheticals

in that question obviously our party

always supports free trade we believe in

in free and open trade with with with

our partners who have you know a similar

rule of law I mean we were thinking

about the United Kingdom same

parliamentary traditions same rule of

law same commitment to to global values

and obviously the ensuring that that we

maintain at the very least what we have

now is it's very important for our

government but obviously that will be

subject to to negotiations and to see

what the eventual outcome is David akin

Global News Des Moines this year just

coming back to the answer on the United

Nations Security Council seat I'm going

to read between the lines that you've

pretty much given up on that but feel

free to correct the record and the

answer to this question which is this

Canada's placed through a small middle

power overseas development assistance is

one of the biggest ways that we can be

influential in the world pulling it back

will make us less influential seeking to

just hang out with our own Club and

NORAD mate or whatever however important

that is makes us less influential and so

when China kidnaps three of our citizens

and we need help we won't have friends

because your policy will make us smaller

in the world

quite the contrary okay first of all on

the UN Security seat as I said I believe

our allies around the world have seen

the contribution and the commitment that

Canada has made in so many of the evils

that we face since our country was

founded side by side our allies fighting

terrorism side by side fighting in two

world wars including conflicts in Korea

so I think our allies know what we're

capable of and but when it comes to

obtaining that seat by using Canadian

taxpayers dollars to be sent to

countries that rank relatively high

middle and high-income countries that

that is different that is a disagreement

that is a choice that I would not make I

would take that money bring it back here

at home to help Canadians get ahead I

actually believe that by strengthening

our

they ship with traditional partners like

NATO and Nora we would have more

influence on the world and it was

precisely Justin Trudeau's decision at

the beginning of his mandate to shift

our traditional our focus away from our

traditional allies that I believe is

precisely why we're in the situation

we're in

I will note that under his foreign

policy the government of China has taken

this action by holding Canadian citizens

while we were still making these types

of funding programs in these types of

countries Justin Trudeau has done

precisely nothing to show the

governments of China that we will stand

up for ourselves

I've called on him to appoint an

ambassador much earlier than he did it

took him nine months to do so to

challenge a China's decision on our

exports to the World Trade Organization

he only did that in the dying days of

his government before the election I've

called for increased inspections on

goods coming from China which would not

just send a message to the government of

China but would also allow us to crack

down on things like fentanyl coming into

our cities so his foreign policy has

been an out complete failure I will I

will make sure that a Conservative

government stands up for Canada's

interest and Canadians around the world

I think a lot of communities would say

we could quibble about the amount Carter

got paid but he was gonna get a check

first of all I need to correct something

in in your premise I don't believe that

we should just abandon the idea that

that Omar Khadr deserves that money I

don't think we should just accept that

that he was entitled to that money or he

was going to get it anyway court rulings

indicated that the compensation that

Omar Khadr was entitled to was

repatriation but that was his

compensation getting to come back to

Canada after what he did was the

compensation for what happened to him

and that would be as far as I would be

prepared to compensate him without

without a further decision Justin

Trudeau abandoned that court case he

refused to fight for the principle that

Omar Khadr did not deserve a single

dollar of taxpayers money he rolled over

on that now I contrast that to his

continual fighting our veterans in court

so the hypocrisy of Justin Trudeau

saying it's not worth fighting the

principle for giving it it's not worth

fighting for the principles and we're

gonna cut Omar Khadr a check to avoid a

court case and then turning around and

spending millions of dollars on lawyers

fighting veterans that is a choice he

has made that is not the choice I would

make now when it comes to terrorists and

people have fought for Isis and horrible

organizations around the world that

commit grievous horrendous crimes

I would not lift a finger to help bring

them back to Canada makes my regimen

merci beaucoup
