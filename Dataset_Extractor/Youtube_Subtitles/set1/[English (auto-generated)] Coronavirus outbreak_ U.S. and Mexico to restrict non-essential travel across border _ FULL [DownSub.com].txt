thank you very much I had a very good

telephone conversation extremely good

with Senator Schumer a little while ago

we're working on various elements of the

deal and the Democrats are very much

wanting something to happen and the

Republicans likewise are very much

wanting something to happen and I think

it will I spoke with at length with

Mitch McConnell and this tremendous

spirit to get something done so we'll

see what happens but my conversation was

very good with Senator Schumer I thank

you all for joining us and I'd like to

begin by providing an update on what we

are doing to minimize the impact of the

Chinese virus on our nation's students

with many schools closed due to the

virus the Department of Education will

not enforce standardized testing

requirements very importantly for

students in elementary through high

school for the current year they've been

through a lot they've been going back

and forth schools open schools not open

it's been a little standardized testing

and you know it's we're not going to be

enforcing that so I think you can let

the people know I think probably a lot

of the students will be extremely happy

some probably not the ones that work

hard maybe not but it's one of those

things unfortunate very unfortunate

circumstance we've also temporarily

waived all interest on federally held

student loans they'll be very happy to

hear that and I've instructed them to

take that action immediately and today

secretary divorces directed federal

lenders to allow borrowers to suspend

their student loans and loan payments

without penalty for at least the next 60

days and if we need more we'll extend

that period of time borrowers should

contact their lenders but we've given

them very strong instructions so we've

temporarily waived all interest on

federally held student loans that's a

big thing that's gonna make a lot of

students very happy and we have more to

come when student loans more good news

for the students but we'll do that at a

different time this morning the Treasury

Department also announced that we're

moving tax day from April 15th to July

15th so we're we're moving it out to

July 15th so that people will have time

and people will be able to hopefully by

that time we'll have people getting back

to their lives families and businesses

will have this extra time to file with

no interest or penalties we're getting

rid of interest and penalties however if

you have refunds or credits you would

like to claim you may still file in

other words you can file early if you

are owed money by the IRS other than

that we're moving it all the way out to

July 15th no interest no penalties your

new date will be July 15th today our

team will also provide an update on our

continued effort to prevent the

transmission of viruses America's

borders and I watched what's been

happening in California with governor

Newsom and this morning with Governor

Cuomo and I applaud them they're taking

very strong bold steps and I applaud

them and we're all working together

we're working very closely together

including those two governors but I

would say based on the call the media

was there I think we can say that with

respect to virtually every governor in

that call I think every governor we had

almost all of them if not all of them

and I would say that you could see for

yourselves at the level of respect and

esprit de corps working together was

extraordinary

there was no nobody angry nobody upset

we're able to help them and that's what

we're all about we want to help we're

doing things that a lot of people

wouldn't be able to do but the

relationship with governors and States's

think very extraordinary especially

under the circumstances where this just

came upon us we're working with Canada

and Mexico to prevent the spread of the

virus across North America very closely

you heard what we did yesterday with

Canada and Secretary of State

Pompeyo will be making a statement in a

little while having to do with Mexico

and the border and Chad likewise Chad

willful likewise to be making a

statement there's a joint comprehensive

effort in collaboration with our

neighbors the measure and all of those

measures that we're putting in place

will protect the health of all three

nations and reduce the incentive for a

mass global migration that would badly

deplete the healthcare resources needed

for our people and so we are working

very closely with Mexico very very

closely with with Canada the

relationships never been better we're

all working for the same toward the same

goal our nation's top health care

officials are extremely concerned about

the great public health consequences of

mass uncontrolled cross-border movement

and that would be mostly and even beyond

but mostly during this global pandemic

every week our border agents encounter

thousands of unscreened unvetted and

unauthorized entries from dozens of

countries and we've had this problem for

decades for decades you know the story

but now it's with the national

emergencies and all of the other things

that we've declared we can actually do

something about it would take it a very

strong hold of that and we have before

but this is now at a level that nobody's

ever approached in normal times these

massive flows place of s burden on our

healthcare system but during a global

pandemic they threatened to create a

perfect storm that would spread the

infection to our border agents migrants

and to the

public at large left unchecked this

would cripple our immigration system

overwhelm our health care system and

severely damaged your national security

we're not going to let that happen

so we have a lot of information and

they'll be discussing that in a moment

to confront these public health degrees

the Centers for Disease Control and

Prevention has decided to exercise its

authority under the title 42 of the u.s.

code to give customers of border

protection the tools it needs to prevent

the transmission of the virus coming

through both the northern and the

southern borders so we're treating the

borders equally the northern border and

the southern border it's being treated

they're both being treated equally a lot

of people say that they're not treated

equally well they are as we did with

Canada we're also working with Mexico to

implement new rules at our ports of

entry to suspend non-essential travel

these new rules and procedures will not

impede lawful trade and commerce

furthermore Mexico is taking action to

secure our own southern border and

suspend air travel from Europe so we're

coordinating very closely the air travel

going to Mexico and then trying to come

in to the United States the actions were

taking together with our North American

partners will save countless lives at

the conclusion of my remarks secretary

azar secretary Pompeo secretary wolf

we're going to be also taking some

questions with Tony and Debra who you've

gotten to know very well but they'll be

discussing certain things and I think

you'll find them of great interest we're

going to be providing tremendous amounts

of detail over the coming days but a lot

of it will be provided right now if

you'd like to find out about it there's

been a week of resolute action

tremendous action tremendous

relationships have developed with people

that frankly didn't get along people

that didn't like each other they're now

working together and maybe even in some

cases learning about

each other and liking each other it's

nice thing I invoked the defense

production act and last night we put it

into gear we move the National Response

Coordination Center to the highest level

of activist mean if you if you take a

look at what we did the level of

activation has been increased to a grade

one level which is the highest level

we're providing historic support to

small businesses and to the states the

states need support normally they do

this themselves because of the magnitude

of it the federal government has gotten

very much involved in terms of getting

the equipment they need so we're helping

them it's it's a responsibility they

have but we are helping the states a lot

that's why the governor's I think in

every case have been impressed and very

nice we enacted legislation guaranteeing

paid sick leave for workers at no cost

to employers and I think it's very

important so they get paid sick leave at

no cost to employers we're accelerating

the use of new drug treatments were

advancing legislation to give direct

payments to hardworking families

throughout our country Americans from

all walks of life are rallying together

to feed the unseen enemy strike in our

nation in times of struggle we see the

true greatness of the American character

and we are saying that a lot of people

are talking about it we're at a hundred

and forty-one countries from what

they're telling me and some of those

countries are really working in a

unified manner and they're working very

unified with us almost I could say good

good number of them doctors and nurses

are working nonstop to heal the sick

citizens and churches are delivering

meals to the needy truckers are making

the long haul to keep shelves stock

we've been dealing with the big stores

and the big chains Walmart they've been

fantastic and others they've all been

fantastic we've made it much easier for

them to stock in terms of travel and

travel restrictions where

lifting restrictions so they can get

their trucks on time you're seeing very

few empty shelves and yet the amount of

volume that they're doing is

unprecedented because people want to

have what they have to have what they

feel they have to have and they're also

buying in slightly smaller quantities

which is good because we're not going

anywhere we're gonna be here so I want

to thank all of those very great

companies for working so well Americans

from every walk of life are coming

together and thanks to the spirit of our

people we will win this war we are we're

winning and we're going to win this war

America will triumph and America will

rise higher than ever before we'll be

stronger than ever before and we've

learned a lot we've learned a lot we've

learned a lot about relying on other

countries and I can say that I think in

both a very good and a very bad way some

good things came out of it and some

not-so-good things came out of it so I'd

like to move now to invite our team to

provide information on the new measures

to prevent viral spread at our borders

and I'll start by asking Secretary of

State Pompeyo to speak he's doing a

fantastic job and like everyone else

he's been working very very long and

very very hard and he's doing the other

more normal jobs of a great Secretary of

State but he got he got tied into this

like everybody else and he's been really

doing a fantastic job Mike please Thank

You mr. president

before I address the efforts that we've

been engaged in to push back against the

Chinese virus I want to sure the

American people that as president Trump

just said your State Department your

entire national security team is staying

focused on the other diplomatic

challenges around the world those

include reducing risk to America from

Afghanistan holding the Iranian regime

accountable for its Mayan activity and

our counterterrorism efforts against

Isis remain a priority for our team our

number-one priority across those mission

sets remains the protection of the

American people the president our team

are very focused on it I'll take this mo

to to thank my team State Department

team who is working long hours all

around the world

to take care of Americans who are

stocked at places around the world I'll

talk about that more in just a minute

you've all seen dr. Burks with me

State Department officials is doing

great work but I want to I want to give

a shout out to all of the State

Department team here in Washington

around the world that are working

overtime to help us push back against

this pandemic under the president's

leadership this week we've taken two

important steps first as president Trump

announced on Wednesday the United States

and Canada jointly agreed to restrict

all non-essential traffic across our

border this decision goes into effect

tonight midnight the restrictions will

be reviewed after 30 days and they

exclude traffic and movement across the

border for work or other essential

reasons we're grateful to have such an

outstanding friend to the north who is

committed as we are to defeating this

virus I also want an ounce today that

the United States and Mexico have agreed

to restrict non-essential travel across

our shared border both our countries

know the importance of working together

to limit the spread of the virus to

ensure the commerce that supports our

economy continues to keep flowing I hear

to the United States is glad to have a

friend whose working side by side us in

the fight secretary

wolf will talk a little bit more about

the details of how we're working

alongside our partner in Mexico to keep

our southern border safe and secure as

well on another note yesterday the State

Department issued a level flow of global

travel advisory this means that all

international travel from US citizens

should be avoided in countries where

commercial departure options remain

available u.s. citizens who reside in

the United States should arrange for

immediate return to the United States

unless they're prepared to remain abroad

for an extended time if you choose to

travel internationally your travel plans

may well be severely disrupted and

finally I want to talk about the

disinformation that people are saying

but on Twitter around the world some of

it coming from government some of it

coming from other individuals just urge

everyone as they're seeing information

information that at one time suggested

somehow this virus emanated from the

United States Army this information

about lock downs that are taking place

every American

people all around the world should

ensure that where they turn to for

information as a reliable source and not

a bad actor trying to create and flow

information that they know is wrong this

is a tough fight the American people

were tougher our diplomatic teams are

working around the clock to help them

keep safe both home and abroad and we're

showing once again the global leadership

that America has always delivered it's

been great to see countries around the

world well rally behind what President

Trump and our team are doing thank you

thank you very much we'll take questions

right after this well let me start off

by thanking the president and the vice

president for their continued leadership

and commitment for protecting the

American people during this crisis early

on the president again took

unprecedented actions to restrict travel

from areas affected with the coronavirus

and to date DHS has screened over

200,000 individuals coming back from

those affected countries this has have

been an immense undertaking but one that

the men and women of DHS have

successfully accomplished today's

announcement is yet another example of

the extraordinary steps the

administration is taking to ensure the

safety of the American public before I

comment on the CDC order that I'm sure

secretary azar will later elaborate on

let me first address the progress as

Secretary Pompeo and others have made

with our Canadian and Mexican partners

regarding cross-border travel as we

continue to evaluate common-sense

measures that reduce risk and prevent

further spread it only makes sense that

we have looked to look at the measures

that our neighbors to the north and

south are undertaking and so we've been

working closely with those partners

since the earliest days of this virus

and the outbreak and again as the

president said earlier this week in

secretary Pompeo we've reached an

agreement an agreement with both Canada

and Mexico to limit till Lymon

non-essential travel across our land

borders let me be clear that neither of

these agreements with Canada or Mexico

applies to lawful trade or commerce

essential commercial activities will not

be impacted we will continue to maintain

a strong and secure economic supply

chain across our borders a few examples

of a central Travel include but

certainly are not limited to individuals

traveling from

medical purposes to attend educational

institutions for emergency response

public health services and individuals

engaged in lawful cross-border trades as

the secretary said the agreements with

both Canada and Mexico will go into

effect on Saturday March 21st

furthermore we're also working

collaboratively with Canada and Mexico

to take decisive a joint action

regarding individuals seeking entry

between our ports of entry the CDC order

directs the Department to suspend the

introduction of all individuals seeking

to enter the u.s. without proper travel

documentation that's for both the

northern and southern border the CDC

director has determined that the

introduction and spread of the corona

virus in the department's border patrol

stations and detention facilities

presents a serious danger to migrants

are frontline agents and officers and

the American people so it's important to

note that the department currently

apprehends foreign nationals from over

120 different countries around the world

the vast majority of those having

coronavirus cases many of these

individuals arrive with little or no

identity travel or medical documentation

making public health risk determinations

all but impossible it's also too

important to note that the outbreak on

our southern border would likely

increase the strain on health systems in

our border communities taking away

important and life-saving resources from

American citizens tonight again at

midnight we will execute the CDC order

by immediately returning individuals

arriving without documentation to Canada

Mexico as well as a number of other

countries without delay so again

CBP is positioned to execute these

measures as we continue to keep our

borders secure and safe before I

conclude let me just wrap up by thanking

the brave men and women of DHS

specifically CBP and across the

government for the work that they do day

in and day out to keep the American

people safe from the corona virus the

department has a number of frontline

officers that have been tested positive

as well as others who are self

quarantine and that I am doing

everything that I can to protect these

Patriots as they continue to defend our

homeland during this crisis

thank you today's announcement is just

the latest in a long line a bold

decisive actions the president has taken

to protect Americans from the corona

virus spreading across our borders in

January within two weeks of China's

notifying w-h-o about the virus and with

only 45 cases in China we began

screening travelers from Wuhan then over

time as the outbreak evolved the

president restricted travel from China

Iran and Europe our health experts say

that these measures have been truly

effective at slowing the viruses spread

to our shores just think about this

Italy and the United States both saw

their first travel related case of

corona virus around the exact same time

the last week of January and yet we have

had precious time to continue our work

around vaccines therapeutics and other

preparations while Italy has tragically

been overwhelmed with critical patients

for several weeks now the president

today is taking action to slow the

spread of infectious disease via our

border under Section 362 of the Public

Health Service Act the CDC is suspending

the entry of certain persons into the

United States because of the public

health threat that their entry into the

United States represents this order

applies to persons coming from Mexico

and Canada who are seeking to enter the

country illegally and who would normally

be held in a congregate setting like a

Customs and Border Protection station it

does not apply to u.s. citizens or

lawful permanent residents during this

pandemic a number of health challenges

arise when illegal immigrants arrive at

our northern and southern borders and

are taken into immigration custody we're

talking about significant numbers of

illegal immigrants from this past

October through February DHS has

processed more than 21,000 inadmissible

aliens at the northern border and more

than 150 1,000 inadmissible aliens at

the southern border

CBP facilities were never designed to

hold large numbers of people and to

protect agents and migrants from

infection during a pandemic nor to treat

them for a novel virus if large numbers

are infected when held at border

facilities these migrants were spreading

the virus to other migrants to CBP

agents and border health care workers

and even the United States population as

a whole in such circumstances the kind

of social distancing measures the CDC

and the president have recommended are

simply not possible on top of that any

resources that we are using to reduce

the risk of infection among CBP agents

health care workers and migrants in

these facilities are drawing on American

an American health care system that is

already fighting the corona virus

pandemic that's why the president and

his administration are taking these

important steps to keep Americans and

our immigration system safe from these

health risks as part of our whole of

government approach to combating the

corona virus thank you mr. president for

the work that you've been doing

throughout this crisis to slow the

spread of the corona virus and to keep

our country safe so we continue to

review the data very carefully from

around the globe as I know many of you

are we continue to see signs that again

individuals under 20 19 and under may

have severe disease but majority and all

have recovered to date we still see that

same trend and frankly from Italy we're

seeing a very another concerning trend

that the mortality and mail seems to be

twice in every age group of females this

should alert all of us to continue our

vigilance to protect our Americans that

are in nursing homes this requires all

of the community and when you see the

sacrifices that many Americans have made

the sacrifices that the service industry

has made to close their restaurants

close their bars and so that the spread

is discontinued and then you really

understand how

all of Americans must make the same

sacrifice we continue to ask you to

follow the presidential guidelines of no

groups coming together of more than ten

that if anyone in the household is sick

that everyone

quarantines in the household together

and that we continue to focus on those

who have the most vulnerability to this

illness now to the moms and dads out

there that have children with

immunodeficiencies or other medical

conditions we don't know the level of

risk and I know you will also protect

them in the same way there just is not

enough numbers at this time to really

tell them if they're at additional risk

are not in the same way that adults are

I don't have any new data I can see the

look on your face is saying is she

seeing something new I don't have any

new data but I think it's important for

us to be as honest with the American

people as we can and when we don't have

data be very clear that we don't know

finally no one is immune I sometimes

hear people on radio or others talking

about I'm immune to the virus we don't

know if the contagion levels are

difference in age groups but we know

it's highly contagious to everyone do

not interpret mild or moderate disease

as lack

you

thank you very much mr. president I just

want to underscore a couple of things

that I've said a few times to this group

you may recall that just a week ago or

so I said the two pillars the two

elements of our capability to contain

the infection and the and the surge of

infections in this country rely on two

things keeping infections from coming

from without in we've been very

successful in doing that with China and

with Europe now we have the northern and

southern Borden issues there's a

fundamental public health reason for

doing that because we cannot be

preventing people from coming in from

one area when they can actually go into

the other so that's an important reason

understand that there's a public health

reason for doing that the second thing I

think is really important is what

happened in New York today what Governor

Cuomo mentioned about an hour ago some

rather strong issues that have been

addressed with his recommendations not

recommendations essentially orders now

we have a group of of recommendations

and guidelines that are applicable to

the entire country

you know them we've been over them yet

there are places region states cities in

this country that are being stressed

much much more than the country as a

whole

clearly one of them was Washington

another one was California governor

Newson made some very important

difficult decisions today Governor Cuomo

did the same thing and I want to say I

strongly support what he's doing and one

thing as a New Yorker myself for those

of you who haven't figured out for my

accent that I'm from New York as a New

Yorker I know what New Yorkers can do

we're tough I was in New York City on

September 11 2001 and I know what the

New Yorkers can do so please cooperate

with your governor cooperate with your

mayor it's very important thank you

thank you

Thank You mr. president

the White House coronavirus task force

met this morning we continue with the

president's direction to bring the full

resources not just of the federal

government but in full partnership with

our state governments businesses around

America and a partnership with the

American people to respond to the threat

of the corona virus and I know I can

speak on behalf of the president with

confidence when I say how inspired we

are by the way the American people and

American businesses are coming together

to help defeat this virus in our country

millions of Americans are putting into

practice the president's 15-day

guidelines and we encourage everyone

even those that are not in areas with

significant outbreak to review these

guidelines over the next week and more

and put them into practice and you'll

continue to do your part later today

we'll be talking with manufacturers

around the country and president I

continue to be inspired by the way

American industry is stepping forward we

have businesses around the country that

are literally volunteering to retrofit

plants to help us meet the needs of our

health care workers and our health care

system in confronting the coronavirus as

president mentioned yesterday following

his decision to put FEMA in the lead the

emergency declaration we actually met

with all the nation's governors from the

FEMA National Response Coordination

Center the president and I our entire

team at the federal level couldn't be

more grateful for the efforts of all of

our governor's in implementing the

guidance that is being issued not only

from our task force but also in taking

strong measures in their own communities

to protect their citizens we want to

urge every American to heed your local

authorities listen to their guidance and

and also do your part to slow the spread

we reiterated to all of the governor's

that the president by putting FEMA in

the lead will continue to implement a

plan that is locally executed state

managed and federally supported that

puts

the health of America first we received

a report today as president mentioned on

our legislative team on Capitol Hill

we're working with Republicans and

Democrats at this very hour to pass an

economic recovery package that the

president described and we hope to see

the Congress act on that early next week

on the subject of supplies we continue

to make steady progress on testing

thanks to the president's involvement of

commercial labs the public and private

partnership more and more Americans are

being tested every single day and

tomorrow Admiral Gua and FEMA will

update the American public on the status

of testing and our support of

state-based testing efforts that are

literally expanding by the hour on the

subject of medical supplies we continue

at the president's direction to pursue

every means to expand the supply of

personal protective equipment for the

extraordinary and courageous health care

workers that are ministering to the

needs of people impacted by the

coronavirus we have a policy of

procuring allocating as well as

conserving the resources that we have in

our system and now that the president

worked with the Congress to make

industrial masks fully available for

hospitals to be able to purchase to be

able to use as protective equipment

we're more encouraged than ever about

the availability of those important in

95 mass to our health care facilities

and over this weekend we'll be

announcing a major procurement from the

federal government n95 masks as well

we're also encouraged that we're finding

new alternatives to increase the supply

of ventilators we've mentioned that we

have a federal stockpile some 20,000

ventilators on on standby but that

doesn't count the tens of thousands of

ventilators that are in our healthcare

system around the country but the

president has challenged us to work to

free up other ventilators from other

sources around the country and there are

two different ways that we're doing that

number one in our recent discussion with

anesthesiologist we've literally

identify

tens of thousands of existing

ventilators that can be retrofitted and

converted to be ventilators for people

struggling with the coronavirus but also

on the president's behalf on behalf of

all of our task force we want to

continue to urge every American and

every American hospital and healthcare

facility to postpone any elective

medical procedures this will free up

beds space free up hospital capacity for

people that are struggling with the

corona virus and it'll also free up

equipment that our health care workers

need it is inspiring that we continue to

receive reports that businesses around

America are donating and ninety five

mass to their local hospitals businesses

large and small or donating hundreds in

some cases millions of Henn 95 masks and

I know I know how grateful the president

is and we all are and let me close by

saying as all of our experts have said

many times while the threat of serious

illness to the average American from the

corona virus remains low every American

can do your part to reduce the burden on

your health on your family the burden on

our health care system and especially

the threat to the most vulnerable among

us by putting into practice the

president's 15 days to slow the spread

and as the president said at the outset

of his remarks I know that millions of

Americans are doing that just now and

the greatness of the American character

is shining forth he says you've now

agreed to invoke the defense production

act to actually make those medical

supplies that hospitals say for in

severe shortage so two questions is that

what you're doing now it is I did it

yesterday we invoked it I think the day

before we signed it the evening of the

day before and invoked it yesterday we

have a lot of people working very hard

to do ventilators and various other

things yes

using it now to tell business you're

using ventilators mass respirators for

certain things that we need including

including some of the very important

emergency I would say ventilators

probably more masks to a large extent we

have millions of masks which are coming

and which will be distributed to the

states the states are having a hard time

getting them so we were using the Act

the Act is very good for things like

this we have millions of masks that

we've ordered they will be here soon

we're having them shipped directly to

States you were signing this but not

invoking it this is what you said

yesterday and you would only do so in a

worst-case scenario so we we need no

it's no different other than we need

certain equipment that the states are

unable to get by themselves so we're

invoking it to use the powers of the

federal government to help the states

get things that they need like the masks

like the ventilators yes teeth Governor

Cuomo was done in New York is there any

more consideration to a national

lockdown to keep people at home I don't

think so

essentially you've done that in

California you've done that in New York

those are really two hot beds as it

probably the two hottest of them all in

terms of hot spots I don't think so

because you go out to the Midwest you go

out to other locations and they're

watching it on television but they don't

have the same problems they don't have

by and by any means the same problem New

York California Miami the governor is

doing an excellent job governor DeSantis

in Florida we have some pretty hot spots

in Florida too but we're a general and

the state of Washington of course but

that was largely if you look at it it

was one nursing home that had problems

like you wouldn't believe

so now we're working with the governor's

and I don't think you'll I don't think

we'll ever find that necessary a week

into your 50 day guidelines are you

happy with the progress would you like

I am happy I am happy with it we'll have

to see what the results are at the end

of 14 days let's say well know by the

15th day to see what we do but I'm

certainly honored by the way the

American people are working because it's

work it's worked not to work is the

first time this has ever happened and

we're working out a tremendous financial

package for them so they don't work who

ever heard of this usually you work out

a financial package to get people

working we're asking people not to work

the social distancing that new term

that's become probably the hottest term

there is so no I'm very honored by the

way the American people are taking this

image so seriously yes Jennifer question

for you in a question for dr. Fadi if I

could there's been some concern among

Democrats on Capitol Hill that the phase

three fiscal stimulus is weighted too

much in favor of corporations and not

enough in terms of individuals what did

your conversations with Senator Schumer

yield on that for well I think that

really all of that is being discussed

right now we talked about as an example

buy back stock buybacks I don't want to

have stock buybacks I don't want people

spending I don't want some executives

saying we're gonna buy 200,000 shares of

stock I want that money to be used for

the workers and also for the company to

keep the company going but not for

buybacks I would I mean I haven't spoken

to a lot of the Republicans or Democrats

owner we discussed it and I I don't like

buybacks I didn't like him the first

time we're discussing that with

discussing many things on the same page

from Senator Kyl we're not so far away I

say we're not very we're not very far

away to dr. Koch if I could dr. joshee

as was explained yesterday there has

been some promise with

hydroxychloroquine this potential

therapy for people who are infected with

coronavirus is there any evidence to

suggest that as with malaria it might be

used as a prophylaxis against Cobra 90

no the answer is is no and and the the

evidence that you're talking about John

is anecdotal evidence so as the

Commissioner of FDA and the president

mentioned yesterday we're trying to

strike a balance between making

something with a potential of an act of

an effect

to the American people available at the

same time that we do it under the

auspices of a protocol that would give

us information to determine if it's

truly safe and truly effective but the

information that you're referring to

specifically is anecdotal it was not

done in the controlled clinical trial so

you really can't make any definitive

statement about it without seeing too

much I'm probably more of a fan of that

then maybe than anybody but I'm a big

fan and we'll see what happens and we

all understand what the doctor said is

100% correct it's early but we've you

know I've seen things that are

impressive and we'll see we're gonna

know soon we're gonna know soon in

including safety but you know when you

get that safety this has been prescribed

for many years for people to combat

malaria which was a big problem and it's

very effective it's a strong it's a

strong drug so we'll see begin starts it

was very it was as I understand that I

is that a correct statement it was

fairly effective when stars John you've

got to be careful when you say fairly

effective it was never done in the

clinical trial they compared it to

anything it was given to individuals and

felt that maybe it works well that's the

point whenever you do a clinical trial

you do standard of care versus standard

of care plus the agent you're evaluating

that's the reason why we showed back in

Ebola why particular interventions

worked the possible therapies yesterday

mr. president you said that they were

for quote immediate delivery of media we

heard an ordering yes we have millions

of units ordered bear is one of the

companies as you know big company very

big very great company millions of units

are ordered and we're going to see what

happens we're going to be talking to the

governor's about it and the FDA is

working on it right now the advantage is

that it has been prescribed for a

totally different problem

but it has been described for many years

everybody knows the levels of the

negatives and the positives but I will

say that I am a man that comes from a

very positive school when it comes to in

particular one of these drugs and we'll

see how it works out Peter I'm not I'm

not saying it will but I think that

people may be surprised by the way that

would be a game-changer but we're going

to know very soon but but we have

ordered millions of units it's being

ordered but from Bayer and there is

another couple of companies also that

that do it said there is no magic drug

for coronavirus right now which you

would agree I guess on this issue I

think we only is this analytic sorry

maybe and maybe not

maybe there is maybe there isn't we have

to see we're gonna know is it possible

is it possible that your impulse to put

a positive spin on things maybe giving

Americans of all senses right now I

don't think so I think that I think it's

good you know not get a pretty lovely

question look it may work and it may not

work and I agree with the doctor what he

said may work may not work I feel good

about it

that's all it is just a feeling you know

I'm smart guy I feel good about it

and we're gonna see you're gonna see

soon enough and we have certainly some

very big samples of people if you look

at the people you have a lot of people

that are in big trouble and this is not

a drug that obviously I think I can

speak for a lot of it from a lot of

experience because it's been out there

for over 20 years so it's not a drug

that you have a huge amount of danger

with it's not like a brand new drug

that's been just created that may have

an unbelievable monumental effect like

kill you

we're going to know very soon and I can

tell you the FDA is working very hard to

get it out right now in terms of malaria

if you want it you can have a

prescription you get a prescription and

by the way and it's very effective it

works I have a feeling you may and I'm

not being overly optimistic or

pessimistic I sure as hell think we

ought to give it a try I mean there's

been some interesting things happened

and some good very good things let's see

what happens we have nothing to lose you

know

expression what the hell do you have to

lose Americans were scared though I

guess nearly 200 dead 14,000 you're sick

millions as you witness who are scared

right now what you say to Americans

we're watching you right now you're

scared I say that you're a terrible

reporter that's what I say I think it's

a very nasty question and I think it's a

very bad signal that you're putting out

to the American people the American

people are looking for answers and

they're looking for hope and you're

doing sensationalism and the same with

NBC and Comcast I don't quote I don't

thought Comcast I call it Comcast let me

just have for whom you work let me just

say something that's really bad

reporting and you want to get back to

report a good set of sensationalism

let's see if it works it might and it

might not I happen to feel good about it

but who knows I've been write a lot

let's see what happens John back to the

science from the logistics areas you

know the units that were ordered are

they for clinical trials are they for

distribution to the general patient

population we are going to as I

understand it we are going to be taking

samples in New York Governor Cuomo very

much is interested in this drug and they

are going to work on it also after they

get a certain approval we're waiting for

one final approval from the FDA we'll

see what happens but we'll use it on

people that are not doing great or even

at the beginning of not feeling learn

fallen under than John what do we have

to lose so this way John it's been out

there for so long we hear good things

let's see maybe it works and maybe it

doesn't I'm just thinking the

application here so that would be under

sort of a modified compassionate access

we're doing that I guess and that's

that's what it's called you know yes you

don't mind to follow up on what the

president is saying should Americans

have hope in this drug right now and sir

I would like to follow up on Peters

question here could you please issue

address Americans in this country who

are scared right now this is a very

valid

concern that people have no there really

isn't that much of a difference in many

respects with what we're saying the

president feels optimistic about

something his feeling about it what I'm

saying is that it might it might be

effective I'm not saying that it isn't

it might be effective but as a scientist

as we're getting it out there we need to

do it in a way as while we are making it

available for people who might want the

hope that it might work

you're also collecting data that will

ultimately show that it is truly

effective and safe under the conditions

of covert 19 so there really isn't

different it's just a question of how

one feels about it well certainly as a

drug any drug John has some toxicities

the decades of experience that we have

with this drug indicate that the

toxicities are rare and they are in many

respects reversible well we don't know

is when you put it in the context of

another disease whether it's safe

fundamentally I think it probably is

gonna be safe but I like to prove things

first so it really is a question of not

a lot of difference it's the hope that

will work versus proving that it will

work so I don't see big differences here

don't have the masks they need to do

their jobs your message my message to

the American people is that there is a

very low incidence of death you

understand that and we're going to come

through this stronger than ever before

if you get it if you happen to get it it

is highly unlikely it's looking like

it's getting to a number that's much

smaller than people originally thought

in terms of the ultimate the ultimate

problem which would be death my message

to the American people is number one

you've done an incredible job

incredible what you've gone through spin

and credit wasn't their fault wasn't

their fault it wasn't the fault of a

hundred and forty other countries where

this has happened and there is

tremendous hope and I think we're going

to come out stronger better bigger in

I think we're going to be a better

country than we were before we learned a

lot we learned on reliance who to rely

on who not to rely on but our country

our country has been incredible the way

they pull together including the fact

that I just spoke to Senator Schumer we

had a wonderful conversation we both

want to get to a good solution but it's

been it really for me watching and

seeing people that weren't speaking

getting along well because we all have

one common aim and that's to get rid of

this invisible enemy get rid of it fast

and then go back to the kind of economy

that we had and maybe even better worry

about how long we're gonna be helping

them along

wouldn't it be focused a big focus and

including my conversation with both

Mitch and with Chuck a big focus of that

conversation with small businesses

because they are really the engine

behind our country more so than the big

ones they are the engine behind our

country are you concerned about members

of Congress that may have used

information they learned on updates to

sell stocks and profit on purpose I'm

not aware of it I saw some names I'm not

oh I know all of them I know everyone

mentioned Dianne Feinstein I guess and a

couple of others I don't know too much

about what it's about but I find them to

all be very honorable people that's all

I know they and they said they did

nothing wrong I find them the whole

group very honorable people yeah please

would include Richard Burr the head of

the Intelligence Committee and it also

would include senator Kelly Lafleur and

so the question is whether or not they

should be investigated for that behavior

well it also includes Dianne Feinstein a

Democrat you didn't mention her name why

didn't you mention her name and I think

she's a very honorable person by the way

so I'm not saying but you know it's

interesting that you mentioned two

people but you don't mention one that

happens to be a Democrat I don't know

because I'd have to look at it but

possibly but I find them to be honorable

people yeah

you can hear yourself you see yourself

as a wartime president right now leading

the country through this pandemic that

were experiencing do you really think

you know going off on Peter going off on

a network as appropriate with the

country is going through something like

I do because I think Peter is you know I

dealt with Peter for a long time and I

think Peter is not a good journalist

when it comes to fairness I think it's a

good message because I think that the

country has to understand that there is

indeed whether we like it or not and

some of the people in this room won't

like it there's a lot of really great

news in great journalism and there's a

lot of fake news out there and I hear it

all and I see it all and I understand it

all because I'm in the midst of it so

when somebody writes a story it does a

story on television and I know it's

false I know it's fake and when they say

they have 15 sources have said and I

know there's no sources there's no

sources they just make it up

I know that and I call Peter I call

Peter F but I call other people out too

and you know this is time to come

together but coming together is much

harder when we have dishonest

journalists it's a very important

profession that you're in it's a

profession that I think is incredible I

cherish it but when people are dishonest

they truly do hurt our country forth and

this all happened almost two months ago

why did you say if you could have known

earlier and also you have been calling

to say this we have and I can speak for

myself but I have a very good

relationship with China and with

President Xi I have great respect for

President Xi I consider him to be a

friend of mine it's unfortunate that

this got out of control it came from

China got out of control some people are

upset I know I know President Xi

I he loves China he respects the United

States and I have to say I respect China

greatly and I respect President Xi the

deal-breaker for you this nobody I never

liked stock buybacks from their

standpoint when we did a big tax cut and

when they took the money and did

buybacks

that's not building a hangar that's not

buying aircraft that's not doing the

kind of things that I want them to do

and we're now talking about buybacks we

didn't think we would have had to

restrict it because we thought they

would have known better but they didn't

know better in some kid not in all cases

obviously some people did an incredible

job they built plants all over the

country I mean you'd see what's happened

I mean we were doing until this

invisible enemy appeared we were I mean

we never had an economy like this but

there were some companies that used that

money to buy back stock driving up the

price of the stock artificially in many

cases I don't like that I don't like it

and as far as whether or not we'll have

that allow them when we give them money

because we have to keep these great

companies in business because of the

workers frankly for the most part

because of the workers the workers are

my number one concern but the way we

take care of the workers is we have to

keep the companies going I am fine with

restricting buybacks in fact I would I

would demand that there be no stock

buybacks I don't want them taking

hundreds of millions of dollars and

buying back their stock because that

does nothing yep

and one thing secretary of state Pompeo

is extremely busy so if you have any

question for him right now could you do

that because you know what I'd like to

do I'd like them to go back to the State

Department or as they call it the deep

State Department you don't mind I'd like

to have him go back and do his job so

does anybody have any questions on work

travel can you define that this all

worked with anyone with the work visa

can still cross the border can you

define the measures you're taking that's

a great question

well we're working we were very good

real concern about h-2a visa is

particularly agricultural workers need

to get across we're gonna make sure that

we do everything we can to keep that

part of our economic lifeblood working

between our two countries DHS and the

State Department will work together we

want to make sure and keep commerce

between Canada the United States and

Mexico alive functional and prepared for

the day that this economy bounces back

like we expected it well the Mexican

government has not announced any travel

ban on Europe word have you been in

talks with them as to when they're gonna

do this and what it is that they're

telling you and then a second question

they also are telling us and said in a

press conference this morning that they

will not take back any non Mexican

citizen any other third parties will

have to we don't know what will happen

to that so can you address what will

happen to those third country immigrants

that you are saying that will not be

allowed to enter the u.s. and Mexico

saying that they will not be allowed to

stay in Mexico either or sent back from

the US I'll take the first one in she'll

give you the second one with respect to

travel into Mexico for my side I spoke

with foreign minister abroad a couple of

times about this I'm very confident

we're gonna get to a really good place

that protects the Mexican people and the

American people from those who might be

traveling into places where we've got

designations the Schengen zone from

China so that they're not coming in to

Mexico and then coming in to the United

States I'm very confident we'll do that

we'll make that announcement shortly

together

yeah as we implement the CDC's order

again we're gonna take a number of

individuals that cross the border

illegally and repatriate them and remove

them quickly back to Mexico back to the

northern triangle and back to any other

country so we're gonna do that in a

rapid fashion we'll continue to work

with Mexico to make sure that Mexican

nationals go back as well as other

populations

Sandeen what a mile inspector what a

mile or Cubans back to Cuba what would

you do those third countries that are

not Mexicans so we're doing all of the

above

we're gonna be sending it again

individuals back to Mexico individuals

back to the northern triangle countries

Cuba Haiti all of the we again 122

different nations that we see -

analogies that come across that border

we'll be sending them back individually

to their countries but also with working

with Mexico to send additional

populations back there as well you know

when you said before you said they're

non Mexicans going to Mexico we are not

sending them to Mexico we're sending

them back to their own countries not to

mix it why would Mexico take people that

are from Mexico we're sending them back

in the case of Guatemala Honduras El

Salvador a lot of other countries they

go back to the country from where they

came okay and Mike please the issue of

disinformation is there any particular

locus for this disinformation or is it

diffused it's pretty diffused

unfortunately but we've certainly seen

it come from places like China and

Russia and Iran with our coordinated

efforts to disparage what America is

doing in an activity to have to do all

the things that President Trump has set

in motion here other than what you're

doing this morning what are you doing to

fight back lots of things lots of work

one of the things one make sure is the

American people go to trusted sources

for the information but we've made clear

we've spoken to these countries directly

that we don't that they need to knock it

off that we don't approve of it and then

there are a handful of other things were

engaged in to make sure that the right

information is out there and accurate

information is given this this idea of

transparency and accurate information is

very important it's how we protect

American people from something like this

ever happening again

SCOR bones are the american people to be

coming to trusted sources of information

does it undermine you at all when the

president stands up here and he attacks

and gives out lists calling us

untrustworthy else have a question

Peace Corps volunteers have all have the

sort of Peace Corps military in to find

themselves stranded in places where

there are no longer flights to get back

to the United States what efforts are

being made to help them I appreciate

that question so we're doing lots of

things we've had a couple places in

particular Peru and Morocco I think

we've had the first two maybe three now

flights out of Morocco what we're gonna

work to get people back we're urging

individuals when they can't get back on

their own they traveled they're on their

own when they can get back they're on

their own they ought to try it to do

that but we are we have a team stood up

at the State Department the repatriation

task force that is working each of these

instances so we've heard from

individuals members of Congress we're

trying to get Americans back from these

places where air travel has been

disrupted and we'll get that done over

time we'll get it done successfully we

don't know the full scale of it yet but

we think we have the largest number

identified and we're working if there

are those who are watching that are

someplace and you can get up you can go

on the State Department website you can

log in to get step gov and go step and

login and we'll we'll track it and we'll

try to get everybody back - how long are

these border restrictions likely to last

long the south and north borders

well they'll last as long as we need to

do it to protect the American people

from the rest I couldn't tell you how

long it's gonna watch we have you have

you determined whether Iran is

responsible for that rocket attack last

week so so let me just let me just get

back to you on the answer to that and

what what we get what we know what we

can say what we can say with certainty

is as we've made clear all along that

the Iraqi Shia militias are fun to

trained equipped by the Iranians and

we've urged the Iranian ah'd to do that

and we've told the Iranians that they

will be held responsible for those

attacks when they threaten American

lives the Peace Corps volunteers that

are in sixty plus countries had they all

been returned you know I don't know if

they're all back or not yet I know that

they were directed to come back I know

that most of them Rebecca I couldn't

tell you if we have all of them back yet

secretary Esper's not here but to get

tests to the troops in Iraq and

Afghanistan are you able to give us a

progress report on the status of that if

they're already able to get tests I

don't know the answer to that I know we

have State Department officials to who

are concerned want to make sure we get

them tests our team as well we're

working on that we've had significant

success on that to date there are a few

places we've not been able to get them

but we will we'll get them there how

exactly are you gonna get those

Americans back and do have any plans to

get the military involved in that we're

gonna use all the tools we can these

first efforts are combined commercial

private flights that will fly in bring

them back bring them back to a

destination here in the United States so

we'll do that there are some that will

travel back other ways as well and we've

worked with the Department of Defense to

say where there are a space available

we'll be able to bring them back on

those flights as well it's the old

government effort to make sure we get

them back again they're gonna help us

every place they can secretary that's

where I've talked about a couple times

question the whole world should know

that humanitarian assistance into Iran

is wide open it's not sanctioned we

offered to provide assistance to the

Iranians as well I talked with dr. Ted

Rose from the World Health Organization

about this we're doing everything we can

to facilitate both the humanitarian

assistance moving in and to make sure

the financial transactions connect to

that can take place as well there is no

sanction on medicines going to run

there's no sanctions on humanitarian

assistance going into the country

they've got a terrible problem there and

we want that humanitarian medical

healthcare assistance to get to the

people of Iran we are working to do all

the things we've had in place for the

first three years here to deliver

security for the American people they

know the end all right they know the

answer arrest the leaders they know the

answer to your question

at a time when thousands are working

very hard around the world to come back

to spend their work with the president

for three years now I know how much he

values the people that work on my team I

know when I was the director of the

Central Intelligence Agency how much he

valued the work we did I know that he

watches our team dr. Brooks all the team

that's working to push back against this

virus to keep America safe I know how

much he values them the CDC picked up

but there was some sort of virus

happening in wool on the corona virus

happening in new hub as early as

December one did a CDC start letting

other agencies know that there was

something in China happening that this

corona virus was happening and then when

did the whole government approach passer

to happen so I let the CDC or talk to

that doctor secretaries are please yeah

yeah so so we were alerted by some

discussions that dr. Redfield the

director of the CDC had with Chinese

colleagues on January 3rd it's since

been known that there may have been

cases in December not that we were

alerted in December there's been some

discussion about China and what they

knew and when they knew it and I've been

very critical we need to know

immediately the world is entitled to

know the Chinese government to know of

this risk to the world and that puts a

special obligation to make sure that

data that data gets to our scientists

our professionals this is not about

retribution this matters going forward

we're know we're in a live exercise here

to get this right we we need to make

sure that even today the datasets that

are available to every country including

datasets that are available to the

Chinese Communist Party are made

available to the whole world it's a it's

an imperative to keep people safe we

talked about the absence of datasets not

being able to make judgments about what

to do this is absolutely this

transparency this real-time information

sharing

is it about political games or

retribution it's about keeping people

safe and so when you see a delay in

information flowing from the Chinese

Communist Party to the technical people

who we wanted to get into China

immediately to assist in this every

moment of delay connected to being able

to identify this risk vector the risk

vectors creates risk to the people all

around the world and so this is why it's

not about blaming someone for this this

is about moving forward to make sure

that we continue to have the information

we need to do our jobs secretary what

what message do you think it sends to

other countries when you have the

present United States lashing out at

reporters I've had my frustration with

reporters too all I ask when I talked to

the media is that you listen to what we

say and report it accurately and it's

frustrating it's frustrating when you

see when you see what you see that

doesn't happen it's enormous ly

frustrating we have a responsibility to

tell the American people the truth and

those who are reporting on what it is

we're doing and saying have an equal

responsibility to report accurately I've

seen I've seen many things at the State

Department reported wildly and

accurately on multiple occasions and I

have spoken to those reporters about it

each and every time and I will continue

to do so all right mr. secretary senator

Johnson has suggested that you and the

administration may be overreacting he

said we don't shut down our economy

because tens of thousands of people die

on the highways we don't shut down our

economies because tens of thousands of

people die from the common flu at worst

three point four percent of Americans

will die from this virus he said what do

you say to people that have that view

that's 11

million people he's talking about well

you just say the entire world is

agreeing with us because they're all

they all have their choice and

everybody's doing the exact same thing

we want to shut it out and we can do

that and we'll see what happens in two

weeks and three weeks but if we can save

thousands of lives and even millions of

lives potentially you don't know where

it goes but you could be talking about

millions of lives so if you look at the

the world I mean you have some very

smart people in the world you have some

smart leaders in the world and

everybody's doing it the way we're doing

it I think we're doing a better job then

hopefully most if not all we're doing a

very effective job but we'll we'll know

better in fourteen or fifteen days but

you know you're talking about hundreds

of thousands and maybe more than that

numbers of people and you know we can

bring our finances back very quickly we

can't bring the people back there are

millions of people out there that share

that view that say I don't really need

to shut things down I don't really need

to stay away from the stores I don't I

can go to the beach and those people

making multiple actions exponentially

it's the difference between life and I

agree with it but I think I'd like to

have Anthony answer that because to be

honest that's what he does and he we had

a lot of a lot of very talented people

telling us what they think we should do

Thank You mr. president first of all I

think that's a false equivalency to

compare traffic accidents with I mean

that's totally way out that's really a

false equivalency when you have

something that is new and it's emerging

and you really can't predict totally the

impact it's gonna have and you take a

look at what's gone on in China and you

see what's going on right now right now

in Italy and what's happening in New

York City I don't think with any moral

conscience you could say why don't we

just let it rip and happen and let the X

percent of the people die I don't

understand that reasoning at all

okay so Secretary of State will be

leaving any other questions right in the

back place in the back for Mike Thank

You mr. president

two things in New York this is a

doubling every day they fear that

supplies are going to run out in a

matter of weeks yesterday

Mayor Bill DeBlasio pulled on you to

mobilize the military to deliver urgent

supplies yesterday he said quote the

fate of New York City rests in the hands

of one man here's a New Yorker and right

now he is the Train

the city he comes from I've personally

spoken to emergency department nurses

who say that they're being told not to

wear and 95 masks because supplies are

so low so how do you respond to those

remarks by mayor de Blasio I'm not

dealing with a membe deal with the

governor and the governor agrees with me

and I agree with him so far we've been

very much in sync I I guess they're not

agreeing with each other necessarily but

the relationship with New York I Love

New York I grew up in New York as you

probably have heard and the

relationships have been very good and I

think government and the governor have

been getting along incredibly well with

the federal government okay

quite a mr. secretary secretary welcome

I could just on on illegal entries of

people who are otm how will the turn

back process work will they be taken to

a common area and then put on a plane

and sit back soon northern countries or

others I mean how would that process

work again it's a it's a public health

crisis so what we're trying to do is

limit the the amount of contact that we

have with these individuals not putting

them in Border Patrol facilities ice

detention facilities and like so it's

going to be very rapid we're gonna

obviously take them into custody and

then and then send them back to a port

of entry or other means so it'll be very

quickly it won't be the six or seven or

ten days that we currently have it'll be

much more rapid TM will you will they be

take you to it and your field that's

right to Americans the bill is proposed

creates sort of tiers of checks Franco I

believe philosophically that were

working well believe in a lot of things

I want to get workers money and

whichever way the best way to get it and

I want to keep the businesses open to

because without the businesses they're

not going to be getting money for very

long but we're gonna be talking

threatened if they're not for your

business will do something later I'm

sure

Wall Street analysts are predicting the

unemployment numbers could skyrocket

next week by some analysts say as many

as 3 million people applying for

unemployment which would be a historic

number of one week spread so is a

thousand dollar check going to cut it

exactly we're not talking about a

thousand dollar check we're talking

about much more than that

we're also talking about doing phases if

this doesn't work we're gonna keep doing

until we get it going and frankly once

we get the economy back and once this

enemy is defeated the invisible enemy as

I call it once it's defeated we get the

economy back it's gonna all come back to

us very quickly it comes to back very

quote we have a tremendous economy we do

numbers like no other country has ever

done before number one in the world if

you go back to weeks and still obviously

but if you go back to week's number one

of the world by far that money comes

back to us very rapidly we want to keep

it we want to have it so that when we're

not if but when we win the war with the

invisible enemy when we win it these

companies can immediately start not that

they have to start rebuilding which

takes a long time Steve connections for

job losses in March and April are you

hearing well we're looking at different

numbers we have a best case and a not

best case but the big thing is to defeat

the virus once that virus is defeated

Steve I think everything else falls in

place very rapidly I think you're gonna

have a tremendous upswing a lot of

people agree with me a lot of if you

look at your stock market geniuses and

some of whom are not geniuses but they

think they are a lot of people think

that I'm right about that that once we

defeat the virus I think you're going to

have a very steep like a rocket ship

it's going to go up and everything will

be back and I really believe we're going

to be stronger than ever before yeah go

ahead

on the issue of supplies you pull

governor's to try to find whatever

supplies they had on their own but some

of them are now saying when they go to

try to buy them they're being outbid by

the federal government well you heard my

news conference yesterday was sort of

yesterday's news no well that does

happen because they want to buy supplies

we want to buy as a backup to them in

case they can and sometimes that will

happen but regardless of who gets them

when they need them we're getting them

to them now we're doing the production

act we're doing it very much and we have

a lot of things cooking right now at a

high level remember this

nothing like this has ever happened

before over a hundred and forty

countries and you have supply chains

that are broken down for two reasons

because they can't supply that much and

because people are sick they can't be on

the chain so you have a lot of

interesting things all over the world

you have supply chains that broke down

because of the illness and also because

of the fact that the quantity but we're

getting it ordered we're getting it done

and the if you just have to look some of

you were at the call yesterday where I

spoke with the governors almost all of

the governors and every one of them was

very impressed with what we've done told

States not to disclose their

unemployment numbers do you agree with

that this gonna have to talk to I would

have to talk to on the EPA I just want

to be clear are you saying that the

administration is requiring these

industries to create these products or

just AskMe so far we haven't had to it's

an amazing thing that happened we're

getting calls from automobile companies

we're getting calls from other companies

saying they have plant capacity they

want to make ventilators they want to

make other things we are literally being

besieged in a beautiful way by companies

that want to do the work they want to do

the job they want to help us they want

to help our country so we haven't had a

problem with that at all

you help out states and localities that

are trying to bid on things like

ventilators and other items that are

being outbid by them well when they call

us they let us know if there's a

conflict they will call us and we will

drop our bid because we want them to go

first because their point a point of

sale so we've had four or five instances

where literally that was happening

because you know we're both trying to

get stuck and if we're going against

they will call us the smart ones frankly

will call us and we will immediately we

want them to buy it because it gets to

them quicker if they buy it they know

they're really there they know that and

it's happening more and more where

they're calling and they say we're

bidding against each other they want to

get it they'll get it much quicker that

way there are across the country that

don't have the testing supplies they

need what specific actions we deal and

we've made a good thing out of it I

haven't heard that question well but go

ahead yeah so so first we're making

tremendous progress in terms of lab

testing tens of thousands of tests are

being done every single day both through

the CDC and the public health labs as

well as now through the private sector

commercial labs they're getting to scale

they have supplies they have high

throughput we do hear anecdotally

occasionally of say a public health lab

or another one that has a concern about

this supply or that supply through FEMA

we actually are standing up a laboratory

task force to answer those questions

usually it's that the lab people do not

understand that there are actually

alternative supplies in the marketplace

that they are perfectly free to use

we've actually had to put out some

common myths and truths about that for

instance the other day we were getting

calls from governors saying we don't

have swabs there no swabs there no swabs

our supply people went in the open

marketplace and bought 200,000 swabs in

the open market and I just sent a letter

to every governor sending them swabs so

some of it's just they

aren't listening or checking with us

about all the freedom all the capacities

out there it's a complex system with 300

30 million Americans and all of these

labs so sometimes there's a lab that

doesn't understand how much flexibility

they have and how much supply there is

out there and we're working through the

new FEMA integration Center to help

correct that for folks well as I said

more and more tests

is the primary audio circuit for the

Reuters live service

good morning afternoon and evening

you

president head of the task force you've

seen the numbers you've spoken average

Americans or former governor what do you

say to Americans right now we're

watching and we're scared I would say do

not be afraid be vigilant all the

experts tell us that the risk of serious

illness to the average American for the

corona virus is low but we need every

American to put into practice the

president's coronavirus guidelines 15

days to slow the spread because the

corona virus is about three times more

contagious than the flu according to our

best estimate and you can contract the

corona virus have very mild symptoms if

any not even be aware that you have it

and expose someone who is vulnerable to

a very serious health outcome that's the

reason why we're encouraging people to

avoid groups of more than 10 to not eat

in restaurants but to use drive-throughs

to wash their hands on a regular basis

and particularly we're going to continue

as the president has directed us to

focus on the most vulnerable population

which are seniors with serious

underlying health conditions or anyone

with an underlining immunodeficiency

it's those people we need to care for

but it's going to take all of us working

together to make sure they're safe you

just said that you haven't had to

require companies to up their production

of medical supplies but you said last

night you invoke h-tpa

when we need something when we need

something because of the act when we

need something we order something and as

you know two days ago I invoked the Act

which was a big step I'm not sure that

it had been done before certainly not

very much and when we need something we

will use the act what has happened is

before we even go out many many

companies great companies companies in a

totally different business are willing

to do things and make things because

that's what they do they make product

they're willing to make product for us

medical product that we need very badly

for the states that the states can't get

they have

able to get and you know most of the

states in no way did they do anything

wrong they were stocked up they were all

equipped unfortunately they've never had

a thing like this so they need help from

the federal government you haven't

actually directed any companies to start

making more ventilators or masks and

then make it a lot of ventilators and

they make it a lot of best yeah

mr. prisons partially following up on

that our automakers right now who are

retooling their production facilities

tank ventilators or I can't say they are

but they will be very shortly because

we're working with one in particular

that wants to make ventilators they

called us yesterday and they're already

well working on it a transaction they're

gonna make ventilators they say they've

done it before which surprised me but

they can do it very easily partially for

secretary Hayes are you said yesterday

that you'd spoken to Carnival

corporation's chairman yes and he said

that he could donate some shoes that's

still night that's not good not don't

like giving them he's not like you use

them I spoke with Micky Arison who's the

president chairman CEO and owner

potentially he said he said to me that

he was willing to if we need ships if we

need ships for helping people that

carnival would be absolutely willing to

help us in Los Angeles in New York

wherever they may be in Miami where

they're very big if we needed something

they would be willing to so far we

haven't needed to and we're bringing the

big hospital ships up in California we

haven't we're working with the governor

of California as you know with Gavin and

we haven't made a determination we're

also talking the folks would like it in

Seattle so we're we're discussing where

it can be most useful we've spoken with

Governor Cuomo and we're bringing the

big hospital ship up in two weeks and

we're gonna have it in New York Harbor

some place in New Yorker

so my question is one I don't think

you're having taken them up on you yes I

am I said if we didn't let you know

let's go take a second right now we

don't need it ships have a lot of

frequently contacted surfaces and so

this is where you come in secretaries

are potentially dr. pouchy you have

concerns about those youth the Kirsch

it's being uses hospitals I can tell you

they're very clean and also those

surfaces the Germans you know the virus

disappears over a period of time and

these ships are very clean

they've been kept very clean they've

been gone over but the virus as you know

of its own a surface for a certain they

have actually charts different kinds of

surfaces

it disappears over a period of time I

mean is what are you trying to get it

appears the the virus disappears when

it's on surface after a certain number

of days or in some cases hours depending

on the surface so can you say you name

any of the companies that you've asked

to start making these ventilators on

face I will be but first I want to get

the approval from the company because I

don't want to be doing that well I

assume they'd like it but I'll let you

know okay well think and this is for dr.

Falchi I mean one company that has

openly stated it is General Motors I

didn't speak to them about announcing it

but I'll announce that I'm sure they

wouldn't be but we have others also for

dr. pouchy there's new research out from

that the CDC has released that many of

the people that have or that 13% of the

people with the corona virus got it from

someone that was asymptomatic so my

question is does that change the way the

approach that should be taken and you

think that's the same

do you think that or do not the the

recommendations that are here applies to

whether you're in physical contact with

someone who could be infected with

symptoms versus asymptomatic I don't

really think it changes anything

certainly there is some degree of

asymptomatic transmissibility it's still

not quite clear exactly what that is but

when people focus on that I think they

take their eye off the real ball which

is the things you do will mitigate

against getting infected no matter

whether you're near someone who is

asymptomatic or not it's the same thing

physical separation and the care that's

outlined here is gonna take care of both

of those things when will every American

who need to test get a test and then be

able to get a test and why not have

medical equipment being shipped right

now hospitals means you're hearing very

positive things about testing and just

so you understand we don't want every

American to go out and get a test three

hundred and fifty million people we

don't want that we want people that are

system that have a problem that have a

problem with their sneezing this

sniffling they don't feel good they have

a temperature there are a lot of

different things you know you know I'm

better than I do so ready we don't need

that but what we are having is we're

having these private labs have come and

they've been really fantastic and we

also have a great system for the future

because as I said we inherited we

meaning this administration an obsolete

broken system that wasn't meant for

anything like this now we have a system

that you can see because look we're well

into this and nobody's even talking

about it except for you which doesn't

surprise

okay we don't want everybody to go out

and get a test because there's no reason

for it yeah now suggesting that their

real way to get to the end of this for

life to return to normal is for every

single person living in this country to

be tested that way you can see who's

contagious and you can then have people

who don't have it go back to work is

there any possibility that this country

could ever get to a point where every

single person could be tested and how

long would that take it thank you for

the question I've heard that before

I don't see I don't connect the dots

there I don't see how testing everybody

in the country is gonna help you to

implement this this should be

implemented universally at least at this

level for everyone the things we spoke

about a while ago that you want to

really ratchet it up like your governor

Newsom is doing in California like

Governor Cuomo is doing in New York or

how you put an end to this outbreak

testing is important it would be nice to

know and there are certain things you

could do but let's not conflate testing

with the action that we have to take

whether or not you test do this I'm not

I'm not putting down testing as an

important issue but people seem to link

them so much that if you don't have

universal testing you can't respond to

the outbreak you really can but I do

think that's after listening to Tony and

everybody else that's an expert I do

think it's important that not everybody

be tested if you feel great and if you

have no symptoms whatsoever it's it's a

it's just not a good thing to be doing

let's see if you for dr. pouchy

yesterday you mentioned the possibility

of aerosol transmission of the virus how

likely is that

me that oh the possibility of aerosol

transmission always comes up when you

have situations like that it comes up

with influenza it came up with SARS in

which there was a documented you know

one-off episode of some aerosol

transmission aerosol means that it can

stay in the air for a period of time

because it's in a droplet that's very

small and doesn't go down

is it possible and that there is aerosol

transmission

yeah if certainly is but clearly what we

have seen in the situations where people

have gotten infected from the areas that

we have experienced China South Korea

now Europe most of it is in a situation

where people are close enough to each

other that a symptomatic person will

have a real droplet transmission so I'm

not ruling out the possibility that it's

aerosol but again it's not gonna

substantially change doing this is it a

very simple way what is the demand

pressure on testing in this country and

are we meeting if I get the same calls

that many of you get that someone goes

into a place who has a symptom and wants

to get a test and for one reason or

other multiple logistic technical or

what have you they can't get it that is

a reality that is happening now is it

the same as it was a few weeks ago

absolutely not because as the secretary

and others have said right now that we

have the private sector involved the

availability not only just availability

but the implementation of the

availability is getting better and

better and better having said that I

understand and empathize with the people

who rightfully is saying I'm trying to

get a test and I can't so that what

you're saying we are not yet at a point

well the answer is yes John we are not

there yet because otherwise people would

be never calling up saying they can't

get a test

I just can't emphasize enough about the

incredible progress that we have made on

testing all of your reporting and media

outlets around the country are as well

that that many many more tests are being

performed every day literally by the

tens of thousands and this has only been

made possible because several weeks ago

the president brought in the commercial

labs these enormous companies quest and

lab core working with companies like

Roche and in Abbott Laboratories and

thermo Fisher and said we have this

existing system of state laboratories

and the CDC processing tests for certain

infections but given the magnitude of

this outbreak the president had pre hend

it early on that it wouldn't be enough

to meet the need and I just want every

American to know that literally hour by

hour in partnership with these

extraordinary commercial labs we are

making more and more tests available

every day we'll detail the way that

we're working with States to distribute

those tests we've obviously focused on

states that have been dealing with with

the most serious outbreaks of

coronavirus Washington state California

New York and others we've been making

sure the tests are in those areas

working closely with those governors but

I think the American people should be

encouraged at the progress that we are

making tomorrow will take some time to

detail that progress for you but I would

say to any American who might be

concerned that they have symptoms as the

president said so well we we don't want

every healthy American to get a test but

if people feel that they have symptoms

that they identify with the coronavirus

call your doctor

their doctor can call their state health

authorities that can work very closely

with our entire team through HHS and

FEMA and work to identify the more and

more tests that are available every day

just just so you know just

for the hundredth time I this

administration inherited an obsolete

broken old system that wasn't meant for

this we discarded that system and we now

have a new system that can do millions

of people as you need them but we had to

get rid of a broken old system that

didn't work it worked only in a very

limited basis and we're very proud of

what we've done

it's incredible what we've done and this

system will now serve for the future for

future problems hopefully you don't have

a problem like this but something will

come up we have now a great system and

it's almost fully in gear but it's able

to test millions of people but we

inherited a broken old frankly a

terrible system we fixed it and we've

done a great job and we haven't been

given the credit that we deserve that I

can tell you but the one that really

deserves the credit are the American

people because they are doing things

that nobody thought they would do what

they're doing is incredible and we're

making a lot of progress and we'll see

you folks tomorrow thank you very much
