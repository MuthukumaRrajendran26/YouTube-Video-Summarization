the Conservative Party of Canada mr.

Andrew Shearer exactly our next prime

him and determination certainly pay off

and as I said we're gonna have a blue

Labrador ladies and gentlemen please put

mr. engineer

[Applause]

Wow what a warm welcome thank you so

much merci beaucoup say president we see

it's such a great pleasure to be here to

support your candidate and your next

member of parliament Jodi Jodi mentioned

that I am the father of five children

Jill and I are so blessed to have a

three daughters and two sons and a lot

of people asked me what that's like to

have five kids especially to go from you

know four out of five that's a that's a

big family sometimes that gets a bigger

reaction than everything else that they

say about me during the introduction and

there's a very funny comedian a guy

named Jim Gaffigan I've got a lot of

mileage out of the joke that he always

tells cuz he too has five children and

he was once asked what it's like to go

from four children to five children and

the best way he could explain I think

it's very appropriate is he said imagine

yourself drowning and then someone

throws you a baby and that's why having

a fifth child is like I want to take

this opportunity to highlight someone

else who is with us this evening I am so

honored by his present presence it's

great to have our our good friend Chaz

Crosby the leader of the d-plan louder

Progressive Conservative Party

thank you very much for your presence

here this evening and I look forward to

working together with you when I am

Prime Minister of Canada and you are

premier of this wonderful business

fantastic we're gonna have a lot of work

to do we're gonna have a big mess to

clean up

federally you're gonna have a big mess

to clean up provincially but we're both

ready to do it and it will start with

something I can tell you one thing I

hear a lot when I'm in new in

Newfoundland Labrador when I talk to

people here I hear a lot of concern

about the cost of living it's the same

all across the country the cost of

living things are getting more and more

expensive and it's harder and harder to

get by and that is what our entire

campaign theme is all about because this

fundamental question this campaign is

who do you trust to make life more

affordable so that you can get ahead and

when we talk about trust we certainly

can't trust Justin Trudeau would you

agree with me on that ladies ago I

believe a promise he broke his promises

remember in 2015 he looked Canadians in

the eye and he told him that he was

going to be as honest as he possibly

could be we now know how honest he

possibly could be and he said that he

would balance the budget in 2019 instead

we see massive deficits for years and

years and years no end in sight and we

know that the debt that that means the

the debt that he has racked up means

higher interest payments more and more

of your tax dollars going to pay just

the interest on that debt instead of

improving social services or being able

to lower taxes that's why conservatives

we have a plan to balance the budget

over a responsible five year period of

time so we can stop spending money on

the interest on that debt to banks and

bondholders and start putting that to

work for the people of this great

country

we're gonna help make life more

affordable by scrapping the carbon tax

job number one we know it doesn't have

any impact on lowering emissions study

after study shows that emissions are

going up and so are the cost of everyday

essentials like gasoline and home

heating when I talk to people in the

fishing industry they tell me their

number one source of expenses their

number one input cost is fuel and that

carbon tax is making that more and more

expensive we're gonna replace that with

a real plan that focuses on technology

not taxes that takes the climate change

fight global and once and for all

addresses other important environmental

issues like banning the dumping of raw

sewage into our rivers lakes and oceans

that's a real environmental plan ladies

and gentlemen we're gonna recognize that

eating your home in the winter is not a

luxury it's a necessity so we're gonna

take the GST and HSD off of home energy

bills we're gonna put more money in your

pocket with our Universal tax cut that

lowers the first income tax bracket

meaning the average hard-working couple

will save 850 dollars every single year

and today I was very honored to announce

a plan to help our veterans get ahead as

well we know that the men and women who

have served this country that have a

special relationship with our country

with the men and women that they fought

to protect and the government has a

sacred obligation to honor their

commitment and I know that our veterans

remember when Justin Trudeau looked one

of the decorated war heroes in the eye

someone who had worn the uniform proudly

for our country and remember what he

said he said that veterans were asking

for more than he could give right now

that shameful lady's coming

a conservative government will honor

their commitment by enshrining a sacred

obligation between the government and

veterans to make sure they get to help

the need and that the government works

for them not the other way around

so we're only we're not even a quarter

of the way through this campaign and

we've already announced concrete

measures to help make life more

affordable to help people get ahead news

have all announced a book would easy day

for a me of a lakota tiempo - they cut

and yang kennedy a we've got a long way

to go but we've got great candidates

like Jodie who are going door-to-door

community to community to get that

positive message to everyone now in the

last election in the last election we

didn't do too well in Atlantic Canada

the Liberals went 32 for 32 but what I

hear every time I come back to

Newfoundland and Labrador every time I

travel all across Atlanta Canada I hear

from people that they feel that the

people of Atlantic Canada have gone over

32 since the last election and they're

ready for change they're ready for

strong representatives that stand up for

them that represent their writings to

Ottawa not Ottawa to their writings

every single Liberal Member of

Parliament voted against pipelines

bringing Western Canadian energy to

eastern Canadian markets every single

Liberal Member of Parliament voted in

favor of tax hikes on small businesses

every single Liberal Member of

Parliament stood idly by well Justin

Trudeau appointed a Minister for a koa

who comes from Toronto as Prime Minister

I will appoint the minister responsible

for the Atlantic Canadian opportunities

agency who actually comes from Atlantic

Canada

so that's the choice ladies and

gentlemen we're Justin Trudeau will

break his promise and lie to Canadians I

will restore integrity and ethics to our

government and shine a light on his

corruption where he will be bullied and

pushed around on the world stage I will

represent Canadians and Canada with

strength and professionalism and where

he will run massive deficits raise your

taxes and make life more expensive we

will return to balanced budgets so we

can put more money in your pocket

because it's time for you to get ahead

so I'm asking all of you here tonight to

give everything you've got to Joey he's

a great candidate I know he's been

working hard for a long time already an

election night starts a little bit early

in Newfoundland and Labrador you've got

that extra half hour on us and we're

gonna know what kind of night we have

when we see those early results coming

in from Atlantic Canada I know I know

that we're gonna turn Atlantic Canada

blue we're gonna win seats here in

Newfoundland and Labrador we're gonna

get strong members of parliament like

Jodie elected and all of us working

together all across this country we can

and we will make sure that Justin

Trudeau is a one-term Prime Minister
