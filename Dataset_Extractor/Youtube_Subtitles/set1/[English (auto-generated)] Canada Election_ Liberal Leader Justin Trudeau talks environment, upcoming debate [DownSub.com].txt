good morning everyone it's great to be

here at the beautiful Frank conservation

area with Mike Bossy Oh weather Mike is

leading a 15 year fight to protect this

community's drinking water we're working

on stronger environmental rules to keep

our air clean

he's the advocate you deserve standing

up for you and that's what this election

is all about the kind of tomorrow we

want to build together

I've just had a chance to help out this

in tree planting here at the

Conservation Area with two of my kids

not only is it great to be outdoors but

it's a good reminder that we can't take

these spaces for granted if we want all

of our kids to be able to hike in our

forests and smile and swim in our lakes

we have to step up and make sure that

that happens so since 2015 we have

worked long and hard to build a real

plan for the environment and for the

economy for putting a price on pollution

to banning single-use plastics we're

making progress

we know there's lots more work to do my

friends we're ready to keep moving

forward there's no depth big polluters

need to reduce emissions but there are

also things that each of us can help do

and using the power of nature is one of

them last week we announced that a

reelected liberal government will plant

two billion trees over the next decade

just like the trees we planted today

they're going to pull carbon emissions

out of the atmosphere to provide clean

air not just for us and our kids but for

our grandkids and their kids as part of

this commitment we will invest three

billion dollars for natural climate

solutions to conserve serve and restore

everything from wetlands to agricultural

land our plan will mean more jobs in

this case around 3,500 new positions and

less pollution because we know we can

fight climate change and grow the

economy we have this country's first and

only serious plan to fight

climate change and the Conservatives

Landrieu sheer promise that the very

first thing they would do is tear up

that plan and cost Canadians money in

the process

conservative politicians have no plan to

reduce emissions no plan for jobs and no

plan for our future you already know

that here Ontario people have seen Doug

Ford trying to axe tree planting

programs for Anning seasonal jobs at

risk and leaving tree growers in a lurch

hard-working families shouldn't pay the

price for his irresponsible choice so we

stepped in with 15 million dollars to

keep the program going

but this short-sighted decision by the

conservative government is just another

example of how politicians who promise

to be for the people turn around and cut

services the families rely on actions

speak louder than words

liberals won't be rewarding big

polluters and the wealthiest 1% with a

whopping tax cut and the Conservatives

will and now Andrew Shearer wants

Canadians to double down on conservative

politicians Olivia oh nabisco buddies

you have a choice to make

do you want a government with a serious

plan to make life more affordable and

fight climate change or do you want one

that will give the wealthiest 1% a tax

cut and the thinks denial is a plan for

the environment

that's the choice it's that clear and

it's that important I'm moving forward

with everyone yes

[Applause]

I'm pleased to be here with my Posse Oh

who has been a strong member of our

rural caucus in Ottawa over the past

four years delivering for people right

across rural Canada we know that we move

forward and if we move forward with a

Minister for rural economic development

firm and Bernadette Jordan

to make sure that rural Canadians have a

seat at the table and see exactly what

investments we've been making from

infrastructure like highways and

floodplains and flood mitigation

measures to investments in broadband and

the kinds of future that we know that

people in remote northern and rural

communities need we are going to

continue to be there for them what we've

seen is consistently Conservative

government's over the over the years

cut flood mitigation and water

protection the Conservatives cut the

Prairie farm rehabilitation agency they

have consistently not supported our

farmers and we have done exactly that

whether it was securing free trade deals

that give better access to farmers in

Canada for example to our cattle farmers

to the Japanese market than the

Americans have whether it's been

protecting supply management in the

renegotiation of the North American Free

Trade Agreement against a Trump

government that stated from the

beginning they wanted to get rid of

Canada's Supply Management we have

consistently stood up for rural

Canadians and we will continue and the

choice facing rural Canadians is do we

keep moving

or with a responsible plan for the

future or do we accept a government

whose first act is going to be to tear

up the only serious plan any Canadian

government has ever had to fight climate

change again we have extraordinary rural

and peace like Mike Bossy Oh like

Bernadette Jordan like people right

across the country who continually step

up to defend the interests of rural

Canadians and build a better future for

farmers northerners and people living in

remote locations we will consistently

make sure that we are fighting for all

Canadians and Canadians know that from

coast to coast to coast the choice is

clear do we move forward with the

government who will rip up the only

climate change plan that is working any

government has ever put forward or do we

keep moving forward with investments not

austerity in cuts one of your candidates

in Atlantic Canada has apologized for

their offensive comments on social media

at the same time that conservatives

kicked out a candidate for their

offensive comments - and Jimmy notices

case an apology is enough mr. batiste

took responsibility for his actions and

apologized do you feel that you're

limited in the action you're able to

take

candidates because of your own history

live like this we recognized that Jamie

batiste

Jaime Batista took responsibility for

his epaulet various actions and has

apologized mr. batiste

pre responsibility versus actual is it

exclusive affordable bunch of high in

because their songs equals a new

you're openly she / young so I care is

your poem because no cement not always

keep on fuzzy understand okay we will

always defend both official languages

everywhere across this country that's

something the Canadians expect of a

Liberal government and that's what we

will do we recognize that the provincial

government in Quebec will have questions

to answer on how they would move forward

on such legislation we are we are

curious to see how they do that as well

describe your process over the next day

on preparing for the leaders to be

also what did you not accomplish in the

French debate last me want to drive home

I think the the debates all debates are

an opportunity to talk directly with

Canadians about the choice they're

facing we are a government that has put

the first real plan to fight climate

change in Canada's history in place and

our primary opponent Andrew Shearer has

promised that the first thing he would

do is tear up that kind of plan we are

going to be moving forward with

continuing to invest in the middle class

and people are working hard to join it

and what we've seen a vendor who shares

platform because he won't release his

full platform choosing to keep it secret

the way Douglas Ford did what we've seen

his platform gives tax breaks to the

wealthiest his use universal tax credit

gives more money to someone making

$400,000 a year than someone making

$40,000 a year and he's planning to give

a tax break larger than the average

person makes in a year for people who

are using private corporations to hide

in to protect their income we have

committed to Canadians time and time

again that we will continue to lower

taxes for the middle class and those

working hard to join it we know that by

investing in Canadians we help grow the

economy conservatives don't understand

that and continue to push cuts and

austerity as the way forward so over the

coming day I will be reflecting on the

best way to connect these messages these

truths with Canadians on the things that

matter so deeply with them how we have a

real plan to fight climate change how we

will continue to invest in Canadians who

need it and not give tax breaks to the

wealthiest and a range of other things

like the fact that we're the ones who

are going to strengthen gun control

while conservatives want to weaken gun

in control

I will say however it will be excellent

to be on stage with the only woman

out there Elizabeth May she was missed

in the TV debates I think it was

important to have my daughter see women

leaders as well as all the men who will

be on there should be a operative on

Donnie portion Deepa

they were unacceptable and I am pleased

to mr. Bookman batiste apologized

unreservedly I would like to ask you

would you lower the voting age sixty

well I've been the Liberal Party she was

critic for most of my political career I

have been on top of being Prime Minister

I've been minister for youth in our

government over the past four years I've

had many many conversations with young

people about how to better get them

involved in politics but I can say that

lowering the voting age is not part of

our platform is not part of our plan so

we will don't do it but I can talk about

what's in our platform because we have

released our full platform and for sheer

is keeping his full platform and it's

costing a secret yo who else did that

Doug Ford he kept it secret from

Canadians and then turned around and cut

health care cut education cut services

for people who need it cut autism

programs cut Franco a franco-ontarian

supports this is exactly what

conservatives do and that is why this

election is such an important choice for

Ontarians and for all Canadians you

might find yourself in the position

there is a strong history in Canada of

minority governments there is no history

of coalition governments in in Canada

and on October 21st I am focused on

continuing to deliver a plan that has

worked for Canadians over the past four

years not only have we put forward the

strongest plan to fight climate change

in Canada's history recognizing there is

much more to do and we will do it like

planting two billion trees like we've

talked about this year but we managed to

see Canadians create over a million jobs

full-time over the past four years as

well as lifted 900,000 Canadians out of

poverty including 300,000 kids our plan

to invest in Canadians and fight climate

change and keep people safer by

increasing gun control is working for

Canadians and I know that's the choice

the Canadians are going to take on

October 21st so what would be your plan

internationally to action against in the

very first weeks of our government in

2015 we went to the Paris conference

where Canada played a key role in

ensuring that the Paris agreement became

a reality we will continue to step up at

home with the knitted initiatives like a

price on pollution like banning

single-use plastics like phasing out

coal plants which I know is something

Germany still needs to do a lot of work

on we recognize however there is much

more to do both at home and

internationally that's why we've been

involved in building climate resilient

infrastructure and climate investments

in countries around the world are

fighting climate change but we're going

to do much more at home as well

including cutting corporate taxes in

half for any company involved in

developing zero emission technologies

because we're committing to reach zero

emissions net zero by 2050 on top of

meeting and surpassing our 2030 targets

we're going to be giving money up front

in font form of interest-free loans so

homeowners can retrofit and renovate

their homes we're going to be protecting

25 percent of our oceans 25% of our

landmass by 2025 and on our way to 30 by

30 these are the kinds of commitments on

top of planting two billion trees the

Canadians expect from a government with

a real plan to fight climate change and

the first thing to conserve

are going to do is rip up the only real

plan to fight climate change that any

Canadian government has ever had morning

I'm sure no Teresa right from the

Canadian Press four years ago not far

from here in Belleville you made

promises about improving services for

veterans and but we still see huge

backlogs of veterans looking for

services and a lot of them say they

don't trust you any more than they trust

the Conservatives I know that in your

platform you've made promises about

mental health for our veterans but what

would you do at the operational level at

Veterans Affairs to try to make sure

that you know to get veterans off

waiting lists or what are you waiting on

holding the phone I remember well that

event in Belleville four years ago where

we promised to stop the nickel and

diming that conservatives had

consistently done to our veterans they

closed the knowing nine veterans service

centers across the country one of the

first things we did was reopened and

then we invested in our veterans close

to ten billion dollars of new

investments to support veterans with

better options better supports better

supports for their families as well

better men mental health supports better

trenches transition supports these are

the things that we know we needed to do

and we have done them but we recognize

there's always much more to do that's

why in our platform right now we

continue to propose more investments in

our seniors particularly around mental

health we also recognize the charges

facing military families when they get

called on to move from one base to

another as so many of them do throughout

the course of their lives deployed in

different places means they need extra

supports for their families for their

spouses to be able to look forward and

that's exactly what we're going to do we

have recognized that people who serve

this country deserve to be supported and

cared for by their government we have

done exactly that

when we recognize we will always

continue to do

even more on Friday you're the federal

government that filed the judicial

review of the indigent or the can a

Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decision

on indigenous child welfare in the

actual application self the argument is

made that the tribunal erred in its

decision particularly in the monetary

compensation can you please talk about

what you think the error is there we

know people were harmed and we fully

agree with the tribunal on the need to

compensate people and that will be our

priority if we form the next government

we agree there is a need for confident

compensation and we will work to ensure

that everyone is properly compensated no

at least two candidates in this region

between the liberals and conservatives

and given the last election one of those

Hastings legs and Addington and North

other located or self this is a you

that those seats will remain this is not

the first time over the past four years

I've been back in this riding the

opportunity I've had every time I've

been here with Mike I've been in the Bay

of Quinte area in Prince Edward County

I've heard directly from people who have

benefited from the choices we've made as

a government from the investments in

families from the Canada child benefit

to the increase in the guaranteed income

supplement who are most vulnerable

single seniors people have benefited

from the greater access to international

markets for our farmers because of the

trade deals that we signed we're now the

only g7 country with a free trade deal

with every other g7 country and Mike and

Neil were part of the government that

did that we have demonstrated over the

past four years how hard we are working

for rural Canadians for farmers for

people right from coast to coast to

coast and we will continue to do that

and we get to go see Canadians with

these proof points of how hard Mike

Bossy oh and Neil Ellis and others have

worked right across the country to

deliver for citizens and to be that

strong voice for rural Canadians in

Ottawa and I'm very excited because the

choice is so clear for Canadians right

across the country do we go back to the

Harper and Doug forward approach cuts of

tax breaks to the wealthiest end up

ripping up the only strong environment

plan to fight climate change that Canada

has ever had or do we continue to move

forward by investing in people by

supporting our farmers by fighting

climate change by building a better

future for our kids and grandkids I know

that here across rural Canada and indeed

across

the choice couldn't be clearer and I am

very confident in Canadians mess of

eternal thank you all so much

[Applause]
