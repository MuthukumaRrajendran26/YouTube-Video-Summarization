by way of update so on the evening of

Monday February 24th a woman in her 60s

presented at Sunnybrook Health Sciences

Center x' emergency department as I've

stated before you know it's not

surprising to learn of this news as we

have have a very mobile population with

a lot of international travel so it's

quite likely that we will continue to

see more people presenting with symptoms

and a travel history to affected areas

in the world

this newly diagnosed person has a recent

history of travel to Iran and she became

unwell after arriving in Toronto at that

time her symptoms included a cough sore

throat body aches and occasional fever

so upon presenting to the Hospital's

emergency department a thorough medical

assessment was completed and kovat 19

testing was initiated

she was then discharged and is presently

at home in self isolation two members of

this individuals family are also in

self-isolation currently in self

isolation at home so I can tell you that

at this time Toronto Public Health staff

are following up with this person and

their close contacts as you know and as

we spoken in the past we do this to

monitor the person's symptoms and we do

our contact management in order to

notify others that they may have been

exposed to a potential health risk we do

this in order to protect population

health to prevent the spread of

infectious diseases in our community and

to ensure that those who have an

infection are well taken care of and

well managed at this time the virus is

not circulating locally however we do

know that there is some global activity

happening and global transmission so

with this in mind

we are actively working with our city

partners our our provincial partners and

other health partners to plan for the

potential for local spread we are

continuing to carefully monitor the

situation and I think at this time it's

very important that residents of Toronto

and I would argue beyond should stay

informed by regularly reviewing and

accessing credible sources of

information I can't emphasize enough as

I have in the past but the best things

that people can do our current advice

continues to be around all the usual

good practices in cold and flu season

things like washing your hands or using

an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if

hand-washing facilities are not

available trying not to touch one's face

with one's hands covering your cough or

sneeze ideally with a tissue or using

your elbow or sleeve if a tissue isn't

available and of course staying home if

you're sick

it with respect to staying updated I

will tell you that at Toronto Public

Health we are continually updating our

website at at all times as new

information comes in Toronto GA /

coronavirus is the place to look for

information and to stay informed in

respect of what is happening we also as

I've said before are running a hotline

at four one six three three eight seven

six zero zero and that hotline is

available Monday to Friday from 8:30 in

the morning to 8 o'clock at night and on

the weekends Saturday and Sunday from 10

to 6 so that people can ask their

questions and have them addressed in an

informed and credible manner so with

that I'm going to turn it back to dr.

Williams and we'll take questions

thereafter okay well thank you and on

the updates I'm not going to read out

all the numbers because you have access

to those there on the global picture

more the interesting points in that is

that we've seen with the numbers in

China where they

large numbers the only one up a little

bit a couple thousand so that number is

slowing down so that's encouraging we

continue to see signs of that aspect in

China both in Hawaii and throughout

abating but early we're still monitoring

still watching on our scientists from

Health Canada or from FAC is they're

reviewing the situation monitoring a

number of questions and issues on that

regard and keeping us informed as to

what they have learned what they're

learning as they do more other I would

say clearing up and doing residual

aspects related to their issues in China

out of that of course you've seen some

other countries that are moving up

fairly quickly such as Italy and South

Korea as they've dealt with the impact

of the virus and their jurisdictions as

they seek to understand that know in

with cases but with gas as well with

that in mind the special Advisory

Committee of our federal provincial

territorial group have we've looked at

it and we decided we've been changed our

countries of interest and concerns so

we've updated it so that those now

include seven places which is China

still and in Japan Hong Kong Italy Iran

a Singapore and South Korea so we're

doing that and we will continue to do

that as we see new areas or hotspots of

concern that we would want to have as

part of our investigation of any people

who would be of interest to investigate

and put on our list of people under

investigation much like the case that

Toronto is dealing with at this time now

so that's part of the dynamic process as

we undertake to do that as far as our

ontero numbers we continue to have a

number of tests submitted each day in

there and we've done over 629 samples of

which 610 are negative 14 are pending

and we now have the confirmed positive

presumptive are still working something

to lab terminology but in the future we

hope to be able to say that our pauses

at Public Health Laboratory do not need

to be confirmed with nml but we're just

trying to get the timing of that right

and the terminology correct so we have

the two the one we talked about earlier

in the week and the new one that we're

talking about today and we have our

three resolve cases in that line there

so other good news is that Trenton

cohort two were released yesterday and

so that's good news and all those even

though the number we're testing the

different islands for various signs the

symptoms of respiratory issues all

negative and the same thing is that our

nav can center now which is moving along

they have all continue to be negative

and we continue to monitor their

situation as that process completes its

phases in there as well so that's good

news in that regard in that so overall

what we're doing now as I say we're into

this aspect I took about the 3rd 14 week

period as we see these other sites

coming about assessing which ones are of

concern what is the status and WH OHS

perspective on how well they are

undertaking doing their own

investigations much like we had

questions with China and their data and

information how does that inform us and

we get informed that informs Toronto

Public Health as we share back and forth

and be consistent in how we respond

across Canada we've heard aspects around

the chief Public Health Officer of

Canada saying we have to be continued

prepared for the pandemic type aspect we

have been preparing since day one that's

part of our pandemic response we always

open it up we always start to deal with

it we ramp up and we ramp down we don't

just turn it on and off so this is

another phase of our response as we do

that and what's the next things we're

going to be adding and we hope to be

updating you on that as we continue to

prepare and be prepared as part of our

process which we've done before

whether it's Ebola h1n1 and learn from

those lessons of SARS in the past our

risk still to Ontarians is low and we're

still in the containment aspect of that

aspect and if the overall management of

a pandemic and so we will continue to

proceed on that basis and we'll be

waiting for more further investigations

from Toronto Public Health and inform us

in that regard and monitor that so

that's our situation
