so I was just saying so this morning

when I talked to you the situation is

that we have 250 Canadians which have

registered on the website of Global

Affairs Canada which are in the province

of the 250 we have 126 which have

requested consular assistance for for

our assistance obviously and so we're

looking now at contacting them as we

appreciate it's the middle of the night

in China we are in contact with them or

trying to contact anyone assess their

specific need for assisted repatriation

we're at the same time consulting with

their allies and and looking at the

different options that people are

considering also in contact with the

Chinese authority but as I appreciate

because it's the middle of the night

this is the details I have for now we're

looking at all options to assist them

that's our priority but we'll come back

to you when I have more at this point of

time this is the information so what I

was saying is that as we said this

morning the latest number that I have

because I think Canadians watching us

should understand it's a dynamic

situation and we encourage Canadians to

register on the website because that's

the best way for us to inform them as

quickly as possible about recent

developments so what we have now

of the 250 Canadians who have registered

hundred 26 have signified their wish for

assisted repatriation because it's the

middle of the night we're trying to

contact them we want to assess their

each individual needs we're looking also

at options with different nations as you

know different nations are looking at

how they can repatriate these people

back to their countries

that's the consultation we're doing

right now we're looking at all options

to provide the best consular service we

can and we'll come back to you as soon

as I have more details because you

appreciate we just finished cabinet we

have that I need to go back make sure

that I have the latest information so

that we can come back to you in third

quarter are you talking about sending a

plane or hit units

so maybe I can take that that question

quite frankly we don't know yet what the

situation of those individuals are as

Minister champagne has indicated that's

part of the process to reach into to

speak with the individuals to find out

what kinds of situations are in what

their needs are and you know an SS and

SS from that space of what kinds of help

we could provide I will also say that

part of the risk to travel to that area

is not necessarily about contracting the

coronavirus but really quite frankly the

strict quarantine that the entire region

is under so for example people that are

visiting to that region or travelling in

that region may be having a hard time

accessing supplies that they need they

may be having a hard time getting around

the community they may be having a hard

time moving from one region to another

they may have family in other areas that

are isolated so this is the work that he

will be doing with his team to assess

exactly what kinds of supports the

Canadians that are reaching out to us

needs right so first of all I spoke with

Minister dick earlier my counterpart in

British Columbia and reviewed the case

with him it had the case of similar to

Ontario when the person traveled from

Wuhan he had no symptoms when he arrived

home he began to feel ill and he reached

out to his health care provider but

given that he had undergone all of the

information at the airport and knew what

to do he also advised his health care

provider that he had recently visited

Wuhan which allowed the infectious

disease protocol to be placed in the

clinic that he visited and now he's

under isolation and observed in being

observed for further worsening of his

condition the lab the national lab has

not confirmed the the case yet but we

are very confident at BCS

do you know yet if they were if he was

on my understanding it's a different

flight I will I will also say to answer

the question about quarantine and

isolation I spoke about this earlier but

I do want to be very clear that

quarantine is only appropriate when

people are asymptomatic and right now

there is no evidence that this disease

is spread when people do not have

symptoms so isolation is a situation

that occurs when people have the

symptoms and he is isolated
