continue work incredibly hard for you to

work with you to work for you thank you

I got to tell you I've met throughout

this campaign some incredible people

some inspirational people and I'm

inspired by them their stories have

stuck with me I've met these folks

across the country folks that that

inspire the work that we do as New

Democrats and one of those people as a

young man a young boy barely 10 years

old who lives with a chronic illness and

told me that he wasn't worried about the

chronic illness wasn't worried about the

medication and the injections wasn't

worried about the fact that if he didn't

stay open on top of his medication or

his blood work he might he might die he

told me he wasn't worried about any of

that he was just worried that his

medication was costing a lot to his mom

and dad he worried about being a burden

to his family

I remember that young the young man I

remember that young man and the fact

that someone as young as that felt like

he was a burden in a country as rich as

ours and that's a part of the reason why

we're fighting we're fighting for that

young man

I also want to talk about grassy narrows

a community a community that represents

the injustice historically and ongoing

that indigenous people continue to face

the people of grassy narrows who are so

resilient in the face of neglect and

negligence and being ignored being told

they don't matter being ridiculed

we brought the national campaign to

grassy narrows to let them know that

they do matter

[Applause]

and that indigenous reconciliation is

sometimes as simple as basic respect and

dignity for the first people this land

and that means clean drinking water that

means that means not taking indigenous

kids to courts that means equal funding

for child welfare for education and

quality homes

campaign I've heard a lot of stories

about Canadians from Canadians who are

struggling and just want to build a good

life but are finding it harder and

harder to do so and to those Canadians I

want to say to you this tonight New

Democrats are going to Ottawa to fight

for you

[Applause]

and friends in the days ahead I'll be

meeting my new caucus and we're gonna

sit together and talk and discuss about

how we can deliver for the people of

this country because the real winner of

this election is not a party or a leader

the real winner of any election should

always be the people and that means

Canadians the Canadians in Canadian

sense a pretty clear message a clear

message tonight that they want a

government that works for them not for

the rich and the powerful not for the

well-connected

[Applause]

and if and if exactly exactly and if all

empties you're right I'm sorry well

we'll talk about that well talk I'm

sorry about that

and and if all MPs elected tonight hear

that message and act on that message

then the real winners of this election

will be the people

[Applause]

so I want to let you know New Democrats

are going to work hard to deliver the

following results we're gonna work hard

to make sure young people have a future

with that's filled with hope we want

that's right we want young people to be

filled with hope we want to make sure

that Canada is a leader in the global

fight against a climate crisis

[Applause]

we want we want families to have a more

affordable life and we want a Canada

that's a nation that takes

reconciliation seriously

and and you know this with New Democrats

for us reconciliation is more than just

a word it requires real action real

action so so here's what New Democrats

are going to seek to do when we work

with other parties to achieve these are

our commitments these are the things

that we want to continue to fight for if

you need medication in our country we

want to make sure you use your health

card not your credit card

[Music]

[Applause]

that means a national publicly delivered

single-payer Pharma care for all

[Applause]

we want to help Canadians be able to get

a home that they can afford and what we

mean by making life a more affordable is

not a tax cut for the richest Canadians

but tackling student debt by waiving all

interest on student loans

[Applause]

what that means that means taking on the

big telecom companies and putting a cap

on cell phone bills real and urgent

action to fight the climate crisis which

includes ending fossil fuel subsidies

and reinvesting in clean renewable

energy and to make sure absolutely we've

got an investment housing we're gonna do

that we're gonna do that and we're also

gonna make sure we're gonna make sure

we're gonna do something that no one

else is ready to say but we're proud to

say we're gonna say it again and again

because we're gonna get it done we're

gonna make sure that the super-wealthy

start paying their fair share

[Applause]

we're on it

[Applause]

[Applause]

that's exactly what we're gonna do

[Applause]

my friends that's exactly what we're

gonna do these these are the priorities

of people these are the priorities of

people that New Democrats will put at

the heart of the conversations that

we're going to have in the days and

weeks to come and if and if the other

parties work with us

we have an incredible opportunity to

make the lies of all Canadians so much

better and even even I've we haven't

have an opportunity to even change the

way we do politics in this country I

want to talk to the many Canadians that

rejected the call to vote out of fear

and thank them for voting for hope

[Applause]

and if if any elections show the

importance of this issue this election

showed it with electoral reform we can

make sure

[Applause]

with electoral reform we can make sure

that every election from now on is one

where people don't have to vote against

something they can vote for something

[Applause]

throughout throughout this throughout

this campaign I've met with a lot of

young people young people that came up

to me and told me how much this campaign

meant to them how much it made them feel

like they belong kids came up to me and

told me that now seeing this campaign

they feel like they could do anything

and that's been an inspiration

[Applause]

while people might talk about the

divisions in our country what I've seen

is that across this country we share so

much in common we share so many values

we want to take care of one another

that's what it means to be Canadian so -

so to everyone that I've met everyone

that's welcomed me and my team it's your

community into your home I want to give

you a big hug and say thank you so

tomorrow morning we're gonna get down to

work I can't wait to speak to some of

our incredible new MPs our job is clear

New Democrats have been given a critical

role you've given us a job to go to

Ottawa and make sure that Ottawa does

not continue to serve the interests of

those wealthiest corporations at the

very top but make sure we serve the

people Canadians

[Applause]

we're never gonna forget your voices

we're never gonna forget your voices

we're gonna work for you

[Applause]

we're gonna work hard to get good things

[Applause]

thank you I think you got a knew where I

was headed on this one I'm gonna I'm

still gonna say it though but thank you

I've said this from day one in this

campaign I don't work for the rich and

powerful corporations I don't work for

those at the very top I work for all of

you

[Applause]

past have chosen to work for those

powerful corporations at the top the

richest Canadians they've chosen those

at the top I will always choose you
