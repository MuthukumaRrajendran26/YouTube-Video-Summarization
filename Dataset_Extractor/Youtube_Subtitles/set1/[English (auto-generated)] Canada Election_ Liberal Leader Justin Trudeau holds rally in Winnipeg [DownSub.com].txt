Thank You doc

hello Winnipeg how we doing today I

gotta say I know it's been a tough week

for Manitobans but as always you pulled

together even though people have lost

power people had to get evacuated you

lean on each other you supported each

other because that's just what

Winnipeggers and Manitobans do thank you

for demonstrating that I got a start

tonight by saying thank you thank you to

all of you for the incredible work

you've been doing these past weeks and

months getting out there knocking doors

making phone calls connecting with

neighbors and demonstrating that we are

totally focused on earning every vote as

we move forward in the right direction

for Canada make um Doug edgy some of my

men in the home mo just gone through

miss Kay's dead TC epic vu that fencer

man I've only leaks you it really brings

it back to that last weekend before the

election when we were here not far from

here in Winnipeg in a similar rally

talking about the big choice Canadians

need to make on Monday and that's what

we did we pulled together we focused on

investing in Canadians because we had

had enough of ten years of Stephen

Harper's cuts Stephen Harper's doing

nothing on climate change Stephen

Harper's lack of ambition for our

country so we chose a different

direction we chose to invest instead in

families in communities in helping each

other and you know what over the past

four years we showed that it works we

[Applause]

we were able to create the kind of

economic growth that Stephen Harper

wasn't able to seek as he kept believing

in cuts cuts cuts and tax breaks for the

wealthiest instead we invested in

families and families turned around and

Canadians created almost 1.2 million new

jobs

most of them full-time we have the

lowest unemployment in 40 years and we

did that because we invested in

opportunities for Canadians and because

we were able to lift 900,000 people out

of poverty we also took seriously the

responsibility to build a pan-canadian

climate change plan and that's exactly

what we did it is no longer free to

pollute anywhere across the country and

families get more money back because of

our climate incentives we demonstrated

what can happen when an ambitious

government rolls up its sleeves and gets

to work with and for Canadians we did

big things over these past four years

and one of the big ones is of course

moving forward meaningfully on

reconciliation with indigenous peoples

I want to recognize that we of course

know there is so much more to do but the

work we've done here in Manitoba with

the Meiji nation across the country with

First Nations has been significant steps

forward we've eliminated 87 long-term

boil water advisories and are on track

to getting rid of all of them we are

moving forward on investing in schools

in health centers and we're doing it all

in a way that is grounded in respect and

partnership because that's what

indigenous Canadians deserve from their

government we've continued to move

forward on protecting Canadians

protecting minorities standing up for

women's rights standing up for the LGBT

community because we know defending

Canadians rights is just what we do as

Canadians but now we're in 2019 and

Andrew Shearer wants to bring forward a

plan that is

well I mean you think about it and you

sort of understand why he waited so long

before sharing his platform he waited

until late in the campaign after the

debates until the Friday night of a long

weekend when he was hoping nobody would

notice that the only three things in his

platform were tots tots tots shame on

him oh oh wait wait that's not entirely

fair because there were a few tax breaks

for the wealthiest and there do you know

you could always count on conservatives

for that but more than that fifty three

billion dollars worth of cuts to

services to programs the Canadians have

learned to rely on and he has promised

that his very first day as Prime

Minister

he would rip up the only real plan to

fight climate change the Canada has ever

had

you know and I know that we need to

protect our environment and fight

climate change that it's not a choice

between growing the economy and

protecting the environment

indeed you cannot in 2019 have a plan

for the future of our economy and not

have a plan for protecting the

environment that's what they don't

understand so we have a choice

come Monday do we continue to move

forward with a progressive ambitious

Liberal government or do we go back to

conservative cuts but you'll understand

that in fighting for the environment

conservatives just don't get it but it's

not just Andrew Shearer it's

conservative premiers right across the

country who are fighting it using your

taxpayer dollars in court they are

fighting the future for our kids when

they fight against the fight against

climate change we know we need to do

more and that's exactly what we are

planning to do that's why we need a

strong federal government to stand up to

those premiers to stand out to the

Conservatives who want to do anything

and I know we can count on Winnipeggers

and Manitobans for that

government is the one that looks at an

elderly widow who just lost her partner

of 50 years who is grieving who's trying

to figure out how to move forward how to

continue and realizes that the pension

she gets is about to be slashed as well

a progressive government looks at that

and says we will help you we will give

you the help you need

that's what a progressive government

does a progressive government looks at

our students are young people who know

that you need to get a good education if

you're going to get a good job but are

reeling from the high cost of tuition

and the challenges around student loans

and you know what a progressive

government proposes that you won't have

to start paying back your student loans

until you're making at least $35,000 a

year

on top of more grants and more help for

families and we look at families who are

increasingly challenged to make ends

meet who want to give every opportunity

to their kids to grow up healthy and

strong with the kinds of experiences and

activities that matter so much to kids

growing up and we gave them the Canada

child benefit and we increased the

Canada child benefit and on top of that

we've decided that because it is so

expensive in that first year of life

that we will be raising by 15%

the Canada child benefit for the first

year of life yes for you Little Miss

that's right you and the moose Santa

t-shirt you get that we know that a

progressive government understands that

the greatest challenge of our time is

the fight against climate change and

that is what we are going to do more of

over the past four years we put in place

the most ambitious and concrete climate

plan Canada has ever had we put a price

on pollution right across the country we

built a world-class oceans protection

plan when we came into office only 1% of

our coasts and oceans were protected and

we said we're gonna get to twenty to ten

percent in five years and I have to say

we didn't quite do that we got to 14

percent in four years but we need to do

so much more we need to get to twenty

five percent by 2025 of our oceans and

coasts and our lands we need to move

forward on meeting and surpassing our

2030 targets and getting to net zero by

2050

we need to continue to invest in clean

energy in that transition in making sure

that there are good jobs for kids and

grandkids in the coming years as we

embrace the new economy as we embrace

next Xero technologies this is what we

need to do and Canadians get it hundreds

of thousands of young Canadians marching

in the streets over these past weeks to

send that clear message that our future

is at risk right now and for me it all

sort of came to a head this morning when

I heard a story from a fellow who

admitted that he'd always voted

conservative he was a small business

owner he just voted for fiscal

conservative his whole life and yet this

election something changed and what

changed was he looked at his 13 year old

daughter and he decided that he needed

to give her his vote because this

election more than just about any other

election is about her future and in

order to vote for her future he needed

to vote for climate change and he needed

to vote liberal for the very first time

because this election isn't just about

the next four years it's about the next

40 years and whether we are going to

step up and build a better future for

everyone for indigenous Canadians for

young families for seniors for students

build stronger communities invest in

infrastructure defend people's rights

these are the things that Canadians

count on and this is the choice that

we're talking about when we tell people

to choose forward

and this election is a time for all of

us to pull together and reflect and two

days from now we need to do everything

we can to make sure we get everyone out

to vote we've got to fight our way

through these next two days to get

people mobilized to get them to

understand what is at stake either

moving back to Harper times once again

or moving forward

[Applause]

and you know one of the things we keep

hearing is Andrew Shearer trying to make

things up to hide his cuts trying to

attack and trying to tell people that

this election is about me this election

isn't about me this election is about

you this election is about Canadians so

get out there go knock doors talk to

your neighbors

talk to your friends make sure that

everyone shows up to vote for a better

future on Monday and together let's

choose forward let's see the moon
