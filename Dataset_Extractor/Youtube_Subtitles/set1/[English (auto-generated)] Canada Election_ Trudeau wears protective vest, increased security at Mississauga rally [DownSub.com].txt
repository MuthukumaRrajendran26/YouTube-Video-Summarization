the liberal campaign is not commenting

on the increased security that was

clearly present at a rally in

Mississauga Ontario but as you can see

Justin Trudeau was surrounded by more

security than usual with heavily armed

police officers in green wearing

backpacks with rifles standing close by

as he addressed the crowd he doesn't

usually have that level of security so

close at hand at rallies a protective

vest could also be seen under Trudeau's

shirt Trudeau doesn't normally wear a

suit jacket at rallies like these

sticking to shirt sleeves his speech was

delayed by nearly 90 minutes other

liberal candidates speaking before him

admitted they were stalling for time but

gave no explanation leaving some in the

2000 member crowd to leave early saying

they had to wait too long Trudeau was

also supposed to be introduced by his

wife at this event she did not appear

publicly the liberal campaign is not

commenting on that last-minute change

they never comment on security issues
