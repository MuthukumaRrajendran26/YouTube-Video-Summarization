if I get Kelowna I get Corona at the end

of the day I'm not gonna let it stop me

from partying

[Music]

[Music]

we've been waiting for Miami Spring

Break for a while about two months we've

had this trip planned to three months so

where does having having a good time

whatever happens happens with the bars

being closed you know we'll find

alternatives unfortunately it does suck

at the bars and restaurants are closed

but we'll find ways I phone with my

spring break what is there to do here

other than go to the bars or the beach

and they're closing all of it it's

really messy I think they're blowing it

way out of proportion I think it's doing

way too much I mean it sucks but we're

gonna make the best of it

we're enjoying ourselves it's and I'm

from New Orleans so this really sucks

however we're gonna enjoy ourselves we

haven't Day parties howdy it's my

birthday st. Patrick's Day

[Music]

doing this bad we need a refund there's

Morris ain't that serious serious it's

more serious things out there like

hunger and poverty we need to address

that

word is trying to roll with the white

weirdest living for the moment we're

just going for we're just going to do

what happens when it happens when self

closes we're gonna do when it closes but

besides that we're just trying to have

the best trip we can we're just trying

to make with what we have right now

[Music]

yeah I mean we putting this a long time

ago and it was kind of up in the air if

we were gonna still go but like we're

here I just turned 21 this year so I'm

here to party so it's kind of

disappointing but we're just making the

most of it we met these other people in

our little Airbnb spot so we're just

hanging out with them and trying to get

drunk before everything closes

everything's closed a lot of restaurants

are doing to go food and they're serving

just the hotel guests so they can

obviously order food to the rooms

the beaches are closed from fish streets

14th everything's been closed for the

last couple days now and that might be

for a longer period of time

you
