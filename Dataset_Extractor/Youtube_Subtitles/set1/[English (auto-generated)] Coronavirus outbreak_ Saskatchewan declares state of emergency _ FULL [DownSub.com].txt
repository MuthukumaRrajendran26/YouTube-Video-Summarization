good

I'll good afternoon everyone and thank

you for being here today today the

government in Saskatchewan has declared

a provincial state of emergency giving

the government broad powers to address

the kovat 19 pandemic this is a

responsibility that we take incredibly

seriously and a decision that we did not

take lately the declaration of a

provincial state of emergency provides

our government with powers that include

the ability to limit travel to or from a

community or a region of the province

and directing or and directing that a

property or equipment can be deployed to

address the Cova 19 pandemic that we are

facing the decision to declare this

provincial state of emergency comes

following confirmation from the chief

medical officer that Saskatchewan has

eight new presumptive cases of kovat 19

and this decision comes on dr. Shah

Hubbs advice this brings Saskatchewan

total of presumptive and confirmed cases

of kovat 19 to 16 cases across the

province and dr. Shahab will have more

to say about that in a moment

additionally the government in

consultation with the chief medical

health officers imposing a number of new

restrictions to reduce the risk to

Saskatchewan people to prevent

transmission of kovat 19:00 and to

ensure that acute care services are

preserved for residents that are most at

risk for severe illness so the following

measures are effective immediately

public gatherings larger than 50 people

are prohibited all restaurants bars and

event venues must limit their seating to

50 percent of their capacity or up to a

maximum of 50 people whichever is less

all must be able to ensure social

distance of one to two meters between

the customers retail spaces including

grocery stores pharmacies gas stations

will be exempt from this policy and I

would also note that this is phase one

with regards to bars and restaurants and

we may implement phase two in the coming

days which would be closing them

completely except for takeout and

delivery options aw Jim x' fitness

centers casinos bingo halls are all

ordered to closed until further notice

residents are advised to limit any

non-essential travel outside of the

province of Saskatchewan with the

exception of people who live in border

communities and are commuting for work

all crown utilities will implement an

interest deferral program for up to six

months for Saskatchewan residents who

whose ability who are unable to make

bill payments due to the impacts of Cova

19 restrictions and all government of

Saskatchewan ministries agencies and

Crown corporations will implement a

phased in work from home policy that

will become effective on Monday the

March the 23rd this is applicable to

employees that are deemed non-essential

and this means that any employees that

are able to work from home will be able

to do so well provide while providing

managers a period of time to ensure that

we have workforce continuity the

Saskatchewan Health Authority will be

discontinuing all non urgent elective

surgeries and procedures and diagnostics

as of March 23rd the this action will

allow the Saskatchewan Health Authority

to the ability to redeploy nurses and

other staff to ensure that medical

supplies and personal protective

equipment are available when needed and

to reduce the risk of further exposure

to not only our health care providers

but our patients the Saskatchewan Health

Authority will continue to provide

services to patients who require

emergent and urgent care cancer urgent

and emergent surgeries will continue as

planned

and patients will be contacted regarding

their scheduled services finally parents

with children and daycares should also

be preparing for the potential for

further restrictions in the days ahead

and I want to conclude by saying this to

the people of this great province we

will get through this and we will get

through this together but we all have a

responsibility and we all have to take

that personal responsibility seriously

and I would say that most of us are

doing that but I have heard some

anecdotal reports of people that have

returned home from abroad and who are

out in the community the very next day

and we just simply can't do that we need

to sell false self isolate and I know

you may say that you're feeling just

fine but you might be endangering the

health and the lives of others your

neighbor possibly or or even an elderly

family member and I know this is

completely counterintuitive especially

here in our province in times of crisis

we are a community and we pull together

as one we have shown that so many times

but today pulling together means we need

to stay apart it means taking extra

precautions like washing your hands more

often than you otherwise might or and

practicing social distancing it means

self isolating for 14 days when you

return from international travel and

that is so important if you are feeling

healthy and you haven't been traveling

or you haven't been exposed to someone

who has tested positive I would offer

you this you can help by delivering

groceries to a friend to a neighbor or

to a grandparent who may be self

isolating on their own we need to look

after one another

it means buying what we need at grocery

stores and not hoarding and I will

repeat precisely what I said the other

day kovat 19 will not cause shortages in

our grocery stores but hoarding will so

don't do it

but most importantly helping each other

out during this pandemic it means

listening to dr. Shahab and his advice

that he provides as well as his

counterparts public health officials

from across Canada and this means this

means each and every one of us who

should adhere to the advice that they

provide us we are taking action in this

province on the very best advice from

some of the very best medical

professionals in the world but it simply

will not work if we do not follow it

each of us it's important for us to

understand that these measures will not

completely prevent the spread of Kovan

19 but they will flatten the curve and

is only together if we take this

situation seriously and that's what I'm

asking each and every resident of this

province to do is to take this situation

very seriously as individuals we all

have a personal responsibility to

ourselves to our family to our community

we have a personal responsibility to

this province and to this nation in

closing I would I would just like to

thank each and every worker providing

that is providing an essential service

in Saskatchewan today doctors nurses

health care technicians paramedics

police officers and firefighters the

work that you do it's of the utmost

importance each and every day but I

think it's even more impactful during

this time of tremendous uncertainty and

to the truck drivers and the grocery

retailers and the pharmacists and all

that are playing a critical part in our

supply chain in our communities thank

you for keeping our shelves stocked and

and thank you for keeping our fridges

full and our families fed and to all of

the people in this great province of

Saskatchewan I would say this we will

get through this and we will get through

this together thank you we'll take any

questions it may be

why did you wait till after the spending

plan was to times aren't connected these

are separate initiatives separate

conversations that are happening this is

the time that we do the update with

respect to coronavirus and so this is a

time that we're moving forward with on

the advice of our of our chief medical

health officer we've been working on it

throughout today I suppose well

yesterday when I was here I was saying

that we should not be surprised to see

an increase in cases primarily due to

travel and we should expect to see

tunity transmission so that was around 3

p.m. and I was here at 2 p.m. and then

in the evening we saw a traditional

cases so our cases have doubled in a day

but they're all travel related so we are

seeing exactly what we predicted we

would see it's happening pretty fast but

it's still something that is manageable

but at the same time like the premier

said we are going to see a lot of people

coming back both short-term visitors and

and long-term travelers coming back it

is essential now that everyone who comes

back self isolates for two weeks because

we want to minimize any chance of

community transmission

having said that we will see community

transmission we will try to control that

as well as we can and that is the

purpose of that should be all are the

goal of all of us for the next few weeks

to really you know stay at home if you

don't have to be out and about children

are home university students are home if

you have an essential service you go to

work and come home we should all go and

buy what we need and just that and come

home so I think it is a time to you know

hunker down you know and just calm

everything down for a while and

hopefully that will slow any risk of

this taking off more quickly than it

should

in the initial say stages it is very

easy to do case contact follow-up now as

more and more people come back it's

harder to stay ahead and as you know

several flights have been notified in

the in the in you know Airlines have

notified flights where people are

traveling back from some destinations

others so obviously the case wanted

follow-up is containing but we already

know that in many jurisdictions it is

hard to keep up so that is why it

becomes everyone's responsibility this

is not something that someone can please

it's all a responsibility to stay home

when you come back from travel to stay

home if we're sick and then as a

responsibility of friends neighbors

family to not invite you out if you just

come back but to support you to greet

you from a distance to do to help you

with your needs to run errands and I

think that's what we need to do for the

next few weeks how successful

identifying and reaching how many have

you identified how many

out there and what are they being asked

to do are they being asked to solve

isolate to self-monitor are they being

tested what is being done so as of

yesterday it has been successful but it

is going to become challenging the

advices that were Public Health contacts

an individual who has become ill that

you don't track their tire movements

during the time that they were

symptomatic and then they determined who

was a close contact so close contacts

are requested to self isolate people who

may not have been close contacts are

requested to monitor for two weeks so as

an example of the airline flights you

know once we get the information of

Cedros we will contact people who were

three seats they had three seats behind

they are even they are not considered

close contacts but they are informed to

self isolate but others in the plane are

informed that self monitor your risk is

lower but just beware but you know as

this time goes on I think that becomes

less and less important because now

anyone traveling from some destinations

two weeks ago there was the issue you

know three weeks ago travel from the US

wasn't an issue

two weeks ago travel from the u.s.

became concerning last week you've seen

several imputations from sun

destinations that weren't reporting any

cases and still not may not be so I

think now is the time that any travel

from outside you know self isolate and

even travel within Canada now we are

hearing from our colleagues across the

process that community transmission has

been established in several provinces we

will see that established you know this

like the previous set is not something

that we can prevent totally but we have

to do everything we can that we break

the chains or drain of transmission

every opportunity we get I'm hearing

that in one of these cases I don't know

which one I'm not asked

identifying information the patient was

in a doctor's office for an extended

period of time

and and and I've been demonstrating

symptoms within that doctor's office are

you aware of that can you confirm that's

the case how many contacts may there

have been and what are you doing to

contain that so and that is an essential

point for us to remember at all times

that the ideal situation is that if

you've traveled or otherwise you have a

fever cough you call Healthline and if

you have to see your primary care

provider you call ahead if you have to

call EMS you go to an ER you call ahead

so that people the staff are ready to

receive you put you in a side room don't

show up without calling ahead if you do

show up you know the staff will try it

will put offer you mask put you in a

side room you want to minimize the

situation where someone is coughing

ingrates in a waiting room but that has

happened in a few instances that results

in a larger number of people being told

to self isolated including health care

providers and and it is a significant

impact for health care providers who

weren't expecting you so you know health

care buddies aren't wearing a mask all

the time but if you have a coughing

fever and you called head then they'll

put on the property PP so yes that is

happening and that is why it's important

that every person be aware of what their

responsibilities are before going to see

seeking seek care earlier the press

release that one you have not

demonstrated and secondly are these

patients sorry are these contacts being

tested so all the cases have been linked

to travel or a household contr of travel

and that's in most cases is travel - its

travel to places outside of Canada but

in two instances is travel to a large

conference and secondly I think that's

really important if you are a toast

household contact we have to remember

that 15 out of the 16 cases are doing

fine in the home setting other people in

the household can safely stay at home

most people if they follow basic

precautions don't get sick from exposure

even in the home setting but if you are

household contact you also have to stay

home for two weeks

once your two two weeks are over you are

cleared and many cases also within you

know a day or two if within about 10

days of symptom onset cleared the virus

and are free so people are going to be

clearing this for the most part within

two weeks of becoming sick and their

household members will also be clear so

in a week or two we'll already see

people emerging on the other end and

their contacts emerging on the other end

contacts as long as they remain well and

the vast majority do remain well need to

self isolated don't need testing but if

they develop fever cough they should be

tested but because they're staying home

they hopefully will not have no further

contacts so I think that's why we need

to break the chains of transmission and

this is the way to do it

now his surgery his or her surgical team

so I don't have that information and we

usually don't get information where

someone has symptoms they if there's a

concern that because many people may

develop symptoms and then they are

tested and once the test is reported

then Public Health confirms the test the

clinician confirms the test so I have

not heard of this instance so I have not

heard of this particular instance but

you know obviously if this is the case

we will hear shortly

[Music]

here's the number of critical care beds

that we have here's so I'm looking for

can you can you tell me what the range

is how realistic you I get it's a little

bit speculative and don't know for sure

other jurisdictions have been providing

us information so you know that's a

really important point and you're

absolutely right that oath equals the

course of 12 to 18 months thirty to

seventy percent of us will get Co 819

but that's exactly the point of all

these social distancing measures because

if all of us get exposed within one to

three months has happened in Wuhan

because they didn't know the virus you

know it started in end of November in

Wuhan they only caught on to it and

being an all wise end of December so by

that time you know it was established

community transmission they couldn't get

ahead of the curve and a similar thing

happened in northern Italy where you

know community transmission it didn't

happen by identifying a traveler it

happened by rapid

takeoff community transmission in a

population northern Italy Italy that was

primarily elderly that is exactly what

we want to war it and what that does is

that if all of us get exposed over you

know 12 to 18 months if you know more

80% will get a mild illness 20% will

require some level of hospital care

maybe week maybe longer oxygen and

supportive care or if anti vials are

available that those can be given if

vaccine is available by 8 to 12 months

that will be given to further reduce

flatten the curve and about 2 percent

will require ICU care 2 to 5 percent of

the you know all people who get exposed

but as long as all those pressures come

slowly over you know 8 to 12 months the

health system still needs to expand the

search

Basti maybe by 50% but it can manage if

we don't do social distancing no health

system in the world can manage and I

think that's a critical point and this

is not up to the health system to manage

they can manage as long as the rest of

us can flatten the curve if the rest of

us can flatten the curve no health

system in the world can manage oh yeah

I'm just wondering when was the last

time if ever the province has declared a

state of emergency I'm not aware of a

provincial state of emergency there has

been community states of emergency

during times of flood or forest fire

things of that nature multiple community

emergencies I am not aware of the top of

my head when the last time the province

have proper has declared a state of

emergency and I I would hope that that

lends itself to the importance of what

doctor Shahab has been talking about

with respect to how our health system

will be able to manage what is coming at

Saskatchewan the the only way we manage

that is by flattening the curve there is

no health system in the world that can

manage this virus if we are not able to

practice personal distancing social

distancing if we're not able to flatten

a curve in some way

when you talk about capacity I'm

wondering about facilities we might use

could we see things like a service so

those assessments that were done in 2009

and never required so in 2009 all those

assessments were done now there are

being revised and almost finalized

especially over 19 and that's exactly

the point that if required how do you

bring online more acute care beds how do

you bring online more alternate levels

of care for people who just need support

that they can't get at home for example

if there's two people in the house both

are ill and require some level of

support can they be cohorted in a place

that's not a hospital but it's a it

could be a school or something and those

were all plans that were made in 2009

were made even before that they were not

needed in 2009 and that was really good

we hope we don't need them this time

around but those plans are being

refreshed right very very positive

announcement from our federal government

literally billions of dollars invested

and invested I would say in a very very

effective and positive manner a large

amount of money that is going to be made

available to individuals very quickly

and it's going to be made available to

individuals that I would put forward

required they've shortened or eliminated

the wait time for employment insurance

they have addressed those that don't

qualify for employment insurance so

single single person businesses that are

operating accountants plumbers

electricians things of that nature

they have provided funding for those

that are remaining at home from work to

take care of a family member that is ill

they have provided funding for parents

that need to remain at home and

care of their children it provided

funding for businesses to invest in

retaining their employees this is what I

think is you know many may talk about

the the size of the package I would say

that it's a an appropriate size for this

at for this point of time we can

continue to talk to see how long this

goes on too but I would say it's an

appropriate size for today and it is

very very well targeted to those that

that require it we are now actively

looking if there are opportunities for

the problems to dovetail into that in

any way as to you know provide further

supports if necessary yeah we're well

we're what we've done here today is with

our utility bills that provided an

interest rate free area we know there

are some people that you know may have

some challenges paying some of their

utility bills over the next number of

months and and we don't want them to be

saddled with any interest costs on that

they also won't be disconnected over the

course of the next six months as well so

that's a start but we are looking at

what came forward here today in the in

the federal package which I would put

forward was an effective package I know

it's possible to do but can you give me

a rough time frame as to how long the

state of emergency is expected to last

and secondly I'm good communication

basically saying the message is not

getting out so we're in the middle of

this state of emergency what can

government do more to get the message I

just got a text from Sarah from someone

basically saying that Polytech Institute

the they're still requiring doctors

notes to stay home hearing all kinds of

stories like that it in my own school I

know

I still make notes to get my kid right

well we're doing our best with respect

to this holding news conferences

virtually daily other provinces as well

and the federal government also holding

news conferences daily we have the very

best medical advice also holding news

conferences virtually daily in

Saskatchewan and across the country our

MLAs are going back to their

constituencies in many cases not cabinet

cabinet is remaining behind to operate

solely focused essentially on kovat 19

but our MLAs are going back to their

constituencies now too and they are

picking up the phone and talking to

people about the seriousness of this

situation and and and let me let me just

say this and reiterate what dr. Shahab

had said a few minutes ago if we are not

able to flatten the curve if we don't

take these social distancing measures

seriously there is no health system in

the world that will be able to manage

what will occur it is incumbent on us in

this province to do our level best to

ensure that we are able to flatten that

curve and that our health system is able

to handle what is going to happen over

the course of the next week's next

number of weeks in the next number of

months it is an impossible question but

the the orders put forward it has a

14-day lifespan and at that point in

time if it needs to be renewed it will

be when you talk about community

transmission why the 50-person Gathering

limits I mean shouldn't it perhaps be

smaller than that also why it can you

clarify why you don't consider a

household contact in to be community

transmission yeah sorry and 3-prime

question for close contacts who for

contacts of people who tested positive

and are being contacted now

do they need to get tested and why not

last one again sorry the people who have

come in contact with those who have

symptoms or or have tested positive okay

do they need to be contested

okay so I'll try to answer them but I'll

answer the first one first and then move

back but if I forget that it's a five

pronged question anything but so if

you're a close household contact and you

keep your distance in the house there's

a good chance you won't get infected so

there's no reason to test because if

you're asymptomatic the test is negative

and if you find after 14 days and the

person who is your household member who

had mild symptoms they're fine

everyone's clear so Public Health will

give you the all-clear there's no reason

to test if you do get symptomatic it

could be Kove it could be something else

so you are tested there's something else

you still find you completely 14 days if

it's covered you then continue for

another eight nine days till you've

cleared and then everyone is fine so

that's the best-case outcome so that is

my last question what is the many people

might be people I say I'll link it to

the 50 / 50 is not and there's nothing

magical in 50 last time you know

actually many jurisdictions in North

America you are using 250 but I'll tell

you what I'm gonna do if I go into a

meeting room and people aren't sitting

one meter apart

I refuse to attend that meeting and I

actually will hold that meeting and ask

everyone to move in in Matera part and

if there's enough not enough room in

that meeting room everyone else can go

to another room and we can dial in if

I'm invited to someone's house you know

I'll say how many people can we set two

meters apart I'm not very popular right

now but I won't go if we can't set two

meters apart and I don't want to go to a

gathering with more than four or five

people actually that's my comfort level

right now fifty is like a speed limit

just because the

is 50 doesn't mean that everyone needs

to invite 49 people to their house I

think you need to minimize contact as

much as humanly possible 50 seems to be

the right number right now because our

up to 50% reefer capacity if there's a

restaurant that can seat 30 people they

should actually have 15 because when in

a restaurant usually you're sitting

pretty close apart but if you keep every

second seat empty and across the table

you usually have one or two meter

separations so those are general

guidelines but I think that's how all of

us should think and then if you are

elderly have an airline risk factors you

need to be especially cautious of where

you're going and not going and as

visitor you need to be very careful

about visiting and keep that social

distancing even when visiting funerals

really the immediate family member goes

and the others can participate you know

virtually it sounds a bit strange I

think you know funerals like the

previous sad weddings those are all

occasions to be together weddings can be

delayed funerals can unnecessarily and

every situation but this is not the time

to have clothes gathering you're crazy

and wondering how long this can last

restaurants having closed voluntarily

just jumping straight into closure

without doing like you mentioned eight

to twelve months for vaccines and things

like that can we expect to be locked up

in our houses for eight months so what

we have seen from countries in Southeast

Asia that did everything right is that

eight weeks 12 weeks out they have seen

it come in a flat way and then

cautiously they can relax on some things

but not other things cautiously so they

may not open schools right away they may

not allow large events but they can ease

up on some of that you know like

restaurants and those kind of things so

I think but we are only into like tenth

week of this outbreak and you know we're

in the middle of March it's only been

going around for two and a half months

in terms of midnight so we are looking

back at people who did the right thing

and you know two months back and now

they're at the other end and

they still have to sustain but they can

start you know some things can start

normalizing but I think right now we

need to sustain the next eight weeks at

least

and then reevaluate

there's dental procedures yeah so I

think so I'm aware of communication that

there's a schedule College of Dentistry

has sent out to its practitioners I'm

aware of similar letters that the

colleges of dentistry have sent out in

other provinces and I think it's really

important because till such time you

could safely self isolate if you had

traveled from abroad or if you were at a

conference there was a conference where

you know not just dentist but people who

work in the dental profession had been

in Vancouver and there's at least two if

not three people one is a house

according to people who have been

impacted by that so at the moment if you

were exposed you obviously need to not

go to work as a health care provider

whether it's dentist physician at the

provider there's a good reason that as

this starts transmitting locally you

have to think about what's the risk to

you what's the risk to your patient

what's the risk to you are you know

people sitting in the waiting room based

on what services you provide so

dentistry you know we we say that this

is a virus that's transmitted to contact

through nose you know no nose eyes and

mouth dentistry is all about being

inside someone's mouth so obviously

dentists are professionals they have

very high stands of infection control

and the highest of all professionals so

they are actively looking at how can

they continue to safely provide urgent

care how can the space out there

patients they need to have the same

controls ers and physician offices have

that they shouldn't someone shouldn't

come even for a root canal if they're

coughing you know they need to have some

pain relief till they're at least the

fevers settled for a few days but then

they can provide emergent care with

precautions so urgent care obviously

will need to be provided but routine

care should probably be as the school to

transition picks up they should probably

start scaling back as much as they can

well I think I've had this discussion

with the register of the college of

dentistry and so this information has

got gone out we're willing to work with

them to see you know I think for I don't

I don't think it's a property right

orders for everything in everyone I

think as professionals all of us can do

a risk assessment what's safe for us and

our patients and I think that's the

spirit in which dentists other people

who point personal care not just in

health but other services have to make

that risk assessment so a tests have

gone up significantly I don't have the

numbers but they have gone up from a

thousand something to 1,800 1,900 so

tests are ramping up they're happening

all over the province are cases also all

over the province north rural South

Regina Saskatoon I'll have to check I

have used it a few times but it seems to

work as designed right now obviously we

may need to tweak it a bit if we see a

lot of children transmission because at

some point and and some provinces have

already gone there BC has already gone

there that it's not effective if you

have a lot of community transmission to

test because you already know what say

then for mild illness you stay put you

stay at home you get over it and that's

it we're not at that point yet we do

want to test but then at some point you

have to say okay we'll test people who

are still coming back after travel but

we know that's going to dry up very

quickly in a week or two and we want to

focus on testing people who seriously

and who work in essential it every time

their encounter with the case because

they'll you know they have but as long

as they using proper precautions they'd

all have to self isolate because they're

not considered exposed but if there's an

issue if they have a cough a fever they

can stare be learning more and go back

to work a bit early if they've cleared

the virus so that's the approach will

have to take going forward but we

have to adjust our approach there's a

number of things that one would use this

this this act in this power for and let

me be clear it was my sincere hope that

we don't use it and don't use it once

but you could use it for example to set

the price of certain items you could use

it for example to set the volumes of

purchases that could be available for

certain items to an individual or you

could use it to to isolate a portion of

a building a building a community or an

entire town village or city anywhere in

the province and so now as we are

looking like we have a number of new

cases and the potential for possible

community transmission of which I think

we will get to at some point if this

particular case is not that we're not

going to eliminate Kovan 19 from being

exposed to the people of the province

what we want to do is slow down

the the rate at which it is exposed

which people of Saskatchewan are exposed

to are flatten the curve if you will so

that that's precisely how we would be

viewed as is using this is if we need to

move in and move in very quickly to do

something just like that - to isolate a

portion of a community or an entire

community so we're not we don't have

anywhere in mind where we would use it

immediately but we think it needs to be

available to act very quickly in what is

an increasingly volatile situation

but I'm hearing very specific reports

about swab shortages for instance in the

five hills

the former five hills health regen in a

simple yeah potentially you know other

areas can you confirm whether or not

that's the case give us an update on on

how many swabs are available and whether

they're sufficient to meet the expected

demand and and further explain whether

that's had any impact whatsoever on the

guidelines being used to determine what

testing is done I'll answer a very high

level and then I'll ask either of you if

you'd like to go into any specifics that

you might have information on and I

don't have information on on the

specifics but with respect to supplies

whether it's testing supplies a personal

protective equipment supplies we're on a

call again this morning with the

premiers in the Prime Minister

discussing just this we are actively

have orders in for a number of not only

swabs and different types of swabs but

also a number of different types of

personal protective equipment as well

and we're working actively with other

provinces in the federal government to -

to ensure we can we can find that supply

we're also hunting out and about on our

own as well - looking for additional

supply as well as these are items that

the rest of the world is looking for at

this at this very same time so I'm not

aware of any shortages at the moment

with respect to any of the items that we

need and I'm not aware that it is in any

way impacted the number of tests that

were doing in the case of swabs in fact

dr. Shahab I just referenced that we did

more tests in the last 24 hours than we

have at any point in time thus far and

it's our expectation that will that will

continue to increase so in saying that

we continue to to look for not only for

supply of the swabs we have but but

additional kinds as well so either of

you have anything to add to that just

make a comment and let doctor job I was

at a ministry briefing yesterday where

we discussed supplies and pretty

specific to swabs was told at that time

I forget exactly how many days but we

had like a number of days left of the

supply that they had been

using they're expecting another

significant supply and by the end of the

week and in the in the eventualities

that for some reason although they're

they fully expect expect that that order

to arrive if it doesn't they have a

significant number of a different type

of swab as they described it to me it's

not it can absolutely be used the lab

prefers the other type somehow for ease

of use but I I took great comfort out of

that briefing yeah I think this

particular instance with as testing

ramps up there's a bit of supply

pressures that then you have to

redistribute so far we're doing okay but

at some point we do need to revisit how

we test and maybe in in the future

sometime we would not recommend testing

for Milan that's because we're already

learning now that and in fact there's a

scientific paper I read yesterday that

we discussed an FPT table where the good

news is that the majority of people more

than eighty percent have a mild

self-limited illness and the clear the

virus in eight to nine days directly

free of the virus on day ten we still

require them to isolate for two weeks

but actually bite they they tend their

clear off the virus so that's the good

news so previously everyone had to be

tested negative and then now that is

actually not the recommendation of a

mile illness so you know we're trying to

rationalize the testing as much as we

can as well

mission is suspected or is happening an

infected person from traveling goes home

and obviously spends time with their

loved ones is are you considering some

kind of order or option where people who

are self isolated have to go somewhere

completely alone they're not allowed to

say go back home to their family or

roommates or whatever it may be so first

of all we don't have any evidence of

Qunu transmission at this point but we

expect it to happen in the instances in

Saskatchewan and in many parts of Canada

the way you know people who are

symptomatic self isolate at home clear

instructions given to them and theirs in

very few cases of secondary transmission

in the whole household setting we have

just seen one instance and that may have

been a common exposure while traveling

to another province but we have not seen

any evidence of secondary household

transmission it means that people are

able to self isolate even within the

household by community transmission we

mean that someone shows up in ER and

they have not traveled anywhere they

were not in contact with the person who

was sick or you get an outbreak and long

term care facility where no one visited

the long-term care facility who was sick

and I just traveled from abroad so then

you can't find where it came from so

that's when we say it's Kuna

transmission we try still try to search

for the source but if you can't find

anything in a few days we say community

transmission is here it may only be in a

part of the province but all the steps

if taken is exactly to delay those

eventualities don't visit long-term care

if you have come from another province

unless for compassionate reasons and

then just go and visit the person you

have to you know don't visit hospitals

absolutely don't visit people who are

vulnerable in home or a facility if even

if you have a cough and you think you're

fine is just a cough those are essential

precautions now going forwards

Twitter feeds your Facebook or anything

else for mass communications

topher like we do yeah yeah yeah that's

not that since that's an option we

haven't we haven't done it as of yet

that is an option though because there

are some you know in the in the vein of

of taking this very seriously you know

we must remember that and quite likely

isn't it's someone of my age and not

that I'm overly healthy but I feel

pretty good I'm likely going to have

mild symptoms as the as the data shows

but my my parents are at a higher risk

category and so the danger is not

directly to me it's to my parents and

their generation and it's to those

individuals in you know our retirement

communities and in our long-term care

facilities and then where we are seeing

terrible results fatal results in Canada

are in our long-term care facilities and

we need to be very very diligent not

only in our personal distancing but I

would ask the people of this province to

be very diligent in whether or not they

need to visit a long-term care facility

or visit anyone in our community that

would be considered at a decreased

immunity or consider vulnerable to this

virus
