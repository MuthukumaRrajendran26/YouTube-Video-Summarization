hello I'm Mercedes Stevenson and this is

the West block politics perspectives and

players one of the top issues in this

election campaign is health care it's a

concern across the country but out east

it's a crisis from doctor shortages to

wellness facilities to ER closures how

is this all playing out as we head to

Election Day on October 21st we travel

to Canada's east coast to Nova Scotia

to find out why the precaution they took

they took out the appendix and a month

later I got a phone call from my doctor

asking me to go in to see her and then

she told me that I had what's called

neuro and repinned cancer 33 year old

Chelsea Pritam's cancer diagnosis came

in May in July part of her colon and

intestines were removed the surgeon told

her she was 98% cancer-free Chelsea

still in recovery is too scared to

celebrate in my mind as a you know newly

diagnosed brand new to this rodeo sort

of person I'm thinking about that 2% and

wondering what I'm gonna do if I have

pain or if I don't feel well or you know

where do I go because unfortunately my

family doctor closed her practice last

week so I don't know what I'm gonna do I

don't know really what's gonna happen if

I you know have a pain or if I get

nauseous or if I you know get scared and

I can't come you know can't talk myself

out of that then I guess I'll go to the

emergency we're home and talk to a

doctor there but you know that's wasting

resources probably wasting time and

Chelsea is not the only patient without

a family doctor adding more stress for

emergency rooms I'm a family doctor and

I also work emerg I'll see folks in the

emergency department who've been without

a family doctor for some time and not

uncommon ly be diagnosing cancer in an

emergency department dr. Tim Holland is

the past president of doctors Nova

Scotia patients without a family doctor

fully understand how hard it is to

access health care when they don't have

access to a family physician and so

we're seeing you know patients calling

up dozens of family doctors offices

trying

get on the list the physician shortage

is most felt in our family physician

shortage there are thousands of patients

across Nova Scotia who are without a

family doctor and if you've ever been

without a family doctor you you'd know

you're being left out of health care I

think without that family doctor you've

got no way to connect with consultant

services you have no one who can follow

you along visit to visit to kind of

monitor your ongoing health needs to

pick up on those diseases before they

become a problem but also someone there

to assure you assure you about issues

that might not be a problem a family

doctor is actually absolutely critical

to the delivery of health care the Nova

Scotia Health Authority says the

shortage of doctors is again affecting

the Memorial Hospital's emergency room

and Pugwash so that er will be closed

this coming Friday the situation is so

bad in Nova Scotia they have a hospital

report just like a weather report the

Nova Scotia Health Authority issues a

bulletin every Monday and updates it

through the week on which emergency

rooms are open and which are closed it's

become so common to hear hospital

emergency room closures on your local

radio station it becomes like it's going

to rain as kind of snow it's going to be

sunny

I had one listener call one day and he

said there are so many Hospital closures

on your newscast why don't you just

broadcast the ones who are open it's a

smaller list and that health care list

for doctors and better er services is

one of the top issues in the election

campaign that bleeds into other things

like money for hospitals and other kinds

of infrastructure even wellness

facilities it's all balled up in that

bigger healthcare concern the battle

here in central Nova is between the

liberals and conservatives over health

care and the environment this is

conservative Mackay country or first

Aylmer and then his son Peter MacKay

held the seat for decades this

constituency was held by for 40 years by

one family the McKay family so Elmer

McKay under Joe Clarke under Brian

Mulroney his son Peter McKay of course

who eventually became leader the

Progressive Conservative Party and then

merged with Stephen Harper's

Alliance to form the new Conservative

Party of Canada and then because he was

so personally popular and because there

was such a strong loyalty to almost to

the family in the riding he was able to

hold that constituency until he decided

not to run again in 2015 so that's a

very strong base for the Conservatives

to try to build on and revive they don't

have this strong personal following

anymore to count on so how much of Peter

Mackay's both was a vote for Peter

MacKay vote for the Mackay sort of

family tradition in the region and how

much it was committed conservative vote

in the way that we see core conservative

vote say in Western Canada is the

question and I think that this this

election will tell the story because we

don't have a big wave going on toward

one party or another so we can kind of

discount that so now it's much more a

question of an election in which the it

could go either way in terms of the

constituency could go either way

in this context I think the national

issues are important the the the

strength of the local MP the sitting

incumbent is important how much a Shan

fries are able to build on you know what

has been a very good four years for him

he hasn't made a misstep he's very

affable very intelligent young man

it's been a good constituency

representative is he able to carry that

will that be enough now to carry him

over the line in an election that's a

toss-up in 2015 though it turned red and

now the Conservatives have brought in

country music star George Canyon to win

it back healthcare at the doors probably

tied it's the top three things I hear

about my dad was in health care he was a

chief tech of the aberdeen hospital

right up the road his whole life and dad

said to me 20 years ago

we're in trouble it's in a downward

spiral when you're going for treatments

in the city Liberal candidate Shaun

Fraser says there is a rule for the

federal government to play in easing the

health crisis the issues are so

consistent it would blow you away we

hear every second or is concerned about

the quality of our health care system in

Nova Scotia they're concerned about

access to family doctors about the

quality of our mental health system

about the wait times they experience as

far as I know there's no other party

that's actually campaigning on a

commitment specifically to help

provinces recruit family physicians and

primary care providers and through the

work that we've put in as a group of

members of parliament from Nova Scotia

I'm sure it had an impact because this

is the top priority for a lot of people

who live in the area that I cover and to

reflect their interests and their needs

I feel like we have to be making these

kinds of investments otherwise we hope

we have been turning a blind eye to

their concerns and they deserve better

than that so I was thrilled when I saw

that specific commitment on the family

doctor recruitment piece because I know

it reflects what I've been hearing on

the doorstep for four straight years

most people appreciate that health care

is a constitutional responsibility of

the province and I think they're right

to expect not just an increase in the

transfer payments but innovative

solutions it will help improve the

quality of our prevention system but for

cancer patient Chelsea Pritam there's

little hope those transfer payments will

be coming anytime soon even after the

election I'm not hearing really as much

as I thought it would be in terms of you

know what the campaign promises are

between different parties I thought that

this would be a huge massive issue that

everybody would be talking about and I

don't see that we are on the point where

this is more than a crisis I don't know

I don't know what's gonna happen I don't

know like what the solution is I mean

obviously we can't get all the doctors

that we need in the province you know in

a month but I know like I said that I'm

not the only person that's dealing with

something like this and that's scary

it's it I mean it's really scary that's

all the time we have for today thanks

for joining us for the West block I'm
