just before we begin I want to mention

we're working very hard long on getting

a young group of people out of Peru

we've removed some and the rest are

being removed with the cooperation of

the Peruvian government and we're also

dealing with Honduras on getting some

people out that get caught up and we are

working on that very well again with the

Honduran government's work and they're

working with us so I appreciate that we

have a couple of other locations that

will report to you and we were able to

get a young woman released from a

certain area who was being horribly

accosted horribly treated and we spoke

to general Milley general Milley took

care of it we went in and we got a route

and we'll we will report further on that

one

but it's there was rough stuff I want to

thank general Milley I want to thank all

of the people that were were involved

and the people that went in together I

want to thank you very much as we

continue to marshal every resource at

America's disposal in the fight against

the Chinese virus

we're profoundly grateful to our

nation's state and local leaders doctors

nurses law enforcement and first

responders who are waging this battle on

the ground it is absolutely critical

that Americans continue to follow the

federal government's guidelines so

important about social distancing

non-essential travel and hand-washing

defeating this unseen enemy requires the

help and commitment of every single

American I want to just say that Senator

Rand Paul a friend of mine he's been a

great friend of mine he's been always

there when we needed him when the

country needed him and as you know he

just tested positive Jose diaz-balart

spoke to him yesterday tested positive

and some people are they're getting

quite close to home and it's a terrible

thing that's going on the hidden enemy I

call it the hidden enemy and I think

they'll all be fine I hope they're gonna

be fine but I just want to send our

regards and I think I can speak on

behalf of our country to those two great

friends of mine who are working urgently

with Congress on legislation to support

the millions of workers small businesses

and industries who have been hit hard by

the virus through no fault of their own

our goal is to get relief to Americans

as quickly as possible so that families

can get by and small businesses can keep

workers on the payroll this will help

our economy and you will see our economy

skyrocket once this is over I think it's

going to skyrocket it's a it's a pent up

demand it's a built up demand and I

guess you really have to say who knows

but I think it's gonna be a tremendous

day when we win this war we will win the

war we want to win the war was a with as

few and if you look at it just deaths as

possible we want to have as few number

of deaths as possible today I'm

announcing action to help New York

California and Washington ensure that

the National Guard can effectively

respond to this crisis the National

Guard these are tremendous people

they're fully on alert we've signed what

we had to sign and it's been activated

we're dealing also with other states

these states have been hit the hardest

actually pretty much by far you could

say the hardest everybody can see that

just look at the numbers and through

FEMA the federal government will be

funding 100 percent of the cost of

deploying National Guard units to carry

out approved missions to stop the virus

while those governor

remain in command so the governor's

locally are going to be in command and

we'll be following them and we hope they

can do the job and I think they will I

spoke with all three of the governors

today and just a little while ago and

they're very happy with what we're going

to be doing because we will be

announcing some other things for those

three states and some other states where

it's hit the hardest

this action will give them maximum

flexibility to use the guard against the

virus without having to worry about cost

reliability and freeing up state

resources to protect the health and

safety of the people in their state the

federal government has deployed hundreds

of tons of supplies from our national

stockpile to locations with the greatest

need in order to assist in those areas I

approved the state of New York's request

for a major disaster declaration

something which Governor Cuomo has been

asking for and which I agree and we had

it done in very rapid fashion we

approved this on Friday evening and we

are working very very hard to get all of

these things not only signed up but

completed and finished and in wind the

request from the state of Washington for

a major disaster declaration was

approved just a little while ago went

through the process and we moved it very

quickly the request from the state of

California was just received and we will

have it approved very quickly we'll be

working I told that to Gavin Newsom and

we are working on getting that done very

quickly it'll be done maybe tonight

we've large we have large quantities of

medical equipment and supplies on the

way based on all of this to those states

including respirators surgical masks and

gowns face shields coveralls and gloves

with large quantities already delivered

to Washington and to New York in

addition a large quantities of supplies

I've also directed FEMA to supply the

following four large federal medical

stations with 1,000 beds

for New York eight large federal medical

stations with 2,000 beds for California

and three large federal medical stations

and for small federal medical stations

with 1000 beds for the state of

Washington

the governor's know the supplies in

route to California in New York will be

delivered within the next 48 hours in

addition the naval hospital ship the

USNS mercy

it's incredible ships these two ships

are incredible one of the West Coast one

of the East Coast will be deployed to

Los Angeles to add emergency

surge medical capacity and they have a

tremendous capacity they are really

something I will say that if you look at

some of the things we've been doing and

now those numbers have gone up and just

to be a little bit more exacting we've

done a presidential approval for a

request for major disaster declaration

for the state of New York

approval of title 32 National Guard

activation for the state of New York

we're providing all of this at no cost

to the governor

I spoke with Governor Cuomo he's working

hard we're all working hard together the

relationship has really been amazing but

it also enables the governor to provide

robust National Guard support to the

state and the 25 percent we're going to

be waiving that 25% cost

we're picking up we'll be coordinating

and they'll be doing something with very

special people mission assignment of the

US Army Corps of Engineers to provide

support to build out alternate care

sites they're doing various alternate

care sites which have now been

designated by New York for large federal

medical stations of 1,000 beds these are

very complex places actually with great

equipment and great people strategic

national stockpile order and this is as

of a number of days ago

so far delivered to New York and this is

the 19th we had the n95 respirators

186,000 416 delivered we've delivered

four hundred and forty-four thousand oh

78 surgical masks many have been

delivered since then facials we've

delivered eighty four thousand five

hundred and sixty face shields Surgical

vans surgical gowns sixty eight thousand

nine forty four to New York coveralls

three hundred and fifty two gloves

245,000 four eighty-six also to New York

in terms of what's been delivered just

since then the numbers are quite large

and we have tremendous numbers of

companies also making equipment for the

state of Washington we've delivered

three hundred and sixty nine thousand

n95 respirators five hundred and seven

thousand four hundred and six surgical

masks and this is as of about three days

ago

facial sixty three thousand seven

hundred and eighty-eight face shields

surgical gowns one hundred and seven

thousand eight fifty gloves two hundred

and forty thousand 376 and we have many

many things pending it's actually not

pending it's being they're being

fabricated they're being made and

they're moving now for Washington so we

have four small federal medical stations

two hundred and fifty bits and for

Washington state of Washington we have

three large federal medical stations 750

bits and then you have as I said the

approval of the title 32 National Guard

state of California again to be very

precise we're going to have the approval

of the title 32 National Guard

activation and we're providing all of

this again at like in New York at no

cost to the governor meaning the

governor Newsom and the state nope

to the state it enables the governor to

provide robust National Guard support to

the state so they're gonna have control

of of the National Guard the federal

government sending these are incredible

people that are being sent we have eight

large federal medical stations with over

2,000 beds and that's going to

California and then strategic national

stockpile order we've ordered likewise

hundreds of thousands of different items

won't go into the exact numbers but the

numbers are very substantial but we're

having tremendous additional numbers set

and whatever the states can get they

should be getting I say we're sort of a

backup for the states and some of the

states are doing really well and some

don't do as well but ones that don't do

as well need more help but these are

three states that really do need help

because they are they are hit very hard

and the outpouring from the private

sector has also been extraordinary and

pleased to report that Honeywell great

company has just announced it will

immediately expand its personal

protective equipment manufacturing

operations in Rhode Island to produce

millions of additional n95 mass very

hard to get they're actually quite

complex for the US government's

strategic national stockpile they'll be

immediately then delivered to the

various states this expansion is already

underway and it's going to provide a lot

of jobs for that state probably around

500 the masks will be distributed by the

government for the use of the health

safety and emergency and this for

response workers primarily for response

workers these are very high-end this

expansion is in addition to honeywell's

action to more than double production of

its existing personal protective

equipment manufacturing plants and make

a lot of different things and they are

doubling and tripling their production

to going round the clock today I'm also

announcing the launch of a new public

private consortium organized by the

White House the Department of Energy and

IBM to unleash the power of American

supercomputing resources to fight

the Chinese virus the following leaders

from private industries academia and

government will be contributing and

they're gonna be contributing a lot of

different things but computer primarily

computing resources to help researchers

discover new treatments and vaccines

they'll be working along with NIH and

all of the people that are working on

this but tremendous help from IBM Amazon

Google Microsoft MIT Rensselaer

Polytechnic Institute the Department of

Energy's national labor laboratories the

National Science Foundation and NASA

they're all contributing to this effort

and they're fully in gear this afternoon

I also want to update you on the steps

we are taking to protect and serve our

countries 18 million veterans these are

great people are amazing veterans have

shown their eternal loyalty to our

nation and this is the time were there

in need and we are going to show our

loyalty to them we're being very

protective of our veterans we're working

on certain hospitals where we may be

doing some work in Louisiana in

particular and some other states

Veterans Hospitals it'll be very

protective of our veterans some of them

are of that very vulnerable age and some

of them obviously are not feeling well

and some of them are still suffering the

wounds of war for many years ago

yesterday are signed vital legislation

to ensure that the GI Bill will cover

distance learning during this emergency

I also spoke with many of our veterans

service organizations or the VSOs to

describe our unprecedented action in

February the Department of Veterans

Affairs established 19 emergency

operation centers throughout the country

one of the things that they've been

trying to get done for many years you

all know this from following me over the

last number of years but we got it done

pretty quickly they've been trying to

get it done for many many decades with

choice veterans

and also veterans accountability now if

it's if it's crowded within this if they

can't get to a doctor we have great

doctors in the VA I have to say that we

have fantastic doctors as good as they

come but it's hard to get to them

because of what was bureaucracy but no

longer bureaucracy we've done a lot of

things in that case because of

accountability when people aren't doing

their jobs or if they're bad or if

they're sadistic or if they steal or

anything bad happens we're now allowed

to fire them for my son that a year and

a half ago for many years you weren't

able to do this so the VA is working and

I was just told by a great leader at the

VA Robert Robert Wilkie he said for the

first time we get the highest marks in

the history highest poll numbers in the

history of the Veterans Administration

came out a week ago that they're happy

and look one of the reasons that

happened highest in history one of the

reasons that happened is because of

veterans choice if they have to wait on

line they go and see a private doctor we

pay the bill and and they get better

they don't have to wait two weeks and

three weeks or two days but they get

better and a lot of times they waited so

long that they would they would have a

problem and it would end up being

terminal because they couldn't get the

kind of treatment that their they

deserve so highest poll numbers highest

approval numbers in the history of the

VA I was just given that information

yesterday we restricted visitors access

to 135 veteran community living centers

which has nearly 8,000 veterans with

chronic medical conditions so that we

limit their exposure to the virus we

want to totally take care of our

veterans and that's what we're doing the

VA has cancelled most elective medical

and surgical procedures that delaying

them till after this is gone after we've

won

we began providing life-saving care to

patients who had symptoms across the 171

VA medical centers nationwide that's a

big deal under my administration the VA

has also been a leader in expanding

telehealth telehealth is becoming a

bigger and bigger factor in in medicine

this month we have taken bold action to

cut through the red tape and make

telehealth available for millions more

Americans during this crisis they can

speak to a doctor from the safety of

their home rather than risk becoming

infected or making a tremendously long

trip when frankly you'll speak to a

great doctor right from your home it's

happening telehealth we're very much at

the forefront of that too we're very

proud of it and it also takes a big

burden off our system we continue to

accelerate the development of safe and

effective vaccines

we're also aggressively investigating a

number of antiviral therapies and

treatments to determine their potential

and reducing the severity and duration

of the symptoms and you know how I feel

because how I feel is on Tuesday they're

going to be starting it on Tuesday

morning and we're gonna have some

medications delivered that we're gonna

see if they work they certainly are

effective in other ways and they they

are safe from the standpoint is that

they're not they're not killing people

we're not gonna have that so a lot of

great things have been happening in that

regard I just want to finish and then

we're going to ask a couple of people to

say a few words that have been so much

in the forefront of this incredible job

that we've all been given but I want to

say that I know that this is a

challenging time for all Americans we're

enduring a great national trial and we

will prove that we can meet at the

moment I want to assure the American

people that we're doing everything we

can each day to confront and ultimately

defeat this horrible invisible enemy

we're at war and a true sense we're at

war

and we're fighting an invisible enemy

think of that for those of you are

feeling alone and isolated I want you to

know that we are all joined together as

one people eternally linked by our

shared national spirit we love our

country the spirit of courage and love

and patriotism no American is alone as

long as we are united and we are united

we're very united people are saying

things now that three weeks ago they

didn't talk that way

we're very United no force is equal to

the strength of a unit really a unified

America United America and America like

we have it right now for those word and

afraid please know as long as I am your

president you can feel confident that

you have a leader who will always fight

for you and I will not stop until we win

this will be a great victory this is

going to be a victory and it's going to

be a victory that in my opinion will

happen much sooner than originally

expected it's now attacking the enemy is

attacking 144 countries at this moment

144 that's unthinkable there's never

been anything like this and it's a

vicious it is vicious some people

recover well and some people have a hard

time we all know that but we will be

totally victorious we will then get our

economy up to a level that it was and I

in my opinion beyond because that will

be a pent up demand there is a pent up

demand and a lot of a lot of great

things will happen but I'm very proud of

our country I'm very proud I'm very

proud to be your president and it's just

something that's just you're very

special people so thank you very much

and I'm gonna ask if I might combination

to Pete why don't you start off

Thank You mr. president

just a little bit about what we're doing

in Washington California and New York we

understand that the states of Washington

New York in California the era seen a

steady increase in to voter 19 virus

cases in order to assist with additional

needs identified in those areas the

state of New York was approved for a

major disaster and declaration this

morning Washington State was also

approved earlier today California

submitted their request and the

president will consider it immediately

we have medical supplies in route to

these states including respirators

surgical masks gowns facial coveralls

gloves with quantities already delivered

to both Washington New York and

California and we anticipate additional

supplies to be delivered with the next

42 hours to all these states under

president Trump's unprecedented national

emergency declaration on March 13 FEMA

is assisting state local tribal and

territory governments including

reimbursing eligible emergency

protective measures taken at the

directional guidance of public health

officials in response to this emergency

all 50 states the District of Columbia

five territories and two tribes are

working directly with FEMA under the

nationwide emergency declaration for

kogas 19 with the assistance of the FEMA

regional administrators were throughout

the country we are working to address

the needs of state and local officials

everywhere States tribal and territorial

governs do not need to request separate

emergency declarations to receive FEMA

assistance under this nationwide

declaration the emergency declaration

does not authorize direct financial

assistance available to individuals such

as disaster unemployment assistance or

other needs assistance at this time just

a note on the USNS mercy based on

analysis of potential needs for hospital

beds on the west coast the decision was

made that the USNS hospital ship mercy

would have the greatest impact in

California the Department of Defense has

be given direction to dispatch it to Los

Angeles immediately DoD has advised that

the Mercy can get into position within a

week or less

of today's order even though there are

more cases right now in Washington the

projected needs for beds in California

is five times more of more that of

Washington the mercy will be used to

take pressure off local hospitals all

the medical needs and not for treating

over nineteen cases and finally a little

bit about the National Guard the federal

government continues to take aggressive

action and proactive steps to address

the Cova 19 threat as we attack the

health and safety or protect the health

and safety of the American people

remains our top priority the national

guy is especially positive and equipped

to assist federal state local agencies

while serving the public in response to

this unprecedented nationwide operation

President Trump has approved Washington

California New York National Guard units

under Title 30 but excuse me title 32

status for the co19

response the president's action provide

the nation's governor's continued

command of the National Guard forces

enabling States to use additional

resources to meet the missions necessary

in the Cova 19 response the National

Guard is a viable and responsive avenue

to provide a much needed asset that a

state managed and fairly supported and I

want to be clear this title 32

activation does not federalize National

Guard members the National Blood is

still under the authority of each

governor they will work in concert with

the Department of Defense and we've had

a lot of distance misinformation

circling and I want to make sure it is

understood that this is not martial law

the Department of Defense by way of a

mission assignment will lead this task

and and finally we continue to respond

to hundreds of requests from governor's

across the country and filling all their

critical needs Thank You mr. president

good evening but what I want to talk

briefly about is the defense production

act and and to give you the overview

here

using the full power of private

enterprise and you full force in the

federal government my job at the White

House is to make sure tactically working

with FEMA and HHS is the American people

gelareh healthcare professionals get the

gloves the masked and all of the

personal protective equipment they need

and I can tell you sir that since you

signed defense production Act my job

gotten and let me explain why the

defense production act in this context

has two primary functions one is

mobilization of the industrial base in

this case the public health industrial

base and the other is allocation of

resources both from the supply chain to

the manufacturers and from the

manufacturers to the end-users such as

the healthcare professionals now what

we're seeing on a purely voluntary basis

based on the leadership of this

administration we're seeing the greatest

mobilization of the industrial base

since World War two and every day I'm

working with organizations and companies

National Association of manufacturing

the National Council of textile

organizations and so on in terms of

building up rapidly our capabilities to

get what you need now let's think about

what mobilization means it can mean for

example repurposing a factory so Pernod

Ricard called us last week and they had

three hurdles they had to deal with they

called my office had to make a call to

Treasury FDA and HHS to clear the path

we got that done that day they started

their production that day moving from

alcoholic beverages to hand sanitizers

and as we speak a truck is moving

towards New York and will arrive there

Tuesday to share with the hospitals over

a thousand gallons of sanitizers so that

would be that would be a repurpose a

second example would be one that the

president had offered with with

Honeywell again Honeywell called the

White House asking for help from from

the president and what they said is look

we want to do this new factory in

Smithfield Rhode Island they called me

on a Friday morning and by that night we

had a contract in to HHS HHS flipped out

immediately

and I had Honeywell moving people and

equipment from Massachusetts to that

facility in Smithfield Rhode Island and

we're going to have those masks produced

within 30 days moving on the assembly

chain so my point is mobilization is

repurposing building up capabilities and

the the the the other portion is of

course the allocation of resources now

what I can tell you so far is that the

defense production actor has given me

quiet leverage when you have a strong

leader you can take a light hand

initially and so what we've seen with

this outpouring of volunteers from

private enterprise we're getting what we

need without without putting the heavy

hand of government down there will be

possibly cases down the road and the

manufacturers have actually asked me and

alerted me of this where some places in

the supply chain they may have problems

that the White House will have to break

through using the defense production act

we won't hesitate to do that the last

thing I'll tell you is that I also get a

lot of calls that are very disquieting

brokers are offering millions of items

where their goggles masked or whatever

and you go through three different

brokers tracing to a warehouse in LA

that's allegedly got 10 million masks

and they want to charge you seven times

what they cost that's price gouging we

are a message to the hoarders if you got

any large quantities of material that

this country needs right now get them to

market or get them to us we'll pay you a

fair price but if you don't do that

we're going to come for you and make

sure that doesn't happen in this country

and that would be a good use of the

defense production Act so I salute you

sir you've made my job easier and I

appreciate that Thank You mr. president

task force met this afternoon as we do

every day and let me begin today by

simply saying thank you to the American

people and thank you for the way that

people across this country seven days in

to 15 days to slow the spread the people

in communities large and small

America are responding are cooperating

are communicating not just on behalf of

their own health and the health of their

family but more importantly on behalf of

the most vulnerable among us so on

behalf of your president and our entire

task force just thank you to the

American people I also want to express

our appreciation to the governors across

the country

president today just announced action in

New York California and Washington State

as the latest demonstration that this

administration will do whatever it takes

to support the leadership at the state

and local level as as the American

people confront the spread of the corona

virus the legislative efforts that are

underway being negotiated on Capitol

Hill as we speak the bipartisan spirit

that's taking place there that's

reflected in all of our interactions

with state leaders around the country is

a great credit to the nation but it

should be a great encouragement to the

American people that that your

government at the federal level at the

state level working with courageous

health care providers all across America

coming together to meet this moment and

that is the way our system works it's

extremely important that the American

people recognize that one of the things

that makes America different is that we

have a system of federalism and that the

by putting FEMA in the lead the

president has emphasized that our

response to the corona virus is in in

the anthem of FEMA theme FEMA it is

locally executed state managed and

federally supported we want the people

on the ground the decision-makers to

have what they need we want States to be

able to manage the unique circumstances

in their States and whether it be the

legislation moving through the Congress

or this the efforts the president

announced today major disaster

declarations title 32 on the National

Guard resources flowing hospital beds

flowing we're going to continue to make

sure that our states have what they need

to meet this moment our task force

continues to focus on the priorities of

President

given us they are testing mitigation and

supplies and on the subject of testing

as is evident to people across the

country testing is more and more

available every single day we'll be

detailing tomorrow from this podium the

progress that we are making on tests at

this day's reporting 254 thousand

Americans have been tested and received

results in corona virus test with

slightly more than than 30,000 actually

testing positive there's a bit of an

encouraging word in that for every

American remember everyone that's being

tested now with the exception of our

health care workers our people that have

symptoms that make them think they may

have the corona virus and as our numbers

come in consistently because the 254,000

does not include all the local hospitals

or all the local labs in our states it's

working out to be about one in ten

Americans who've been tested who thought

they had corona virus actually had it

nine out of ten did not but we'll

continue to roll out the testing to

provide that resource to the American

people and we're working to make testing

happen faster we expect from work from

the commercial labs that we should be

caught up on the backlog in testing by

the middle of the week and we are urging

today on the president's behalf that all

labs would prioritize in patient testing

let me say again to all of the

commercial labs in the country you will

receive guidance from HHS tomorrow but

on behalf of the president and the White

House coronavirus Task Force we are

urging all commercial labs to prioritize

in patient testing we want people that

have been checked into a hospital that

are being treated for what they suspect

to be corona virus to receive those

tests more quickly also I'm pleased to

report that yesterday the FDA have

approved an emergency authorization on a

new test that should be in production by

the end of March it actually would be a

corona virus test the results of which

come back in 45 minutes and we're also

working the FDA is working with

manufacture

around the country to come up with even

faster more innovative tests and as we

told our governors in several calls this

week governors and state health

officials to simply contact FEMA for the

latest information on testing solutions

let me also say tomorrow when we gather

at this podium we'll be unveiling with

dr. Bob Redfield in the lead new

guidance for people that work in law

enforcement first responders people that

work in what we call critical

infrastructure in the country it was in

early March the CDC issued guidance for

people that were asymptomatic or did not

have symptoms but who had been exposed

to someone with coronavirus who gave

them guidance about being able to return

to work wearing a mask for 14 days and

tomorrow at this podium CDC will unveil

in cooperation with the Department of

Homeland Security new guidance which

will make it possible for people that

have been exposed to return to work more

click quickly with by wearing a mask for

a certain period of time let me also

amplify a point on behalf of the

President and on behalf of the State

Department about Americans abroad you

know one of the one of the reasons why

the United States is in a different

position today and portions of Europe

are and China and elsewhere is because

the president suspended all travel from

China he suspended travel from Europe

and the UK in Ireland but the State

Department is working around the clock

to assist Americans who may find

themselves overseas they're able to come

home there's no barrier to Americans

coming back to American soil they're

screened when they come home through a

series of airports but we're aware that

with flights being canceled some

Americans have found themselves unable

to find a way home and as the president

said we've been working very diligently

through the State Department to make it

possible there commercial flights have

been chartered we're also working with

the military for a back up on flights at

this point the State Department has

brought more than 3000 Americans back

home but speaking to the Secretary of

State today he wanted me to share a

website and a phone number for any

American might be looking on from

overseas you can call the smart traveler

enrollment program at one eight eight

eight four zero seven four seven four

seven or you can go online at step dot

state.gov this will allow our embassies

and consulates to gather important

information about your situation and

work to facilitate to bring you home let

me say finally as I began let me close

as the chairman or the leader of this

White House coronavirus task force we

are seven days into 15 days and the

American people are responding because

as we speak about supplies as we speak

about testing the most important thing

every American can do is heed the

guidance in the direction from your

state and local officials particularly

in areas where we have widespread

coronavirus infections but for every

American putting into practice these

measures that the president alluded to

at the very beginning of his remarks is

a way that we can that we can do this

America we can we can lessen the

magnitude of the corona virus in our

country with the cooperation compassion

generosity and prayers of the American

people we can slow the spread we can

protect the most vulnerable and we can

heal our land so let's do it America

thank you very much

so just a couple of little things that

we'll take some questions maybe you will

have some maybe you want that'd be a

shock

you shocked the American public but I

have to say on the testing they knew if

we if this works out if we think it

might the new test will be a very simple

one of much easier than the existing

test which is quite complex and not not

a lot of fun to take and this will be a

game changer but remember we inherited a

broken obsolete system it was good for a

small number of people but not good for

the millions of people that we're

talking about and we've made this into a

system that no matter where you go in

the world that's where they're going

that's what they want to do that's how

they're going to be doing it should

something like this happen again so our

people have done a fantastic job really

a fantastic job and I hope the new test

works out we'll know fairly soon I think

we're going to be knowing about that

very soon and hopefully it'll check out

or test out and we certainly are looking

forward to that that'll be a very simple

test by comparison won't be unpleasant

at all and one other thing the the ships

so we have the mercy and that's in it's

going to California as you know that's

in on the west coast now and you have a

sister ship that's essentially a twin

they're incredible I mean they're

incredible ships I've seen it I've seen

one of them and they are unbelievable

what they can do and the capacity many

operating rooms you know their wartime

ships they were meant for war many many

operating rooms stainless steel these

rooms are as good as there is anywhere

in the nation actually I spoke with

Governor Cuomo with a great conversation

today number of conversations actually

he's working very hard and we are going

to be bringing that ship that's called

the comfort so you have the mercy and

the comfort the comforts on the East

Coast and that ship will be coming over

the next three weeks three or four weeks

that's being it was in the middle of

maintenance and we are moving the

maintenance very very quickly and we're

also supplying the ship simultaneously

it's actually big supplies going into

those ships big

and that ship will be coming up here

over the next few weeks and we'll

probably be putting it in New York

Harbor and we're making arrangements for

that also as to where it's going to be

docked so you have the mercy and you

have the comfort they'll be coming up

the Mercy will start very very quickly

it'll be arriving in Los Angeles pretty

soon so we look forward to that a

question

ABC first of all Senator Paul tested

positive once the last time you had in

person contact with on top of Senator

Paul now four senators are in isolation

and the rules say that in order to vote

there's also two of them word contact

Rick is stirring up the critical

stimulus package vote expect Romney's

imagination do you think that Congress

should consider changing the rules to

allow them to vote remotely if it comes

to this critical stimulus I was thinking

about it today and I'm saying you know

you could have a lot of senators and a

lot of House members I spoke last night

was a very very good man who happens to

be in the house as you know and he's

he's just started and he tested positive

so you could have a large number of

people and they're from Congress you

could have between House and Senate you

could have a large number and I think

it's something at the least I mean I

fully understand why you should be there

I think it may be a constitutional

reason why you should but we could be in

a position where I would certainly be in

favor of it where they could vote from a

certain outside location I would be in

favor I was thinking about it today I

mean we could be in this with what's

going on

nobody's ever seen anything like this

you can have a lot of people in there

from from Congress and it was it would

certainly be they may tell me there's a

reason constitutionally and there may be

but I would be totally in favor of it on

a temporary basis

negotiations still have a ways to go on

the stimulus package are you concerned

about the timing at all we have we have

an interesting thing you know we we all

want to get to the same place but we've

different I am we want to and I just

wrote this down just a little while ago

we want to protect the worker very much

so do they so do the Democrats we also

want to protect the worker through their

companies we don't want to necessarily

we're gonna help the worker anyway but

ideally they can go back to one of their

great companies you know you have great

companies that are in financial trouble

now and we need money to help those

companies so they get back in to where

they should be health you know most of

these companies four weeks ago were

having the best year they've ever had

last year was the best year almost all

of them other than Boeing which is

incredibly had problems big percentage

of GDP but we have to be able to work

with Boeing Boeing is was a great

company and will be a great company

again I think shortly so we have to work

with the companies and they don't want

to do that it's crazy they don't want to

do that

I don't want stock buybacks so I don't

know where the problem is there but I

know that's one of the things that

they're talking about I do not want

stock buybacks

I don't want to give a bailout to a

company and then have somebody go out

and use that money to buy back stock in

the company and raise the price and and

then get a bonus okay so I may be

Republican but I don't like that I want

them to use the money for the workers I

want them to use the money for the

company to help the company in the

airline business to take care of their

planes and all of the things they have

to do including by buying new planes but

I don't want to type start I don't want

to have any stock buybacks the Democrats

are with me I don't know what the

problem is in that one because I can't

imagine that is too tough we want to we

want to be able to take care of our

people you're going to have things

coming up we're going to have some of

some of the elements that they're

talking about they're down to I mean

literally 95 percent of things that you

would think that they wouldn't agree and

you think the Republicans wouldn't agree

to it and unemployment as an example is

one of the things they talk about an

unemployment insurance I think we're

very close on that but

right now they're not so right now

they're not there but I think that the

Democrats want to get there and I can

tell you for a fact the Republicans want

to get there and I don't think anybody

actually has a choice

it's a bold package it's a big package

we do have money for one of the things

is we do have money for saving small

businesses I don't imagine the Democrats

because we have a lot of money set aside

for small businesses we also have a lot

of money set aside for big businesses

you know the big powerful companies that

were powerful for weeks ago and today

they're overextended look at the cruise

line that's a big that's a tremendous

business a big business very important

to Florida and it's unthinkable a month

ago a month just unthinkable they were

setting all sorts of records that were

they're building new ships we can't let

the cruise lines lines go out of

business I mean that would be massive

numbers of jobs for our country and

actually for the world but for our

country it's a massive business and it

doesn't take much to keep them going so

we have to we have to provide for that

but I think both the Democrats and the

Republicans are agreed that we have to

take care of our workers and we're going

to be doing that in numerous ways

including a substantial cash payment

yeah please when it comes to the defense

production act we know that governor's

across the country all day today we're

pleading with you to eautiful to utilize

the dpa for that allocation piece that

you missed and mr. Navarro why not use

it now if that would answer their pleas

for help but we are using it now the

fact that I signed it it's in effect but

you know we're a country not based on

nationalizing our business call a person

over in Venezuela ask them how did

nationalization of their businesses work

out not too well the concept of

nationalizing our business is not a good

concept but I'll tell you why as Peter

said we may have to use it someplace

along the chain but we're getting calls

here's the beauty of it if we go out and

we want let's say masks we don't know

who to call

mask but Hanes who makes things of

cotton various elements lots of things

it's a great company they called us and

they said we're going to make millions

of masks we got a call today from 3m and

there's a big article today the head of

3m they're going to make tremendous

products and they're more or less in

that business and if they're not like

for instance General Motors spoke to us

Ford spoke to us about doing ventilators

the beauty is they're calling us if you

go the National Rock nationalization

route we're going to tell a company to

make a ventilator they don't even know

what a ventilator is in the case of one

company they used to make them years ago

and they know how to make them you know

it's a very complex piece of equipment

frankly so what we're doing is I think

Peter said it may be better than

anybody's gonna say it we have the

threat of doing it if we need it we may

have to use it somewhere along the

supply chain in a minor way but we have

millions of masks being done we have

respirators we have ventilators we have

a lot of things happening right now so

just the threat of using it but using

it's actually a big deal I mean when

this was announced it said tremors

through our business community and

through our country because basically

what are you doing you're talking about

you're gonna nationalize an industry or

you're gonna national you're gonna take

away companies you're gonna tell

companies what to do the truth is most

people nobody would know where to start

there are companies out there that you

wouldn't think of that have called us

that say we can do ventilators we used

to do them years ago and they can do

them in large quantities other come if I

call companies and say you build menthol

is they don't even know what a

ventilator is so it's really working out

very well one of the reasons I read the

numbers to you is because we've given

vast numbers of just about everything

we've taken it out of our supply out of

our supply and we're restocking our

supply but we're really backing up the

governor's the governor's have to go out

do their things and you have a lot of

Governors they've done a fantastic job

you have some that haven't usually it's

the ones that complained that have the

problems but we've had a great

relationship as an example with Governor

Cuomo with Governor Newsome

we've had a great relationship with the

state of Washington those

three hot bets those are three hot beds

now we're also dealing with other states

as the Admiral said yesterday we're

doing with all of the states actually in

one form or another some are very

affected in a very minor way where you

have two people or three people and I

don't even mean deaths I mean literally

cases and that's different than New York

where you have you know tremendous where

everybody I lived there for a long time

everybody's extremely close tight and

you have a lot of cases in New York you

have a lot of cases in New York and

we're helping Governor Cuomo we're

helping governor Newsom

they've been frankly they've been total

gentlemen they want to get it done and

we want to get it done but doing do it

the way we're doing it is much better

it's really much better supply chain not

allocation not about manufacturing so

the companies it's not we coordinate

with the states and we are coordinated

with the states and for the most part

the coordination has been very good look

three days ago I had a phone call with

all the governors I actually allowed the

press to stay they weren't supposed to

stay and one person of the media said

that was surprising it's actually a

little risky doing that because we had

Democrats and we had Republicans and you

know they're politicians and they always

have something to say well I took a lot

of calls and we really didn't get one

nasty or bad response they were thanking

us for the job we did and I had to press

the end I don't know if you were there I

don't think so

I had the press standing there watching

they weren't supposed to be there but I

said let them stand there the governors

were very complimentary very very

complimentary and I watched I watched

over the last few days Governor Cuomo I

watched Gavin Newsom with California

watch both of them and they've been you

know very complimentary and those are

really the hot beds and so we want to

keep that going I'm very proud of this

country and I'm frankly very proud of a

lot of the politicians that normally

we're fighting with we have different

views on things you know little diff

view but we're going to get to the same

place we have different views but we're

going to get to the same place

yeah please I wanted to ask if you are

considering an executive order to free

elderly non violent criminals from

federal prisons we have been asked about

that and we're going to take a look at

it it's a it's a bit of a problem but

when we talk about totally nonviolent

we're talking about user totally

nonviolent prisoners we are actually

looking at that yes eliminated a key

position in China in July a medical

epidemiologist

embedded in China's Disease Control

Agency and it was just months before the

first cases were spotted in Wuhan so the

question is basically why the post was

eliminated anybody would you like to

take that one Bob but but you know this

is just like all of the other stuff that

you not you but that the press was

asking all of which turned out to be we

actually gave CDC more money not less

money they said we defunded it turned

out it was more money every one of those

things that were said were 100% wrong

and this sounds like another one of them

but anyway go ahead yeah as you know CDC

has offices all around the world right

now to do our function to detect and

prevent and respond to outbreaks where

they occur the china office is actually

being augmented as we speak as and we've

been embedded there for over 30 years

there's a reason they call it the

Chinese CDC because we've had that

productive partnership resolution again

our relationship with China is a very

good relationship I wish they told us

three months sooner that this was a

problem we didn't know about it they

knew about it and they should have told

us we could have saved a lot of lives

throughout the world if you look at

what's happening in Italy in Spain and a

lot of other countries we could have

saved a lot of lives throughout the

world Kelli president given the

diagnosis for Senator Paul

and people being a self-quarantine what

concerns do you have about the direct

threat to the function of the Senate the

ability to get this important package

that people are waiting for past and

should Americans be expecting you to

extend the 15 days given the climate of

how this is spreading it is well I hope

we won't have to it's possible but we'll

have to see how that works as far as the

Senate is concerned we are looking at

some you know some other folks are

feeling very good some are quarantined

but they're negative they may be they

may be it may be totally fine okay

others are positive we're just finding

this now for the first time I mean over

the last two days we found that threat

to the aid package that Americans are

waiting for no I don't see any threats

at all honestly I don't see any threats

at all it'll all work out

it is a question and a very good

question I thought that we are

considering I don't know if you can do

it constitutionally but we are

considering letting people vote

Senators Congressmen and women vote from

a separate from a separate location from

a outside namely a hospital or a home

depending on where they are so we are

looking at that it's a little trickier

question most people would believe but

we are looking at that very strongly

Kelley was alluding to it while we've

been up here they weren't able to get

into 60 votes to move the package for

the cloture vote

I'm just curious just a reaction to that

sir and then what is Mitch McConnell

telling you and miss Ackerman is well

we're dealing with him all the time and

we're dealing with Mitch we're dealing

with the other side everybody wants to

get there we'll see what happens I think

you'll I think you'll get there it's but

to me it's not very complicated we have

to help the worker we have to save the

companies because as soon as we're

finished with this war it's not a battle

it's a war as soon as we're finished

with this war our country is going to

bounce back like you've never seen

before

but we have to get it to that position

and we have to make sure that those

companies are whole that they haven't

been disbanded because if you do that

it's going to take much longer so in a

way it's being penny

have you don't but we want to help the

worker we want to help the companies

that the workers come from because if

those companies go out of business and

that includes small businesses we have a

tremendous amount of small business

working there you know that once they go

out and they don't come back that's a

much longer period of building it's

officer I apologize there was a woman

that was an American that was what she

being what was going on there bad things

were happening to her in a certain

country and we're we're really under the

feeling that we should keep it somewhat

private until she's already been freed

and I have to tell you general Milley

and the his people were unbelievable

they were not playing games general

Milley does not play games it's very

interesting guy they got her out where

she was seriously abused accosted and

and whatever the maximum word is other

than death that happened but we got her

out and she's okay and she's back with

her parents two speakers but previous

crises like the tsunami katrina past

presidents they've they call their

predecessors and said hey i need you to

step in do something like that do you

have any interest in reaching out to

President Bush Obama Clinton Carter

mysterious if that's meaningful consider

enough look I have the best people in

the world I think we're doing an

extraordinary job if you look at if you

look in let's say the h1n1 you look at

that whole that was a disaster that was

a tough period of time for our country

you look at so many other things that

weren't handled very well whether it's

Katrina or something else look I respect

everybody but I feel I have an

incredible team and I think we're doing

an incredible job when you look at the

job we're doing and what you have to do

is look at the approval numbers on the

job we're doing I think we're doing an

incredible job so I don't want to

disturb them bother them I don't think

I'm going to learn much and you know I

guess you could say that there's

probably a natural inclination not to

call now if I felt that if I called I'd

learn something and that would save one

life it would save one

okay I would make the call in two

minutes but I don't see that happening

completion ask you about the comments in

a couple of your former aides have said

today Gary Cohen that is it time to

start discussing the need for a date

when the economy can turn back on

where's Stephen and his saying drop the

hammer stay on the virus we're gonna

have to take this thing up front you

have to shut it all down

I suppose one asks with the tension

between the economic game was suffering

and of course the virus itself and the

casualty of America I'm of the opinion

we have to do great during this 14 days

during the 15-day period we'll know at

the end of 14 days pretty much we're

gonna have a pretty good idea how we're

doing I think you have to shut it down

and you have to see but you know

there'll be a point at which we say

we're back in business let's go savings

are not mutually exclusive you

understand I saw both of them today

intermesh well he's calling for a faster

a just a brutal shutdown and then open

up maybe a little bit faster so you know

this is that fine fine line look we did

a big shutdown when we wouldn't allow

people from China that could have been

very seriously infected that were when

we cut that off very early and then we

cut Europe off very early as you know so

that was also a new start opening game

three well I can't tell you that what I

have to say is that I think we're gonna

have good results I think the American

people have been amazing

I think our stimulus package will get

done and it will be a tremendous package

we're really not I mean they may not

have gotten those votes but they're very

close to getting a deal done so I'd be

I'd be surprised if they didn't and if

they don't I think frankly the American

people would be very upset with the

Democrats because the Republicans are

ready to approve a deal so the only

reason if the deal couldn't get done is

pure politics

New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio he

says that the city is gonna run out of

basic hospital supplies by April how do

you prevent New York City from becoming

the next Italy

well he should have you know the

hospital systems in various places some

have been stocked and ready to go for

nothing for this nothing this is beyond

anything that anybody ever thought

possible I think you could really say

this nobody can nobody can really doctor

nobody can really say oh gee this will

happen this is a very unique and

hopefully it will be unique for you know

many many centuries you know for a long

time hopefully we don't see this again

but again the systems are supposed to be

ready willing and able they're supposed

to be ready to go we are helping them a

lot and I have great love for New York

City and I have great love for New York

State and we're gonna help them a lot I

mean I was just saying we're sending our

ships up there we're sending on more

than just this ship we may be using if

we need we'll be using some of the

cruise ships that you've been reading

about we'll be using them also because

they're very immediate and very quick

they can be there very quickly we have

good dock insist you know systems and

the places that we're talking about so

we may be using some of the cruise

liners that we're talking about but no I

mean I think I think bill de blasio is

working very hard I think he's trying

very hard it's a tough situation for him

and every mayor because nobody has ever

seen the scale you know when you hear

you've given millions of masks and

you've given hundreds of thousands of

masks in a certain short period of time

and then you hear they need many many

more you know one of the things they

have started with respect to masks is

the sterilization process some are you

know really it works very well others

aren't really set up that way you throw

them out but we have a sterilization

process that's working very hard

speaking of that hand sanitizers you

know when you ask the question on the

companies and what's going on we have

many companies now companies that made

whiskey that made alcohol they've now

gone very quickly into the hand

sanitizers

all of you know you've been reading

about three or four big companies we're

doing incredibly well on that there was

no way if you took the existing

companies that something like that could

happen but it happens almost they'll

call Peter

Navarro or they'll call somebody in one

case they called me they said we can do

this we can do that we've had a lot of

those calls where companies want to

there's a company in New Hampshire a

great company they want to make

ventilators I'd never thought of them

for ventilators but they do make metal

equipment and things out of metal

they'll be great they'll make they'll

make a great product so Peter I think

you're seeing a lot of that hundreds of

billions of dollars for the Treasury

Department to use to bail out states and

localities as well as specific

industries such as cruises and hotels

will you commit publicly that none of

that tax their money will go towards

your every time I do it like for

instance I committed publicly that I

wouldn't take the four hundred and fifty

thousand dollar salary it's a lot of

money whether you're richer now it's a

lot of money and I did it nobody cared

nobody nobody said thank you

nobody said thank you very much no I

didn't commit legally I just said I

don't want it I don't want my salary I

work for zero I don't want my salary

nobody said oh thank you very much but I

guarantee you if I ever took it you

would go out after me you in particular

would go out after me I like Quincy so I

have no idea what they're talking about

with regard to the one element

everything's changing just so you

understood so changing but I have no

idea but every time I commit to this um

that committed to do me look I ran and

everybody knew I was a rich person I

built a great company and people knew

that but I agreed to do things I didn't

have to I still don't have to but my

company I told the kids who are running

it I'm not running it but I told him

don't deal with foreign companies don't

do I didn't have to do that I could have

just ran and I have I didn't have to do

that at all and instead of being thanked

for again not agreeing to do it but just

for not doing it I get excoriated all

the time

so I've learned let's just see what

happens because we have to save some of

these great companies that can be great

companies literally in a matter of weeks

we have to save them yeah please

national guard and then also okay so you

would said that there would be eight

large medical structures that will be

built in California with more than two

thousand beds and then I think I heard

you say there would be four small

medical structures in the state of

Washington with 250 beds and we could

you say what cities in areas those are

going to be in specifically so we are

filling the governor's request and so we

send that resource to them they'll put

it the best use they'll put it to where

they will have the most effect so we

don't dictate exactly where it goes

again it's a request from the state to

the federal government for a certain

asset and those assets are sent to the

the GUP the governor can use it as she

sees fit and you're still considering

you just said that using the cruise

ships as well so I don't I hope we don't

need them I hope you're gonna have great

luck on Tuesday morning we sent a lot of

the medicine we don't have to go into it

again but we sent a lot of the medicine

to Governor Cuomo I believe they already

have it and they have some very capable

people we spoke to dr. Zucker who is his

primary representative on this and we

spoke to the governor himself and I

think he's excited about it like I'm

excited about it now will it work I

think it has a really good chance I

think it's worth well why should we be

testing it in a test tube for a year and

a half when we have thousands of people

that are very sick they're very very

sick and we can use it on those people

and maybe make them better and in some

cases maybe save their lives so Governor

Cuomo told me they'll be using their

supply starting this apply on Tuesday

morning I think it's very exciting I

think because if that happens much of

what we're talking about with ships

and hospitals and all of the things that

we're doing and all of these masks and

everything that we're ordering

ventilators it's a whole different game

if that happens and we'll see there's

been some tremendous signs that this

could work now again you know some

doctors think it should go for years and

testing but you know this has been

something that's been around for many

years it's been phenomenal strong

powerful drug from malaria but we think

it might work on this based on evidence

based on very strong evidence we're

gonna see we're going to know on you

know sometime after Tuesday but you'll

have to ask Governor Cuomo I think

they're gonna start the process we've

gotten them the drug I think they're

gonna start the process of of

giving the drug mouth you know through

through mouth and I think that starts on

Tuesday morning he said and that'll be I

mean I'll tell you what I don't want to

get anybody overly excited but I'm very

excited by that by the prospect of it

then in addition to that their work in

NIH is working on vaccines and on

they're making great progress but the

vaccine does have to be tested for a

long period of time because you can't

give you know thousands millions of

people a vaccine and it turns out to be

dangerous so that does have to be tested

but this one's been taken for a long

time so we know pretty much one result

yeah I want to ask about China and

President Xi when was the last time you

had a conversation I don't want to

exactly say that but I have spoken to

President Xi about this specifically

about this and look he doesn't want this

you know this is not something that he

wants and and it happened it happened to

China and one thing they told me I was

told by a great Secretary of Agriculture

sonny Perdue that China has been buying

a lot of our farm product and I'm

looking at different pricing but China

has despite all of this and it started

it's delayed it a little bit obviously

but it started fairly recently but

Chinese buying we made a new deal as you

know with China very big trade deal and

China has been buying our agricultural

product

masks I mean they've been a supplier of

the United States of mask of yes in fact

they sent us a master sending master

Italy they are sending masks to Italy

we're in a very good process with masks

but I'm a little upset with China I'll

be honest with you because as much as I

like President Xi and as much as I

respect the country and and admire the

country I've great admiration for the

country what they've done in short

period of time of course our presidents

our previous presidents allowed that to

happen you should say thank you very

much to all of them but they should have

told us about this and I did ask him

whether or not we could send some people

in they didn't want that at a pride I

think really at a price they don't want

they don't want to sending people into

China to help them you know China's

strong country they have they have their

scientists and they have their doctors

very smart a lot of people I you know

but I did discuss that about sending our

people in and they didn't really respond

we went again they didn't respond if

they went in they would have been able

to tell us give us a much earlier

indication but we had an early

indication that's why I closed out China

I mean I felt it was my instinct but

that's why I closed out China at a very

early time please mr. president our

undocumented persons welcome at testing

sites and can they show to be tested

without fear of being reported to

immigration officials for possible it's

really a fair question I think I'll let

Surgeon General we know from a public

health perspective that it is important

that people who have symptoms can get

tested but as you heard earlier we are

pregnant well we know that it's the

virus doesn't judge based on where

you're from and so it's important that

we try to get people tested who has

symptoms but the important thing that we

really want people to hear is that in

patients need to be tested we need to

prioritize our health care workers and

one thing I would like to say to you all

very quickly on behalf of the doctors on

the task force health care workers we

hear you

we hear you and we absolutely are

prioritizing your health in safety

making sure health care workers can get

tested in patients can get tested people

at highest risk but to answer your

question yes we absolutely want to make

sure people who have symptoms who could

be spreading it can get tested

Department of Homeland Security

addressed that issue a few days ago

Customs and Border Protection actually

issued guidance that absent certain

circumstances the Customs and Border

Protection does not target emergency

rooms or health clinics and I would

refer you to the website they issued a

very clear statement making it making it

clear to any person that is in need of a

test or medical care that Customs and

Border Protection is not focusing on

emergency rooms or health clinics or the

drive-thru clinics without fear of yes

that's not the policy I'll make it the

policy and I was just saying as Mike was

saying that the answer is yes we will do

those tests because I think in that case

it's important I think that if you could

go you could say illegal alien you could

say illegal immigrant you could say

whatever you want to use your definition

of what you're talking about we're all

talking about the same thing yes we will

test that person because I think it's

important that we test that person and

we don't want to send that person back

in to wherever we're going to be sending

the person whether it's another country

or someplace else because you know we're

now bringing them right out of our

country but yeah we will test those

people okay we were talked about this

before the briefing you know a lot of

folks they're watching TV they're

reading up on this constantly if you are

not and you know somebody who's got a

pre-existing health condition but you

always said he'd go you know Alice I

just don't feel 100% and then your mind

just starts playing with you right you

think oh my god you know I coughed three

hours ago was that a first sign we

those people really start to say okay

maybe I need to call the doctors so you

don't want to flood them but a lot of

people that are that are probably

healthy right now are thinking whoa

that's all I'm hearing about it's all I

can think about when should I

either call a doctor or get tested the

vice president gave an important

statistic this morning only 10% of the

people who have symptoms who've been

tested actually tested positive for

coronavirus meaning 9 out of 10 people

who actually likely had symptoms do not

have the corona virus so I want people

to understand that so that they are

reassured I also want to direct people

to a website we've been telling them

about all the time coronavirus gov

coronavirus gov has information to walk

you through the symptoms fever cough

shortness of breath body aches and what

to do if you have symptoms or you're

worried the most important thing we can

tell people is call your health care

provider talk to your health care

provider information that coronavirus

gov to walk you through when to come in

and win and what to do yesterday

I'm just curious turkey tell us what

that was like for you you get a lot of

people are gonna be going through this

but we stand by the phone where you just

didn't have an iced tea

what did you yeah what was that like and

what did you do that kind of until that

time to keep your mind at ease the test

was very quick but it goes a fair amount

up into your sinuses and it's not

comfortable and that's the reason it

probably is a good opportunity to say

again to any American looking on if you

don't have symptoms you don't need to

test and current testing format although

they're evolving regularly now we just

mentioned that I think at the end of

this week that me a new test and there's

all new technologies I would say again

to all the governor's that are looking

on and their state health officials

contact FEMA will give you all the

latest information on new testing that

is available including steps we're

making where Americans would be able to

test themselves and send it in

but well for me and mrs. pence it was a

it was kind of a pinch it was kind of

invasive but we were grateful for the

support Walter Reed Hospital processed

the test very quickly they had a lab at

the hospital to be able to do that and

gave us the results quickly but it also

informed me we we were wondering during

that time as a family and it's one of

the reasons that presidents made it such

a priority that we brought all these

commercial labs together and now more

than a quarter million tests have been

done we believe we'll be caught up if

you will by the middle of this week on a

backlog of tests but we announced today

that we are directing commercial labs to

prioritize people who are in the

hospital for tests is we want to

continue to work with new technology and

with the new focus and guides from HHS

to get the results of that as quickly as

possible for every American so if they

have coronavirus they can be properly

treated or they can have the peace of

mind that they may have some other

respiratory ailment but not that Karen

pence knows this because the vice

president told me he said she actually

hailed it better than him I didn't

handle it so well either don't worry

about Pelosi earlier today said that the

house may introduce its own bill are you

willing to work with the speaker on a

House bill and given what happened in

the Senate

just a short time ago what are you

willing to do to get this bill over the

finish line given the urgency secondly

did you send a letter to North Korea's

Kim jong-un seeking cooperation with

numerous countries if they need help

we'll give them help does nobody has

what we have especially with the new

tests that are coming out North Korea

Iran by the way and others we are open

for helping other countries and there's

a very serious time in North Korea's

going through something Iran is going

through something very very strong we

let Iran is really going through a very

difficult period with respect to this as

you know so I've put the it's really a

glad-hand it's all it is to North Korea

to Iran and to many other countries and

we're working with as the doctor can say

we're working with many countries with

respect to the problems that they have

again it's a over 140 countries right

now but North Korea Iran and many other

countries we will help and we're willing

to as an example this new test if this

new test works out where instead of

going through what we all went through

with this rather difficult test to put

it nicely we would have is that just a

swab on the tongue doctor just a how

does that work not to the same it

doesn't go all the way up and hangs a

right under your eye right so that's a

tough test so if we do that that the

procedure the test and nobody has this

in the world nobody has this this is

developed by us we think it's going to

be certified shoot so we think it's

going to be very good but if we have

that we'll be able to help a lot of

countries something please

I mean just a follow-up on that are you

willing to work directly through your

pollution

however we have to we have to help the

American worker we have to help the

countries from which the American

workers I mean they came out of these

companies that were doing phenomenally

well you saw what payroll was going way

up where wages were going way way up

there's never been a time like this

we can't lose those companies and we

want the worker to be happy and whipping

I think more generous than anybody has

ever been we want to take care of the

worker but we want to make sure that

when we win the war it's only a question

of its when not if when we win the war

against the virus we want to make sure

those companies are ready to charge

forward not that they've been disbanded

because we were penny wise and dollar

foolish there are factors around the

world that produce medical protective

equipment that are used in European

hospitals they've been certified for use

and at the highest level in European

hospitals is the FDA in your

administration willing to look at a

waiver for that equipment to be sold

from those facts well we're just a

question a little while ago and the

answer is we may but we may not need it

we do a very high standard or standard

is higher please mr. president I was

hoping to give some guidance to American

families who are anxious about their

financial futures earlier today on one

of the Sunday morning shows the

secretary of the Treasury Steve minutiae

was talking about the millions of

Americans who are impacted by these

shutdowns that are happening in cities

and sometimes full states yeah and

secretary manoosh in said that this

shutdown this lockdown could last 10 to

12 weeks perhaps early into June given

that would you consider another fiscal

stimulus another check to these gonna

see what happens hopefully we won't need

it but we might but we're gonna see what

happens look the greatest thing we can

do is win the war the war is against the

virus that's the war we do that

everything I really believe everything's

gonna fall into place it's going to be

beautiful I call it a pent up demand

people are dying to go out to a

restaurant people are dying to go onto

airplanes and I think well there's a

tremendous pent up demand you may be

surprised to the degree I think it's

going to go very rapidly because this

wasn't a financial crisis just the

opposite this was a medical

mr. president your family sell stocks

they don't have said I own things that

make any alternates - you know it's very

interesting that you ask a question like

that you know nasty question and yet it

deserves to be asked I guess what I've

done by deciding to run under this I

knew this first day I said if I win it's

gonna cost a lot of money it costs me

billions of dollars to become president

to be President of the United States in

things that would normally be run at a

certain thing even people that don't

like me because they think I'm too tough

on the border now some people love me

for it other people don't like me at all

you know it's very funny my wife we were

at a charity event in New York City I

had just announced that I was running

and we were at the Robin Hood Foundation

at the Convention Center which now we're

going to be converting to hospitals for

Governor Cuomo and I was walking in and

there was a smattering of boos and a

smattering of cheers I was getting both

and are very popular first lady she's

turned out to be a very popular people

have great respect for her but a very

popular first lady said to me huh that's

strange I've never heard anybody booing

you that was very early on because I

think I called for strong borders right

call for something that other people

don't like you know and I knew this

would happen I knew it was gonna happen

but the fact that I ran and I knew as

soon as they announced when I ran I said

it's gonna cost me a fortune not only in

terms of actual cost look at my legal

costs you people everybody everybody is

suing me I'm being sued by people that I

never even heard of I'm being sued all

over the place and doing very well but

it's unfair but I say this in terms of

running for president and I don't think

rich people Michael Bloomberg spent now

is determine almost a billion dollars

and look what happened

think it's very hard for rich people to

run for office it's it's far more costly

it's it's just a it's a very tough thing

now with all of that being said I'm so

glad I've done it because you know there

are a lot of rich people around got a

lot of rich friends but they can't help

and they can't do what I've done in

terms of helping this country we are we

are doing things we got sidetracked by

the invisible enemy but you know what

when you look at what we've done I said

before with the veterans with with all

of the things we've done especially

choice but when you look at all of

accountability when you look at all of

the things that we've done rebuilding

the military the tax cuts which thank

goodness we had the tax cuts because we

had cushion oh and without that this

would have been catastrophic

we had a big cushion I mean with all of

the losses that you've seen in the stock

market we're basically back and with

this horrible thing if this would have

happened before you would have had

nothing left this was all cushion but I

will say that it costs me billions of

dollars to be president and especially

with all the money I could have made for

the last three four years and I didn't

because I was being president I have no

interest in it I'm allowed to you know I

don't know if you know George Washington

they say he was a rich man supposedly

relatively rich and he ran the

presidency aniversary ran his business

they say he had two desks nobody

complained until I came along I got

elected as a rich person but nobody

complained until I came along so it cost

me billions of dollars to be president

and I am so happy I did it because who

cares who cares I'm really happy with

the job we're doing and I'm glad that

this team and me are here for this

horrible thing I mean it's a number of

people have said it but and I feel it

actually I'm a wartime president this is

a war there's a war different kind of a

war that we've ever had and when you

look at the economics of the war in the

past we used to stimulate to get people

jobs now we're stimulating to protect

people because we don't want them to

work because we want them to stay away

from each other we don't want them to

gather social so social gathering so

we're paying billions of dollars more

than that so that they don't gather they

don't because we have to defeat this

virus and we will but it cost me

billions and billions of dollars to be

president and I am so happy I did it

your priority is to Americans and of

course this nation but what about have

you ever considered supporting for

foreign countries who are also fighting

this global pandemic that was the other

question

and I'm honored to help and the doctor

has helped the Surgeon General is

speaking to other countries all the time

they're asking them questions what do we

do nobody has ever seen anything like

this they're calling our people all of

the time and yes I have let it be known

that will help people including North

Korea including Iran and including many

other countries it's very important to

do that

are you considering any financial

support for them let me quote to you to

retired a retired general and a retired

Admiral from the US global coalition no

matter how successful we are in fighting

the threat of Kovach 19 pandemic at home

will never stop and unless we're also

fighting it around the world so

financially is there anything in the

stimulus bill and then are you

considering no not in the stimulus bill

but we are very much I mean we give away

billions of dollars for as an example

AIDS in Africa we're still fighting that

battle it's a tremendous battle

tremendous war also but we're fighting

it here as you know in 10 years now it's

eight years because I started it should

have been started before long before I

got here because they had the answer

even before but we're fighting that

battle will be aids-free in

approximately eight years it looks like

that is going to happen we're spending a

lot of money but we're spending a lot of

money with other countries if you look

at the aid that we give to other

countries we give billions and billions

and billions of dollars to other

countries and a lot of times I say you

know we could save a lot of money we

shouldn't and then they come in I say

what's it used for it's used to fight

malaria it's in countries that are very

poor

it's used to fight AIDS in Africa it's

used to fight many other things many

other things and I don't think I've ever

said no I can't it's just so terrible

countries that we have really were not

involved with him very much other than

there would be tremendous death

tremendous death I mean you can get a

list and I could get you a list we give

away billions of dollars to other

countries and we are giving away a lot

in terms of everything and probably will

end up doing economically doing

something for other countries but when

I'm presented with these lists that yes

there are in Africa were fighting AIDS

or were fighting something else I tell

you what I start off by saying you know

we should say we could save a lot of

money and then by the time they walked

those listed to my office I say we have

to keep doing that that's humanity you

took it how about one more question yes

person I want to ask you about the

states that have not yet issued stay at

home waters so in Texas for example the

hospitals have said that they expect to

run out of beds by the end of April if

the governor does not issue a state on

order Dallas genic just announced an

order it's very it's not a septic oh

that's a great governor you're talking

about Greg Abbott Abbott in Texas and

he's a great governor and he knows what

he's doing

a lot of the areas that he's talking

about a lot of the counties just talking

about or not very strongly affected you

know it's very different kind of a place

in a great place but I have total

confidence in governor Greg Abbott Idaho

West Virginia Iowa Nebraska are much

different than New York then California

Los Angeles as an example or San

Francisco they're much different I mean

it's it's much different the hot spots

right now our state of Washington and

probably number one by far right now is

New York that's the hot spot like no

other hot spot in California Zod's but

but New York right now is is the leader

there's no question a final quarter you

sir your administration is backing a

lawsuit to

the Affordable Care Act's have given

that people are losing their jobs now

and need health care more than ever

would you consider rethinking your

position on that well that's a lawsuit

coming out of Texas again that was

headed up by Texas and what we want to

do is get rid of the bad health care and

put in a great health care and we will

always I will say this I can make this

commitment to you the Republican Party

is fully backing pre-existing conditions

now if we could get a great health care

plan which would need the house to do

but if we can get a great health care

plan we will only do it if we have

pre-existing conditions totally back so

we're back in preexisting but would like

to get rid of bad health care now we are

running the bad health care much better

than it was ever run and we're making it

better but it could be much better than

it is and so what we want to do is

terminate it have a great health care

but we will only do it with pre-existing

we will back pre-existing conditions

okay what if this thing thank you all

very much thank you we'll be back we'll

have a meeting tomorrow
