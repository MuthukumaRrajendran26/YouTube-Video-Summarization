[Music]

don't move you well I think we're gonna

get you willing to get you let me get

you a father this one coming up how do

you feel huh

but you didn't begin to be doing this

my campaign gurus big supporters at

everything that's not just my jacket

- she can

good morning lady Smith so glad to see

so many people out on Climate Action Day

in this amazingly beautiful part of our

region on Vancouver Island

I'm Sheila malcomson I'm the nyos member

of the legislature and we are so honored

to be here in Samina

First Nations Territory a Theriault

territory led by Chief John Eliot

unceded territory to meanest people to

be here on climate action day with two

strong defenders of the coast like joke

meet Singh and Bob Chamberlain is a

specially powerful statement for all of

us in our community our writing Nanaimo

lady Smith has a very strong history of

coastal defense from New Democrats my

mentor and friend Jean Crowder was such

a strong defender against oil spills she

fought very hard to get abandoned

vessels out of Ladysmith Harbor took her

legislation all the way to Ottawa surf

this region for 12 years and and changed

our country in many ways Jordans

principle and a lot of work on

indigenous missing and murdered women

that was all jeans legacy and I was so

proud to be able to carry that work on

as Ladysmith and and I'm most member of

parliament our history of standing up

together really infused that work that I

did I went to Ottawa really to stop the

Kinder Morgan pipeline

I thought all we had to do was defeat

the Conservatives in this riding and

that's what would have killed the Kinder

Morgan pipeline never having thought for

a minute that our Liberal government

would actually buy the pipeline that was

so here we are still fighting for the

coast another election with another

strong community behind us I'm now the

parliamentary secretary for environment

in the BC NDP government

and honored to be but we cannot do this

work alone British Columbia needs a

strong partner in the federal government

dedicated wholly to coastal protection

and to standing up with coastal people

and for coastal people and that's why I

think we have of the extraordinary gift

in our writing having a candidate like

Bob Chamberlain

there is no one that I have seen on the

front line of more of these fights in

coastal communities standing up against

the Kinder Morgan pipeline standing in

the strongest way in the courts and with

the people on the front line and in

particular Bob's work after three

decades of intractable fighting over

protecting wild salmon and trying to get

fish farms out of wild salmon right

migration routes it's this man Bob

Chamberlain that got the breakthrough

after three decades to work using the

principles of the United Nations

declaration on the rights of indigenous

people with the BC NDP government to get

fish firms out of the wild salmon

migration routes

it's a extraordinary breakthrough and

and the epitome of this man's work as a

coastal defender and so on climate

action day and on the beautiful

shorelines of lady Smith Harbor with my

great friend jug meat sing and so many

of our community members here thinking

of the next generation so grateful to

the young children that have come out to

stand with us today I introduce to you

my friend

coastal defender and animal lady Smith's

future Member of Parliament

Bob Chamberlain good morning everyone

I also want to acknowledge that right on

the unceded territory of this de Minas

First Nation I'm very honored to be here

on climate action day with my dear

friend Sheila malcomson and my other

dear friend jug meat Singh it's only

right that we gather here by the ocean

something that has been

mainstay of the work that I have

accomplished in regards to safeguarding

the environment but it's things such as

the ocean which are causing great

concern to people for a variety of

reasons of course one is climate change

the undeniable fact that the oceans will

rise when the glaciers are melting and

the ice caps are disappearing and in the

face of this reality this global reality

we have a prime minister that thought it

was a good idea to buy a 60 year-old

pipeline for four billion dollars okay

fine 4.5 billion and if you've got to

build another one you know it's going to

be four times that amount by the time

it's done it's a not a good investment

for Canada imagine if we took that

amount of resourcing and money and put

it into green alternative renewable

energy we would be well down the path on

the transition that is necessary and

that necessity is about ensuring the

global temperature is a place or does

not raise too far so our children can

enjoy a measure of the life that we have

so the environment is there to provide

for them as it has provided for us and

chile's mentioned the fish farm struggle

in the wild salmon I need to acknowledge

the team that I had with me I was part

of a very dynamic team including premier

Horgan's team which we are the first

table to implement the United Nations

declaration on the rights of indigenous

people it was a shared decision-making

model it was free prior and informed

consent and we have proven to Canadians

that it can happen the world does not

end and we have agreements which

safeguard the environment wild salmon

reconciliation it's all possible and I

want everyone to know to advance this in

a meaningful way on the national stage

it's all possible because of people such

as my dear friend jug meat who I have

the greatest honor to introduce now

Chuck meat Singh thank you

[Applause]

friends I am so honored to have the

chance to be able to stand with Sheila

malcomson and deny deny Mo MLA and with

my incredible candidate bob chamberlain

candidate for the night my lady smith

today we want to talk about defending

the coastline and we've got a beautiful

coastline here in BC and this is

something that's particularly important

given today is the week of climate

strikes globally so people around the

world are taking to the streets

particularly young people and they're

demanding that leaders listen to them

they are calling out The Betrayal

they're saying how dare you betray our

futures they're angry and they're

frustrated and the right to be because

in the face of this global crisis this

climate crisis world leaders have

ignored young people have ignored the

evidence here in Canada mr. Trudeau in

the face of a global crisis in the face

of climate crisis fought a pipeline for

4.5 billion dollars not only did he buy

one back in 2015 mr. Trudeau promised

that he would not build the Trans

Mountain pipeline he promised he

wouldn't build it he became government

not only did he is he committing to

buying it or to building it he's bought

one

the question is this how can people

trust mr. Trudeau now if he campaigned

in 2015 saying that he wouldn't bill

trans mountain and then once he became

prime minister after listening to the

energy lobbyists who lobbied him and his

government 1,500 times he bought a

pipeline and then on one day declared a

climate emergency on the second date

approved building a pipeline and that's

what we have with mr. Trudeau

and we look at this beautiful coastline

and we think about the young people we

think about the marine diversity we

think about how beautiful this is and

how we need to protect it and that's why

today we're committing to boldly

protecting this coastline with a coastal

protection fund this one's going to

protect salmon help us reinforce the

coast guard make sure we continue the

work that Sheila mentioned that she

started where she built on from Ching

Crowder the work

making sure in Benin vessels are cleaned

up because they pose a risk to polluting

the coastline we're gonna boldly invest

to protect our coastline and we're gonna

make it very clear today that our pledge

our commitment as New Democrats is we

will always fight the Trans Mountain we

will continue to fight against a 700%

increase in tanker traffic and the

diluted bitumen oil that could spill and

and threaten the entire coastline one

spill would devastate the entire

environment so instead of mr. Trudeau

we'd like to say pretty words before an

election and then bicep pipeline or Mr

Shearer who doesn't even believe that

there is a crisis New Democrats are

committed to not only committing to

fighting but also putting massive

investments to fighting the climate

crisis and protecting our coastline

thank you very much and I'm ready to

take any questions that you might have

[Music]

hi it's Annie Bergeron Oliver with CTV

national news the Green Party has said

they will phase out bitumen production

between 2030 and 2035 I'm wondering if

your party would do the same thing

our plan is that the future for Canada

is a future where we're not using carbon

for fuel and that's why we would

immediately end for fossil fuel

subsidies right away

take that those billions of dollars and

invest that into clean and renewable

energy we would massively invest in

transportation public transportation to

electrify and to reduce our emissions

and we would retrofit all homes we need

to get off of carbon as a fuel and we

are absolutely committed to doing that

so is that a yes you would phase out

bitumen and how and when our plan is

exactly that that we need to transition

in a bold way there's no question about

it the future of our planet depends on

us movie to clean and renewable sources

and that means in all areas of energy we

need to stop burning carbon there's no

question about it we need to stop

burning fossil fuel the emissions are

massive the impact in the environment is

massive and our future generations the

kids of course striking today are

demanding that we don't betray the

future that we commit today so

absolutely we need to move away from all

carbon as a source of fuel that is our

commitment Jerome Avenue Canada shall

he is it clear

I don't wanna continue it the monsoon a

it Capozzi no Prabhupada found along the

amo

sure it's obviously greatest choice who

she wants to meet with but it's really

clear that mr. Trudeau promised really

clearly in 2015 that he would not build

the Trans Mountain that he would oppose

it and then once he got into office not

only did he break that promise he bought

the pipeline and then approved its

expansion the day after he declared at

climate emergency that is something that

should have everyone pause and that's

why Canadians are saying we can't trust

and we don't believe mr. Trudeau we

don't believe him with any promises that

he makes now when he broke those

promises so horribly right after getting

elected and getting into power it's

clear that he works for the powerful the

people at the very top he met with the

energy lobbyists 1,500 times and the

results are clear

he continues to subsidize the fossil

fuel sector he exempted the biggest

polluters from the price on pollution

and he bought a pipeline for 4.5 billion

dollars yeah a bit mere declaring to

you can't know the trans mountain

peeping cbc news yes or no do you

support the liquefied natural gas

project to northern BC well with that

project my position has been very clear

I believe the future has to be a future

we were no

using any carbon any fossil fuel for

energy and I want to invest I want to

end fossil subsidies and invest in clean

and renewable energy my position is the

future of our planet has to be one where

we do not provide any fossil fuel

subsidies and we invest in clean and

renewable energy you've said the future

of energy like what you just said why

not come out strongly against this and

yeah why not come out strongly against

this very clear that future what I'm

gonna do is I'm gonna end immediately

fossil fuel subsidies I'm gonna take

those those those billions of dollars

and invested in clean and renewable

energy I'm gonna make sure our future is

one where we're investing all of our

public dollars into renewable energy and

we're building a future where young

people can say you know what these these

leaders are fighting for us they can I

want to look at young people in their

eyes and say you know what I'm not gonna

let you down I'm gonna fight with every

ounce of my power and skill to be able

to defend this environment so you have a

bright future coal is just our Black

Press media you say you're going to

invest in protecting the coast

approximately how much dollars are you

going to invest and protecting the coast

sure so today's announcements a 40

million dollar announcement to support

the coastline to support protecting

salmon to support the removal of

derelict vessels to invest in protecting

this beautiful code long coastline it's

also a contrast where we want to defend

the coastline mr. trudeau wants to

increase the tanker traffic by 700

percent

risking a diluted oil bitumen spill

which could result in devastating impact

to this coastline so our position is

very clear we were opposed to trans

militant and that's a part of our

defending the coastline commitment local

residents are very concerned about coal

and grain freighters that have been

parking up and down the coastline what

is your position on those freighters

yeah they should not be parking here

it's absolutely irresponsible the fact

that they're using a loophole and

they're creating a great threat to this

community in to this to the coastline

here and something that is needs to be

needs to be solved and and right now

that loophole that exists is is being

exploited unfairly and wrong hi back to

me again hi obviously fighting climate

change is going to take the nation and a

lot of the plans involve cooperations

from provinces and municipalities and

some of it

not federal jurisdiction how do you get

the provinces on side and how well would

your plan work if you can't get all of

the provinces and territories on board

so it's a fair question in sense it's

gonna take a lot of work it's hard to

work with it's gonna be hard to work

within our federal system but it's a

beautiful system and it requires that

hard work and we know if we put the

right incentives on the table the right

investments on the table we can

encourage the right outcomes we know

that it has to be a collaborative

approach and we're committed to that but

there's some investments we can make

right away there's some things that we

can do right away ending the fossil fuel

subsidies is something that the federal

government can do without any

negotiation with provinces that's a

commitment that we can make right now

and I'm making that commitment we can

also make sure we invest in clean and

renewable energy that's something we can

do right away with respect to our

investments in public transit for

example cities are asking for these

investments municipalities are saying we

need help and we want to be a better

partner between the federal government

and the municipal government who are

demanding for the people that live in

their cities and the municipalities they

need more investments and we're

committing to investing in clean and

electric transportation electrifying

public transit and massively investing

in it do you think it's realistic that

you're your party can get elected

without mass supporting the prairie

provinces I couldn't hear you you want

to get that sure do you think it's

realistic your party can get elected

without mass support and the prairie

provinces we believe in having support

across the country we need support

everywhere in the prairies are where New

Democrats began with our powerful

movement to fight for Medicare it was in

Saskatchewan where the the first leader

of this party Tommy Douglas began the

journey to bring Universal Medicare to

Canada I want to build on that vision

that was brought to life by the prairies

I want to take it to the next step and

make sure we cover Universal Pharma care

as well and then go beyond that to

dental care vision and hearing care and

head-to-toe health care that includes

mental health and rehab services thank

you so much everybody please appreciate

you being here Thank You Jesse thank you

auntie Sheila and

you
