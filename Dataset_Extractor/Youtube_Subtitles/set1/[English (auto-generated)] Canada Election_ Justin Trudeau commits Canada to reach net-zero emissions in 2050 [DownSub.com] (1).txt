you

good morning everyone it is great to be

here at Nano 1 joined by our strong

liberal team and particularly the next

member of parliament for right here in

Burnaby South Neil Umbra

alehrer Sangamo own Italian country yada

yada famiiy the owner of a powder not

blow for a deal a class Moya today I

want to take a bit of time to reflect on

our liberal vision for the future of

Canada a vision that moves Canada

forward and does so by tackling the most

fundamental challenge facing our

generation climate change last Friday we

saw historic demonstrations for climate

action in cities around the world more

than four million people participated in

climate strikes from Germany to Uganda

from Australia to Bangladesh people

young and old showed up to demand

leadership and change we shouldn't be

surprised we are living in a

breathtaking pivotal moment citizens are

coming to a major realization the

climate choices the climate crisis is

real and people are waking up and it's

because young people led by the likes of

sixteen-year-old Greta Thornburg are

driving the conversation they've seen

the science things are now more urgent

than ever before they've seen the impact

with floods and fires destroying entire

communities with forced migration with

dwindling air quality with species

extinction and these kids are scared

because they know this will become their

mess to clean up

climate change has been a catalyst for

some tough but inspiring conversations

with my own kids who like so many of

their friends just seem to get it

unfortunately not everyone can say the

same some politicians usually in

conservative parties throw their hands

up and say there's nothing we can do

they record falling back on the approach

they no vest neglecting our environment

and pretending climate change isn't real

or if you're former conservative Finance

Minister Joe Oliver you admit the

climate change is real then you turn

around and insist it's a good thing for

Canada but here's what we as liberals

say the climate crisis is real but we

can't waste any more time

conservative leaders have wasted enough

it will take courage and planning

grassroots leadership and government

investment but if we mitigate and adapt

we can win the fight against climate

change and we can lead that fight from

right here in Canada in fact we have to

since our country's warming nearly twice

as fast as the rest of the world

we hope so nickimja days on the press

does she happied none years from now I

want to look my kids in the eyes and say

we stepped up in the fight against

climate change and we've already started

the hard work our plan isn't perfect

but we're making real progress putting a

price on pollution protecting our oceans

phasing out cold

banning single-use plastics these aren't

piecemeal policies but crucial parts of

a larger plan businesses are stepping up

to but not fast enough

we need them to act because as a

government and as citizens we can't do

it alone

we have to move faster than ever before

we have to stay hungry for change we

have to keep going

so a reelected Liberal government will

keep moving Canada forward Canada is on

track to reduce our emissions by 30

percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels

and just this morning we committed to

exceeding this target and to join in

countries around the world in reaching

Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions by

2050 that means not putting any more

carbon emissions into the air than we

take out this will be a huge opportunity

for Canadians it'll require us to slash

our emissions transform our economy and

use the power of nature like planting

trees and protecting ecosystems to bring

us to NAT zero it's an ambitious target

but it's doable here in Canada will

appoint a group of ex

to help us chart a path forward and

we'll legislate five-year targets along

the way we will hit Net Zero by 2050 not

only because we can but because we must

and a big part of our plan to get to Net

Zero includes creating an economic

ecosystem where clean tech companies can

thrive the global clean tech economy is

a multi trillion dollar opportunity and

so the clean tech market is exploded

this is the way the world is going this

is the next great economic frontier

companies and countries are already

innovative they see what's coming and

they want in not only to curb the

impacts of climate change but to

capitalize but conservatives want to

bury their heads in the sand denying the

science and hoping that other countries

will step up they have no plan to reduce

emissions they have no plan for jobs

they have no plan for the future all

they've done is Drive innovators away

liberals on the other hand want Canada

to lead in the global clean tech race we

want to drive that solution that's why

they reelected Liberal government will

cut corporate tax in half for zero

emissions clean tech companies

this would include for example companies

building battery technology for electric

vehicles for those working on

next-generation solar panels we have the

talent we have the vision and we already

have the reputation as the best place in

the world to start and grow a clean tech

ecologic my friends here's the reality

the major policy discussions ahead of us

will be centered around mitigating

climate change this is a fact this is

our great global challenge politicians

academics scientists entrepreneurs

Canadians we will all be seized with it

so here's the question you have to ask

yourself do you want to be represented

by a team that has a serious ambitious

plan and is committed to doing more or

do you want a team of climate deniers

with no long term vision for Canada's

environmental and economic future

conservatives want to take us backwards

to make pollution free again this isn't

an exaggeration they've told Canadians

that that's what they'll do they ignore

climate change because they don't think

it's an economic issue but they couldn't

be more wrong

you pay for climate change when your

basement floods or when the highway

washes out you can't make it to your

shift you pay for climate change when

you're facing higher insurance premiums

or when tourists skip your town because

the smoke from neighboring forest fires

is too much you pay when a drought

devastates your crops and you pay when

deadly heat waves paralyze your city for

days climate change is already making

life more expensive for Canadians we

have to take it seriously and that

starts with setting ambitious but

essential goals and outlining how we're

going to get there we're not just

investing in clean tech and public

transit and climate resilient

infrastructure we're investing in

Canada's future we're investing in our

kids

and we're investing in a better tomorrow

here's the long and the short of it our

plan creates jobs and reduces pollution

the conservative plan will cost more and

do less Doug Ford Jason Kenney Andrew

Shearer this generation of conservative

politicians are all the same

when it comes to the environment they

just don't care and they just don't get

it

news alpha while the questions easy

simple new solutions markee Mazyck

the conservator no canary palms no we on

worthless ill the feathers in this

election

Canadians are faced with an important

choice will we move backwards or will we

stand together and choose forward here

is our promise as liberals we won't give

tax breaks to the 1% or to big polluters

but we will make life more affordable

and fight climate change that's what

we're offering a real plan for families

and for the future I'm for moving

forward for our planet for our kids for

everyone

yes

[Applause]

next we're shifting CBC News your plan

offers very few details on how Canada

will get to this ambitious goal of net

zero emissions by 2050 year environment

minister and now Liberal candidate said

as much this morning and said the first

thing we need to do is to get through

this election so if now is not the time

for precise policy than when is oh we

inherited and target that the

conservative set and did nothing we made

our way three quarters of the way to

that target in just four years and over

the next 11 years Canada will meet and

surpass those targets unless we elect

another Conservative government

Canadians need a government that will

wake up every morning focused on

fighting climate change and committed to

a better economic future for everyone

the Conservatives have never shown that

commitment they've never shown up on the

fight against climate change we have

demonstrated concretely our leadership

on climate change we're going to

continue to move forward that's the

choice Canadians are facing

something like taking the advice from

your own advisory panel and implementing

your own commissions vehicles

regulations and mandates that are more

your turn we have moved forward on a

broad range of significant and

meaningful actions over the past four

years

whether it's banning single-use plastics

whether its massive incentives for zero

emission vehicles whether it's phasing

out coal whether it's protecting larger

areas of our land and marine ecosystems

or whether it's putting a price on

pollution right across the country we

have done more than any government in

the history of this country and we

recognize there is much more to do I

look forward to talking about those next

things that we're going to be doing over

the course of this week but today

this investment this commitment to draw

in clean tech innovators from around the

world to both generate the solutions

that Canada and the world is going to

need and benefit from the trillions of

dollars in the zero emission Akana

of the coming years is a significant

step forward that is going to help us

fight climate change

the Conservatives Doug Ford and Russia R

Jason Kenney have demonstrated time and

time again that they're just the same

when it comes to the environment that

they just don't get they just don't care

and they just don't get it we do we are

going to continue to step up because we

know that this is the issue that matters

for our kids and grandkids you know

you're setting this target for 2050

meantime your own numbers show you're

not meeting the 2030 targets that

experts say are also too low we will be

meeting and exceeding our climate

targets for 2030 we know that we need to

continually increase our ambition and

that's exactly what this government will

do the choice for Canadians is very very

clear you either go with the

Conservatives who have done nothing to

fight climate change and who promised to

do nothing to fight climate change you

go with the government that has

continued to lead on the world stage and

at home on fighting climate change and

will continue to do so in a way that

creates jobs opportunity and a brighter

future for all Canadians that is the

choice in this election pseudo-celebrity

we know that we need to keep moving

and that's why we are evaluating

that's something that's different from

what the Conservatives did who didn't

understand that the way to move forward

is by rigorous environmental and

oversight and partnership with

communities including and especially

indigenous communities we will continue

to understand that that is the way

forward in order to get to reducing

emissions and getting to Net Zero by

you say that we're going you insist that

we're gonna meet our 2030 targets and in

fact surpass them but not really giving

us detail today in full about how that's

gonna happen and it's not the first time

we've heard a policy in the last week

announcement with a lack of detail how

our voters are posted aside on what

you're offering if you don't actually

explain the details of what you're

offering I think the first part is to

recognize that we inherited targets from

Stephen Harper that he did nothing to

meet because conservatives don't take

action on climate change and we reached

three-quarters of those targets in just

four years now over the next 11 years

Canada if we keep on track and choose

forward will continue to meet and

surpass those targets but we recognize

there is a need for continued ambition

that's why this announcement today

coupled with the announcements we'll be

making over the coming days that will

make it very clear to Canadians that our

plan will work the announcement we're

making today highlights the

opportunities for jobs for economic

growth while engaging in the

trillion-dollar opportunity that is the

zero-emission economy technology from

mr. good morning David you wonder what

is your reaction please to the court

decision today granting BC an injunction

detects how much more complicated is

this argument between two major programs

is making the whole idea of ensuring the

expansion of TM excavator we we

recognize that the federal government

needs to stand up for the national

interest and that will always be our

approach but we also recognize that

Canadians expect rigorous environmental

oversight partnership with indigenous

communities and responsible ways to move

forward I'm not going to engage in

internal conflicts between two provinces

my responsibility is to look out for the

national interest in the national

interest means making sure we are

fighting climate change with a strong

ambitious national plan that will reach

and surpass our targets while at the

same time we're securing jobs and a

assure you that our offices are working

because you're poor colonies if they're

convinced that so creamy yesterday in

Hamilton you refuse to answer a very

simple question about the costume that

you were wearing in blackface video team

by global you know all you said was that

you were being very frank and open with

Canadians how can you say you're being

very frank and open with Canadians when

all you're saying is you're being very

frank and open to Canadians I understand

the question about the costume but let

me make it very very clear there is no

situation in which that would be

appropriate the racist history of

blackface makes it wrong in any

situation in any circumstance I did not

know that then and I should have and I

take responsibility for that

my joy culprit with the Vancouver Sun I

have two questions the first is why I

make this announcement today in Burnaby

there are many voters here who were

still very upset about the purchase of

the pipeline and separately how do you

square the promises we've made today

with the edges of that pipeline

I think Canadians here in Burnaby and

right across the country know that we

have to fight against climate change

with dedication with seriousness and in

a way that brings all Canadians along

with us we've seen what ten years of

Conservative government did to our

positioning on the Environment Canada at

the federal level showed no leadership

under conservatives because they didn't

and they don't take the fight against

climate change seriously we have

demonstrated that we have we have done

more over the past four years than any

government in Canadian history in terms

of protecting marine and land areas

investing in a historic oceans

protection plan banning single-use

plastics moving for with a price on

pollution right across the country

phasing out coal demonstrating

investments in zero emission vehicles

and technologies and in renewables in

general but we recognize there is more

to do and a highlighting an

extraordinary startup company a

scientific company like nano one that is

part of that figuring out how to reduce

emissions and get to Net Zero by 2020 50

is why I'm so glad to be back here in

Burnaby I was at General fusion just a

few buildings over a few years ago for a

similar visit and announcement we know

the Canadians right across the country

need a government that wakes up every

day focused on fighting climate change

we have been that government and will

continue to be that government if

Canadians make that choice in the coming

election the alternative choice is to go

with the government

a Conservative government that has never

been serious about fighting climate

change either for the environment or the

future of our economy that's not what

Canadians need you invoke conservatives

often in your remarks this morning but a

lot of vancouver area writings are

competitive for the NDP for the Greens

largely on the climate question both of

those parties have climate platforms

with targets similar to yours but with a

lot of detail why should voters here who

rent climate is such a tough issue who

are upset about the trans mountain

pipeline why should they just you in the

Liberals on October 21st to deliver on

climate change we have demonstrated our

capacity to deliver over the past four

years we are three quarters of the way

towards our targets for 2030 and will

surpass them over the next 11 years we

know that fighting climate change

putting a national price on pollution

phasing out plastics investing in the

green economy phasing out coal moving

forward on renewables putting a price on

pollution across the country are the big

things that needed to be done and yes

there is much more to do and the plan

that we are putting forward this week

will demonstrate how clear that choice

is between a conservative party that

does not actually fight against climate

change that does not see as it as the

the most important economic issue of our

time the Liberal government that will

continue to move us forward in the right

way

minions about the greens and the NDP's

climate platforms I think it's it's

really important that there are a lot of

Canadians and a lot of different

political parties that are talking about

the need to fight climate change but the

plan we are putting forward is a

concrete and tangible plan that will

achieve Net Zero by 2050 there will

achieve and surpass our 2030 targets it

will continue to demonstrate that

climate change is a real and pressing

challenge to individuals families and

communities across this country but is

also an opportunity to grow to innovate

and to have a positive impact on the

world

that's what Canadians here in Burnaby

across the country want to see and that

is what we are proposing as a government

Tesla vikander Center Vancouver other

than your promises about pipeline safety

and consultation what do you have to say

to indigenous voters who are

disillusioned by your purchasing of a

pipeline and you're asking everyone to

happen we are pleased to be working with

a large number of indigenous communities

and leaders across Alberta and BC who

are interested in becoming partners in

the TMX expansion we recognize that

there are strongly held views on both

sides of this issue and we are listening

very carefully to people with concerns

to minimize those concerns to

demonstrate the kind of partnership and

respect that is at the heart of

reconciliation but it does no one any

good it does our environment no good to

continue to get billions of dollars

worth of discount from selling our

resources only to the United States as

opposed to opening up new markets where

we will be able to bring in more profits

to invest as we have committed those

profits in a greener future in

transition towards is NetZero economy

that is what the path forward is

Canadians particularly here in British

Columbia understand that we need to both

grow the economy and protect the

environment at the same time the BC

government has done that for many years

with its world leading carbon price and

we are continuing to do that because

that's what British Columbians Canadians

and many many indigenous peoples also

understand is the right path forward and

specifically about your treatment for

Jory awesome right bolt for business we

continue to work with indigenous

communities across BC I was pleased to

move forward on historic agreements with

it so protein it moved forward on many

tangible issues that indigenous voters

are putting forward that indigenous

Canadians have concerns with whether

it's the fact that we've eliminated 87

long-term boil water advisories across

the country and are fully on track to

eliminating the 50 or so more on

schedule we've invested in new schools

in new health centers we've created

partnerships that go to the very

relationship that is nation-to-nation

and we recognize there is more to do and

we will do it in partnership with

indigenous peoples here in BC and across

the country

Kelvin gali Burnaby now you've promised

a national housing strategy of billions

of dollars to go with it but if you ask

my curly the mayor of Burnaby that

money's nor to be found he said he's

asked her government many times in vain

and nothing has come through so what do

you have to say to people in Burnaby

that are waiting desperately I was very

happy to sit down with Mayor Mike early

just a few months ago to talk about

housing to talk about infrastructure to

talk about the concerns they have around

the TMX pipeline and we work together to

build and strengthen Burnaby our

National Housing Strategy represents 40

billion dollars worth of investments our

first-time homebuyers plan is something

that gives up to 10% off the purchase

price of a first home for young families

here in Burnaby and across the country

we're gonna continue to work with

municipalities I know Mike was very

pleased with the doubling of the gas tax

transfer that we did this year that led

to tangible impacts investments for

people in Burnaby but I continue to look

forward to working with Mike and

municipal leaders right across the

country on responding to the pressing

housing challenges we actually increased

the first-time homebuyers benefit were

committing to increase the first-time

homebuyers benefit so that more people

in the Lower Mainland including in

Burnaby will be able to access the

support they need to buy their first

home this is something that's important

for people here but indeed right across

the country

yes it alone thank you all

[Applause]
