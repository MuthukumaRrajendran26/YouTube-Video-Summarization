high cost of dental care

I hear frustrations about politicians

doing them but jug meets Singh is

really make things better here for

people in Sudbury and across the country

and the powerful the only leader who's

going to stand up to the powerful lobby

insider lobbyist and he's the only

leader who's actually on your side

we see too many Canadians in our country

that cannot afford dental services

there's 4.3 million Canadians that can't

that don't have access to dental

services I have no coverage public or

private we know that one in three

Canadians have no coverage at all this

is a serious concern cost of living is

going up it's harder and harder to make

ends meet and then we look at the

choices that we have

mr. Trudeau thinks that things are fine

the way they are mr. Trudeau and Mr

Shearer have a track record as liberal

and conservative governments of helping

the well-connected and the powerful get

ahead while everyone else falls behind

that is wrong government should work for

people we should be in it for people and

that's what we're presenting to people

we are in it for you we are in it for

people were fighting for you we're on

your side and that's why today I'm

really proud to announce mr. our in our

past Tommy Douglas had a vision of

Medicare and that meant care for

everyone head to toe and he talked about

something and I want to bring that idea

back he talked about dental care that

not only do we need pharmacare

medication coverage for all we also need

to make sure that no Canadian falls

behind when it comes to the dental needs

and that's why today I'm proud to say

our plan that we're putting forward is

dental care

it'll cover everyone who is who has

salary less than $70,000 they'll be

completely covered with this plan and

those who make seventeen between 70 90

will have a sliding scale but this is

our first step toward the dream of

universal dental care for all

we're taking the first bold step today

so that people like melody and

she'll we'll have coverage this is a

plan that is direct it's a government

insurance plan and will ensure day one

we put this in place and we have

coverage for every single Canadian under

makes less than 70,000 who does not have

coverage this is a bold step for to come

before us and announce a ko9 flow the

tell my fear discipline as conv editor

John Baxter and super cool now we'll

take some questions from the media so

we've had this costed by the

Parliamentary Budget Office and the

first year will be about 560 million

they'll be a bump up in the second year

because we anticipate or the

Parliamentary Budget Office anticipates

there'll be a lot of people who have not

had access to dental services that will

then take take advantage of a program

that'll help them get a back on track so

it'll be a bump up and then it'll

stabilize around 860 million dollars is

what the parliamentary budget

anticipates anticipates it'll cost again

it's about choices 860 million dollars

to assure that 4.3 million Canadians

have dental services is a priority for

us what's not a priority is what mr.

Trudeau did last year cut corporate

taxes basically gave 14 billion dollars

to the wealthiest corporations so that

they could buy corporate jets and limos

he spent 14 billion dollars to do that

this plan cost less than a billion

dollars he spent four point five billion

dollars in buying a pipeline this plan

costs eight hundred and fifty six

million dollars he spent billions of

dollars he waived corporate law

to the tune of six billion dollars in

one year alone this plant cost 856

million

I mean these are choices that we would

make this is a priority for us we know

that Canadians deserve the care I'm

gonna make that happen yesterday you

made an announcement on affordable

housing and said you'd provide about

five billion dollars in the first year

and a half

today you're saying 560 million what do

you say to Canadians who want the books

balanced and are concerned that the NDP

platform will cost too much well the

difference is we're not going to give

billions of dollars away to corporations

the wealthiest corporations that don't

need help

we're making a clear choice we have

limited resources we understand that we

would not give 14 billion dollars to the

wealthiest corporation to by corporate

jets it just won't do that instead we'd

invest in people that's the big

difference it's a matter of priorities

there is limited resources and people

expect us to use those resources

responsibly we will not give them away

to the wealthiest but invest in people

the direct impact you think that this

plan will have on Canadians it'll make

people healthier it'll mean that people

like melody and Michele who told me that

they're earning a decent salary but they

can't afford the care that they need

that they're putting it off and it gets

worse and worse that people who are

struggling because they can't afford

dental care won't have to struggle

anymore this will mean so much to so

many people

and I'm proud that we're putting this

forward single joke that's what cannot

dental coverage

how would it specifically work for them

how when would they be able to go to the

dance

sure yeah this is a plan we've put in

place a year one this is a plan that

doesn't require working with we will

work with provinces of course always but

this is a

vermin insurance plan essentially we're

delivering a federal government

insurance plan to cover those Canadians

who have no coverage that is an

immediate plan that will immediately

lift 4.3 million people out of the

position where they have no public or

private insurance this is an immediate

solution it is bold it is exciting kind

of getting goosebumps when I think about

it because we can actually cover so many

Canadians that don't have coverage this

is such an amazing step forward and it's

a really a matter of choice I gave you

all those examples for a reason the six

billion dollars that mr. Trudeau waived

for corporate loans the 14 billion

dollars that they gave to the wealthiest

corporations to buy corporate jets it's

really a matter of priorities our

priorities will always be people were in

it for people and this is something it's

gonna lift up the lives of people

yeah this is something that we could put

in place pretty immediate this is

something that we expect people be able

to use within the first year of our

government mandate and this is something

we expect people will use very much on

the second year as the program rolls out

and more people use it that's why the

Parliamentary Budget Office put a

massive bump up for the second year and

then it'll stabilize because we expect

people to use this program we know

people are putting off their needs

because they can't afford it and we want

people to have the dental care they need

this be a plan that you would push

whoever was in power to put forward

absolutely when we're in the position to

implement this if anyone wants to work

with us to make it happen we're gonna

make this happen

Pharma care for all intensive care these

are two massive commitments we are

really excited about these two

commitments we're gonna make this happen

in northern life Sabri calm hi there hi

um have you considered the impact on the

small business people that essentially

dental offices are they employ people

have you spoken to the Ontario Dental

Association the Canadian Dental

Association for example the Ontario

healthy smiles program does not even

cover the costs of dentists so are you

going to make sure that I guess dentists

are able to cover their costs with this

new I guess coverage for for Canadians

and considered the impact on the small

businessman a great question healthy

smiles is a great program but I spoken a

dentist who wanted to be involved in the

healthy smile program but it doesn't pay

enough for it to have even cover the

cost so it is a serious problem what

we're hoping with this coverage is we're

gonna take off some of the burden from

provinces with this coverage is a

federal plan we're putting up all the

dollars federal there's no provincial

investments and it's gonna put a lot of

pressure off of the provincial system

and then we want to sit down and

negotiate with provinces that because of

our program it's going to lift the cost

off of provinces in a such a massive way

that we want to negotiate to increase

funding for the potential programs that

do exist we don't have control over

those provincial programs they are good

starts but they don't go far enough and

the healthy smiles is a great example of

a great program that doesn't pay enough

in Ontario so what we want to do is by

putting in place this coverage that's

actually going to create a great it's

gonna make a massive investment we're

hoping that that'll offset some of the

costs and so provinces can augment and

increase the funding that they do put in

to programs like healthy smiles and

other provinces that have similar

programs

hi Shannon Proudfoot with Maclean's hi

Jenna let's say in a hypothetical

minority government situation if you

were to press for some of your

priorities to be incorporated what would

be your your one or two top priorities

of the the platform planks you've

announced so far assuming you're not

gonna be able to get the whole package

of what you want what would you pursue

first sure so we would take so first off

I'm writing to an Prime Minister so I'll

frame it like as Prime Minister I will

take the support of other parties and a

minority government while I'm Prime

Minister I'll receive their support for

the following one I will take people's

health care very seriously in health

care as a priority so Pharma care and

dental care I'll take people's budgets

very seriously and there's a number of

no-cost steps taking on the big telecom

putting in a price cap and requiring

mandatory unlimited data plans that's a

low cost no cost actually and that's

gonna save Canadians a lot of money

bringing us in line with the OECD

countries housing massive investment

that we need to make because people are

struggling with the cost of housing and

then with respect to the environment

well tackle climate crisis and make some

massive investments there those are our

three areas where we're seriously

concerned and we're going to put a lot

of effort into thank you I got a thumbs

up and I got you over the past week the

gap between the NDP and Greens has in

fact wine and you've gained two points

however still to get to a position that

is in good shape for the NDP you still

have a long way to go what are your

thoughts on that just in the past week

and how you continue to take back your

green support well I mean my focus is

mr. Trudeau I'm not worried about anyone

else I'm trying to replace mr. Trudeau

because people deserve a government that

works for them mr. Trudeau hasn't done

that he hasn't had the backs of people

shadows - Charlie Angus he's easy he has

it he's made it a priority to make life

easier for the wealthiest and make their

life easier while it makes everyone else

is harder I want to replace that with a

government with a new democratic

government that Tina for you that's in

it for people that's what we gotta do

now see beaucoup thank you so much thank

you

[Applause]

you
