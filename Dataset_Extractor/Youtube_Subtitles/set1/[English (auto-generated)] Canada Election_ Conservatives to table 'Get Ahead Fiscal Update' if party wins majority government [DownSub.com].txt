good afternoon everyone

yeah first of all I want to say that my

heart goes out to all those who are

impacted by the storms here in effect I

want to thank all the emergency

responders who are working so hard to

clean up after the storm and get people

back into their homes I made a personal

donation to the Red Cross's relief

efforts and I would encourage others to

contribute what they can as well

throughout the course of this election

our conservative team has laid out a

clear plan to put more money in your

pockets so that you and your family can

get ahead a plan to scrap the carbon tax

and lower the cost of gas groceries and

whole community to introduce the

universal tax cut to save a couple

making average salaries eight hundred

and fifty dollars per year to take the

GST off home heating bills to make

maternity benefits tax-free to increase

the aged credit for our seniors to boost

the RESP so you can get more for your

kids education and to introduce new tax

credits for children's sports arts and

learning programs public transit and

green home renovations our plan will put

thousands of dollars back into people's

pockets right now our plan is still only

a plan until we put it into action and

there's no time to lose Canadians are

falling further and further behind and

they can't wait any longer

for relief and that's why today I'm

pleased to announce that is part of our

100 day action plan a new Conservative

government will convene Parliament as

soon as possible to table the get ahead

fiscal update I will direct my new

finance minister

table is obtained within 45 days of

forming government say precautious recon

told that our sailors with me Gaddafi

cavalry didn't work no taxi on the Sun

Prudential in Nouveau Granada

conservator like overkill the polymer a

Divino today ordered a name among

Nouveau minister different phenols the

presentation missus rule that I cannot

say premiered to Google on the get ahead

fiscal update will implement four key

money saving measures they are platform

the green home renovation tax credit

putting up to thirty eight hundred

dollars back in the pockets of families

make green palma treatments the

children's fitness tax credit allowing

parents to claim up to a thousand

dollars for sports activities the

children's art in learning tax credit

letting parents claim up to five hundred

dollars for arts and learning programs

and the green public transit tax credit

saving a family of four who take transit

up to one thousand dollars by competing

parliament quickly at doing this right

away we will make sure it needs to

benefit from these measures starting

January 1st 2020 will also use the get

ahead fiscal update to finally open the

books on Trudeau's budget miss shine a

light on his historic fiscal

mismanagement and competence Canadians

deserve accountability and under a new

Conservative government's exactly what

they will get looser democracy please

allow me sir Jeremy no juice no profit

farewell Emir so the gosh

you know some of a suggestion it's only

confidence Jenny the fields the Kennedy

La Cala again very definitive a suitable

woman among conservative City exact

amount of sick leave all at walk four

years ago just eternal said a lot of

makes words it made a lot of big

promises to get elected he promised you

would provide relief for the middle

class only to increase taxes on eighty

percent of middle class families he

promised the budget we balance itself by

it this year only to pile on billions of

new debt with no end in sight you

promised you would run an open and

transparent government only to cook up a

backroom deal with SNC level of

lobbyists meddle in a criminal

prosecution and then abused his powers

to cover up this corruption after four

years of this kind of image that

Canadians are right to demand some

serious accountability Canadians need a

government that will help them get ahead

and they need it right now over the past

four years Canadians have found

themselves worked harder than ever and

just not getting ahead their taxes are

higher their bills are bigger the cost

of living is on the rise Justin Trudeau

wants to make life even more expensive

and still he wants you to pay more to

fill up your car to heat your home and

to put food on the table he wants to

keep sending your hard-earned tax

dollars to relatively well-off countries

that don't need it and corrupt regimes

that don't deserve it he wants to keep

sending corporate welfare checks to

billion-dollar corporations he thinks

your money belongs to them and now is

even leaving the door open to a

coalition government with the NDP in a

desperate attempt to cling to power a

coalition that will lead to even higher

taxes less jobs more deficits and bigger

household bills

it's the coalition Canadians can't

afford Justin Trudeau will pay any price

to stay in power and he will use your

money to pay for it so my message to

aliens is this only a conservative

majority government

and prevent a government with Justin

Trudeau as the spokesman but the NDP

calling the shots the choice is clear

it's between a Trudeau NDP coalition

that will drive up taxes drive out jobs

and cost you thousands of dollars more

over here and a new conservative

majority government that will lower your

taxes and put more money in your pockets

it's between a true NDP coalition that

will chase away your best early and put

thousands of Canadians out of work and a

new conservative majority government

that will live within its means so we

can make life more affordable it's

between a Trudeau NDP coalition that

will send the carbon tax through the

roof and a new conservative majority of

government that has a plan to help you

get ahead right out of the gates the

schwab don't Clara say entrepreneur they

see others things with over lmpd even

more theories they know eliminate

a fart will that be through our down if

they automatically see on which they to

know a red video give a comment a

massive mouth attacks to October in

government conservative majority can

trump or boobs a day

dating America our get ahead fiscal

update will put more money back in your

pockets by January 1st and deliver the

transparency you expect from their

government there's no time to lose

it's all part my 100 day action plan and

a key part of our top commitment to put

more money back in your pocket so you

can finally thank you very much and if

not why is coalition such a dirty word

so answer the first question

no and I believe he needs now have a

crystal clear choice between a Trudeau

NDP coalition that will raise taxes run

endless deficits and make life more

expensive and a Conservative government

majority guard that will live within its

means lower taxes put money more money

back in their pockets and in a minority

government situation and well with the

first

like who would be willing to work with

well as I said right now it's very clear

adjustable pay any price to stay in

power and you will use your money to pay

for it we are asking Canadians for a

mandate to implement our agenda we are

outlining the next few days exactly what

our first 100 days will look like and

that is what we are committed to

following through but I was taken to the

[Music]

well obviously our hearts and best

wishes go out to first responders and

officials who are working to clean up

from the storm and we certainly hope

that people are able to return to their

home as quickly as possible

mayor Julie me a big donkey sorry I fell

so far or clearly problem because if the

tone that day and there's a spare they

jump there were too many other means of

seto capacity doesn't last in many ways

the people who in evacuate almost told

us that who you should be dealing with

the crisis instead of coming here to

campaign what do you see those people

who say it's tone-deaf you could be

there at this time

well you know as I said we're sending

out there obviously we want to send our

best wishes in our manner our hearts go

out to those who are affected by the

storm certainly wish all those who are

dealings as well and we've made I've

made a personal donation to highlight

the fact that the Red Cross is providing

much-needed relief and support and we

certainly don't want to disrupt anything

that they're doing but do we want to

support their very important work that

they're doing

they are very generously assuming ADA on

top I could polish man they say the

existence on several families of the

balconies were asked to check over their

hotel today because another big perk was

coming with this group that they're

talking about an order conservative

campaign and did you give any

consideration to delay in today's event

given the fact that there are so many

people so answered the first question no

and obviously we want I want to

highlight the important work of the Red

Cross's doing to help with those

families who are affected by the storm

and certainly don't want to construct a

the good work that they are doing but

wanted to highlight the work you're

doing by making donations are there any

other people who do the same a liberal

candidate is posting ads with images of

semi-automatic weapons and a claim that

you will repeal gun control measures if

elected we want to get your reaction to

all that happen circulating online and

would you repeal candidate so it's no

surprise that liberals spread this

entire spreading misinformation they've

been doing that even before the campaign

that was started I've been very clear

with Canadians a Conservative government

ensure that our firearms laws go after

gang members for those people who

traffic in illegal firearms we will

maintain the robust regime around

classifications of many many firearms

are prohibited cat that will continue

but it is again it's easy and lazy

government to go after law-abiding

people it's to force law-abiding people

to follow more laws it is very easy to

do it's harder to go after gang members

and firearms traffickers liberals aren't

prepared to do the hard work we are

that's why our plan tackles target's

gang members in illegal firearms

so let me be very clear on this what we

have in front of games right now

is Justin Trudeau being the showing

comedians if you will pay any price to

stay in power he will form a coalition

with the NDP which means higher taxes

less money in your pockets run away

endless deficits for years and years and

years or a Conservative government that

will live within its means and focus on

making life hard for me that is the

choice it is quite clear that he is so

desperate to cling to power that he is

now going to form a coalition with the

MEP we are putting forward our platform

to Cannes

we're asking for a mandate for majority

governance that we can implement ecology

say cleric admit no because she stands a

little back they had me pourquoi for

gestion who severed ear and chorus young

men are back they pitted

severely deficits something they saw

staple a the schwa eclair Meno a de

mando they can improve on that measure

again a lot compared a Grimaldi advisor

I would we would not government we would

not enter into any type of negotiations

with the block I don't need to work with

the bloc québécois to deliver results

for their back I can work with the

premier we go to do that she did walk

back I may have a cubicle Ayatollah as

you about today and I can see the glue

one way they Basel down putting chemical

I came across you say how big of

donation you may need to the Red Cross

today and other than that donation is

there anything that you add to your

schedule today to either assist helping

settle a bag you ease or assist with the

cleanest where did you keys your skin

will remaining the same as it was with

the plan to come here so the it was a

personal donation and we don't want to

disrupt the work with the Red Cross and

other relief agencies are doing we want

to highlight the work they're doing in

supportive okay so if you can answer the

dollar amount that need also there are

thousands of people right now do not

know where they're going to sleep

tonight why do you think it's

appropriate to come to their city at

this time while it's in a state of

emergency to ask for their votes well as

I said you know we're certainly sitting

here are our best wishes our hearts are

going out to those people who are

affected by the storm and we know

the important work to clean up

afterwards and get power restored is

underway and we certainly hope that that

happens as quickly as possible we

presented a plan to get back to balanced

budgets while maintaining increases in

investments in health care social

programs and education by eliminating

things like corporate well cutting

corporate welfare by 1.5 billion dollars

and eliminating the practice of sending

foreign aid to cut relatively well-off

countries in addition we know that we

can save taxpayers billions by ending

the practice of things like March

Madness which is what we call in Ottawa

and departments blow through hundreds of

millions of dollars at the end of the

fiscal year on chairs and computers new

cell phones curtailing the practice of

high-priced outside consultants coming

in to do the work that experienced

public service already are able to do

and we believe that is a responsible

plan to get back to balanced budgets

that allows us to cut taxes all along

Lee Ontario pledge

government smaller without having fewer

employees does it even incredibly

promise to say the public sector will

shrink you know as I said by going after

wasteful spending practices like morons

like bringing in outside consultants to

the work of highly trained and capable

public service and also by eliminating

waste that goes on and how the

government manages its real estate we

have you know over 30,000 federal spaces

across the country many of which are not

fully utilized so we're being very clear

it's exactly where we're going to find

the money to allow us to cut their taxes

cutting corporate welfare by 1.5 billion

dollars eliminating 25% of the foreign

aid budget by ensuring that if they

attack sellers don't go to countries

that are relatively well-off and by

ending these types of wasteful spending

practices we can preserve and indeed

increase the investments that are going

to directly to Canadians in front of

healthcare social programs education

no see Claire exactly on the the bonds

have ID the that's good c-chief napadas

lucky to fire on Jupiter a a very

suitable way things of that they say yes

a solution scheduling a pond on a

a signature song priority in Quebec the

Parti québécois a war in you know I for

one say it's another priority did have a

vagueness year ago a Sulha dossier

composted that nuclear Metro the problem

in st. Paul they they kept acquire came

across a not Olivia up or down

the Canadian Press I want to follow my

by crecelius question about your plan to

cut spending

your predecessor Stephen Harper launched

a much wanted deficit reduction action

plan that set 5 billion dollars annually

in cuts he wanted to make and he too

said there would be no cuts to services

a new ask a veteran who saw their

Veterans Affairs offices closed across

the country because of those cuts

they'll stay there were cuts to services

so why should people trust that your

plan is any different don't mr. Harbor

today we are showing kids exactly where

we'll find the money to pay for our tax

cuts we are going to go after corporate

welfare foreign aid and the wasteful

spending within government that does not

affect them services things like March

Madness things like high-priced outside

consultants and by ensuring that our

real estate is managed properly and that

is the choice because on the other side

of the equation is an NDP liberal

coalition which will increase spending

drastically which will raise taxes which

will run massive deficits that mean

higher and higher taxes every year just

to pay the interest on that debt that is

now the clear choice being foreign

Canadians a responsible plan to get back

to balanced budgets over five years

while we maintain investments in

important services and lower taxes and

an NDP liberal coalition which will

raise the carpet tax even higher

embarked on billions and billions of

dollars of new spending running massive

deficits leading to higher taxes that is

now the choice heading into the last

week of this campaign and I am asking

for majority mandate so we can get back

to balanced budgets

lower their taxes and leave more money

in their pockets

it says about Canadians and Canadians

today the poles are suggesting nobody

wants a clear majority and people are in

fact very divided on their vote and

perhaps with light the coalition think

of the government ' Pearson and how much

was accomplished for Canada under that

minority situation I do not believe that

Acadians would I do not believe the

Canadians want a Trudeau NDP coalition a

government where Justin Trudeau may be

the spokesperson but the NDP are calling

the shots because that will mean massive

new taxes it will mean endless deficits

threatening if those important social

programs because more and more of your

tax dollar will have to go just to pay

the interest on the debt on the new debt

that they will be racking up making life

even more expensive the choice could not

be more clear now and there is only one

poll that I pay attention to and that is

the one on election 80 I believe given

the choice between a Conservative

government a conservative majority

government that will get back to

balanced budgets

leave more money in the pockets of

Canadians by cutting taxes and an NDP

liberal coalition that will run massive

deficits in could lead to massive new

increases in taxes I'm very confident

that the Canadians will give us some say

in choix ethically I might know último

de coalition

the NPD deliver I'll give up on Montel a

simple augment daily deficit a rather

lengthy demo to share precarity okay ooh

conservative measure right here

a key map base it is important to be

profitable per decade or new demondo of

may be important that loss comfort let's

see if we don't know down there I said I

wanted to make a personal relation to

show my support to highlight the fact

the good words that I said when it is

one of the features oh yeah I wanted to

make a personal motivation to highlight

the good work that the Red Cross is

doing it's about showing support and and

and highlighting the good work that

they're doing and that should be the

focal point of today and the coming days

to for those Canadians that are able to

help support the Red Cross no interview

one of my colleagues asked whether

you're scheduled to occupy the power is

there people downstairs to the lobby of

this very hotel

people I'd be happy to talk to them

thanks very much

[Applause]
