Mike well Donna there are some matters

that are shared jurisdictions with the

provinces this isn't one of them it's

federal and we heard over and over from

people that as we're choosing a federal

government defense is something we

should be talking about Canada's

military doesn't usually register as a

major issue in our elections if you

speak to experts they say that's fine in

normal times but that these aren't

normal times we have depended upon the

United States for our protection well

American power and their ability to

protect Canada it's hardly a sure thing

anymore the world is a more dangerous

place than it was four years ago

first China's flexing its muscles

constantly in fact a Canadian warship

last summer in international waters was

buzzed by Chinese fighter jets and then

there's Russia it's pushing and testing

NATO from the east and Ukraine it's

involved in Syria propping up the Assad

regime Russia is also expanding its

presence here in the Western Hemisphere

the US has told Russia not to send

troops to Venezuela but it's done so

repeatedly as recently as last month and

then just this month the Russian Prime

Minister was in Cuba renewing commercial

and military ties through all of that

radio silence from Canadian politicians

the basic fact that the parties aren't

giving any airtime to this is just

really kind of crazy I mean if there was

ever there was an election to have the

Munk debate on foreign policy this was

it are you ready now what makes the

situation even more urgent is the

political situation south of the border

even before the Trump administration

there was a shifting in the u.s. away

from its Cold War doctrine as a global

policeman President Trump just tapped

into it let them have their borders some

of the attitudes that he's conveying

reflect a wider shift amongst parts of

the American population that is

uninterested in continuing to play and

pay for the role that they have in the

past decades another big challenge ahead

for Canada is the north russia's

building bases in the Arctic while there

are rumblings out of China as well it's

not an Arctic nation but it's trying to

join the Arctic

so arguing the north is a global

resource through it all in this election

there isn't even a debate over replacing

Canada's aging fighter jets the f-35 is

still out there is a question who was

huge in the election four years ago and

now it's a total non-issue there are

some problems you can get away with not

addressing you just wait and they go

away when it comes to defense and the

challenges Canada is facing they're not

going away they're getting worse Donna

all right Mike Armstrong in Montreal

thanks all four major political parties

have released details on how they plan

to address Canada's defense problems the

Liberals plan to ensure defense

procurement projects are delivered on

time by creating what they call a new

agency to fund defense procurement

Canada they're also vowing to develop

better surveillance and rapid response

capabilities in the Arctic the

Conservatives say they'll establish

without a doubt Canada's sovereignty in

the north by reinforcing our country's

standing as a maritime nation a party is

also vowing to depoliticize military

procurement by establishing new

oversight bodies in cabinet and the

Privy Council office the New Democrats

promised to replace the fighter jets and

say they are committed to ensuring the

Canadian Armed Forces can meet the needs

in the north the Greens say they'll also

make sure the military gets the

equipment it needs and ensure it's

prepared to protect Canada's northern

border as arctic ice now
