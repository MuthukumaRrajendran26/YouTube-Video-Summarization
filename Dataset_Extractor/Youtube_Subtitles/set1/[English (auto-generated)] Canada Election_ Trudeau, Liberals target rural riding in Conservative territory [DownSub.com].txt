Abigale Beeman is traveling with the

liberal campaign and joins us now

Abigail Robin the day before a debate is

often a quieter one on the campaign

trail Justin Trudeau picked a rural

riding within three hours of Ottawa to

plant trees and highlight the liberal

promise to plant two billion trees in

the next ten years and this riding is a

notable one Hastings Lennox and

Addington is traditionally conservative

territory the Liberal incumbent won at

last time by 225 votes one of the

tightest races in the country and

polling suggests it's likely to go to

the Conservatives this time around

sending Trudeau here shows the Liberals

are pushing to hold on to it and this is

part of a trend across the country

voters in larger cities tend to vote

liberal those in rural ridings vote

conservative we move forward with a

Minister for rural economic development

bourbon and Bernadette Jordan to make

sure that rural Canadians have a seat at

the table and see exactly what

investments we've been making we care I

would say that this Prime Minister is

brought about more positive change for

rural Canadians than any Prime Minister

has in living memory and I know because

I was the guy doing the asking the

Liberals were also on the defense today

over a candidate in Atlantic Canada who

had to apologize after his past sexist

and racist comments on social media

surfaced conservatives have been passing

this image around where Jaime batiste

wrote why do I assume every skinny

Aboriginal girl is on crystal meth or

pills

I asked Trudeau why an apology is enough

when the Conservatives just got rid of a

candidate on the other side of the

country for her offensive comments he

gave one of the shortest answers on this

campaign mr. batiste took responsibility

for his actions and apologized I also

asked Trudeau whether his own history

with the black faced controversy limits

the actions he can take against other

candidates he didn't directly answer

after this the Liberal leader will focus

on debate prep tomorrow will be the

first and last time Justin Trudeau

squares off against the other leaders in

English
