Australia is on fire and it's bigger

than you think twelve point thirty five

million acres of land have been burnt by

bushfire so far that's almost twice the

size of Belgium and three times more

land in the 2018 California fires and

Brazil's 2019 Amazon fire combined

flames have reportedly reached a 70

meters high that's taller than the

Sydney Opera House at least 19 people

have been killed and more than 1,400

homes have been destroyed residents and

tourists have been forced to relocate

just get out while we can nearly 500

million animals have died in New South

Wales alone the fires aren't just in one

location they're raging everywhere

across the country so what ignited this

deadly crisis while bushfire season is

nothing new in Australia but this summer

has been one of the hottest and driest

in the country's history since September

the combination of droughts

unprecedented heat waves and strong

gusty winds has created a recipe for

disaster aspire conditions on top of

that the smoke from bush fires generates

its own weather sparking thunderstorms

with lightning and strong winds which

create even more wildfires scientists

have been predicting such extreme

weather for years warning that bush

fires will become even more frequent as

climate change worsens although the

weather has cooled slightly in parts of

Australia authorities say with months of

summer left the worst is yet to come
