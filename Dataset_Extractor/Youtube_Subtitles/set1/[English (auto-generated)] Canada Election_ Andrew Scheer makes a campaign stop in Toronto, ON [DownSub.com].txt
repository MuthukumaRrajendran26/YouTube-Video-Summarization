Ontario and yards a day later I see a

lot of friends here so this is where I'm

gonna point you to some work let's hear

the cheers who's here from the 905

and who's here from the four one six I

would go five one nine but I don't think

you're here anyone from that's amazing

well what else we want to do with a big

Friday night but to get together with

the wonderful conservative family that

we have here right and I know we have

special guests tonight - don't we we had

two special guests tonight I am so I'm

so very excited to be here as I said

it's been quite the campaign we've had a

lot going on we have just over two weeks

left and this is where conservative

principles and values really come to the

fore

if you wanna know why there are no

harder workers in this country than

conservatives no and it doesn't matter

what part of the country you're from all

the way out of Newfoundland and Labrador

and all the way up to Vancouver BC and B

Victoria BC and all the way up to the

north where my friendly owner bucock is

seeking the seat in a towel it again

[Music]

we know that we have two weeks to work

as hard as we can to make sure that we

change the control of this country and

we change controls country for the

better one of the questions that I keep

getting asked when I'm knocking doors

and Milton by the way is so tell us

about Andrews share what do you know

about Andrews share great he's a great

guy that's what everyone says for sure

but let me tell you what I know I didn't

know Andrew when he was Speaker of the

House because I was administered in the

Stephen Harper government therefore we

really didn't have a chance to shot he

was the traffic cop and he had a very

important role and I was in the

government and we didn't really have any

opportunity to socialize I got to know

Andrew in 2015 when Ron Ambrose at us

next to each other in the House of

Commons he was the house leader

opposition House leader and I was the

credit for finance and what I learned

first and foremost

the one thing that came across is how

real and authentic he is he is exactly

who you see him - cool

and the second thing I can tell you you

never tried to throw me or Ron under the

bus

didn't happen he has an excellent sense

of humor in fact we used to get in a

little bit of trouble because we quit

being back and forth all the time which

shows you he has a kind heart he's

empathetic he's trustworthy and as well

more so than anything else he loves his

country and wants to make it better in

the time that I thought to know him

through the leadership and the time that

I've had the pleasure of sitting next to

him again in the House of Commons I can

tell you this he has become the leader

that Canada deserves and that Canada

needs right now he enjoys having other

people express their point of view to

him he's not gonna fire somebody just

because they have a different point of

view and express it he's going to

welcome that opinion and he's going to

help all of us make the decision

together

he's absolutely true and loyal to the

people who were around him and most of

all he shows each and every day that

this is about us this is about the

conservative family he is grateful for

our work and he doesn't think it's all

about him because quite frankly aren't

we tired of a leader who thinks it's all

about

[Applause]

I'm getting pretty excited cuz I know

we're getting close to when we're gonna

be bringing out the boss so we can have

a word with all of you but I'm gonna

tell you this two weeks left get on the

doors find our vote and get our vote out

to the polls more importantly when you

find the people who are gonna vote for

us tell them to bring a friend to the

polls as well tell them that we need

their vote too because this is a tight

race and the GTA is so important to

ensuring that this country starts moving

in the right direction again a direction

where people have dreams an opportunity

thinking actually attain and that your

success is determined by your work and

your values and not by whether or not

you're a friend of Justin Trudeau we

want to make sure that we do everything

possible we put it all on the line and

we work as hard as we possibly can to

deliver the result that Canadians want

and that Canadians deserve and that is a

Conservative government in this country

so I gotta know one thing

aren't you excited are you ready to give

this all you've got

and most importantly to quote my family

and K friends are we gonna get her done

ladies and gentlemen I want to introduce

you to your leader and the next prime

minister of this great country of Kerala

ladies and gentlemen Lisa Raye thank you

so much reduction merci beaucoup sit the

golbez Ian if you see it is such a

pleasure for me to be here and I've got

great news I always like to start off

the evening some people say I smile too

much some summer I can't assert that I

heard that the door it's hard not to

smile when you think that we are less

than 18 days away from getting rid of

this level of government it's hard not

to smile when you've got great

candidates all over the GTA all over

Ontario and all over this country

I have crisscross this country several

times over the last few weeks and I can

tell you the responses the doors has

been fantastic people are excited people

are ready people are they cannot wait

they cannot wait to put an end to this

tax hiking deficit running

scandal-plagued Liberal government and

replace it with an honest conservative

government that puts people first

[Applause]

Canadians are realizing that Justin

Trudeau is just not as advertised

so many jokes right through trying to

pick just one you know they're seeing

more and more that he's not who he says

he is that he's a hypocrite on so many

different levels

we found out just the other day that

well he's been preaching and lecturing

to Canadians about how they need to pay

more for their gasoline for the

groceries in the home heating he's

actually been flying across the country

with the second plane or in his costumes

[Music]

[Applause]

his camping equipment maybe even that

canoe but it's okay it's okay because

he's buying some some carbon offset

credits which gives him license to keep

living his lifestyle the way that he

wants to live and that is the essence of

the hypocrisy on this because you see

for people like Justin Trudeau and their

millionaire buddies they will never have

to worry about higher gas prices about

more expensive groceries or about higher

home utility bills but that's where

conservatives come in because we know

that hardworking Canadians don't want to

pay more well privileged people like

Justin Trudeau don't have to worry about

the consequences but I'm gonna make them

an offer here tonight I am personally

going to offer to pay the offset credits

for the second movie ban he's going to

need on October 22nd the day after the

election

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

and people are seeing the the

consequences of his higher taxes we know

the Canadians are feeling like they're

falling further and further behind over

80% of middle-class families they're

paying more today than they were when

Justin Trudeau took office and it's

carbon tax is raising the cost of living

and I'm here to tell you the people of

Ontario the people all over Canada the

first job of a Conservative government

after this election job number one first

piece of legislation will be called an

act to repeal the carbon tax that's the

first thing we're gonna do they're

seeing that he's not as advertised when

it came to running an open and

transparent government an open and

transparent government sunlight is the

best disinfectant I remember someone

saying said sunny ways here well it

seems like we've encountered a long

patch of cloudy weather he's kicked out

the only two people kicked out of caucus

the only two people who were standing up

to him during the SNC Laughlin

[Music]

so it seems like the only thing that

gets you kicked out of the Liberal Party

is when you stand up to those who are

abusing the power of their office

Canadians see through that they can see

the betrayal that he that he had with

our war heroes our veterans promising

that he would clear the backlog and

instead it's getting longer and longer

and that's why we're offering such a

positive message this campaign we are

whole platform is all about the way that

we are gonna help people get ahead we

believe conservatives believe that a

dollar left in the pocket of the

hard-working Canadian who earned it is

always better spent that in the hands of

the politicians we have and we know what

Canadians are working harder and harder

and we're gonna make sure they keep more

of their own money first of all we're

gonna run a government that lives within

its means we're gonna get back to

balanced budgets in five years

conservatives know that those deficits

add up that it has to be paid back with

interest Newsome honkers in a company I

pay the debt a event in Denver a

collector named Wang lei bonk we know

that more and more of your tax dollars

going just to pay the interest on that

day that's money that could be going

into better services or in better yet

better services or back into tax cuts

and that's why we're gonna stop the

borrowing and get back to balanced

budgets we're gonna be a government that

runs within its means

how do we do that we're gonna leave more

money in your pocket we are going to

lower the first income tax bracket

saving the average hard-working couple

eight hundred and fifty dollars a year

ladies I know many people here probably

take public transit I know I'm visiting

my family and Mississauga I actually

think I think one of my uncle's this

year I have a large like today it's my

Uncle John I've got 30 odd cousins all

spread out throughout the GTA in

southwestern Ontario but I visited my

grandmother on Koffler Road in

Mississauga almost every summer and we

stick the number 8 bus to square one and

we used to come up and take the GO train

down into games and go to the X and I

know how important public transportation

is for people here in the GTA in so many

parts of Canada and that's why we're

going to bring back the public transit

tax credit to help the morning commute

get a little bit more affordable

we're gonna help with raising kids we're

gonna bring back the children's sports

and activities tax credit we're going to

recognize the sacrifice that new moms

make when they take those critical first

few months off of work to be at home

with their newborn child that's why

we're going to make maternity leave

benefits tax-free ladies oh we know how

important it is to help support families

Jill and I have five kids a lot of

people a lot changes between your first

in your fifth I can tell you with our

first child every time they drop

something we're cleaning it off and

disinfecting it running under hot water

you know always checking any time the

people would put it down to sleep

running into the room every time we

heard any kind of noise and 5th child a

little bit different five-second rule

turns into a 50 second rule bad times a

little bit different a lot of people

after Mary was born a few months in

civil she's sleeping through the night

of course we would put her in her crib

turn a fan on in her room

closed her door going our room close our

door turn a fan on a typhoon

when people asked us that question say

we're not sure if she's sleeping tonight

but we're sleeping tonight

that's why we're bringing back these

family-friendly tax cuts like sports

activities and maternity leave and

that's also why we are going to boost

the RESP so that people saving for the

children's education can get a help

helping hand as well an order in order

to pay for that we are going to stop

spending money on corporate welfare

we're gonna cut corporate welfare by one

point two point five billion dollars so

we can put that money right back in the

talker and we're not going to send your

tax dollars to relatively well-off

countries middle and high-income

countries we're going to take 25% out of

the foreign aid but there and we made

the commitment that we are going to

increase transfers to provinces for

health care education and social

programs by three percent or more every

single year

so that is the choice ladies and

gentlemen it could not be more clear

between a prime minister who abuses the

power of his office to reward his

friends and punish his enemies and one

that will shine a light on his scandal

and corruption and bring back ethics and

integrity to our government ladies go

we're Justin Trudeau will embarrass

Canada and get bullied and pushed around

on the world stage I will represent

Canada with strength and conviction and

defend our interests where Trudeau will

look our decorated war heroes in the eye

and tell them that they are asking for

more than he can give I will honor their

service and their sacrifice and uphold

our sacred obligation to them

where he will travel around the world

and talk down

Canada's natural resource and energy

sector I will be a champion for it and

get big projects built in this country

getting our energy sector back on its

feet where he will target law-abiding

farmers and hunters I will target the

real criminals the gangsters the repeat

offenders and the drug traffickers and

while he will watch billions of dollars

leave Canada billions of dollars leave

Canada for other countries I will

support a national energy corridor that

brings Western Canadian energy to

eastern Canadian markets and gets us off

of foreign oil ladies and gentlemen

and where he will raise your taxes run

massive deficits for years and years and

make the cost of living get more and

more expensive I will run a government

that lives within its means so we can

leave more money in your pocket because

it's time for you to get ahead ladies

down

[Applause]

man thank you so much thank you so much

thank you and as Lisa said we've got a

few more days left a little over two

weeks left it's gonna take all our

grassroots efforts you are our secret

weapon we I don't know if you know this

but we don't always sometimes have the

same advantages as a liberal sched what

apparently get any messages though so

it's gonna take every single one of us

working hard long day's long into the

evening knocking on doors putting up

signs I'll have what happens Wayne to

boot was that for

we need all your help but I know this

all of us working together our

grassroots volunteers learn I was just

getting that message out to our friends

and neighbors you know so many people

are telling me they voted liberal in

2015 and they're not doing that at this

time we have an opportunity to get the

message to them to tell them how their

life will get better how life will get

more affordable and how we are going to

win that's right and all of us all of us

working together in ridings and procs

the GTA across Ontario across this great

big wonderful country of ours all of us

doing our part in our runnings we can

and we will make sure that Justin

Trudeau is the ones your Prime Minister
