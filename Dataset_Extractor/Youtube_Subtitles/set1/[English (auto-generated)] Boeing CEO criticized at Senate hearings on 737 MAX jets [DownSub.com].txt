boeing has not told the whole truth to

this committee and to the families under

the people looking at this for hours

Boeing CEO Dennis Muhlenberg faced the

wrath of angry American lawmakers those

pilots never had a chance these loved

ones never had a chance

they peppered him with tough questions

about how his company 737 max planes

were designed and certified and why it

took two fatal crashes to pull them from

service I would walk before I was to get

on a 737 max I would walk Muhlenberg

first public testimony about the max

began with an apology to the victim's

family seated right behind him I know

that probably doesn't offer much comfort

and healing at this point but I want you

to know that we carry those memories

with us every day that was quickly

overshadowed by questions about

explosive text messages between Boeing

engineers mr. Muhlenberg how in the hell

did nobody bring this to your attention

in 2016 Boeing's chief pilot described

the planes MK s anti-stall system as

running rampant in the simulator and

egregious Muhlenberg now admits he

learned about the existence of the

messages earlier this year

prior to the second crash strange the

families wanted more and left with many

questions unanswered

Joan Vincent and Roland were horn of

Orillia lost their daughter Angela in

the ethiopian crash he needs to

understand that I think the biggest

tragedy for me and I fell apart a little

bit in there was just realizing over an

Oregon that this was preventable

Paul Jarreau gay of Toronto lost his

wife three children and mother-in-law on

that same flight to him Mullen Berg's

apology rang hollow it's one thing to

say that we take responsibility over the

installation of MCAS it's another thing

to say we take responsibility over the

deaths of 346 people that's what I want

to hear him say after testifying

publicly Boeing CEO met privately with

the victims families for the first time

the company remains undeterred in its

efforts to get the 737 max back in the

sky the families say if they had their

way

lanes would remain grounded for good
