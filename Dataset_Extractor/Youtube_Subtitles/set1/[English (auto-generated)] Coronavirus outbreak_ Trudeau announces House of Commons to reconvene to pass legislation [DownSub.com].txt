we interrupt this program for breaking

news from the global national newsroom

hello I'm Robin Gill we're standing by

for the prime minister to address

Canadians about the Cova 19 pandemic

this has become something of a daily

event for the past 7 days let's take you

to Ottawa now in the Prime Minister's

home he and his family have been in

self-isolation there since his wife

Sophie tested positive for köppen 19 on

March 13th

she's recovering there and is doing well

the health scare and the economic impact

of Kovan 19 is top of mind for Canadians

the House of Commons will reconvene on

Tuesday to deal with the crisis but

business will have to be conducted with

a minimum number of MPs possibly only

those who are within driving distance of

Ottawa there is an acknowledgment that

parties will try to keep their MPs from

flying as we wait for the prime minister

to speak let's go to our Michal Couture

in Ottawa Mike these press conferences

outside Reno Cottage have become a daily

affair Global News has learned that the

House of Commons is reconvening for a

sitting

obviously unusual and unprecedented

conditions what can you tell us yeah and

consider that they will reconvene at

noon we just got the notice from the

speaker's office today the Speaker of

the House of Commons and as you said a

minimum number because think of this

first of all you don't want to come on a

flight if you're an MP from far off and

also within the House of Commons on

Fridays when there are an a minimum

number of MPs already in the house they

usually actually move around so that

this shot on TV looks like there's a

good number of them around each other

because of social distancing they were

gonna have to be a good distance away

from each other so that will be

interesting we don't expect that

actually to go on for too long though

it'll probably go through pretty quickly

to pass that 82 billion dollar stimulus

package we heard Andrew Shearer speaking

to Canadian Press yesterday saying this

is not the time for partisan games with

this and that he expects that his party

will support it but also on the flip

side what we expect to hear from the

Prime Minister today is the effort to

get all these Canadians home we had the

flight from Morocco landing yesterday in

Montreal this morning we spoke on the

West block

- ha Filipe champaing the Foreign

Affairs Minister who talked a lot about

what the behind-the-scenes machine is

all about in trying to secure these

flights and getting people home they're

already working on one from Spain and

another one from Peru have a listen now

on how difficult it is to try and get

these flights to the country and then

get these Canadians home what we have to

accept is that there will be some

Canadians who can come back home and

what we'll do with our missions around

the world is to provide them services to

it to assist them that this weekend but

I'll be honest with you this is going to

be in a scale that we've never seen

before to give you a sense of

perspective we've got like 14,000 emails

in the last 48 hours 10,000 calls we

have 600 people in our Operations Center

24/7 so this isn't a scale that we've

never seen so everyone is mobilized

we're focusing on helping those in need

most Mike the minister is realistic

though that not all Canadians are gonna

get on flights and come home yeah and

that's a difficult decision they're

having to make trying to make sure that

they can clear that airspace who can

they go get where are there the biggest

and a number of clusters of Canadians

and those who can't those that have to

hunker down and stay in the country

where they are they are looking at using

consular affairs to send money to send

checks to make sure that they have the

funds and that they have the ability to

stay where they are and ride this out

this is not going to be like a hurricane

or some sort of natural disaster where

it'll pass quickly I mean you heard

paddy hide you yesterday talking about

social isolation and how it will social

distancing rather and how that will last

not weeks possibly months and this is

the difficulty the government is really

trying to grapple with here is they're

trying to underscore to Canadians

if everybody does this now it may not

last as long as we want it to or as it

has to so they don't want to play that

card of the Emergencies Act a lot of

people have said what happens when we

get there what will it look like will it

be police officers patrolling

neighborhoods and telling people get

back inside your house please will they

have to arrest people provinces

are I've already been doing it on their

own what will this take for the

government to get there and the

government and ministers are pleading

with Canadians please stay inside now so

we don't have to get there and that we

can get through this now back to the

point of people who are not in Canada

they're gonna do their best to try and

get everybody back to Canada especially

if you consider countries that possibly

don't have health care that is at the

standard of Canada's making sure that

whoever is out there can get back and if

need you know to be in Canada for health

care but it is going to mean difficult

decisions for this government and at

some point just saying this is as many

people as we can bring back at this

point all right Michael Couture in

Ottawa all provinces

nova scotia was the last province to

declare a state of emergency it went

into effect this morning premier Stephen

McNeil is restricting gatherings of more

than five people non-essential

businesses will be closed businesses and

individuals will face fines for

violating self-isolation orders the

province is also tightening controls at

provincial borders if you are coming

into our province you'll be stopped at

every entry point questioned and told to

self isolate for those who are not

essential service and want to enter our

province for social purposes please stay

home

alright let's take a moment to update

you on the Cova 19 numbers here in

Canada there are more than 1300 tested

and diagnosed cases across the country

19 people have died British Columbia and

Ontario are still bearing the brunt of

it BC has at least 424 cases Ontario 377

in Alberta the number has risen to 226

in Quebec there are at least a hundred

and eighty-one cases and yesterday kovat

19 reached the far north Northwest

Territories confirmed its first case the

government there is now limiting

non-essential travel across the

territory's border and that is the first

jurisdiction in Canada to do so now

around the world there have been more

than 300,000 confirmed cases of Cova 19

in about 170 countries and territories

the current center of the pandemic has

been Italy for days now and that

continues to be the case with more than

53,000 people infected Spain has more

than 28,000 people infected and 26,000

people are infected in the u.s. the

numbers obviously keep rising the US

Canada border the world's longest

undefended border has been closed tuna

all non-essential travel for more than

24 hours now it remains open for trade

so trucks carrying food and goods can

continue to go back and forth Canadian

residents are allowed to travel back

from the US but hundreds of Canadians

abroad are still anxiously waiting to

find out when or if they can come back

the federal government is working with

Canadian airlines to operate

repatriation flights one such flight

arrived in Montreal overnight from

Morocco let's go to our Mike Armstrong

in Montreal Mike that flight from

Morocco had more than 400 Canadians and

permanent residents but what do we know

about other flights to other parts of

the world to get Canadians out well we

know that the government is scrambling

we're hearing reports about flights

perhaps leaving for Guatemala trying to

bring back about 95 people there about

4300 people we believe stranded in Peru

that country closing its airspace it is

extremely complicated trying to get

planes into their minister

bang actually said that the planes are

the easy part it's getting the landing

permission the making sure the airport's

open making sure people can actually

travel to get to the airport to be

picked up because we have martial law in

some of these countries and curfews and

things like that actually you can log on

to Twitter and see where a lot of

Canadians are stranded you can basically

just put Canadian and any country you

want and you'll find people saying I'm

here can the government please come and

help me

the government's also making suggestions

to people if you have family that are in

these some of these countries and

they're stranded in any country actually

the government's saying please make sure

that they register with the consulate

that they fall that they fill all the

different excuse me the forms that the

government asks for so that the

government knows exactly where they are

and whether they can travel or not but

and then it's the the government's duty

to get the planes there and that's what

they're working on a WestJet by the way

put out a statement last night saying

they're hoping to make 34 repatriation

flights between this Tuesday and

Thursday so that work continues Robin

you know the window of opportunity to

get these Canadians home is obviously

shrinking not a lot of airspace runways

are diminishing

what about snowbirds I know the province

odd the federal government was urging

snowbirds to get home yeah we're seeing

that trickle actually south of Montreal

we've got the local border crossing

which is if you drive north from Florida

straight to Canada that's probably where

you would end up going and all day

yesterday there were news reports of

people showing up there and saying we're

in sometimes in RVs and things like that

saying we're happy to be home actually

one of the things that they were saying

was that perhaps Florida wasn't taking

it as seriously as they were here in

Quebec was taking it and Canada and so

they were that's one of the reasons they

were happy to be home as well as the

health care system here but yeah a lot

of snowbirds heading home and it is

important to note as was noted just a

little while ago that Canadians headed

north can cross if you got a Canadian

passport the Kenyan government is not

going to tell you you can't cross the

border home yesterday the Prime Minister

indicator that it's kind of become tree

by country day by day when we figure out

how many and when we can return these

Canadians yeah and it's it's really

complicated cuz there

actually in some cases for example

European countries planes are leaving

Canada with foreign nationals taking

them home and then when they get there

they're picking up Canadians and

bringing them back and you know it's a

we see the cabinet ministers giving

shoutouts to people health care workers

people are driving trucks and things

like that

it's important to remember the work

that's going on on these repay tree

Asian flights the pilots and the flight

attendants who are putting perhaps their

danger their lives in danger at least it

is a very distressing thing to have to

do they're being given masks and gloves

so imagine flight attendants that and

that's the only defense they have people

are getting into these confined areas

with them they're bringing people back

and I spoke to a flight attendant on

Friday who was telling me you know here

she is nervous about whether if she's

putting a life in danger and maybe her

family by bringing something back with

her and there she is sitting in another

country waiting to fill up the plane and

bring people back and that's when she

got her layoff notice telling her that

in two weeks she won't have a job

anymore at least temporarily but who

knows how long this is gonna last these

are tough times all right Mike Armstrong

in Montreal let's turn to our jeff

simple in on in toronto jeff can you

update us on the situation in Ontario

now yeah Robin in the last few minutes

in fact we've received an update from

health officials here in the province of

Ontario updating the number of cases in

this province that number now stands at

four hundred and twenty-four they've had

47 new cases here in the province of

Ontario so again the total number for

the province 424 that includes the three

people who were killed by the virus and

it's also worth noting that there are

more than 8300 cases now under

investigations so an expectation here

that the number of cases will continue

to rise as we continue to await the test

results from many of those other

patients we've also heard that Ontario

hospitals are receiving broad new powers

now to help combat this outbreak that

includes the ability to cancel staff

vacations to move employees between

departments is needed and to bring

volunteers in to assist as needed as

well and we're outside of one Hospital

here in Toronto

we're an emergency room doctor is now on

his own volition launching what he's

calling a PPE drive so we've all heard

of food drives of course but PPE Drive

PPE standing for personal protective

equipment so those surgical masks that

we often see he's concerned about a

critical shortage here in the days ahead

for those of that type of equipment for

health officials where it's so

desperately needed so he's asking

members of the public starting tomorrow

to donate any unused unexpired surgical

masks those are n95 respirators gowns

goggles anything that's still in its

packaging to bring them to your local

hospital here in the City of Toronto and

donate them to the health officials who

so desperately need them and of course

Robin we've seen those images people

hoarding some of those supplies it's not

uncommon to see people in the streets of

Toronto wearing those surgical masks as

they're out and about despite health

officials stressing that those masks

will help prevent the spread of the

virus if you're infected but there's not

a lot of evidence to suggest that

wearing them out on the street is going

to prevent you from getting sick unless

you have close contact with someone

known to be carrying the virus and of

course that is the case for many health

officials here who are at the very

center of battling this outbreak they're

obviously under a huge enormous amount

of strain what other resources are being

made available to them

well at this point they're really

concerned about the lack of ventilators

as I say at the lack of surgical

equipment we've heard from the w-h-o the

World Health Organization warning about

a global shortage of PPE saying that

globally speaking we need to increase

the production of those surgical masks

by 40 percent so some pretty dire

numbers there and of course we've seen

what can happen in a hot spot like Italy

for example if health officials don't

have protection almost 10% of frontline

health care workers in Italy have been

sidelined as a result of their their

exposure to the virus so at a point

where our health system is at capacity

of course we then run the risk if we

don't protect our frontline health

officials that they could be taken out

of service and make this bad situation

that much worse Robin what's the testing

like in Ontario well at this point

there's the health officials have warned

that there's simply not enough testing

going on and they are trying to ramp

that up as best they can we are seeing

of course that they they're aiming for

the number 5,000 tests a day is what

they'd like to be seeing nationwide

that's the number that we've heard the

Health Minister talked about before

we've seen in a country like South Korea

for example which is you know nearly

twice the size of Canada they were

conducting at their peak about 10,000

tests per day the tests are quite quick

in most cases we're talking about a

nasal swab but then the test results can

take several hours to process and in

most cases patients are told to wait for

a couple of days so as we say in the

province of Ontario right now we're

looking at more than 8,000 cases that

are currently under investigation so a

lot of in many of those those are test

results that we are now waiting to hear

back from but you know especially when

you look at an example like South Korea

where the health officials there did a

terrific job by all accounts of managing

to get this outbreak under control at

least relatively speaking one of the big

hallmarks of their success there Robin

was just the mass testing that they

conducted on an unprecedented scale not

only to determine who had the virus but

then to determine who they had had

contact with to notify the people in

there thank you so much we're gonna

listen in to the prime minister now

let's let's hear what he has to say for

today

some churro giving his daily they know

what coming 1203 it's a feminine or

producer men could is expel the

something public demo several weeks that

health expert us Canadians to help them

slow down the spread of the pandemic

stay home restrict your traveling and do

not meet in great groups so I'd like to

thank all the people who follow the

directions and we must all do our part

we all might make sacrifices to protect

not only our health but also other

people's health and this is what people

do and this says it is reassuring but we

have to continue working overtime to

keep us safe and keep the country moving

hospital staff border agents store

clerks cashiers postal workers delivery

folks pharmacists cleaning staff first

responders truck drivers train

conductors and so many others they've

been working every day so we can work

from home and practice social distancing

thank you for being there for us know

that all Canadians are grateful for your

service I know that many of you are

worried about what might happen next

you're wondering how long this is going

to laugh

and your savings you're worried about

your kids not being in school and we get

it these are uncertain times and

families across the country are

concerned that's why this week we took

important steps to support Canadians

protect jobs and limit the spread of the

virus we unveiled an 82 billion dollar

plan to help people and businesses

who've fallen on hard times because of

covet 19 as part of this plan we want to

boost the Canada Child Benefit

introduced new benefits to help people

who don't qualify for employment

insurance and supplement the GST credit

amongst many other things our government

also announced new funding for research

and a new strategy to mobilize industry

to fight kovat 19 after conversations

with our colleagues on the other side of

the aisle I can now confirm that the

House of Commons will be recalled on

Tuesday at noon so we can pass emergency

legislation that will put our plan into

motion on that note I want to thank the

house leaders for their cooperation and

the members of the opposition for their

efforts as we work together to slow the

spread of this virus I know that

together we can protect Canadians save

jobs and set the groundwork for our

economy to rebound after this crisis the

economy on top of our economic strategy

we have announced new restrictions for

traveling and we have temporarily closed

our borders to international travelers

we have also made an agreement with the

united states to prohibit non-essential

movements between our two countries and

we are considering encouraging Canadians

who are abroad to come home but many

people are in difficulties to find a

flight to fly back to Canada and

yesterday announced that our government

who would be working with Canadian

airlines for the purpose of making this

easier for Canadians to come back home

and the first flight from

Rocco with Air Canada has arrived last

night and other flights will be added

and WestJet has announced that from

monday to wednesday more than 30 flights

are planned for the purpose of taking

Canadians back home Air Transat is

working at the moment to weigh the world

affairs Global Affairs of all he know in

order to plan flights where the airspace

is closed and thousands of people might

be brought back over the next few days

and when there's are spots left on sun

wing the flight is free for people who

need it we've announced so far on the

government website at canada dot CA and

since there's more support coming this

week that's where you'll find all the

information you need and to help you

deserve a faster in situation also crazy

though we're facing an unknown situation

without precedent and if you cannot talk

with somebody or if you're abroad and

you cannot find a flight well this is of

course created triggering anxiety I can

assure you the whole of our civil

service is working for 24/7 to provide

you the help that you deserve and from

the beginning we told you that would be

who will have your backs and that we

told you that the government would spare

no effort to support you we went through

several important steps over the last

few weeks but work continues and we

won't let you down and you can count on

us helping us slow the spread of covet

19 to those of you who usually spend

your Sundays in a place of worship thank

you for staying home today I know it's

not easy but it is deeply appreciated

and to all the kids out there all of a

sudden you've heard you can't go on play

dates or have sleepovers your

playgrounds and schools have closed and

your March Break was certainly different

than what you'd hoped for I get it from

my kids as well they're watching

watching a whole lot more movies

but they miss their friends and at the

same time they're worried about what's

going on out there in the world and what

no this is a big change but we have to

do for ourselves but for our

grandparents our nurses our doctors and

everyone working at our hospitals and

you kids are helping a lot the doctors

and scientists have been clear that

social distancing which means staying at

least 2 meters apart and staying home as

much as possible is the best way to help

each other and you're having to wash

your hands a lot so a special thanks to

all you kids thank you for helping your

parents work from home for sacrificing

your usual day for doing math class

around the kitchen table and for

trusting in science we're gonna have

more to say to you soon so stay tuned in

the meantime let's make sure we all do

our part let's fight this together yes

people go to the moon

Thank You everybody I'll be glad to

answer your questions live from Radio

Canada CBC on social media we see tons

of pictures with many many people

crowding the spaces and they do not seem

to be worried about social distancing so

what your message for you these people

and what is the threshold for your

government to intervene and and use

coercion answer well to everybody I'm

saying stay home practice social

distancing this is essential in order to

to slow down the spread of the virus and

also to help our fellow citizens and

also to protect most of all the people

who are working in our health systems

each and everybody has the ability to

slow down the spread and to flatten the

curve and protect our communities and we

must do it so when making taking steps

federally provinces are making the

necessary provisions and we do cooperate

for the purpose to do whatever is

necessary and will be necessary but in

it

the Tammi we wanted to encourage people

to stay home and help our country to go

through the crisis in English please

I recognize that millions of Canadians

are practicing social distancing are

choosing to stay home are looking for

ways to keep two metres apart from each

other and taking this very seriously

that's great because this is a situation

in which individual Canadians behaving

responsibly will help themselves help

their neighbors and mostly protect our

healthcare workers this is something we

mean to do together we are of course

continuing to work very closely with

with all provinces with different orders

of government to make sure that people

are understanding what they need to do

and doing it we will continue to look at

possible next steps that may become

necessary but for now we are telling

people stay home engage in social

distancing protect yourselves protect

our system and let's get through this

strongly as a country buta comas happen

near my diffuser patottie the sir

assembly the Schatzi also fine weather

is starting and people are starting to

go out he sent wouldn't be it would it

be reasonable to use the war measures

the emergency measures act in order to

have people stay at home answer I

understand the desire people may have to

go out and they may they may go out but

they should keep their distance and they

should avoid crowding and they should

avoid them meeting in congregations and

we on as far as we're concerned are

doing her utmost to guarantee people

security and safety and safety and and

and we're working with the provinces and

if other necessary steps are to be taken

will building them into social distance

is not enough there is mounting evidence

of social media pictures of people

packing onto beaches in Vancouver for

example why not invoke something

stricter like the emergencies act why

not you know restrict people's civil

liberties to protect

health there are many things that are

being done and can being done at the

local level of the municipal level and

at the provincial level the federal

emergencies Act is a significant step

that can and should be taken when we've

exhausted all other steps at other

orders of government and the legislation

and regulations available to the federal

government do not respond or are

insufficient to respond to the situation

at hand

we continue to work very closely with

provinces with other jurisdictions to

make sure that they are able to do the

things that need to be done and we will

continue to look at if it's necessary to

move forward with the emergencies act

your party took down a public appeal

that used the köppen crisis to fundraise

for the Liberal Party why was that taken

down and what did you do about it I

can't speak for for that decision

I'm obviously this is a situation in

which Canadians need to pull together we

need to be there to support each other

we need to make sure we're using all

different methods to connect and pass

important messages to Canadians on how

to stay safe and how to make sure that

we are that we are properly protecting

ourselves our communities and protecting

health care workers I know that everyone

needs to use whatever methods of

communications they have but it's not a

situation for fundraising hi it's Annie

Bergeron Oliver with CTV national news

companies across Canada have said that

they're willing and able to retool their

production lines and to ramp up

production but they say that they need

assurances from the federal government

will your government guarantee that it

will buy supplies like masks and

ventilators if companies start preparing

them immediately that is very much part

of our industrial strategy that we just

announced to get companies across the

country to manufacture essential

equipment whether it's ventilators or

masks or gowns we've had already a

tremendous positive response from

companies it both creates things that we

need in Canada and that will be

necessary elsewhere around the

as well as keeping Canadians at work in

factories contributing to our economic

activity these are things that we're

going to continue to do and we can

assure companies that produce these

things that we need them and we will use

them so is that a yes that companies

that are producing them immediately will

have their purchases their products

purchased and - are you considering any

incentives to keep people home we are

looking at ways of ensuring that people

can stay home by attending AI supports

to people who don't normally qualify for

them income replacements that'll make

sure that people don't face a choice

between having to go out there and work

in order to feed their family and

possibly put put their neighbours and

themselves at risk we want to be able to

be able to choose home so Brian Mullen

at the Global News I have a question

about economic aid for Canadians Denmark

has a very aggressive plan paying about

75% of people's salaries to avoid mass

layoffs and let them keep their jobs

encourage them to stay home

basically freezing their economy in the

hopes it'll eventually thaw out with

less damage in the long run did your

government consider this option and rule

it out we have not ruled out anything as

I said we put forward a significant

package of 27 billion dollars directly

into the economy to support workers to

support small businesses but that was

only the initial phase of what is

necessary we are continuing to talk

about next steps looking at best

practices from around the world looking

what other countries and jurisdictions

are doing to ensure that our economy

remains solid if at a standstill

so that it can pick up again once this

crisis is through in a question about

personal protective equipment not just

for frontline hospital staff but for

other essential workers once the virus

ramps up people will burn through it

fast do we have what we need now are you

bringing in shipments right now from

other countries including China we are

confident in our capacity to ramp up to

provide protective equipment for

frontline hospital staff and others who

need it so importantly this is something

that Canada has been working towards for

a while now we will ensure

that the equipment is available for

those who need it right across the

country good morning Prime Minister

Trudeau Sean's to look off at The Globe

and Mail I hope your family's doing well

as well as can be in the circumstances

like every other person in Canada just

picking up on my colleagues question

about freezing the economy it seems to

be a fairly significant move by a number

of countries I can you share with us

your views and your government's views

about taking this approach

I've talked this morning to several

business leaders including Goldie Haider

and they're all concerned that this

economy will go into a tailspin and they

think it would be better to push money

from the government through them to

their employees rather than seeing

another week of 500,000 or a million

Canadians applying to e.i and

overwhelming your government's resources

to practice to process those

applications and then again to fill in

more paperwork to apply for their jobs

back can you tell us a little bit more

maybe go into more detail about your

thinking about this approach because it

seems to be the thought leadership

that's that everyone is looking at in

the last couple of days we've been

listening and speaking with business

leaders in this country top employers

small business groups representatives

right across the country to hear their

ideas on how to move forward we've been

listening to opposition leaders who are

making different suggestions as well I

can tell you that nothing is off the

table but I can also tell you that there

is no one measure that is going to be

sufficient to get us through this

situation we are going to need to bring

in many different measures that have

different impacts on employers on

employees on workers on families on

vulnerable Canadians on Canadians of all

sorts of different challenges and and

and situations in order to be able to

hold strong through this time of

economic stoppage to have so much

activity so that we can then as we were

through this pick up without having lost

too much or anything and without too

much delay yes it is obvious that the

companies that are able to keep people

on the pay

Rolle longer will find it easier not

have to rehire later and that is

certainly something that we are looking

at is something we've taken steps

already towards with the payroll credit

but there is more to do and these are

the things that we're absolutely looking

at but like I said there is no one

silver bullet it is going to be many

many different measures brought together

in the most efficient way that will help

us do this and what guidance can you

provide Canadians and employers about

how long the current maximum container

phase will last before shift gears to a

more targeted containment where most

people can return to work will it be

weeks months or several quarters that is

a question for scientists obviously we

are taking the best advice from top

researchers around the world we're

looking at the track of the spread of

the disease in China in places like

South Korea in places like Taiwan and

Singapore looking at the challenges

facing Europe and particularly Italy

right now and trying to make sure that

we are taking the best possible

decisions here in Canada we know that

self isolation and social distancing is

going to be extremely important in the

coming weeks we're going to have to

maintain it we also know that testing on

a much larger scale is going to be very

important which is why we're testing

ramping up the amount of tests done by

tens of thousands every single day we

will continue to look to do exactly what

we need to do in the time it takes I

wish I wish anyone could give a date at

which point this will all be behind us

but that really depends not just on what

we do today but what we keep doing

tomorrow and into next week and into

next month and that's why we all need to

be working together to get through this

as I know Canadians will thank you will

now go to the phone for a few questions

if you'll have one question in a quick

follow-up moderator thank you messy the

next question is from @ml CEO the next

question is from animal feel your line

is open looking it

play mafia please go ahead ray I've been

in what probably one more room should I

mean it hello Prime Minister to follow

up on my colleagues question doctors

business people are asking you for more

stringent or even more coercive measures

to make sure people stay at home why do

you believe it is not yet time to order

people to stay home and just not to

travel to go out we know that

provincially and municipally there are

measures that can be put in place to

measure people's movements for the

federal government to take that step

that would you take circumstances where

we've really gone beyond anything that

can be done by the municipality and by

the province an emergency measure at the

federal level to exercise those powers

we are not there yet

but we are watching and monitoring the

situation carefully to see if that ever

becomes necessary thank you big yawn

Thank You Brenda Morel your line is open

some chairs real knives a mohel please

go ahead

good morning mr. Toledo you talked about

an airlift for Peru and Spain when will

those flights leave to bring back

Canadians who are in those countries I

can assure you that Global Affairs

Canada is working directly with

governments not only in Peru and

elsewhere but around the world they're

working to ensure that we can land at

the airports we need that we can both

land and take off air spaces are closed

so we need authorization and we believe

that we will

be able to have those flights soon there

are a large number of Canadians waiting

for those flights and we're working very

hard to bring them home as quickly as we

can it will take some a bit more

patience however so is this a matter of

days or a week it's a matter of days we

hope yesterday you said also that you

we're sorry to say that some Canadians

would not be able to come home what will

you say to Canadians who may be stuck in

Peru for example because they're ill and

they can't come home and may have to

find care in places that are somewhat

less advanced medical facilities that

are less advanced what do you tell their

families first of all as I said at any

given time 3 million Canadians are

outside the country and not everyone

will be able to or will even want to

come back what we're telling people who

have no choice but to remain where they

are to make sure they self isolate to be

very careful please register on the

website at Travel GC dot CA we will do

everything we can we're providing

funding to help people who have to

remain where they are but this is an

unprecedented situation and we don't

always have the means to help everyone

as much as we would wish but we will try

to help as many people as possible and

that is what Global Affairs Canada is

trying to achieve as it works with

Airlines and others to bring back as

many Canadians as possible thank you

next II don't I just don't either

the last question last question what

thingy to back your line is open

David you might be unmute as well good

grief and there I was sending a tweet

mocking another colleague laughing yeah

okay you're live now David so you can

ask you a question you talked about the

next week's of social isolation but

penny hide you your house and mr. major

yesterday that we're talking about

months not weeks now this is surely the

need to keep the economy from freezing

over months rather than weeks surely

means as my other colleagues of us do

that you're gonna have to boost your

your your reaction the fiscal stimulus

plans can have been much bigger than the

twenty seven billion we've announced yes

as we've said what we announced this

past week twenty seven billion dollars

directly into the economy the fifty five

billion in deferred taxes these are only

a very first step we are looking now at

what those next steps are to ensure that

our economy is able to pick up against

once we're through this whether it takes

weeks or months it is likely to take

months before we're fully through this

that's why supporting directly to

Canadians support directly to small

businesses to large businesses to

industry to various sectors that will be

much harder hit these are things we are

busy looking at in order so that once we

move through this we are able to get

back to where we were before as quickly

as possible right thank you effective

maneuver connoisseur screams I'm off a

Lessman bossy we recognize that what we

announced last week the twenty seven

billion in direct support and the five

fifty five billion in deferred taxes

that is going to help but that is only a

first step we realize we will have to

take many other measures be it direct

measures for small businesses industries

workers

sectors we know that the overall goal is

to get through this crisis this extreme

economic slowdown and then revitalize

the economy quickly afterwards it's

going to be difficult it is going to

require many different solutions and a

collective effort but we will do what we

need to do and we will come through this

together

as Canadians thank you everyone have a

good Sunday you've just heard the Prime

Minister addressing the nation and

impressing upon Canadians that they must

restrict travel that they should not

meet in groups and that they should

maintain social distancing he admits

that this is going to go on for weeks if

not months let's bring in Michael

Couture in Ottawa Mike it seems like the

provinces have more power than the

federal government when it comes to

enforcing this social distancing and

social and self isolation yeah or at

least they're willing to use it more

readily I mean hearing about nova scotia

saying no gatherings more than five

people and others like you're hearing in

Quebec that they you know are arresting

people who are under quarantine and

saying you know you'll now be facing a

fine fines as well coming in Nova Scotia

if that if you ignore the health

ministers or the health officials

directives the prime minister clearly in

that press conference not willing to go

there yet thinking that what will the

country look like and this government

has continually said these are only the

first steps clearly the thinking behind

the scenes is we want to go with baby

steps here what do we need to do right

now to maintain the economy to maintain

public health and then what do we need

to do in the next step in Trudeau making

mention of that saying nothing is off

the table

there will be there will not be one

measure that is going to get us out of

this I think which is important that he

says it's going to be part of a whole

myriad of them and on the last question

on the economy saying yes of course this

is just the first step we're thinking

about the next economic steps going

forward to make sure that we have a plan

going forward to get out of this because

that is just as important as weathering

the storm now is how will the economy

come

this didn't he he mentioned an extreme

economic slowdown didn't say recession

and I think that's part of the framing

that this government and the

communication that this government is

being very careful about trying to make

sure they don't put people into a panic

and I think that's why the government

has not gone to the Emergencies act yet

it is something that they want to play

as their last card the last time a prime

minister did this it was called the war

Measures Act and it was his father Prime

Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau that was

a completely different situation but at

the same time extremely extreme and

Prime Minister Trudeau knows that if he

has to play that card it has to be the

last one we can't get there yet at the

same time he was asked during that press

conference what do you think of seeing

those images of people in Vancouver and

in BC on beaches still gathering and he

tried as much as he could to impress

upon them that look everybody you are

responsible you are responsible and

helping us flatten the curve here and if

you don't self I sleep if you don't

limit social interaction and have social

distancing then this is gonna be longer

for everybody also wanted to sort of

mention how he did speak and address

directly to kids you know I've got two

kids at home they're having a difficult

time as well and understanding you can't

go outside you have to limit your

exposure to other people interesting

that the Prime Minister felt it

important to mention his own kids and

how difficult it has been for them

they've been watching a lot more movies

as he said but also saying that he

thanks them for helping the parents to

work from home possibly doing homework

around the kitchen table

you know while school is either on or

not in different parts of the country

and saying to them look we're gonna get

through this

and he also saying he's going to you

know address them further you know in

the days to come

clearly this government is trying to

take a whole approach to everyone

understanding the strain that this is

putting the entire country through Robin

Mike on Tuesday the house of commons is

reconvening obviously this is unusual

it's going to be a smaller Corps a

smaller quorum so to speak it's 82

billion dollars is are you getting any

sense from the opposition that they say

it's not enough and we need more not yet

I mean what we're here

from Andrews sure he did an interview

with Canadian Press and he basically

said yeah this is gonna go through we

may have some suggestions to add to it

but I think you know as the time goes on

I mean it was all he feels like it was a

year ago doesn't it but just a couple of

days ago that the Prime Minister and the

Minister of Finance Bill Morneau

announced these measures he said you

know 82 billion dollars and now we're

looking at already the prime minister

said more steps

Andrew Shearer saying we're just trying

to make sure that we can communicate

directly with the government when we

think we have concerns that there may be

gaps and it sounds like those lines of

communications are open the Prime

Minister is saying that his House Leader

Pablo Rodriguez is in regular

communication with the other leaders

from the different parties to make sure

that everybody is on board we expect it

to be a short session on Tuesday at noon

you'll have as you said a minimum number

the number of of MPs that can come who

can drive to Ottawa

so that actually might mean that the

Green Party doesn't have representation

in the House because you consider that

two of their members are out and thanked

or out in BC one is out in New Brunswick

so they may not be represented there but

all other parties to work together and

pass this and I personally think that it

will I'm not going to say rubber stamp

but it will pass because everybody on

all sides of the aisle know that this

has to get through now and they're not

going to be doing any politicking to try

and hold it up they may have suggestions

that the government will listen to and

make sure that it is bolstered one issue

that I think that is interesting is how

do you get the money out the door

quickly earlier today we talked to

foreign affairs minister of housewife

Philip champaing who was on the West

block which would be aired later on

tonight and we asked him about that how

do you get the money out the door

quickly because a lot of Canadians are

sitting at home saying I'm not getting a

paycheck right now and I have to buy

groceries right now so when we asked him

what are the mechanisms that you can use

and you can the leavers you can pull on

to get it out the door he said look

behind the scenes we're working very

hard but it's difficult because it is a

big machine have a listen

we need to find the way the mechanism

which is fair quick and appropriate you

know because we need to have speed and

resiliency in that so we need to balance

these things to make sure that what we

do is fair but also it's fast and it's

resilient Mike what else did the the

foreign affairs minister say this

morning well he was talking a lot about

the difficulties that they're having and

I know earlier in our broadcast Mike

Armstrong was talking about this as well

in trying to coordinate all of the

repatriation flights there are Canadians

who might be watching this abroad and

saying I'm stuck I need help

while global affairs Canada is doing

their best to try and get flights their

prime minister had mentioned it as well

in his address that they're trying to

get to every Canadian they admit that

they may not be able to get to everybody

because you have to consider that

there's restricted airspace that you

have different protocols think about

this for a second the flight crew that

lands in whatever country they're going

to they have to make sure that they meet

all of the criteria of that country so

does that mean that because they are

foreign that they're coming in to Peru

for instance that they have to self

isolate for 14 days well the Minister of

Foreign Affairs has to get on the phone

to his counterpart in Peru and say can

you make sure that this flight crew is

exempt from that there are also other

issues in terms of flight crews that

they have to rest will they have to stay

over in Peru once they land and get

people out it's not as simple as flying

down and flying back there are so many

things behind the scenes that need to be

worked out negotiating with these other

governments to make sure that you can

get those Canadians to the airport if in

other places as possible Philip shan-pak

mentioned is there martial law going on

in one of these jurisdictions and how do

you get Canadians through there think

about what happened in Wuhan China where

they had to send special releases

special notes to the Canadians so they

could get through checkpoints to get to

the airport I know it sounds it feels

like it was years ago but there's only a

few weeks ago that the government of

Canada's biggest concern was getting

Canadians out of Wuhan China and out of

Yokohama Japan to get them off of cruise

ships similar type of negotiations have

to happen but it's

across the globe now Francois field of

shopping also mentioned to us that

they're making deals and negotiating

with London England to make sure that

the airspace continues to stay open make

that almost a bit of a hub so that

Canadians can get to London then that

they can definitely get home and make

sure that whoever needs to get home

knows and that's the other thing this

government has tried to underscore

register on the government on the

Canadian website I believe it's travel

GCA so that they know where you are and

that they can come get you if they can

all right Mikey Mike thanks so much for

that as we mentioned earlier all

provinces are now under a state of

emergency nova scotia was the last

province to make such a declaration it

went into effect this morning premier

Stephen McNeil is taking drastic steps

to prevent the spread of kovin 19

restricting gatherings of more than five

people non-essential businesses will be

closed businesses and individuals will

face fines for violating self-isolation

orders starting immediately police can

now issue tickets for breaching the

chief public health officers orders

mainly around social distancing

currently fines are set at $1,000 per

individual per day the fined is 7,500

for businesses the province is also

tightening controls at provincial

borders and ordering anyone who has

travelled outside the province to self

isolate for 14 days if you are coming

into our province you'll be stopped at

every entry point questioned and told to

self isolate for those who are not

essential service and want to enter our

province for social purposes please stay

home

let's go to our Mike Armstrong in

Montreal Mike we heard about Nova Scotia

state of emergency can you take us

through some of the measures that are

being taken across the country to stop

the transmission of copán 19

yeah it's a slightly different

everywhere you go but very much pretty

much in the same vein but every every

single province now has that some sort

of a declaration of a state of emergency

or a public health emergency some cities

have done the same here in Quebec for

example as of yesterday there is a ban

on all public gatherings which sounds

pretty extreme but that's inside that's

all gatherings if you're outside you can

have some gatherings as long as you can

respect the five excuse me the 2-meter

social distancing rules exempt at this

point our workplaces and public spaces

where some sort of a good is being

obtained so stores for example things

like that but it is really changing the

way the government is treating people

for example Friday there was a woman in

Quebec City or the Quebec City area who

was called by health officials to be

told she was she had tested positive she

made it clear to them that she wasn't

going to stay home they then called

police police went to the home didn't

find her

they found her outside the home she was

then arrested and ordered into hospital

so shows you how things are getting

tighter Northwest Territories also as of

this weekend blocking or limiting travel

to the territory all but essential

travelers can go through so that closing

a provincial border so that's something

that the province excuse me the federal

government has said it's considering but

it doesn't want to do and the reason

really is limiting travel will have an

impact on probably more people than you

want to so the government is trying to

make sure that we we do limit

transmission but that we also make sure

the country keeps running the Health

Minister said yesterday you know we

don't want to do more harm we're trying

to help here Mike it seems like the

power is in public health officials not

necessarily the federal government it's

a patchwork it doesn't seem to have any

consistency you could argue that but the

federal government as Mike was saying

doesn't want to sort of bring the hammer

down with that that last thing that it

still has in its back pocket the

Emergencies acted

trying not to do that but everybody's

involved with this even municipalities

for example the mayor of Brampton

Ontario put out a tweet this morning

talking about how a clerk at a petrol

Canada Tim Hortons has tested positive

and asking everyone who's been there for

gas or coffee or supplies recently to

self isolate for 14 days so I would

argue everybody every level of

government really is involved in this in

the way that they can make a difference

Robin all right Mike Armstrong in

Montreal let's return to our Jeff sample

in Toronto Jeff the Prime Minister is

talking about the health crisis putting

in a tremendous strain on hospitals and

medical workers can you talk about

what's being done to make sure the

people on the front lines have the

resources they need well in the last few

minutes Robin we've actually received a

release from the union representing

nurses in the province of Ontario

revealing that dozens of its members

dozens of nurses were exposed to a

patient who had kovat 19 in Kitchener

Ontario that patient was reportedly

admitted to the emergency ward of a

hospital in Kitchener was screened flute

for influenza the standard seasonal flu

but was not tested for kovat 19 and as a

result the union says the dozens of

nurses were exposed to that patient and

did not have the proper respiratory

masks the n95 that the union says nurse

is required to ensure that they are not

infected so just another example and

we've heard so many of them now where

health officials on the frontlines are

warning that they don't have the

equipment they need to protect

themselves now you heard Prime Minister

Justin Trudeau they're saying that he's

confident that the country the Canada

does have the capacity and will be able

to ramp up capacity as needed the Prime

Minister sounding confident but

certainly health officials here on the

front lines not sounding confident

sounding panicked and warning that we

are quickly approaching a crisis point

here that they don't have the supplies

they need whether it be ventilators or

PPS and that this storyline could become

much more prominent in it later this

week Robin what's the reaction been to

Ontario's emergency plan there well

Ontario's emergency plan is one of the

strongest we've seen thus far across the

country police now have the power to

issue fines and against individuals but

also against core

operation significant ones reaching into

the tens of thousands of dollars for

corporations that you know either

refused to shut down in the case of a

restaurant for example or allow

employees to gather in groups of 50 or

more so Ontario leading the way in that

regard and you know we says we've noted

now seeing the province of Nova Scotia

taking a similar measure of the premier

they're sounding very frustrated they

can now issue fines as well similarly in

Saskatchewan as Mike Armstrong noted

police in Quebec arrested a woman last

week who was infected with the disease

but was still out and about do running

errands and we've seen internationally

as well robbing a number of countries

including democracies such as South

Korea taking these draconian measures

monitoring CCTV and bank records for

example to make sure that patients are

self isolating as instructed in Hong

Kong we've seen patients they're wearing

those trackable bracelets that allow

officials to ensure that their movements

are tracked and that they stay in

self-isolation in Israel the government

they're reportedly monitoring cell phone

data to try and keep people where they

are obviously the government here in

Canada nowhere near implementing any

measures like that and in fact still

reluctant to implement the Emergencies

act as we've heard they're following in

the example that we've seen from a

number of provinces including right here

in Ontario

Jeff earlier you were talking about a

doctor and his petition calling for more

personal protective equipment tell us

about that again yeah that's right so

Anam frontline emergency room worker

here a doctor here at Michael Guerin

Hospital in Toronto is going to be

putting out an official call a press

release to the public later today asking

people to donate any unused protective

equipment unused unexpired masks or

surgical masks and 95 respirators

goggles gowns vinyl gloves anything

that's unused unexpired asking them to

bring those items to their local

hospitals here and sort of a PPE dr

similar to you know a food drive that

we'd used to see so he's going to be

asking people to to make those donations

drop them off at their local hospital

starting tomorrow and they're now

organizing quickly to try and get ready

to make sure they're able to receive

them all right Jeff sample in Toronto

before we leave we want to give you a

quick look at what Prime Minister Justin

Trudeau just announced in his nationwide

address and we can't reiterate the words

of the Prime Minister and health

officials across the country enough stay

home to limit the spread of the new

coronavirus we know you have lots of

questions about this virus and Jeff

sample we'll continue to consult with

experts and try to answer them you can

email your questions at your questions

at global news dot CA and on our website

you'll find a special page dedicated

entirely to the new corona virus that's

at global news dot CA / corona virus we

also want to mention that Global News

okay well good afternoon everyone

good afternoon Canada Lots changes every

day and it's extremely hard for people

to keep up with the volume of

information they're getting from all

levels of government one way to ensure

that you have information that you need

is to visit the can see a backslash

coronavirus website this website has

been growing as we've been evolving and

as measures have been evolving it's a

great place to get to up-to-date

information and credible information

it's seen an incredible traffic increase

with thirty seven point two million

visits since its launch on January 16th

and we continue to update it with the

latest information including the

self-assessment tool that we added

yesterday we've seen 280,000 Canadians

use this tool since it was launched

twelve hours ago so you can see that

this is a highly demanded information

that Canadians are looking for if you're

feeling unwell or you're unsure I

encourage you to answer a series of

questions on the site to determine

whether you need further testing or

medical attention on continuing

education implement

in full of Canadians Canada a coastal

apothecary yesterday with a daily show

at the terminal just cause a cell on the

tongue so that people in Quahog shall

salute it is a new boost on tape a B and

C well we're also working on making more

mental health supports accessible online

and we will have new tools up as soon as

next week our mental health is difficult

to maintain with the enormous

disruptions that we're seeing in our

lives and we're all searching for ways

to hold on to routine and to each other

if you were alone reach out by phone or

online to friends and family and find

new ways that you can do things together

using technology share a meal with

friends or family who are apart from you

using a social media platform that

allows you to see each other and try to

spend time outdoors each day social

distancing

doesn't mean that we have to stay inside

but while you're doing that give people

their space stay six feet away from

others and as always be kind there are

people in every community who are

struggling and they need our help more

than ever reach out to them even a small

gesture a text or call makes a

difference now more than ever we need to

stay connected and thankfully we have

tools that can help thank you very much

today we'll hear from dr. new on a

situational update and then from pablo

rodriguez minister Rodriguez on the

House of Commons reconvening next week

dr. noon good day long Joe globally

there are over three hundred eighteen

thousand cases of kovat 19 in over 185

countries in Canada as of this moment

there are 1388 cases of kovat 19 and 19

deaths we have tested over 92,000 people

across the provinces and territories

that's over 54,000 additional people

tested across Canada over the past five

days looking back at the week behind us

there have been several signals of

concern we have seen steep increases in

case counts cases among healthcare

professionals and in vulnerable people

in high-risk settings like long-term

care facilities tragically including

several deaths

accordian a cement the next application

while we wait to see the signs that our

efforts are having an effect prevention

is hard work it takes time to see

results and we can't count the cases we

prevent it but we know it must be done

we've seen the devastating effect of

this pandemic on countries who have

waited too long or let down their guard

too soon so we must see this through as

many people continue to come back from

March Break travel outside of Canada you

have to stay home and self isolate due

to the increased risk that you have been

exposed to covet 19 and could spread the

infection to others furthermore if you

are sick that means avoiding contact

with other family members these days and

weeks for some have been challenging

we're in the early days into this

difficult effort is still too soon to

say how much we have affected their

trajectory of kovat 19 in Canada but as

Canadians we will band together and get

through this time together let's keep up

the momentum let's get this right we owe

to ourselves our families friends and

neighbors nexi thank you doctor new and

I will turn to minister Rodriguez mojo

artists more than a week ago members of

the House of Commons joined together to

do the right thing and adjoin

proceedings under until April 20 whoever

we all knew there was a chance that some

of us would have to come back for a

recall of the house and since then our

government has taken strong and quick

actions to respond to covet 19 today I

wrote to the Speaker of the House

requesting that he recalled the house on

Tuesday March 24th at noon which he

accepted the purpose of the brief recall

is so that the government can introduce

you station to bring in emergency

economic measures to support businesses

in response to the Canadians are living

through an unprecedented crisis that

requires swift action by their federal

government to ensure that they received

a financial support they urgently need

as you know as I've been in discussions

with my counterparts from from all

opposition parties in recent days about

this recall there were good

conversations lots of collaboration we

are working together in the best

interests of Canadians and I want to

thank them for their collaboration

Mercia to a party Lucien opposition

party repelled a sham but the new deep

tila persecuted the bad notice also join

support so here's a plan for what is

gonna happen on Tuesday first there is

agreement between all parties that the

house said for only one day we have all

agreed that it's important to have a

small number of MPs in the chamber our

public health officials are reminding us

in all Canadians about the importance of

importance of social distancing so we

agree that in addition to the speaker

there will be 32 MPs in the chamber the

numbers will reflect the proportion of

MPs from all the parties as we all know

we are in an emergency and Kenyans need

help quickly and this is a fact on a

Giroux Danny Daniel and happy

and I would like to thank your position

for the collaboration and say once again

that we will face this crisis together

as Canadians and we will get through

this together

thank you very much Paulo okay you know

the drill one question one follow-up

Rachel hands T te si T V ah my first

question is for Minister hi do when did

you first know and first briefed about

the coronavirus threat even when it

started in China uh it would be hard for

me to precisely give you a date I can

check back and we can give you a date on

the first briefing but it was extremely

early January I would say probably

around the 10th or so that I was I had I

had returned from my own vacation and I

was briefed at that time that dr. Tam

had been observing a cluster of very

unusual activity in Wuhan and was quite

concerned about what that might

represent in terms of future

developments and dr. new there have been

a number of concerns about the backlog

of result and the cases of community

spread even here in Ottawa the public

health officer saying that there could

be number up to a thousand people who

are infected right now how many people

right now do you believe are infected

with Koba 19 it's a difficult question I

really can't speculate a conjecture we

do know that our best efforts are being

put forward at all levels of government

the federal government provincial and

local to make sure we get testing

available I have access to as many

people as possible because we want to

actually have the most accurate picture

of what's happening in our communities

so at this point it I don't think it's

it's it's a useful to speculating how

many people might be having covert 19

well based our results and the way for

it on the test results and then put our

best foot for in terms of the public

health factors that need to follow hello

I'm Richard lui I can I can take a shot

at answering that as well and

we we are not only obviously watching

the numbers of new cases but the numbers

of deaths and where those deaths have

occurred and in what context they've

occurred so for example we know that I

think nine of the death that we have I

think it's nine occurred in one single

nursing home in in the Vancouver area

that is important to understand because

it isn't that we're seeing deaths

accelerate in an emergency room it's not

to say that we won't and that's what

we're trying to work so hard to prevent

so when dr. new is saying it's hard to

speculate it's because the the data is

different depending on you where we are

and the measures that we're taking will

actually influence the what dr. Tam is

called the attack rate how many people

will actually get sick maybe I can just

add to that that we're pulling out all

the stops at all levels of govern - in

terms of testing technologies getting

access to more test kits and so on so

certainly at the present time you you

indicate there might be a backlog or

working to deal with that well not

listening to your advice about social

distance iation police has to intervene

we see pictures on the social media

people filling up parks don't really

seem to care what's your message to

these people I'm sure the guys who

actually kitchen law class a pretty

strong words yesterday and I would stand

by those words I would say that people

need to take this seriously that various

different levels of government have

various different quarantine acts and

measures what that could include up to

and including financial monetary

penalties and in some cases arrests and

provinces and territories and the

federal government will be using the

tools that they have to ensure that

people comply what we would like to see

obviously is Canadians to comply

willingly in the spirit of generosity

towards their citizens we understand

this is hard for people to understand

who are in an area where maybe they

don't have even one case yet but people

need to understand that the what

protects them from having one case is

the behaviorists are choosing today

so I mentioned walking outside and you

mentioned being outside and in various

different settings we're not saying that

people shouldn't go outside unless they

are symptomatic if people are

symptomatic they have to stay in their

house

and stay in the room and not interact

with other healthy people are

asymptomatic people that is all cases

all the time there is no exceptions if

people are not symptomatic and are

feeling fine it is safe to go outside

but even then they should be practicing

maybe we should be calling it physical

distancing staying six feet away from

people making sure that you're not

crowding people on you know I heard

reports of people walking on the seawall

for example in Vancouver less yesterday

but I think every every region and every

province is having examples of this this

is very serious and just because you're

not feeling the illness or you don't

have necessarily in your community even

one case what we're trying to do so

diligently together at all levels of

government is prevent this disease from

spreading towards other communities and

everybody has a part to play in that so

you know I will reiterate what I said it

is essential that people are following

the advice of Public Health and the

advice is getting stronger and stronger

and with that stronger advice will be

coming my request in the minutes and we

just talked about the fact that there

could be stricter penalties at a federal

level and right now there's

to be a patchwork across all the

provinces today for example notice going

out seeing stricter penalties there what

is it going to take at what point are we

gonna see more severe penalties in a

federal level and what would that look

like

well I already have at my disposal the

quarantine act and we're looking at a

number of ways that we can make sure

that we have stringent requirements of

the quarantine act for people who are

returning to Canada for example from

Spring Break or the snowboards that are

returning let me be perfectly clear we

will use every measure in our toolbox at

the federal level to ensure compliance

this is of utmost importance and I will

speak directly to those people who are

returning to Canada from March break or

the snowboards who are coming back when

we say that you must stay at home for 14

days that means you stay at home for 14

days you do not stop for groceries that

you do not go visit your neighbors or

your friends that you rest in your house

for 14 days no exceptions if you are

returning to a household with other

people who have not traveled then you

rest in isolation from those other

people you stay in your room or in a

basement or in an isolated area away

from the other people in your family it

is critically important especially for

those returning home now to ensure that

they follow this public health advice

that we're giving them and the advice

will be not just advice if we if we if

we need to take stronger measures we

will Pacific you've talked about you

know how you're going to make it Cris

more crystal clear for people getting

off cruise ships and like you said the

snowbirds coming back I think it's

important for them to know what could be

coming if they don't take take these

measures like what specifically are you

talking about here under the federal

quarantine act which has jurisdiction

over international borders and travel

and not necessarily interprovincial

travel we have measures that could

include monetary penalties up to an

including criminal penalties ok we'll

switch to the phone Thank You Nancy

please press star 1 at this time you

several questions

yep yes sir it's well I might not put it

in jest oh there will be a brief pause

or the participant logistical questions

video - if they met on

tonight I feel a pound put up a register

thank you for your patience mess it up a

copy we have the first question from

Kristen Dobie that's Oprah vacuous I

know Kristin Dobie from The Globe and

Mail hi good afternoon

Minister Rodriguez could you comment on

how the government is reorienting

resources if at all to deal with the

surge in AI applications will be

explained during the debate on Tuesday

and of course things that will be

explained in the bill that I cannot talk

about at this moment the the Prime

Minister was asked about this that at

the press conference this morning but

wondering if you can speak at all to

other steps the government is

considering in response to two wage

pressures that the businesses are facing

well I mean as you saw with the measures

that we presented last week our are

touching everybody alkanes where we said

very clearly we don't want to leave

anybody behind where we have measures to

to help people that have access to the

eyes to measures but people that all

have access to a I measures for people

that have to to same home because a

sacred they have to take care of

somebody as well as measures for for

small businesses so where this is a

first face and and we've been very clear

this is a first face to stabilize a

situation it's not even you know

starting to relaunch the economy that's

kind of come after and I and we think

that these are necessary and very

inclusive steps to help all

really poor urgently

[Music]

could come from Montreal or Toronto by

car thank you when expression is from

Harley weeks the Harley weeks from the

Google mill hi thank you we've heard a

lot of concerns from various provinces

about the backlog in tests and shortages

of materials just learning dr. new

perhaps you can address this from your

perspective what are the primary

challenges with testing shortages and

how soon are they going to be addressed

a result among the public health

community in Canada and obviously a

special Advisory Committee of which dr.

tamanna myself were part of that's a

very alive issue we're having active

discussions we recognize that obviously

there's a global challenge in terms of

getting the supplies materials the

testing kits and so on but we're putting

our best efforts forward I'm aware that

we are in the process of acquiring

additional testing kits we're also

looking at the new testing technologies

we've just obviously I think Minister

you know approved a sort of a regulatory

wiser different testing technologies

that we're also looking to validate as

soon as possible and that would also add

to the toolbox that the provinces and

Tories territories can use and obviously

in their jurisdictions so I can just

assure you that we're pulling out all

the stops looking at

all the possible things that we couldn't

should be doing to assure that Canadians

have access to testing uh we recognize

that's the most important thing we need

to do in terms of public health action

and I'll just add I want I want to thank

all the lab workers who are working all

across the country to try and find

innovative ways to speed up the

processing of tests various labs have

various different turnaround times at

the National Lab the turnaround time is

only 24 hours and the lab workers are

working full stop to try and process the

many the many tests that were receiving

through the National Lab but part of the

challenge is also the logistics of

transportation which we also are working

on a solution for so it's a it's as dr.

new said a very live issue and a lot of

extremely wise people working on all of

the various snags and the logistics to

speed up our testing capacity okay thank

you for that in addition some number of

infectious disease experts have raised

concerns with the response in Ontario

specifically singling out the province

for its a very large backlog now more

than 8,000 test results are taking up to

a week in some cases to come back and

officials there have resisted telling

people that there is widespread

community transmission of the virus even

though their own numbers show about 40%

of cases are now the result of community

transmission I'm wondering if you can

please just tell me perhaps dr. new and

Minister hi do you want to comment as

well you know about some of these

regional disparities that we're seeing

and how you're going to address those

there's a number of people who are

concerned well thank you very much and

the special advisory committee that dr.

Tam and dr. new work through with their

counterparts at the provincial level are

having that conversation today as a

matter of fact how we have some uniform

standards around not just testing but

surveillance and data provision all

across the country in terms of and

including up to an including public

health advice and messaging this is an

area that we're watching very closely

over the next couple days and we have no

hesitation to step in if we need to to

provide stronger guidance and stronger

measures to bring some uniformity across

the country we know that various

provinces have various problems and and

and challenges but also as

since strengths and what we're trying to

do is make sure that as we go into the

next week we have a much more unified

approach across the country okay that's

question Thank You Massie our next

question is from Daniel Boone to Canada

my questions Prime Minister I do

Minister idea you've mentioned the

possibility of criminal penalty is

earlier and fine that your disposal

under the quarantine Act it could be

more specific on what type of penalty is

the amount of the fund and can you can

you tell me when in your head you think

something like the emergency measure Act

becomes a tool that you need becomes a

necessary tool and well first of all I

don't have the specific information on

the quantum of penalties in terms of a

monetary approach we'll get you that

information for your article in terms of

whether or not we're thinking about the

emergencies measures Act I believe the

Prime Minister was asked this a number

of days ago and he said that all tools

are on the table that we will consider

all measures necessary in order to

actually get to that point that I just

made to the previous questioner around

uniformity and Canadians being able to

expect the same level of attention

service and and detail no matter where

they live and so again the best way to

do this is with provincial and

territorial collaboration dr. Tam is

meeting today with a special Advisory

Committee I know those conversations are

happening through the Deputy Prime

Minister's Office as well but listen we

will not hesitate to take stronger

measures should we need to in order to

make two things absolutely crystal clear

across this country one to keep

Canadians health and safety at the

forefront and two to figure out a

long-term strategy to get us out of this

situation did you want to add a French

follow no follow so three months no no

no sorry guys

queso por vous avez I'm Alison Priscilla

[Music]

over at the federal level to enforce

that next leap when I kiss Josh but

probably some other money houma money

shot coming coming let's and the agents

on to pubic to the job memo

let's don't need Amir

of course a home minister the public

adopters to DD shows the distance

sociology degree self-efficacy the

na-neun discuss yonder

yeah pray over Johnny de consejo

meniscus community minister and the

minister for their consideration the

iconic state I'm gonna ask my next

question to a minister I do in English

obviously vocabularies very important

and times of crisis and the prime

minister said he's asking Canadians to

stay home intimating at social distance

I want to know are you asking or

recommending or or you ordering

Canadians to stay home or stay at a

social distance asking them and

recommending them and I am hoping that

we don't have to get to ordering them

all right next question

thank you our next question is from

Sharon and querque my question jess.joy

- ina Kirky from the National Post hi

thanks so much mr. Hatcher you you've

mentioned several times now and any

vanassa's skill you know you're prepared

to use every measure in your toolbox to

ensure compliance what exactly for you

would be the tipping point for stronger

measures I think the work that dr. Tam

and dr. new are doing along with the

Deputy Prime Minister with the various

premiers of the provinces and

territories is very important right now

this is I think for me a critical point

in the way that we're dealing with kovat

19 and I think for me should we not be

able to get consensus that would

indicate to us that we need stronger

measures and so the work that they are

doing right now with provinces and

territories around trying to align our

actions with public health evidence with

the with the goals as I said earlier of

keeping people healthy keeping people

out of the hospital but also finding a

way out that include includes a robust

testing strategy based on the best

science and evidence that we have

looking at ways that we can make sure

that provinces and territories have what

they need in a surge those are all very

important conversations and I hope that

they are successful because I think for

me should we see a reluctance on behalf

of the country to pull together that

that would be a time where we would

require additional measures and sorry my

follow-ups there's sort of this small

but growing chorus from contrarians who

are calling overkill they're saying that

the data collected so far on how many

people are infected and how the epidemic

is evolving some are saying our quote

utterly unreliable the former chief

medical officer of Health for Ontario

this morning actually sort of acted with

those calls and said that what we're

taking our steps that are really

unnecessary and what we should be doing

is for example isolating seniors anyone

to say 50 or 60 and older and allowing

younger people to sort of continue on

their ways could I get your response to

those concerns oh I'll start and then

I'll turn it over to dr. new for the

science but I will say that it is not

anecdotal evidence that we are using to

make our decisions it is science and it

is details from other countries and it

is reports from people like I've

mentioned before the Minister of Health

from Italy who is in the crisis of

obviously their country's lifetime with

hospitals that are now making decisions

about who will live and die based on

kinds of metrics that we can't even

imagine in Canada it is the reports from

New York physicians and emergency rooms

who are saying it is not just old people

that need to be severely and medically

supported that there are a high degree

of young middle aged working aged people

that are requiring significant medical

interventions to get through this crisis

so I would say that we have some of the

best scientists in the world in in our

government we're very fortunate to have

two of them with us here at the federal

level dr. new and dr. Tam we have been

increasingly alarmed as we've watched

this sweep around the globe and I would

say that it is our obligation as

politicians to take this seriously and

listen to our scientists so with

I will turn to dr. nail I just have an

additional comment certainly we live in

a free and democratic society and

everyone's entitled to their opinion but

all I can say is that the overwhelming

majority of the public health community

our colleagues are working right now and

the health care community we're all in

the same page this is a serious issue we

need to deal with it right now okay the

last question thank you once again

please press star-1 is ever questioned

and the wound is deep bad it was

reported in our next question is from

David Lundgren from the voters Ottawa

yes good afternoon

I have a question dr. new but I will

admit right away that this is a question

for one of medical ignorant I gather the

Canadian tests you you apply a swab and

then you have to go and analyze the

nasal secretions and this can take

several days for a result to come back

I'm seeing mentioned in media elsewhere

of other countries who have supposedly

put together test to give results in a

matter of hours is that the case am i

confusing two different procedures here

no and you've had it right on the head

the tests that were using right now in

Canada obviously based on having the

genetic sequences what we call a PCR

based test it does involve a he said

with a swab and then sending it for a

result the turnaround time is a minister

haider has said this at in our national

microbiology laboratory it takes a

one-day about 24 hours

having said that certainly were aware of

other testing technologies I think we've

mentioned that we have a you know had

regulatory approval for these new

testing technologies which can give

results a quicker in a matter of hours

instead of a day or so and so certainly

we're looking to acquire these new types

of testing kits and to obviously roll it

out across the country as soon as

possible

and when you noted a jump in the number

of tests you've done over the last 24

hours but is that number of tests you've

done or did you actually get results

from the samples you took these are test

results so I think that's also quite

remarkable in terms of the fact that as

I just mentioned that top we've done

over 92,000 of people have been

tested across the country and you know

even in over the last five days that's

you know that's more than 10,000 test

results per day and so I think it's a I

think it shows that we're reaching

contains contains have access to the

testing and for the most part the good

results because you look at it obviously

we have you know 1388 positive results

so far but that also we do the math

subtract that from ninety two thousand

that's quite a number of negative tests

okay that's it thank you very much
