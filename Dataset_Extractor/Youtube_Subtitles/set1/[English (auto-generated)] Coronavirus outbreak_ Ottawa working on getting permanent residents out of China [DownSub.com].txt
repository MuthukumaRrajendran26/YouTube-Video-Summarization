good evening and thank you for joining

us we begin with breaking news

a fifth case of the novel coronavirus

has been identified in Canada

DC's top doctor says a woman in her 50s

has tested positive and a sample has now

been sent to the National Lab in

Winnipeg for confirmation but health

officials have not confirmed how the

woman contracted the virus she hadn't

been to China but she did have family

visiting from Wuhan the woman is an

isolation at home and said to be in good

condition

this case is not unexpected it tells us

that our system is working that we're

finding people that were assessing them

safely and in the hospital setting for

example the things that we're doing

every day to prevent transmission of

influenza and the other bugs that we see

this time of year are working meanwhile

Global Affairs has told Canadians

trapped at the center of the outbreak in

China that a plane could be ready to

leave ohon as early as tomorrow there's

no guarantee that everyone who wants to

leave will be able to get out it appears

there are more people wanting out than

there are plane seats and china says

permanent residents will not be allowed

to leave unless they're needed to

accompany Canadian children that's left

some families in a state of limbo the

Canadian government says it's doing what

it can to help we have been advocating

for repatriating because obviously I saw

the news I saw this the family stories

obviously everyone wants to do their

best to bring all these people home

however I have to work with the Chinese

health authorities new video from Wuhan

today shows the chaos caused by the

outbreak hospitals are so overwhelmed

that people are lined up outside waiting

for help as of tonight more than 24

thousand cases have been confirmed the

number of dead has grown to 492 most

cases are in China but at least 24 other

countries including Canada are affected

we'll have more on the virus and what's

happening in China in just a moment but

we begin with the Canadians waiting and

hoping they'll be part of the airlift

Abigail Beeman has tonight's top story

when we can each have a child on our lap

and not be too

hanging up any additional seats so

there's really I can't understand any

reason why it's not doable this email

from Global Affairs Canada told Megan

Millward she's shortlisted for the

Canadian flight with her two young

children but the family was devastated

to learn her husband a permanent

resident isn't on the list reads two

kids they're two so is kind of hard to

believe and separate the defending

Canada maintains China will only allow

Canadian citizens to leave and a primary

caregiver for a Canadian child but not

to we're going to continue to press I

understand there's a number of permanent

residents would like to be repatriated

as well my family is one of the vacation

they didn't go over there to you know

create a problem for anybody and it's

really just kind of escalated into this

national dilemma and I I just want my

family home permanent residents Danielle

Alou and daughter domenica are visiting

family in Wuhan but live in British

Columbia where Canadian citizen husband

and dad Monty Gisborne is frustrated by

a lack of communication they're not on

the list for the plane I'm just trying

to get my family hall I'm getting worn

down by this a little more than 300

people have asked for Ottawa's help to

get out there is a larger number of

Canadians asking for evacuation and

there is space on the plane that's why

we have already got an option on the

second plane but no word yet on the wind

that would come or who would be allowed

on board meanwhile for many being holed

up inside small spaces for days takes an

emotional toll we're just really tired

we've been trying to campaign to get him

to be allowed to go with us and we're

tired those who got the short list email

are told to make their way to the

airport late Wednesday night for a

Thursday morning departure but even then

there's no guarantee they'll get on the

plane due to numbers and final approval

for that flight to take off is still in

China's hands Robin

Abigail Beeman in Ottawa the government

chartered plane is now on its way to

Hanoi Vietnam once China grants final

approval the plane will fly into the

epicenter of the outbreak

Wuhan to pick up

Canadians approved to leave after taking

off from there the plane will stop in

Vancouver to refuel all passengers will

remain on board any passenger who is

sick will be taken off the plane for

treatment from Vancouver the plane will

fly to the Canadian Forces Base in

Trenton Ontario once there all

passengers will be screened for symptoms

and then kept on base under quarantine

for 14 days

they'll stay at a special military hotel

at CFB Trenton called the Yukon Lodge

everyone will be placed in their own

rooms with families kept together in

China authorities are taking more

aggressive steps to try to get the

outbreak under control in the gambling

city of Macau officials are now so

worried they've asked that all 41

casinos in the city be shut down for two

weeks so far ten cases have been

reported there at least one of them

involves a casino worker elsewhere in

China officials are struggling to keep

up as the virus spreads

here's Redman Shannon forget about the

numbers for a moment this is the real

human impact of coronavirus a woman

cries after being prevented from seeing

her mother's body before it is driven

away authorities are now admitting the

first patients to the newly built Wuhan

hospital and elsewhere in the city

community games and even convention

centers are being converted into medical

facilities for an ever-growing number of

patients the Health System is struggling

to cope with some people lining up out

doors to get treatment

across the country various tactics

including drones are being used to

remind people to wear face masks in Hong

Kong a new type of protest after the

first coronavirus death in the territory

health workers demanding all border

points with mainland China be closed

leader Carrie Lam has kept three

crossings open for now I'm appealing to

those who are taking part in this action

that let's put the interests of the

patients and the entire Public Health

System above all the things outside of

China another cruise ship is in lockdown

this time in Japan after one passenger

tested positive for the virus the World

Health Organization says this is not yet

a pandemic at least by its own

definition but it's asking the world to

start cooperating properly I'm writing

to all ministers of health to request an

immediate improvement in data sharing as

I said yesterday we can only defeat this

outbreak with global solidarity the

w-h-o again criticized blanket travel

bans against China saying they only

increased fear with little positive

effect one positive note though this 73

year old Thai patient described the

symptoms as tough but she said she's

fully recovered after hospital treatment
