and members of the PC caucus as well as

some of our fantastic candidates here in

New Brunswick

now I've had just out the honor of

meeting with some true local heroes the

dedicated volunteers of the upper King's

clear fire department I want to start

today by thanking you and volunteers

across the country for your service

Canada would not be the great country

that it is without the contributions of

our volunteers the people who answer the

call of civic duty the people who choose

to say yes to helping others even if it

means putting themselves in harm's way

whether it's a service club their child

sports league charity work for a Cause

close to their heart or emergency

response

there are almost 13 million kids who

volunteer more than two billion hours of

time each year

Canadians step up Canadians help each

other to get ahead that's what I love

about this country and I believe

government should encourage it play

Kaluga mo DeVry on Courage ASA because

there are so many Canadians working hard

across the country to support their

families and their communities giving

what little time they have in service of

their fellow citizens they are people of

courage character and strength like

those with me today it is my privilege

today to be joined by search and rescue

volunteers and volunteer firefighters

these men and women not only serve their

community but they save lives in many

towns and cities from coast to coast

it's volunteers who are the frontline of

community fire protection of the almost

4,000 fire departments in Canada 3,000

are staffed by all volunteer teams for

those volunteers the call can come at

any time during their Christmas dinner

their kids piano recital or during a

night out with a loved one it's a huge

commitment

a giant responsibility a sacrifice

so is volunteer search and rescue in

cities towns and rural areas across

Canada when someone goes missing teams

of volunteers spring into action New

Brunswick's very first volunteer search

and rescue team was formed in

Fredericton in 1983

today there are 10 teams located across

the province and more than 330 volunteer

members they provide vital services in

New Brunswick dense forests from missing

person and evidence searches to

emergency preparedness and training so

today I'm extremely proud to be here to

announce how a new Conservative

government will further support search

and rescue volunteers and volunteer

firefighters across Canada right now

search and rescue volunteers and

volunteer firefighters have to do 200

hours of service before they qualify for

the current tax credits we will lower

that criteria from 200 to 150 hours to

ensure that more Canadians are eligible

for these benefits it was a Conservative

government that brought in the existing

tax credits for these community heroes

and a new Conservative government will

make it easier to qualify so more

volunteers can get ahead we all know

money isn't why they do what they do but

this change will help more get more

money in their pockets it will help to

pay for gear and training most of all

it's a recognition of what they do for

us and a way for us to say thanks or

the second form for new emphasis on

campaign I have spoken about my plan to

make your life more affordable for you

for your kids and for your retirement

and that's really what this campaign

will come down to who do you trust to

put more money in your pockets so you

and your family can get ahead Justin

Trudeau has already raised taxes on 80

percent of middle-class families and if

he's re-elected his carbon tax will only

go out adding at least 31 cents to the

price of gasoline and hundreds

potentially thousands more for everyday

household essentials on the other hand

we will bring in a universal tax cut for

every Canadian that will save a couple

with average salaries 850 dollars a year

we'll bring in tax credits for

children's arts fitness and learning

making it more affordable to enroll your

child in soccer and other

extracurricular activities we will give

a green public transit tax credit to

those who take the bus or train to work

and we will make maternity and parental

AI benefits tax-free will increase the

aged credit by $1,000 putting 300

dollars back into the pockets of a

senior couple and will boost the RESP

helping parents save to send their child

to post-secondary school you work hard

for your money and volunteers like the

ones here today and across the country

work especially hard for no money at all

and a dollar is always better spent by

the person who earned it and by the

politician who taxed it and I know how

hard you're working how Canadians feel

like they are falling further behind and

that should never be the case and

certainly not for community heroes who

risk everything to help others and

that's why we're lowering the number of

hours required and making it easier to

qualify for the benefits to which you

are entitled a new Conservative

government will live within its means

we'll lower your taxes and put more

money in your pocket

morning Mr Shearer David akin from

Global News last night we heard the

issue of the ruling in the Quebec court

about medically assisted dying bill come

up and I think you mentioned you'd like

to see it go to the Supreme Court you

wanted some certainty I'd like to hear

though your opinion about the ruling and

whether or not you agree that the law

ought to be broadened as the judge

agreed to include those with painful and

curable conditions though not

necessarily terminal tissues you agree

that the pool of people who should be

able to access a medically assisted

death should be broadened well when this

bill was before Parliament I voted

against the current government's

legislation because I did not believe

that it had enough safeguards in it and

now with this ruling I think it's best

that we appeal it to the Supreme Court

so we can get certainty around which for

the framework within which Parliament

can legislate we are conservation law

topic we heard last night about the

Trudeau campaign and two planes is very

entertaining listening to your response

of that matter but more seriously I mean

a lot of people just might wonder why

wouldn't this campaign buy some carbon

offsets and hard to see the downside on

what a lot of Canadians think is a very

reasonable thing to do they'll buy some

offsets to for your carbon footprint why

not why wouldn't your campaign

done that well our plane is actually

using less fuel than the the plane

that's carrying the Justin Trudeau and

his staff and the media around so right

there were emitting fewer emissions and

we're going we've we've decided to get

by with just the one plane we've taken

that decision it's you know we've we

found that we've got more than enough

space we can we can make do with just

the one

and I don't buy mr. Trudeau's excuse

that somehow purchasing some credits

excuses him gives him the privilege to

burn more fuel at tens of thousands of

gallons per hour or per flight news of

all clearly the decision under there was

so much behind that's why we on

kinetic camping news Mr Shearer the

consensus in Quebec media is that you

lost last night's first French debate

what does it say to Quebec voters that

you sort of hightail it out of there and

had it here to New Brunswick instead of

spending more time campaigning in Quebec

after the performance yesterday of

course I disagree with that entirely I

think last I believe last night

Quebecers heard very clearly about which

where the parties stand on making life

more affordable they heard for me the

very concrete specific measures that we

will take to put more money in their

pockets so they can get ahead I I stayed

I participated the debate I participated

the media availability afterwards I was

in Quebec for for the day prior as well

as the day of so and Here I am again

won their leadership of the party my

personal position has always been open

but I've also made the commitment that

as leader of this party it is my

responsibility to ensure that we do not

reopen this debate that we focus on

issues that unite our party in the

United 80s and that's exactly what I'll

do that's why I will vote against

grave over stood about good morning mr.

Giuseppi valiantly Canadian Press in in

2015 a post mortem conducted by your

party found that people were frustrated

by a lack of new ideas in the

conservative movement and today you

announced again a small tax credit it to

date the majority of your promises can

be directly traced back to the thousand

the 2015 platform and an earlier why is

that and and what is your vision

well I of course reject the premise of

the question this our platform the

announcements that we've made so far are

full of exciting and innovative ideas

including our real plan for the

environment creating the green patent

Tax Credit which will allow companies to

innovate and conduct research and

development here in Canada leading to

new technologies that lower emissions

are universal tax cut is is an

innovative way is a comprehensive tax

cut that applies to every single

Canadian taxpayer our foreign policy is

clearly it clearly contains measures

that are new for a party so I'm excited

to continue to bring out these

innovative policies that are clearly

resonating with Canadians across the

country and you just you just mentioned

again that you were a personally

pro-life Trudeau just a few moments ago

in Montreal so that you were against the

rights of women

can you point to a single policy in your

platform that you believe shows that you

do support women's rights well of course

all our policies are argued are centered

around treating all Canadians equally

and supporting the rights of women we

will continue to ensure that that women

are treated fairly and equally in this

country and that their rights are always

protected Glenn Berger CTV News mr.

Blanchet said yesterday that Quebecers

should support him because the party

kena qua resembles them I'm wondering if

you interpret that as many are doing as

being racist than because it's they

don't visually look like the other

parties don't visually look like the

Parti québécois resembles him sorry I

see a pretty good party yeah yeah of

course

well look I'll leave it to me she

belongs shit to explain what he meant by

that I believe that Quebecers want

adoption to have representatives who

have the ability to deliver results for

Quebec that they can have people around

the decision-making table the bloc

québécois is you know has always in the

past played on on division within the

Canadian population within the Quebec

population I am more I believe in

finding the common ground between all

different types of Canadians people who

have come here from all different parts

of the world and celebrating what unites

us what protecting the very reasons why

people came to this country and I'm

gonna continue to run a positive and

inclusive campaign we measure Valecia

Montreal this morning mr. Trudeau said

that you're attacking him over the

second airplane in his use of carbon

offset credits because you don't have a

meaning

we'll plan to cut carbon emissions so

give you a chance to respond to them

well we actually have a real plan for

the environment our plan will lower

admissions his plan fails to take into

account that if we do not take the

climate change fight global if we do

nothing to ensure that Canada can help

lower emissions on a global context then

the planet is not better off

that's exactly targets at recognizing

that we can export our clean technology

our carbon capture we can if if if we

can ensure that other countries take

advantage of the types of things that

we've perfected here we can actually

lower emissions in a substantial way

otherwise the global emissions are just

going to continue to go up and we can

chase away jobs and investment here we

can make the cost of living even higher

and higher here only to see that

economic activity replaced by production

in China in Indonesia in India and

emissions will actually go up for the

world so the planet's not better off

under Justin Trudeau's approach it will

be under our approach good morning mr.

schirra Steve shear with Reuters you've

made a number of prompt promises and

you've talked about in sort of your

rivals affordability you talked about it

today but there's been little talk about

the root problem for the Canadian

economy which is productivity and

potential growth so my question to you

is you know what is your plan to do to

make the Canadian economy more

competitive mm-hmm well you rightly

point out that under Justin Trudeau

Canada has fallen behind our largest

trading partners and our competitors

when it comes to productivity that is

through a number of issues I've made the

commitment that in addition to

eliminating corporate welfare for the

for highly profitable countries

companies and and companies that export

their take the money for operations in

other countries we will also conduct a

regulatory review that will reduce the

red taper in on Canadian businesses and

companies right now there are billions

of dollars in lost productivity just

because of government compliance often

with outdated regulations that do not

serve purpose other than to create

paperwork

so we are going to attack that issue to

make sure that Canadian companies while

meeting very high standards from the

environment for health and safety and

for workers rights can do what they do

best which is produce goods and provide

services and an export that around the

world economists say that that Canada

can slightly increase its deficit

spending and still bring down the debt

over the next few years especially if

growth continues as its projected and

and they say that would be a good idea

because private debt in Canada is quite

high so my question to you is would you

consider pushing back or or abandoning

your goal to balance the budget in five

years if that proves true if the economy

needs some support well I I will not

take the advice from liberal economists

who believe that budgets balance

themselves or that people become richer

by paying more taxes those are things

that I've made my choice I don't agree

with that and Canadians can make their

choice on October 21st the massive

amounts tens of billions of dollars of

new debt that Justin Trudeau has added

to the national debt comes with a price

tag it comes with a cost interest on

that debt has to be paid and I believe

that Canadians would rather see their

tax dollars going into improved services

or into tax cuts rather than see their

tax dollar going to pay the interest on

that debt just going to banks with the

Liberals you get two speeds for

government spending fast and faster and

if we are if there are as we as many

analysts indicate there are some

troubling signs on the horizon for

Canada's economy we need to get our

fiscal house in order

the Liberals have put us in a position

now where if there is a difficult period

ahead there is very limited flexibility

that they will have to operate under

because we are carrying around these

massive deficits but I believe that it's

not fair to current taxpayers who know

that their taxes will go up after the

election or to future tax payers so

we'll have to pay back the interest on

the debt that Rio has accumulated that's

why we're committed to a five-year time

frame

Janice McGregor from CBC News perhaps as

early as next week in a number of school

boards in Ontario there could be

classroom disruptions if the Ford

government cannot reach an agreement

with QP what are your federal

conservative candidates in Ontario

hearing at the door about this labor

situation in public schools well I

believe people Ontario are aware of the

fact that this particular union and and

education unions in general have gone on

strike under governments of all stripes

they were under they went on strike

under the McGinty liberals they've been

on strike under the Bob ray andp going

back throughout throughout decades in

Ontario I think people on a tear

understand this is a provincial issue

it's up to the union representatives and

the provincial government to to come to

a deal but I asked you specific what

specifically what your federal

candidates are hearing at the door on

this issue I see one provincial premier

at this event I only am led to believe

then that the federal and the provincial

parties of the same stripe are in

conversations about strategy and

coordinating messages

what are your federal conservative

candidates hearing at the door on this

well just I'll just maybe a correct one

thing they're very honored to have

Premier Higgs here but it's not as if

we're sharing strategy and

communications it's just quite frankly

that we happen to have the same position

on some issues like scrapping the carbon

tax like standing up for Canada's energy

sector like having a government that

lives within its means so that we can

lower taxes and put more money in the

pockets of Canadians and that is and

again that is why I'm so honored to have

Premier Higgs here I can tell you what

our candidates are hearing at the doors

in Ontario they're hearing that life is

getting more expensive they are worried

about crime in places like Brampton and

Toronto they are frustrated that this

Liberal government has actually lowered

penalties on dangerous criminals they

are here that they are aware of the

damage that Kathleen Wynne's Liberal

government did for so long in Ontario

and they are aware of the fact that

Justin Trudeau is running the exact same

play book and that is why I believe that

voters in Ontario will do four do at the

federal level what they did in the at

the potential level that's put it into

scandal-plagued deficit running tax

hiking Liberal government second Oct no

ugly example a don't immediately scandal

good morning Jacques Basra from CBC and

New Brunswick we spoke to a number of

consumers at gas station yesterday about

the carbon tax and they most the

majority of them said we know it's

they're kind of getting used to it don't

notice it as much as we did before

wholesale gas prices are below what they

were in April what would you say to

those voters well I can tell you the

voters I've heard from frustrated by the

fact that they have to pay the carbon

taxes or even more frustrated that they

have to pay tax on the carbon tax and

when Justin Trudeau says the higher tax

prices higher gas prices are exactly

what he wants that frustrates motorists

across the country our plan is to scrap

the carbon tax we're gonna put more

money back in the pockets of Canadians

we're also gonna take the GST and HSC

off of home heating to recognize that

it's not a luxury to heat your home in

the winter it's also proof that the

carbon tax isn't working if it's not

changing behavior it's clearly not

working so Justin Trudeau has to come

clean with how high his carbon tax is

going to go after the election hi Mr

Shearer Janice Dixon The Globe and Mail

earlier this week you said you finished

your degree in Ottawa when I asked for

clarification but over the years you've

told a number of journalists that you

finished in Regina

why is that the case so I my degree is

granted from the University of Ottawa

I finished it while I was in Regina the

combination of course is from from the

University of Regina and corresponds

courses I then had those credits

transferred back to University of Ottawa

to obtain my degree okay thank you and

on a different topic what a Conservative

government appeal the Canadian Human

Rights Tribunal order that says Canada

must compensate First Nations children

living on reserve for failing to provide

funding for child and family service but

the deadline for this appeals Monday I

realize you're not in government then

but just we're looking for your thoughts

on this way I believe this question came

up during the the McLean's debate this

is a far-reaching decision that has

major impacts on multiple levels of

government and many different

departments within government and for

that reason I felt like it was

appropriate that it would be appropriate

to have judicial review of this decision

so this is your mobile an impact

significative siragugal more further how

Aloha Sarah his own port ecology my

mr. shears Silas Brown global New

Brunswick this is obviously your second

visit to New Brunswick during the

campaign but this is also your second

visit to primarily Anglophone part of

the province what do you have to say to

voters in the primarily francophone

north to convince them that you will

represent all New Brunswickers not just

those in the south well actually I was

here celebrating the Acadian culture in

New Brunswick just before the election

started and I've always made it very

clear that our government will ensure

that francophone rights are protected

across this country and we have great

candidates throughout New Brunswick that

are representing Franco Franco New

- Oh Canada obviously the southern part

of the province has been an area where

your party has had a lot of success in

the past and do yourself have spent

quite a bit of time here in the southern

part of the province would you say that

it's more of a priority for you to be

down here in the southern part where you

believe you may have a better chance

that's electing some MPs well you know

Innes in a campaign route that is only

around forty days and there are 338

ridings I wish I could visit every

single one of them I obviously spent a

lot of time this summer visiting many

ridings in the hopes of coming back

second a second time we'll see how the

campaign unfolds and see how we can do

as much of that as possible we're very

optimistic for gains all throughout

Atlanta Canada in the last election the

Liberals won 32 for 32 but the people of

Atlantic Canada feel like they've gone

oh for 32 under this Liberal government

this Liberal government imposed a carbon

tax

this Liberal government killed a

west2east pipeline that would have

created jobs right here in New Brunswick

they have had a minister responsible for

the Atlantic Canadian opportunities

Agency comes from Toronto so they've

clearly taken this region for granted we

won't and we are going to win seats back

all over Atlantic Canada and rural

Telegraph Journal from st. John you've

said that you and premier Higgs kind of

on the same page one of the files you

don't seem to be on the same page is

about health care transfers the premier

has talked about how New Brunswick's

aging population and demographic needs

to be recognized in those payments

you said you Alana the current agreement

how do you reconcile that difference

well I will take this opportunity to

point out the hypocrisy of Justin

Trudeau for running against the current

formula in the last election and then

and then locking it in going forward

just another example of how he was not

as advertised during the 2015 election I

understand the challenges that Premier

Higgs has brought up with as it relates

to New Brunswick specific situation with

an aging population that is one of the

reasons why I made the commitment that

we will increase funding for healthcare

by at least three percent

every year and why we also announce that

we will create a fund that will help

provinces purchase life-saving

diagnostic equipment like MRIs and CT

scans that will help address wait times

while ensuring that the products can

meet its needs to provide these types of

services when you do those funding

increases will they take the demographic

age of the population into account

we're committed right now to the the

current formula which includes a three

percent increase but I've always said

that I would have a much more

cooperative approach with the premiers

every province has unique challenges for

some provinces it can be large cities

with all the challenges that come with

large infrastructure projects for others

it may be aging populations or or or

less dense populations spread out over

larger larger land areas others it can

be a higher population

you know the economies that are more

dependent on on industries that have

much greater cycles that can rise and

fall drastically so I've always sent a

signal to premiers that when I sit down

around the table with them they won't

have to get me they won't have to take

me to court for me to hear their

concerns that I'd work in a cooperative

manner with all of them we all knew
