Oh

I worked in the right

okay

good

but not to Robert Menzies

good morning everyone welcome to this

discussion with medical health

professionals on guns it is an

opportunity for us to really dig into an

issue that have a significant impact in

our communities on lives of Canadians

from coast to coast to coast and

particularly on the medical

professionals who respond to gun

violence on a weekly basis right across

the country we know this is a huge

impact on Canadian families on

communities that's why we've taken

significant measures over the past four

years as a government to strengthen gun

control we recognize there's more to do

that is why we're moving forward on

banning military-style assault weapons

going to be moving forward on allowing

cities to restrict or ban handguns we're

strengthening various other gun control

measures and the choice is very clear in

this election we want to strengthen gun

control with significant real measures

that are going to have an impact and the

Conservatives want to weaken gun control

which I think is the wrong choice for

Canadians but I'm looking forward very

much to hearing from the experts

gathered here today and I want to start

with dr. nasch Mohamed who was on on

call the night of the Danforth soot

shooting that so many people remember

here in Toronto and indeed across the

country can you share with us a little

bit your perspective on that night and

and what is in soot I thank you mr.

Trudeau Prime Minister for including the

voice of doctors and healthcare

professionals in this important

discussion that affects the health of

all Canaan

indeed I was on call the night of the

damn floor shooting and it was a

horrific and terrible experience you

know we trained for these kinds of

things all the time

mass shooting events and mass casualty

events but we hope against hope that we

never have to bring our expertise to

bear Canadian doctors and traumatologist

have for a long time been concerned

about the rise and gun violence in our

cities but I think what happened on the

night of the dan force is that all

Canadians became aware and awakened to

the reality of gun violence and that

were really not that difference and if

we don't act terrible things could

happen

I asked all of our elected officials to

understand that harm injury and death

from guns is a preventable public health

crisis and that legislative action is

necessary a multi-pronged approach is

going to be very useful but but we have

to change the laws I am a trauma surgeon

and I've worked at Saint Michael's

Hospital for twenty years

last week I offered on a longtime

patient of mine it's a terrible story of

a young man injured by a spray of

bullets he happened to be at the wrong

place at the wrong time and last week he

underwent surgery six hours of

reconstructive abdominal surgery and

this was his ninth operation over the

three years since his discharge from

hospital he has been unable to return to

work in and out of hospital on and off

intravenous nutrition because his gut

simply doesn't work perhaps many people

imagine that after our heroic paramedics

transport the patients to our trauma

bays and those trauma bay doors closed

that the doctors and nurses busy

themselves and packed up the patient and

make them well again and they get to go

home in a matter of days but for the

magic but for the majority of patients

that simply is not true that's the

furthest thing from the truth these

patients require upwards of a hundred

units of blood sometimes in the first 24

hours

many many operations to reconstruct them

and bring them back to life they spend

weeks and weeks in the ICU their lives

hanging in the

their family to their bedside we doctors

walk past them trying to give them hope

and if they do survive they spend months

and months in hospital and then

rehabilitation that's the reality of gun

violence and something else I want all

of our elected officials to understand

the effects of gun violence reverberate

for years and decades and generations

are paid that our patients their

families are never the same our patients

are left with long lifelong disabilities

that they live with and they live with

life-altering circumstances and the

psychological burden of being a gun

violence victim doctors and nurses and

other health care professionals who

treat these patients see it as our

responsibility to inform you of our

lived experience so that you can make

better decisions on the behalf on behalf

of all Canadians and doctors have always

participated in these difficult

discussions and the discourse around

public health think about tobacco and

asbestos and seatbelt laws we always get

into it when when people's lives are at

stake we have witnessed an escalating

pace of violence in our city in 2018

there are 425 shootings in Toronto and

2019 seems worse we cannot afford to

remain silent and we will not accept the

status quo Canada must follow the

example of countries like Australia and

New Zealand United Kingdom and now the

Netherlands legislative action is needed

to stop the proliferation of guns in

Canada and we know that countries with

stricter gun laws have lower rates of

gun homicide suicide femicide

intentional and unintentional injury I

ask you Prime Minister and all of our

elected officials to consider the weight

of the scientific evidence that clearly

shows the proliferation of guns makes us

all less safe I ask that you hear the

tragedy of our daily lived experience

and the devastation of people personally

traumatised by gun violence and I ask

the government to act thank you now I

want to turn now to dr. Joe Lexington

who's been

had a number of years in in an emergency

room

have you seen gun violence and the

victims of gun violence evolved in terms

of the the frequency in terms of the

intensity in terms of the stories and

families that are around them I work at

University Health Network we used to be

a trauma center so we used to see gun

violence we haven't been a trauma center

now for 25 years or so so I don't see it

directly but I do hear about it from my

colleagues who work in the emergency

department I hear about their concerns

their worries about things and while I

appreciate the efforts that your

government has announced I think that

the idea of letting cities ban handguns

is the wrong idea there are provinces

out there this is going to have to be

done at a provincial level the provinces

are going to have to allow the cities

and there are provinces with leadership

out there that are not going to accept

this and even if provinces do accept it

Toronto may do it and Mississauga may

not do it

you just cross the 427 and you can

purchase handguns I think that that's

the wrong approach I think that what the

federal government needs to do is show

leadership and do a national ban on

handguns Thank You Joel obviously it's a

we've taken a significant step

and there's other measures that we've

put in place around controlling bulk

purchases and making sure that handguns

don't end up on the streets as much as

we possibly can but we recognize that

this isn't a first important step that

there are lots of people who would like

us to go further and I hear you on that

perhaps turning behind you to to to dr.

David Gomez

is a trauma surgeon in currently dealing

I believe with with gun violence on an

ultra regular basis Prime Minister when

I when I was thinking about this I

wanted to share a story with you it was

early in my practice I would just gotten

home from a long day of work I didn't

even have a chance to say hello to my

little guy and I would rush back to the

hospital I was greeted in the trauma Bay

with two critically ill gunshot wound

victims the team were practically to

save their lives we performed emergency

surgery and unfortunately were

unsuccessful we had to make the long

walk talk to the family members the

patients and the families lives changed

forever I was sweaty was tired I got

back home even before I put my head on

the pillow I rushed back more surgery

more with more injuries more death the

same report the same story with Peter

over the weekend about five or six

control room patients came in that we

canwe operator and all of them and I

thought to myself this is there's to be

a one-off this is in Toronto this is in

Canada and unfortunately I realized that

it's not a one-off it's routine we see

cancer wound victims in trauma centers

every day patients lives and every day

and their family's lives change every

day by the end of the weekend my shoes

were bloody and they sit in the corner

of my office and either little shoes or

or non little shoes are in offices of

every trauma surgeon they remind us that

it's not just a job to fix these

injuries it's our job to help prevent

them we have not only the legislative

tools and we're not naive we understand

that not one intervention is going to

fix this this is a multi-pronged

approach interventions for assault

they're going to be different from

unintentional injuries and are gonna be

different from suicides but we need the

tools not only from a legislative aspect

from from a research aspect to be able

to intervene we need to be able to see

the data and act on the data and I and I

think we were talking today that we

actually don't have those tools and some

of our privacy legislation really limits

us in being able to start

these as the disease that it is firearms

are vectors of disease and we need to

understand the host and the vector to be

able to intervene thank you very much

David beside you is dr. Hannah Adair

who's a general surgery resident at the

U of T but also from originally from New

Zealand and obviously New Zealand has

been part of the conversations we've had

internationally this year following the

terrible Christchurch shootings and the

leadership that the New Zealand

government led by Jason Tedder and have

taken on banning military-style assault

weapons we are going to be moving

forward in a similar way where perhaps

you could share some of your perspective

on this issue

thank you Prime Minister so when I

emigrated to Canada during 2014 I have

to say I never thought I'd be sitting

here today talking to you about the

destruction I see every day from

firearms and my work and it's partly

because I thought Canada didn't have a

gun problem

I'm sadly here to tell you it does every

day or summer while I've been on call I

have seen gunshot wound victims I've

treated them I've had to teach my

medical students how to come and counsel

families and when they've lost a loved

one our two quiet rooms at Sunnybrook

Hospital

there have been nights where we have had

too many families and not enough rooms

so there is a problem and I think

similarly to a New Zealand we had a not

us not here attitude don't let it become

too late there is already a daily surge

of violence in the city not just

homicides but also firearms that are

used in suicides and accidental

shootings and I think there are many

examples of strong legislative actions

that have couldn't other OECD countries

that have significantly improved the

number of deaths from firearms for a

long time he was complacency in New

Zealand I think I don't think we woke up

and suddenly decided that we needed to

change legislation it wasn't a

motivation to do so and I would hope

that it doesn't take

fifty-one people from your community to

make you act as a public health issue

this is not a partisan issue or a

political issue and it is particularly

only in North America that is become one

I have to say we must see this as a

community problem and as a health

problem first and foremost firearms are

one of the leading killers of young men

in North America

they've had a bigger impact in terms of

mortality than road traffic injuries and

HIV and AIDS over the last 25 years on

our continent and we must treat them

like the public health issue that they

are actually right in front of you

Lillian Jenkins is a doctor originally

from Australia in Australia had

experience of a terrible and mass

shooting a number of years ago which

they took significant measures around

gun control perhaps you could sort of

share us some of your experience and the

Canadian experience that you've had to

help you reflect on that Lillian thank

you very much mr. prime minister so I'm

here doing a trauma fellowship here

I've worked as a doctor in Sydney in

Australia for ten years I did all my

training in a big trauma center in

Sydney and my first weekend or my first

week here in Toronto I saw more gunshot

injuries and I've seen in all of my

training at home I was really unprepared

for that the devastating effects that

gunshot victims have to face in their

family their injuries are so severe and

it just it seems so preventable I do

come from a country where we have

stricter gun control legislation and

we've had that since I've been in high

school and we just we just don't see gun

violence as something that's common in

our trauma base it just isn't our normal

and I think like that that's something

that I'll really take from working here

in Toronto is that it you've got to make

sure that you don't accept it as normal

it is it is preventable thank you for

that beside you is Sameer bully who's

there a medical student

I want you to share with us your story

hi my name is Sameer bullet and I am a

second year medical student and unlike

most of my colleagues here I won't be

really talking about the clinical side

of gunshot violence but more the

personal side of the matter so just a

little background about myself I'm a

second year medical student here at the

University of Toronto my parents came to

Canada's refugees and I grew up in the

karmis area right across from here I had

a wonderful loving childhood or even

though we never had much we were always

able to get by but as I got older I

began to notice things I would always

have to take the long way home from

school to avoid the buildings around my

house out here loudly tonight and have

to walk past the police crime scene the

next day I was in the eighth grade I

first saw a gun one that a classmate

brought to school and the first thing

the only thing that I could say was cool

because that's how normalized it was the

issue

it was so normalized around me that I

barely saw any issue with my

surroundings then as time passed the

shootings are more personal it will

start with a whisper of a friend of a

friend then an acquaintance that was my

cousin eventually one of my closest

friends got shot in the back in front of

his own home and to this day he's

wheelchair-bound

his whole life and all the potential he

had was taken from an in single instant

my innocent younger brother was shot at

twelve times two minutes from my own

home imagine just for a second being a

mechanic who can't sit in a parked car

due to having panic attacks because you

don't feel safe just think about it and

this is just a taste of gun violence has

done to my community

my story isn't by no ways unique and the

only thing that differentiates me from

all the other kids is luck this doesn't

begin or end with guns it is a

combination of a lack of economic

opportunities limitations of our

education systems and growing income

inequality in our communities that allow

guns to seem as such a necessary tool

for survival however studies have shown

that a lack of access to guns

significantly reduces levels of gun

violence

kena's fire mortality rate is eight

times that of the UK Australia Japan and

Netherlands all countries are strict gun

control legislation exists from the

Journal of American Medical Medical

Association in 2018 while we cannot

police the border and stop every legal

gun that gets through we can

concurrently address stricter gun laws

while creating opportunities been

disadvantaged how many kids do we have

to lose to the trauma of the gun

violence so we decided enough is enough

I'm here to say as a representative of

the black Medical Students Association

we are here to give a voice to those in

forgotten by our society I'm not

becoming a doctor to continue to see

this kind of violence and I hope you can

see the urgency in this matter

Thank You Samara I think that it gives

us a bit of a segue to Bill Blair who

has worked on Community Safety as former

chief of police as someone who has had a

significant level of impact during your

long career in fighting gun violence

with real tangible successes over the

past few years we have have you lead a

really important discussion on concrete

measures that we can move forward on to

keep communities more safe so why don't

you share a little bit with us thank you

very much Prime Minister I have to say

that the stories that we hear are so

compelling and there are so many other

stories the stories of mothers who have

lost children and and no family members

and communities that have been dead

stated by the violence and people living

in fear it changes their lives it

changes the bulk of their lives and

limits our kids in really realizing

their full potential when they have to

grow up with that I have worked in in in

in all of the neighborhoods of Toronto

and you know I think I think there are

some very significant of the things that

have been done and can be done to reduce

the incidence of gun violence but I will

tell you from experience that you know

it just when you go to a community and

say we've made more arrests this year

than last year they are not comforted by

that when you tell them there are more

guns being seized this year than before

that causes them to be more fearful and

and so we must do more than I mean quite

frankly I've always been a little bit

frustrated by people who said let's just

lock everybody up and throw away the key

that does not solve the problem we'll

make our community safer and it's not

what we should be doing for our kids and

so I think we have to have the courage

to take the steps that are necessary to

change the circumstances that give rise

to this violence and one of those

circumstances is the ready availability

of guns I'm not sure how you can talk

about gun violence without having the

courage to talk about guns and and

interdicting the supply of guns into the

hands of someone who commits a violent

crime with it is an important part it's

not the whole solution but it's an

important part of the work that we must

do and we also must work in those

communities to help those kids make

better choices and to address the

circumstances that give rise to violence

in our communities and and really that's

our that's the work we've been doing but

that's the work that also needs to be

done and so much more needs to be done

in our communities

I believe that cops count and I believe

that when you have adequately and well

trained adequately trained and adequate

resources of police officers and

communities they can help to make a

difference but if you don't arrest your

way these very very challenging problems

that we face in our society and the

public health approach which looks at

all of the hearts and all of the things

that give rise to those times it starts

to address the reduction of those crimes

in a very thoughtful and meaningful way

that's the thing that I believe makes a

difference in my experience in the City

of Toronto you know we actually achieved

some pretty significant reductions in

gun violence during during my time here

but it wasn't we

do it by putting more and more people in

jail we did it by encouraging young

people to make better and safer choices

and and to increase the strength and

resiliency of communities we also took

some very meaningful steps to interdict

the supply of guns but more needs to be

done and that's the work we're dedicated

to do it we've had a lot of discussions

on some of the community issues and gang

related issues but there are other

aspects impact in gun violence and I

thought maybe we could turn to dr. Julie

magic who is the clinical psych I've

done all be the intersection of mental

health and gun violence is something

that is often brought up in the news and

I'd love love to hear from you a bit

Julie thank you mr. Shido so as you know

I'm a psychiatrist and mental illness as

you also know is a prevalent and

extremely pressing issue for Canadians I

would say that the most devastating

outcome for any patient of mine or for a

family member is death by suicide today

I want to ensure that we're talking not

just about sort of gang violence and

mass shootings which of course are

important and what we hear about in the

media but also about the fact that over

70% of gun death in Canada is death by

suicide so we cannot have this

conversation unless we're talking about

mental health and suicide so as a

psychiatrist I have an absolute

privilege of sitting with people at

times in their life when there's great

suffering and despair and I've had the

privilege of watching people and helping

them overcome suicidal crises and really

accessing the most resilient parts of

themselves but I and my colleagues could

only do that if they're alive if we have

individuals showing up in dr. Ahmed or

dr. Gomez's trauma Bay before they're in

my office or in the office of my

colleagues we have absolutely missed an

opportunity to assist them we failed

them and that is an outcome

we do not want to see we also know

something that's critical and that is

that the means with which an individual

attempt suicide matter so when you have

access to a gun in the midst of a

suicide crisis which can be anywhere

from five minutes to less than an hour

when you have easy access to a gun your

risk of using that gun goes up so the

one of the interventions that we have to

have is to really find ways legislative

ways to limit people's immediate access

to firearms

we know that for individuals in many

communities that live in a home with a

gun their risk of dying by suicide is

five times higher the general population

and this is a statistic that we we

really can't ignore the other people I

see in my office

are individuals who have survived gun

violence and my trauma surgeon

colleagues my family physician

colleagues will talk a lot about the

multiple surgeries and Rehab physical

rehab that has to exist to bring them

sort of to help them recover the other

part that has to recover is their mind

and their brain and it takes just as

much treatment and support to help an

individual after they have had an

experience of having their safety

basically ripped out from under them at

being shot and it's you know we can't

forget the toll that that takes on them

and on their families and if I could say

one last parting thing I think is I

would like my elected officials to focus

on protecting individuals when they're

at their most vulnerable and that is

what I hope for for my patients that's

what I hope for for my family and that's

what I hope for for our community

and I think by you know putting in

legislation that actually addresses this

issue effectively is a way of doing that

and looking after our most vulnerable

thank you Thank You Julie to to two

people to your left is dr. Suzanne rush

who has worked in indigenous health has

also done a lot of work on intimate

partner violence and is now a family

physician can you share some of your

perspective on this please yes thank you

so much so my name is dr. Suzanne

Shushan as an indigenous woman and an

intergenerational survivor of the

residential school program system I just

wanted to acknowledge orange shirt day

today thank you so as a physician I have

treated gun violence in both urban and

rural settings multiple times and

sometimes it's being in remote northern

hospitals in very simple trauma Bay's

with no supports of surgery intensive

care or anesthesia

I've also treated severe complications

of trauma on mental emotional financial

and social health and patients as young

as four years old gun violence is

absolute terror and is devastating and

crippling for communities and families

as per Section seven of our Charter of

Rights I truly believe that freedom from

gun violence should be considered a

basic human right community should not

fear mass shootings police shootings

gang-related shootings or self-inflicted

shootings nor any other form of gun

violence people should not have access

to weapons designed for mass casualty

and children should not have to do mass

shooter drills in class as my children

have had to but we have to remember that

gun violence is only a symptom it can be

a symptom of depression and anxiety

domestic violence online radicalization

and hate or powerlessness due to

structures of inequity marginalization

poverty and systemic racism in education

criminal justice health employment

housing and more these root causes must

be addressed a weapons ban will not be

enough gun buyback programs cannot work

without addressing structural

disenfranchisement and economic

exclusion that deeply and

disproportionately impacts black and

indigenous communities when having a gun

is the

only power one feels that they have in

life we cannot expect a buyback program

to be effective unless we're replacing

the power we are taking from these

children

additionally we cannot eliminate gang

culture without eliminating systemic

racism children of color need to feel

they belong everywhere in this country

includes and respects us in every aspect

in every interaction we cannot eliminate

gang culture without eliminating

systemic poverty as poverty itself is a

port form of violence funding community

initiatives is important but money must

get to the committee's in smart

meaningful ways this requires the people

in charge of funding distribution to

have an intimate understanding of the

people they're trying to serve

communities truly know what they need

and they have to be empowered to act

we're starting to understand as many

other people have said that gun violence

like the opioid epidemic is a public

health crisis we must treat it as such

with systems designed to prevent screen

and treat trauma and the root causes of

gun violence thank you

beside you is dr. Lynn Wilson the vice

dean at U of T's medical school can you

share that the more academic perspective

perhaps that you have if not your

perspective as a doctor I think I'm

gonna focus mostly on my perspective as

a doctor and then I have a couple of

comments about our healthcare system as

a whole that and how it relates this

issue so I've been a family doctor for

over 30 years and the standard of

practice has changed in my practice due

to the proliferation of guns and gun

violence in our country and I'm just

going to mention a couple of examples so

being a family doctors very is a very

privileged role in our society I get to

look after children adults multiple

generations of one family and these are

the things that have changed in recent

times when I see a well-baby or well

child in my practice part of the

standard now

to ask if there's a gun in the home and

if there is a gun in the home is it

safely secured because of the issues

that we see the tragedies we see around

accidental deaths of children when I see

a woman for her well woman care I

routinely screen for whether or not

she's experiencing intimate partner

violence and if she says that that's

occurring whether it's emotional or

physical violence I also ask is there a

weapon in the home or does your partner

have access to a weapon many of my

patients very sadly experience very

significant mental health issues and

it's very important for me to provide

comprehensive care and of course I

always ask about whether they have

suicidal thoughts and if they do then

it's my job to ask whether or not they

have access to a gun for the reasons

that Julie Maggie was talking about the

other part of my practice that really

means a great deal to me as a counseling

that I provide to individuals whether

they're going through an acute crisis or

they have long-term mental health issues

and I must say that over the years I

have been particularly in recent years

I'm amazed by the number of people who

are very severely impacted in one way or

another by violence and often death due

to guns but also some of the other very

important social issues that we're

talking about here and what I see are

people whose siblings are either gone

well they're gone and one way or another

right they've died because of guns or

perhaps they are now incarcerated and

and I see people who've lost relatives

in other ways and the thing is that the

trauma goes on and on

and it's often multi-generational and it

in a way I don't think it ever truly

goes away so finally I just want to make

another comment you know as I listen to

my colleagues who I think are also very

remarkable right whether it's the trauma

surgeons the sort of work Suzanne does

Julie etc just remarkable people and

then I think about as a family doctor

how what a passionate advocate I am for

our universal health care system and how

there really is a national debate right

now about can we keep it going what are

the pressures on the system and aside

from the the personal human tragedy that

we are all talking about I also think

about the strain on our system we're

talking about a great deal of money that

could be redirected in other ways to

address social determinants of health to

help our frail elderly patients and on

and on so there's kind of two ways of

looking at this and all I want to say is

I really appreciate the opportunity for

all of us to have a chance to have this

dialogue today Thank You Lynn we have

five more experts to hear from what I

want to hear from you all I want to

start with Rebecca and then Suzanne and

go to Adam brandy and Ann Eileen Rebecca

you're an RN at the trauma neuro

neurological institute

tell us about your perspective there so

I am a nurse I work in the trauma

neurosurgical ICU at st. Mike's so I see

kind of after the initial contact in the

trauma Bay I'm then part of the team

that long term takes care of the patient

while they're in the ICU so I definitely

see the effects of gun violence it's

tragic

we are also consulting the families

everybody is asking why what can be done

what can be different so I'm definitely

impacted in that role and it is a strain

on the health care system overall as

well there's a lot of time and resources

that go into helping these people should

be but on the flip side I'm also I don't

get to leave work and step away from it

I also live downtown I live

so it's part of my day-to-day life

whether I'm at home taking care of my

three kids or whether I'm at the

hospital taking care of the people that

we do save that survive gun violence so

I definitely think more needs to be done

in terms of restricting access to these

weapons and I'll leave it at that dr.

Susan Meno you're a pediatric and

emergency doctor tell us about your

perspective for having this discussion

here I am a pediatric emergency medicine

physician and I direct the trauma

program at the Hospital for Sick

Children as well and I while I've had

experience looking after all ages people

with gunshot wounds my expertise is in

Pediatrics and I'd like to focus on the

unique vulnerabilities of children and

youth and I want to thank Lynne for

bringing some of these issues forward

but firearms as we've heard are

certainly a significant and preventable

cause of death and disability in

children in Canadian children and youth

and there is there is no worse thing

than having to tell a parent that

they've lost their child and losing a

child to gun violence is unimaginable

horror and not only our kids directly

injured from firearms and they are with

mortality rates exceeding for any given

injury the younger and smaller that you

are each time somebody is shot there is

inevitably a child who's indirectly

impacted through the loss of a parent or

a sibling another family member or a

friend and the physical and the

psychosocial ripple effect of gun trauma

is far-reaching long-term and extends

well beyond the acute injury intentional

violence like suicide and homicide is

disproportionately affecting young

adolescent males and their risk from

death from firearm injuries now exceeds

all other injuries combined from fires

Falls drowning etc but the majority of

firearm injuries and children are

actually unintentional and mostly

occurring in the home and directly

related to inappropriate access to guns

young children are developmentally

curious they don't have the cognitive

maturity to appreciate danger while

adolescents are notoriously impulsive

and especially vulnerable to the risk of

having a

lethal means suicide easily accessible

in the home our trauma program in recent

years has noted a trend and increasing a

violent injury and that is you know in

2018 we cared for the same number of

children with gunshot wounds as the

previous five years combined

thankfully the absolute Rinat numbers

remain small in comparison to adult

partner trauma centers but they are a

marker of a significant societal problem

and despite strong prevention efforts

and great success and many other injury

domains society does tend to implicitly

allow for the acceptance and

normalization of life ending or

life-altering injury and with regards to

guns it's very routine obviously to hear

of daily occurrence of shootings here in

Toronto and I just want to stipulate it

must never become routine or acceptable

or normal for us to hear of Canadian

children in their daily lives be at

school playgrounds or otherwise to be at

risk so for kids removing access to life

on firearms is life-saving and there's

multiple medical pediatric surgical

societies all whose job it is to look

after the well-being of children who

support banning handguns and assault

weapons and additionally strongly

advocate for safe storage and removal of

guns in the home in families with active

mental illness or concerns for domestic

violence and it's worth noting also that

the Canadian pediatric society one of

these societies supports the proper

regulation of air and BB guns as well

some of these have velocities high

enough to cause serious injury and death

and young children and argue these

should indeed be classified as firearms

when they do and as as David mentioned

expanding research programs to obtain

the data that we need to guide policy is

absolutely essential so in summary I

agree with the public health approach

with the multi-dimensional approach to

reduce root causes and and I think that

strictly regulating firearms is very

important for Canadian children and

youth thank you thank you doctor I'm

turning it now to Adam Vaughan who's

been a long advocate for the City of

Toronto both as our MP right here but

also as someone who's worked in City

Hall someone who's a mental journalist

someone who

understands the multiple determinants of

health including poverty and housing but

also access to guns share with us your

perspective

I had a door knock this weekend and the

mother behind the door all she wanted to

talk about was the kid she lost and it's

a hard door knock it's and I wish to god

it wasn't the first one and it came from

a neighborhood where you don't expect

that conversation and it's just it's

just it's it's too much and if it

impacts the candidate listening you have

to know it impacts the mum and the

family and the siblings and the

grandmothers and it just the bullet

stops but the ricochet continues and

it's trauma and it's big in this city

it's it's hurting kids you know at some

point the politicians that talk on this

issue are going to have to put the same

kind of energy into cutting the yellow

tape as they do the red tape and they

just won't and what the families are

saying is that if you want they test

this is politicians they say if you're

brave enough and have the courage to

talk about gun control

then maybe I'll listen to you about how

you're actually going to solve the real

complexity of the issue and the

complexity of the issue is this we're

just not building strong enough

communities that are creating the most

resilient enough children the families

will also talk about the perpetrators

because they come up many times of the

same communities and they are just as

heartbroken for the families that lose a

kid to the prison system or that lose a

kid to the gang life or lose a kid to

the to the to the cold indifference for

somebody else's life they they see it

holistically they see it in the

comprehensive way and they want you to

talk about educational opportunities and

they want you to talk about better

housing and they want you to talk about

child care they want you to talk about

the whole array of issues because the

ricochets hit those other issues too and

if we're going to honor those tough

conversations and talk about gun control

we have got to step in and step up

equally on those other determinants

because if we can build stronger

neighborhoods we get better cities in a

stronger country but if we build

stronger neighborhoods what we really

get is a more resilient generation of

kids I don't know the next doctor who's

going to cure the common cold but if a

bullet takes mountain Rexdale it's on us

it's on

it's got a stop and and as a political

organization as a culture as a society

as a city every step in the right

direction is a good step but if we don't

make enough stuff it's not a March and

we're not gonna get to where we need to

get to and I want to thank all of you

all of you for the courage and the

service and particularly the way you

heal the families that have to deal with

the aftermath but it's on us the next

bullets got to stop we can do it thank

you Adam brandy Talon tenable is a

registered nurse at the Sunnybrook

Center for injury prevention

tell us about your perspective just to

clarify I'm not a medical practitioner I

work in the Center for injury prevention

and I'm a program coordinator although

my parents would be quite happy if I was

medical practitioner I'm not so I'm

gonna offer a different perspective if I

may working in injury prevention and I'm

gonna share my thoughts on behalf of

those working in community and injured

preventionists around the country who

are working tirelessly on multiple

injury issues we know that injury is the

leading cause of death for Canadians it

leads to it's a leading cause of

disability and hospitalization it's a

massive issue and gun violence is

certainly part of that and there's a

tremendous opportunity to collaborate

between hospital and community to create

the needed change in health outcomes and

that's what we're working towards

working in injury prevention can

sometimes feel like pushing a boulder up

a mountainside

our work is evidence-based and at

Sunnybrook we've seen a sharp increase

in the number of violent injuries in our

trauma center and it's really concerning

what's most frustrating that I've heard

from from our practitioners is treating

the same patient multiple times

so the issue of recidivism is is an

enormous problem and we're in past

practice our medical teams would do

tremendous work to to fix the physical

injuries and send people back into

community we're realizing that we can do

a much better job when we can

collaborate with our community partners

and we create linkages directly to

patients when they need them most and

and help to change their trajectory we

know much more today about the

underlying conditions that influence

violence and I'm punctuating the points

that have already been

we need to build solutions through the

lens of the social determinants of

health with our partners in health care

in public health and community

organizations together we're working

with our partners across the city to

implement a hospital based violence

intervention program but there is

there's barriers to creating programs

like this in terms of the resources

necessary to support them and so we hope

together that with our partners in the

in the city and across the different

communities that we'll be able to

achieve this this great program it

requires innovation and collaborative

solutions and and I think that's the key

to take gun control and gun and gun

violence is that we we look at this

through multiple lenses it's not a

simple solution and it we can't reinvent

the wheel we need to to find these these

new ways to work together breaking down

the silos between us to achieve the

healthy outcomes that we want for every

community and every individual thank you

thank you brandy and finally to dr.

Eileen Davila who is the medical officer

of Health for the City of Toronto

obviously you've been engaged in this

issue for a long time your leadership is

well known to people who who are in the

community and also watching your work on

through the media thank you for your

leadership and I'm glad to give you the

last word today thank you very much mr.

prime minister and first of all I'd like

to thank all my colleagues around this

panel for sharing your stories and for

doing the amazing work that you do to

help keep our city as healthy as

possible I can't thank you enough for

the work that each and every one of you

does in your respective realms we've

heard you know from my colleagues and

it's hard for me to say it better than

that which has already been said but we

know that gun violence and violence writ

large as having a significant impact on

the health status of our city and that

obviously as the medical officer of

Health for the City of Toronto concerns

me it concerns me for Toronto but it

concerns me beyond the borders of

Toronto and we've heard many of my

colleagues already speak about how this

is a public

issue and how therefore that calls for a

public health approach so I won't

belabor the point but I will say a few

words in respect of what does that mean

what is a public health approach to

violence writ large and certainly we

know that restricting firearms

restricting access to firearms and

ammunition is part of the equation and

it's an important part but I would say

that it is only part of the equation and

we've heard many of my colleagues around

this panel speak to the need for us all

levels of government and all of us in

our community to think about how best we

address the social determinants of

health as a public health practitioner I

have to tell you it is extremely

heartening to hear health care providers

speak so eloquently and so passionately

about the social determinants of health

healthcare is incredibly incredibly

important to the health status of our

population but we know that what really

creates and maintains health in our

communities whether they're big cities

like Toronto or small jurisdictions

further north are the social

determinants of health people need to

have access not just to housing but to

homes places where they belong people

need to have access to employment and

financial resources people need to feel

that they have connections that they

have the supports right social supports

social networks to rely upon when

challenging times arise these are just

some of the things that need to be

addressed in order to actually solve

this issue to mitigate the negative

impact of violence on the health status

of our communities so I would encourage

each and every one of us in this room

yes there's a role for government yes

there's a role for the federal

government yes there's a role for the

provincial government yes there's a role

for local government but each of us has

a role to play beyond that which our

governments can do and I would encourage

each and every one of us in this room to

think about what that role

looks like and how we intend to act upon

that thank you very much doctor thank

you all for being part of this important

discussion this morning we know how

important it is to keep our community

safe we know that there are many many

elements to reflect on from intimate

partner violence to mental health to

guns and gangs we know that there is

always more that we need to do as a

society and that's why as a federal

government we're proposing to move

forward with some of the strongest gun

control measures in years in this

country and I look forward to continuing

this conversation with many many

Canadians as we take concrete steps to

keep people safer and taking a public

health perspective on guns and on

violence is a really important addition

to the conversation something you've all

been leading on for many years and I'm

very very pleased that we were able to

have this discussion this morning makes

you look into a mountain thank you

now I'm going to take some questions

from media

[Music]

Chris Reynolds Canadian press the

Premier of Ontario where Toronto has

seen this star fries in fatal gun

violence has said he's not interested in

a ban on handguns sales he opposes it

have you spoken with Doug Ford at all

since the writ dropped I think this is

something that we've been unfortunately

seeing right across the country the

conservative politicians want to weaken

gun control where we want to strengthen

gun control and that is at the heart of

the choice the Canadians are facing in

this upcoming election do we strengthen

gun control in a way that will keep

cities communities and Canadians safer

or do we weaken gun control we have

committed to move forward to give cities

the tools municipalities that want the

tools to restrict or ban handguns we

will work with the provinces wherever

possible and I certainly hope the

provinces will listen to the voices of

experts and the voices of municipal

leaders who are demanding more tools to

fight the gun violence they're facing

but we will ensure that cities have the

tools to ban or restrict handguns as

they wish okay new Haqqanis own que le

you spoken before it since the red

dropped I have known and very lastly a

lot of the advocates here today more

professionals here today as well as

anti-gun can or gun control advocates

say that this really isn't enough that

assault gun bans don't go far enough a

handgun ban is needed how do you answer

them why not just go a little further we

are putting forward the strongest

measures around gun control that Canada

has seen in many many years because we

know that stronger gun control is

something that our communities need

something Canadians need something

Canadians expect to keep themselves and

their families safe we've heard

heartbreaking stories from medical

profession errs professionals who are on

the front lines and who are dealing

every day with the impact on families

and that's why we're moving forward with

significant gun control measures that

will ban military-style assault weapons

that have been used in mass shootings

increasingly in the United States but

also in Canada and we've also moving

forward to give municipalities the power

to restrict or ban handguns these are

measures that the Conservatives have

announced not only will they not do but

they will reverse the gun control

measures we brought in like tougher

background checks and verification of

permits before you actually buy a gun

the choice for Canadians is crystal

clear liberals will strengthen gun

control conservatives will weaken gun

control Haley Cooper one Newstalk 1010

we're hearing of new very creative ways

of getting these weapons across the

border and they are making it across the

border how big of a problem is this

and you know battling gun violence and

you know what's being done to solve it

under ten years of Stephen Harper the

Conservatives cut funding for the

Canadian Border Services agencies we

actually invested significantly over the

past four years in better measures at

the border to control the flow of guns

in from the United States and we will

continue to ensure that our border

agents have the tools necessary to slow

the flow of guns illegal guns from the

United States but we also recognize that

there are many guns legally purchased in

Canada that end up in the hands of

criminals and on the streets which is

why we're moving forward to give better

tools to our police agencies to monitor

bulk purchases of handguns and we're

also moving forward on stronger

regulations for storage particularly for

gun ranges and and and retail outlets

that sell handguns to ensure that those

guns

don't end up on our streets as well we

have taken many measures and we're going

to be taking more measures but it comes

down to that straightforward choice for

Canadians liberals are going to

strengthen gun control conservatives

want to weaken gun control Loserville

I just might follow up you mentioned

that Canadians need to elect a

government that will listen to people

similar to the panel sitting behind you

and we have heard today that some people

sitting on that panel want gun violence

declared a public health crisis why has

it not been declared a public health

crisis by your government we are moving

forward in tangible ways that is going

to counter gun control and Islands we

made deeper background checks we've made

measures in place through our

commitments in c71

to make safe transport a more more

controlled element there are many

measures that we've taken to strengthen

gun control over the past four years and

we will continue to strengthen gun

control with a ban on military-style

assault weapons and empowering cities to

ban handguns these are the things that

people are calling for they are concrete

actions not just statements of urgency

because we recognize the public health

emergency that gun violence is becoming

we're doing it in a way that continues

to stand up and defend Canadian

know there is a time we are in a time

right now around the world of

mobilization of migration of immigration

and that means that Canada is not immune

from it what we've been able to ensure

over these past years is that everyone

who arrives in Canada whether it is

regular or irregular goes through the

entirety of our immigration system and

we continue to apply all the rules all

the checks all the steps within our

robust immigration system in a way that

can reassure Canadians and continue to

ensure the Canadians continue to be one

understands that immigration is a good

to pay their fair share of taxes we know

that we're in a world where they haven't

always done that and that's why we are

following the lead of countries that we

are friends and allies with like France

and the UK to ensure that those tech

giant's pay taxes on the revenue they

generate in Canada we are aligning

ourselves with an international approach

that has been worked out between the US

and France for example and we are

Bloomberg News The Globe and Mail this

morning is reporting that Canadian and

US officials are working on a joint

action plan to reduce reliance on

Chinese rare earth minerals are you

aware of those efforts and would you

support them I brought up this topic of

conversation in my last meeting with

Donald Trump where I highlighted the

Canada has many of the rare earth

minerals that are so necessary for

modern technologies and as a terms of a

country that is a solid Ally and a

reliable supply of minerals that as you

point out many of them come from China

it is in our interest to ensure that we

have reliable supplies of these

important minerals for technologies and

it's a conversation that are

our government is leading them Papago

Beeman Global News there's a headline in

the New York Times that says Justin

Trudeau Instagram prime minister

struggles to resonate with young voters

how concerned are you about resonating

with young voters and perhaps more

importantly actually getting young

voters to the polls I was very pleased

to be meeting with young voters

yesterday in a town hall in which we

talked about our approach on many things

but particularly around post-secondary

education

we understand that young people are

facing increasing pressures and barriers

to succeed and that requires more

studies and more post-secondary

education being available and that's why

we're moving forward to continue to make

post-secondary education more affordable

when we took office in 2015 was about

$2,000 was the maximum Canada student

grant we've now we will now boost it up

to $4,200 for students who need it right

across the country on top of that you

won't have to start paying back your

student loan for the first two years

after you graduate and then only once

you've started making thirty five

thousand dollars a year will you have to

start paying back your student loan and

if you start a family we want your focus

to be on giving all the opportunities to

your young family that's why for the

first five years of your child's life

you will not have to pay back your

student loans either we are making

student edge making education more

affordable for young people because we

know how important it is on that on our

leadership on the environment and

fighting climate change on gun control

which is an issue that matters deeply to

young Canadians as well we are moving

forward in the right way and I'm very

excited about how many young people are

stepping up to get involved to volunteer

to be part of moving to moving forward

with the Liberal Party of Canada

mr. Trudeau good morning Omar sechina

from CTV News here we are day 20 or

midway through this campaign

and you have targeted key constituencies

you just talked about some of them

parents students the middle class and

yet you're still not connect with with

your main challenger your main rival

Andrew Shearer what's it going to take

in the second half of this campaign to

break that logjam and that deadlock we

are going to continue to talk about the

things that matter to Canadians we've

heard from Canadians not just over the

past number of weeks but over the past

number of years that even though our

economy is growing at record levels even

though we have over a million new jobs

that Canadians created including most of

them full-time we've lifted 900,000

people out of poverty including 300,000

kids we hear very clearly from Canadians

that there is more to do there's more to

invest in people there's more to invest

in communities and that's exactly what

we've put forward as a platform more

help for seniors more help for young

families more help for workers more help

for students investments in the future

of our country and the choice couldn't

be clearer Liberals are proposing to

continue to invest in Canadians because

it is working to grow our economy create

opportunities for everyone conservatives

are proposing tax breaks for the

wealthiest and cuts to services for

everyone else they're proposing the same

kind of austerity that didn't work for

ten years under Stephen Harper and as we

continue to approach the October 21st

Election Day we will keep talking but

the things that matter and the clear

choice that Canadians are facing between

choosing to move forward are going

backwards with weaker gun laws with

nothing to fight climate change and with

tax breaks for the wealthiest and

nothing for people who are working hard

and needed that's the choice people are

facing and I'm looking forward to

October 21st

mr. Trudeau back on the subject of arms

Barry watch that our socialist action

Canada is the sixth largest producer

weapons the sixth largest exporter of

weapons in the world

why do you condone the sale of weapons

to Saudi Arabia which is using those

weapons to to commit atrocities in Yemen

and other places around the world after

ten years of poor choices by Stephen

Harper's Conservatives we move forward

on signing the end ratify moving for

ratification of the Arms Trade Treaty

because we recognize how important it is

for Canada to be a positive player a

positive leader in the fight against

illicit arms and violence around the

world we've also moved forward on

greater transparency and accountability

and indeed the contract the secret

contract that Stephen Harper signed with

Saudi Arabia for the sale of light

armored vehicles is one that quite

frankly was a terrible contract that

involves penalties in the billions of

dollars that Canadian taxpayers would

have to send to Saudi Arabia if we

breached that contract that is something

that it would be unacceptable to

Canadians that's why we're moving

forward on on on verifying and

reconsidering the export permits while

at the same time we're ensuring that the

workers in London good middle-class jobs

at GDLs in London have contracts with

Canadian military to ensure that we are

able to continue to support good jobs

while we stand up for the values and

priorities of Canadians like follow up

mr. Trudeau are you aware that your

campaign office in Montreal is now

occupied by Haiti solidarity activists

and what would you say to those who

asked why you back the undemocratic

regime of jovenel moise Hawaii wage war

on on on Venezuela and continue to lead

the Lima group with undemocratic regimes

in Honduras Guatemala Colombia and many

other places isn't this a POC recei I've

heard a number of people bring up the

situation of Canada's leadership around

the Lina Lima group

Venezuela as something to criticize we

are standing up and respecting the

Venezuelan Constitution because for all

those people out there who think that

there was somehow a legitimate election

for Maduro last year they are wrong

international bodies have recognized

that the election in Venezuela was

illegitimate and Maduro is not the

legitimate president of Venezuela and

therefore according to the Venezuelan

Constitution the leader of the National

Assembly gets to become president and

hold elections as quickly as possible

that is the movement towards democracy

that Canada is not just supporting but

leading on and I disagree vehemently

with anyone who continues to support the

murderous Maduro regime and the deep

violations of human human rights and

humanitarian crisis that Maduro has

launched April from an TV TV strudel

considering 300,000 Canadian living hong

kong and hong kong people has been

fighting for their basic rights and

democracy for almost four Mensa's US

government has taken action to support

Hong Kong democracy movement and the

Iying process of passing the Hong Kong

human rights and democracy act so if

really liked it what action will you

take to protect Nene and living in Hong

Kong and support Hong Kong democracy

Liberal government has not stated

clearly whether you will ban my ways 5g

and if we really liked it would you ban

Powys 5g our decision around telecom

security in Canada is based on expert

recommendations based on working with

our five eyes allies who are are working

very much on the same issue we will

continue to follow the advice of experts

including experts in allied countries on

how to ensure that Canadians have the

the right security around our telecom

infrastructure at the same time as we

make sure that they're affordable for

people getting that balance right is

something that shouldn't be just left up

to politicians it's something that we

need to respect the experts and the data

on and that is what we're doing in

regards to Hong Kong as you point out we

have three hundred thousand Canadian

citizens in Hong Kong and we are always

very concerned about their well-being we

continue to call for de-escalation for

dialogue between the authorities and the

people of Hong Kong and respect for the

one country two systems approach that

has served well over the past years yes

longer
