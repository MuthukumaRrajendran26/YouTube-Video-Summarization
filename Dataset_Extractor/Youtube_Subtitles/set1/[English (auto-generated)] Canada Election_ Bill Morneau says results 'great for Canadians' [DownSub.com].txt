well the night's not over yet and so we

are we're gonna wait and see the outcome

what I can say clearly has happened as

Canadians have seen that the message

that we brought forward the need to

continue investing in the success for

themselves and their families that

people took the hurt they know that we

need to deal with climate change they

know that our plan is the only way for

us to move forward on that agenda so I

think what we're hearing is an agreement

with the issues and we will manage

towards making a difference for families

managed towards making a difference for

for our environment and I think

Canadians would be on board you said

that the night is still young but there

are if you are to return to the finance

role how how difficult do you foresee

that being is trying to you know broker

deals when it comes to an opposition

that would be very keen on repealing a

number of things that you I think we're

always going to seek the things that we

know are gonna make a big difference for

Canadians and I I expect that the other

parties will see that as well so when we

think about making sure that families

are optimistic about the future because

they're doing better they're more money

in their pocket that students have

higher levels of grants I think we'll

find broad support when we look towards

making sure that we have a price on

pollution across the country so it can

actually constructively deal with

climate change I think we will find a

broad base of support so we'll need to

work to make sure that we are doing what

we've promised we're gonna do and find

ways to make sure that other parties

will come along with that and I'm

confident that we will be able to find

that that ground that matters for

families that matters for Canadians and

that other parties will come around to a

grain

the Conservatives campaigning so

heartily on repealing the carbon tax are

you concerned that it may come to a

point where the government could fall go

back to another election just based on

that do you think that they would be

willing to support your government if

that was the crux of the issue there I

think we're gonna find that there is

broad support in this country for

dealing with climate change you saw

through the course in this election that

we had young people stand up and say

this was the most important issue in

their agenda I think what you're going

to see from the results tonight is that

a strong plurality at least if not a

majority of MPs are going to be behind

that notion so we are going to continue

to work on behalf of Canadians and we're

going to find a way to ensure that we

address the issues that we need to

address and that's what we've been

saying all through this campaign

stumbles as far as your party as far as

your leaders well there were elements in

this election campaign that were

decidedly negative and that's

unfortunate obviously social media

magnifies some of those discussions I'm

confident that what we've done is we've

put together an agenda that it's going

to make a real difference and I think

what Canadians are going to want to see

is that we're gonna get down to work

that we're gonna actually work on the

issues that matter to them we need to

put the election campaign behind us we

need to govern in a positive way

addressing the things that people want

us to address so they can feel more

confident about their futures

even here tonight you know with the

blackface scandal are these are you

confident that we've moved past that

point what what word are you hearing

from your voters that they would like to

hear mr. Trudeau still address about

that you know I've spent a lot of time

in this riding with my constituents as

well as in other writings and I think

that what they see is that our approach

to ensuring that we have a strong and

diverse country is the right approach

obviously mr. Trudeau made a mistake

that he apologized for we're going to

move forward with our agenda trying to

ensure that we continue to be a beacon

of hope for the world in terms of

successful immigration policy helping

people to lead successful lives here

from around the world when they choose

to come to Canada that's a policy that's

worked for generations yourself team is

rookie last time how excited are you to

return knowing that there is a bit more

experience now look I'm very excited

about the next Parliament it is really

the case that what's happened over the

last four years has given me of a sense

of how much impact we can have on

Canadians lives how much positive impact

and I'm excited to get back to work

together with my colleagues so that we

can make sure that we're actually

addressing the issues that matter so

it's a really great result from that

standpoint I think it's a great result

for Canadians
