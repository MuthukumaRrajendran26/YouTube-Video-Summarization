thanks so much we're here in pricey

narrows here miss I see fruity turtle

Canora it's well MoMA Kwok a member of

Richard Parliament in Ontario

Legislative Assembly and Ewan Gracia

narrows this is a community that is one

of the most powerful examples of the

neglect of the federal government the

fact that the community has had mercury

poisoning that is claimed the community

for so long and there's been so much

inaction is is just such a horrible

example of just the inaction of

conservative and liberal governments and

most recently when we saw a community

activist someone from Gracia Narrows

raising the concern about what will the

federal government what will mr.

Trudeau's government do about the

mercury poisoning at a fundraiser

it is incomprehensible how mr. Trudeau

said this but he sarcastically said

thank you for the nation as he mocked

someone raising a concern about a

community another example of the two mr.

Trudeau's someone in public who says

indigenous reconciliation is so

important but in private makes fun of

someone who's raising a serious concern

about a community impacted by mercury

poisoning beyond that now we've seen

recently with mr. Trudeau's government's

decision to appeal the landmark Canadian

Human Rights Tribunal decision to say

indigenous kids need to be compensated

for the unequal funding something that

we've long known as being true the fact

that this is now being appealed and the

reasons for the appeal again are a

complete betrayal of reconciliation it

is it is beyond any sort of

comprehension how the God we can talk

about reckless reconciliation in one

hand and then abandon it on the other

these are just more and more examples of

what is what is a massive issue of

injustice that's not being interests and

I want to make one last thing very clear

that we can tackle these problems it's a

matter of having commitment to do so the

Parliamentary Budget Office makes it

clear

that the reason why the boil water

advisories the cleaning water has not

been done is because of a lack of

funding that 1.8 billion dollar

shortfall in commitments is the reason

why we're not at the point where

cleaning the water that's me is just

again unacceptable it's wrong when mr.

Trudeau can find the money to buy a

pipeline you can find the money to give

corporations billions of dollars in tax

cuts the fact is they could find the

money they're not doing it it is a

choice that they're making

it's not about chance it's not by

Clinton it's a choice good morning mrs.

Singh so what exactly are you committing

to this community when it comes to

addressing the issues with with mercury

poisoning can you give us exact don't

look bigger as many specifics as

possible sure so what the communities

asked for is 19 million dollars for a

treatment center now while that's what

they need to deliver the type of

treatment center that's required for a

community that's been impacted by

mercury the Trudeau government is come

back with your 10 million so half of

what's needed essentially and of that

they've not delivered any of the funding

maybe a percent effectively no money's

been delivered so for New Democrats this

is a priority we would immediately move

to commit to the 19 million dollars

ensure that the treatment center is

built it's fully funded and ensure that

we're sinking steps not to just clean

the water and treat your poisoning

that's impacting people now but also a

commitment to ensure we've put enough

money to ensure that there's no more

water advisories and drinking water

issues in any indigenous community

across Canada national news

so 19 million for the construction of

the mercury home but there was also

requests and belief from the community

here for eighty eight point seven

million with a trust fund that would be

secured for compensation if all of the

health related side effects so what

would an NDP government do in terms of

funding for compensation here Christine

arrows and also chief turtle maybe

explain what the other hurdles have been

to get this project forward and to move

forward with compensation is that still

a request from the host nation here to

have that money set aside that eighty

eight million dollars set aside for

future health concerns so when I can

speak to this is the general value and

then she journal will speak directly to

your question if you just take a step

back we've got a community that's facing

justice for over fifty years there's

been mercury poisoning that's directly

impacting the people for fifty years

there's got to be a point in time if we

really are committed to reconciliation

where we say enough is enough we need to

take real action right away so for me my

commitment is this we need to do

everything possible to provide treatment

for people who are faced with mercury

poisoning we need to make sure that that

treatment center is funded long-term we

also need to make sure that we clean the

water whatever it takes to do these

three things I'm committing to do these

are so important that we cannot

negotiate or be willing to compromise if

we want to solve the problem there has

to be a commitment to do that that is my

commitment I believe that there is no

excuse in 2019 but the well that we have

as a nation the technology we have as a

country that we cannot clean this water

ensure that all communities have clean

drinking water I do not accept any

excuses I'm committing to do whatever it

takes to get it done yeah so I mean I

gotta be really clear on this if we I

mean looking at a community that's faced

with mercury poisoning I've met with the

kids I've met with elders and seniors

that have suffered from the poisoning to

me we'd have to be willing to have the

courage to do whatever it takes and so

yes I'm committing to the funds there's

reason why mr. Trudeau could find 4.5

billion dollars divided by a pipeline 14

billion dollars to give away to the

wealthiest corporations we couldn't find

the money to make sure this community

has the treatment center it's fully

funded and clean drinking water do not

accept that it could not be done I

accept what the PPO is said that is

simply a lack of courage a lack of

priority not putting the money up to do

with the problem I am prepared to do

that can you be a bit more specific

about what your strategy would be in

government to combat the oil water and

five cereza and also it sounds a bit

like is this blank cheque for indigenous

needs that are I mean we can say that

they have not been met certainly for

decades but is that what your promises

here today you're saying whatever it

takes no matter what it costs is that a

blank cheque for indigenous communities

if you're elected that is a firm

commitment for justice this is a firm

commitment to reach to remedy and

injustice why is it that indigenous

communities it's okay to have drinking

water that's that's not clean why is it

okay for that to exist and why would

that be it to be why would anyone

question whether or not every indigenous

community should have clean drinking

water if this was an issue in Toronto in

Vancouver in any city around the world

in around Canada there would be no

debate we would get it done you wouldn't

say oh how much is it gonna cost it's

clean drinking water

obviously everyone should have it and

obviously our country should make it a

priority

so yes I'm saying let's do whatever it

takes to clean that drinking water we

already know roughly the figure the PPU

has indicated that there is a 1.8

billion dollar shortfall so that's

roughly the amount that's being that's

being put forward as what we need to

find so absolutely we should be able to

find 1.8 billion the government was able

to find 14 billion to give away to the

wealthiest corporations they forgave six

billion dollars in corporate debt yes I

am committing and I think it should be

obvious that we can commit to cleaning

and drinking water for all indigenous

people where's their strategies what are

their attitudes

this problem strategy is if it is this

it is a problem we've got the technology

and we've got the money what we've

lacked in what we have in life but mr.

trio is locked when mr. Harper is locked

is making it a making it a priority they

can make it a party you can get done it

has not been made a priority the PPU has

been has made it very clear that it's

not been a priority they haven't put up

enough funding to get it done we will

get it done because we believe it's a

priority and we will put the money in

place to make sure it happens to a

formal national for the Kevins point are

you just writing a blank check for all

problems for all indigenous communities

across the country once you get into

office

so if Toronto had a drinking for water

problem if Montreal had a drinking water

problem would you be asking the same

question it's a lot of money is what I'm

saying and people will look at it and go

how much money are we going to spend on

all this that's a genuine question would

you be asking this question that if

Vancouver did not have clean drinking

water would you be asking this question

of Edmonton did not have clean drinking

water

no you wouldn't that's what I'm saying

why is it that we asked the question

about whether or not conditions people

shower clean drinking water we got to

take a minute and think why is that even

a question yes they deserve a clean

drinking water yes if you make it happen

it's a matter of priority and I'm gonna

do it chief turtle a question what has

it been about the Trudeau government has

frustrated you so much that you've

decided that you now want to run for the

MVP and and tell me a little bit about

their their dealings with you over this

this deal to try and get the treatment

plant in the health center well first of

all like I think that it's what's been

very frustrating is all the stalling

stalling tactics that

they've been using him Oh quite often

though they'll just be quoting on

regulations and procedures and things

that are normally done well this is not

a normal situation like it's been 50

years since since we've had mercury

poisoning here grassy narrows and also

the other things is that I traveled the

communities already open to different

communities and there's still

communities that are that that have poor

running water there's this one community

that I've been to where they they can't

start their school year because their

water treatment plant is not running and

it's not fair to that community that

they can't start their school year just

because their water treatment plant is

not running well that's wrong and that's

me and and I'm not happy with that that

should be fix I know that they're going

around making these announcements here

and there but there's still lots of

First Nations that need to be dealt with

and also just not just not just first

nation but small towns too that they

need drinking order to that's something

that I want to correct like I I'm not

running only on indigenous issues I'm

also running for the Mystic

municipalities and and and their issues

and the surrounding area here in Kenora

matter Marly Thunder Bay television news

you said you know you open it up for

brain clearing out boil water advisories

and in many communities you can many of

those communities are far northern

communities they lack road access

obviously roads falls under the purview

of the province how do you plan to work

with the provinces to be able to get

that technology to those locations with

the lack of roads that are up there we

know that there's so many technologies

available right now there's so many ways

to solve problems available right now

really to me this is just a question of

whether or not there's a priority to get

it done we can do incredible things if

it's a priority you can get done and the

Probation Budget Office is giving a

rough figure of what

the gap is in how much funding is needed

and how much funding has been delivered

that with there's a 1.8 billion dollar

gap and the commitments that mr. Trudeau

has made that Liberal government's made

to solving the problem which includes

from northern and remote communities so

what I wanted to put forward is a choice

these are just choices that governments

make mr. Trudeau made the choice to

spend a lot of money he spent 6 billion

dollars to forgive corporate loans 14

billion dollars in the Falken ah McStay

meant to give away beastly to the

richest corporations so they could buy

corporate jets and limousines he gave

away 4.5 billion dollars of our public

money to buy a pipeline there's billions

of dollars that are being spent I think

it's very reasonable to say that if

indigenous people can object have a

clean drinking water and the shortfall

is 1.8 billion dollars that yes we

absolutely can find the money to do that

to make sure that that indigenous people

have clean drinking water no matter

where they live across this country it

can be done it's a matter of priority

and I'm making a party it was less about

finding the money though is working with

the provinces because obviously we have

any conservative Progressive

Conservative government Ontario how do

you plan to work with that government to

be able to get those roads built to get

those technology who say we have to

these communities we absolutely will

have to work with provincial governments

but for many of the solutions it's it's

a matter of providing the resources to

the community the training the equipment

being delivered to those communities it

can be done there's ways that equipment

is delivered to those communities

already there's there's infrastructure

in those communities right now it can be

done it's got to be made a priority and

I'm gonna make it about why won't you

commit to a target of when you're gonna

lift the water advisors the Liberals

habits 20 21 yes I'm sorry we have a

target as well I'm saying that well what

I'm coming to immediately is yes see our

target is actually getting it done we

have the same target but where our

targets actually get it done and our

commitment is this we're gonna put the

funding in place right away

the funding has not been put in place

right away and not to me is a concrete

way the target is is important but we

know what's been laughs

the funding so they can talk about the

targets all day long and that's been the

problem that mr. Trudeau has made

targets for reducing emissions made

targets for reducing bullet water

advisories but making a target and then

not backing up is meaningless and so

what I'm saying is the coffee thing the

federal government dude does it put the

money on the table and we know the PBO

has said it's a 1.8 billion dollar

shortfall I'm gonna put that money up

front right away to me there's no time

to wait there's no reason to wait if it

is a priority and it is for us we will

do that work right away a lot was said

at this news conference about how there

are policies and issues in our

government that disproportionately

advantage some Canadians and

disadvantaged indigenous communities

fair to say and this is open to anyone

here you know Canada's racist so we have

a government that's racist

there's no question about it if you look

at the treatment of indigenous people

there is a decision being made not to

fund basically things like water there

is a decision being made to not ensure

that edition's communities get the basic

funding that's needed the PPU has said

that their commitments and what their so

what they what's needed to be done and

what the Liberals are committing to you

there's a 1.8 billion gap at 1.8 billion

dollar gap so clearly there is a there

is a concerted decision that the

government's making now when it came to

giving what richest corporations money

they jumped into action did 14 billion

dollars in last fall economic statement

I can't highlight that enough that is a

clear decision that this governs making

to say corporations need help we're

gonna jump to help them out as your

shadow says if we need to buy a pipeline

I'm gonna find the money 4.5 billion

dollars right away when indigenous

communities need clean drinking water oh

it's gonna be tough I'm not sure I'm

gonna be able to do it that is what

we're seeing that is not a chance that's

not a coincidence that is a decision and

it's not a decision that just applies to

indigenous communities we see that same

decision-making apply to healthcare

where people who need access to

medication they're told to wait but

pharmaceutical companies who want

profits they say we got you're gonna

protect your profits these are decisions

that governments are making little bows

thank you

continue to make decisions that benefit

those at the top that hurt people that

hurt families that is what they've been

doing indigenous communities are a

powerful example of this priority that's

put on the wealthy and the people at the

top not the families that need it not

the indigenous community that need it

and we can change that that's what I'm

saying to Canadians that we do not have

to settle for less we can actually build

a better country and I'm committed to

doing that
