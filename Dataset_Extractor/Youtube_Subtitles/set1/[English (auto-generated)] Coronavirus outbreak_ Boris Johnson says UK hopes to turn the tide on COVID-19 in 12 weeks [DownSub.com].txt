for the the huge efforts that the

country's is making to comply with the

advice that we being given but asked me

such a huge amount asking these students

to put their education on hold we're

asking people not to socialize in the

normal way and so it's vital that we in

government stand behind them when what

we are asking anyone to do is so crucial

for saving literally thousands of our

lives by defeating this virus and

unconscious as as the days have gone by

that people we want to know how long

we're expecting them to keep it up and I

wanted to try to say something today

about how I see the timescale of this

campaign and where we're going and what

we need to do and I do think looking at

all that we can turn the tide within the

next 12 weeks and I'm absolutely

confident that we can send a coronavirus

in this country but only if we take the

steps we take the steps that we have

outlined reduce the peak and what we've

achieved that if we do those techniques

as I've said then the scientific

progress that we're making would start

to come into a play I wanted to discuss

a little bit of that this afternoon with

you because we are rapidly declined so

much better at understanding the the

genomics of the heart of this virus and

all that is going on in this country

were getting better

admittance would may treat and cure it

and today we put the first British

corona patient into a randomized trial

for drugs than they treat the disease UK

experts the scientists expect to start

trials for the first vaccine within a

month this process is so difficult

because the enemy is invisible and the

answer is to remove the cloak of

invisibility and to identify the box and

two men who which of us is carrying it

and to give you an idea of what is

coming down the track we're in

negotiations today to buy an antibody

test as simple as a a pregnancy test

that can tell whether you have had the

disease and it's early days but if it

works as its proponents claim then we

will buy literally hundreds of thousands

of these kits as soon as that because

obviously it has the potential to be a

game-changer

there was once human likely to be less

vulnerable you're less likely to

possible and you can go back to work and

of course by the same token were

massively increasing the testing to see

whether you have it

no and Romney are daily testing from

five thousand a day to 10,000 to 25,000

and then up at a 250,000 and that

knowledge of where the virus is will

make a huge difference to our management

of the disease and our ability to reduce

disruption and economic difficulties and

I wanted to set that out because it is

this is where

coming down the track as I say but it

really take time to come on the street

and that is why in the meantime to get

back to a theme that you know I'm going

to repeat it is absolutely vital that we

followed the advice search we've been

hearing over the last a few days the the

announcements that we've already made

about staying at home if you have the

symptoms if your family has the symptoms

like avoiding unnecessary contact

avoiding gatherings where you may pick

up the disease pubs bars restaurants

please please follow all that advice

scrupulously work from home if you

possibly can

wash your hands wash your hands and it's

by this combination ruthless determined

collective action and scientific

progress there already see that we will

we will succeed and I know how difficult

it may be when they seem right now but

if we do this together we will save as I

said many many thousands of lives and so

everybody in the UK who worried about

their jobs are less than everybody in

who faces difficulties because of the

advice that we are giving I say to

business

stand by your employees stand by your

workers because we will stand by you and

be hearing more about that in the course

the next table sir and that is how by an

iterative corrective determining

collective action and scientific

progress

I absolutely no doubt that we will turn

the tide of this disease and beat it

together now

and you told the country yesterday

wouldn't hesitate to take extra measures

people are worried about what that might

mean when you tell people what might be

next will you within days seek to shut

pubs cafes clothes and a lot of people

have contacted us today to say the

measures set out for businesses to apply

to loans it's simply not quick enough

for them to be able to keep their staff

on we've had a lot of messages

is it good enough to say it's a business

you can apply for a loan when many of

them face immediate decisions that might

mean they have to look to see cut staff

yeah decisions are very much liked by

the science and the advice given is he's

working so as long as we think that

people are actually staying away from

places where they may transmit the

disease that is working then you just

want to say thank you to everybody for

their extraordinary efforts and

encourage everybody to do likewise if we

feel nothing we just got to do it

together and please please follow the

advice

second thing you mentioned this tomorrow

from from issue the Chancellor's you

know at the transfer my message to the

business is why I can't just stand by

your employees as his widow stand by you

understand by

this target any different as we come

through this difficult economic race you

know how to do you have to make every

city know about the baton you didn't go

out there the people who Reza it's time

to make sure that we look after the

people who suffer from the first half of

the twenty nine deaths today in London

so p.m. I have to ask you in careful and

others do you not think he is now right

to move from those substantial drop down

of the capital like they have done in

Italy and Spain and France where you

can't leave your house unless you keep

Parker will you go to the shops for food

or medicine are you not doing that

because you don't know how to enforce it

when you can't enforce it or rather you

do it but the time isn't quite right and

just secondly a bit of hope there will

suggest in to the public that if they

follow the rules that you can turn the

tide on this disease are you telling

people that by the summer they might

they just might be able to go back to

normal life go on their summer holidays

thank you

we do want to see people following the

advice that we give them in the capital

which is up as what you say the place

where the disease seems to

but that we need them to consider you

know absolutely necessary to ensure that

I'm very confident that we'll beat the

virus I think within the next week but

it depends on collective resolute and

doing that the the greater the the

choices that the scientific community

will be able soon to come up as I say

the fantastic results from testing to

say nothing like other other medical

treatments if I could ask a couple of

questions - Chris witty there's pollen

concern within the NHS about capacity

running short lungs and hospitals could

you tell us a bit about how you see the

capacity issue agenda

second is we also be aware there is a

lot of concern among medical staff that

they're not getting the protective

equipment was apparently the system is

just not in the right places

how quickly will you be able to get it

to the right places and then finally

Prime Minister you came up with 22

number just now you said 250,000 tests

what what do you mean by that

they are they on course testing is I

think crucial to our success in

defeating this this virus were making

fantastic progress on testing I are we

had a great meeting in Mexico with

people supplied us with all kinds

launched at the end when he testified I

mentioned much faster and more digital

test to see whether he currently have

the the disease not the culture of those

to help us is obviously enormous we're

not there yet but we will get there very

soon yeah

the testing to public helping with new

parody leaving the testing on this their

products through the 5000 there are

proposals to get that much higher

through other mechanisms for the virus

itself and then the antibody test if

that turns out to be something as well

so ideally you'd like to get those sorts

of numbers you'd like to be able to do

both testing the infection itself and

testing yet packet you have that we've

done a few short weeks practically that

can be done I mean the testing for the

virus is a pretty standard technology it

just happens to be your Z precise with

this virus but it's not a new technology

event and if the antibody test is

reliable works if seen at that centers

but if it does then that's what one does

it be easy in to scale up pressure in

London so at the moment London from the

corona virus is under pressure but

indirectly but that's going together

that is actually the reason for doing

all of the things we're trying to do and

the first thing that will give the

greatest pressure

Andres perfect system that's the thing

which in a sense that's the first point

of of real pressure on ths is happen and

to be clear even if everybody does all

the things we hope and really really

would ask that they do do the numbers

will continue to go up over the next two

weeks because it continues it takes a

while for there to be a lag there's a

lag until things start to improve now at

that stage we need to do three things

the first of which is obviously to try

and pull the feet down and that is the

key thing that everybody can help with

in terms of the social distancing and

let me be very straightforward if the

numbers are high enough with high enough

proportion of people choose to that do

coming for Sarah social distancing

there's a lot of evidence of huge

proportions of people are we don't know

yet whether it's enough that will cool

it down if they do not the second thing

we have to do NHS's

issue is to increase the number of beds

which are capable of taking whispering

patients because that's the big

bottleneck for this particular infection

so that's that's very important and then

the third thing you have to do is at the

moment all NHS staff who are getting

burned getting symptoms that are

compatible with this virus are quite

rightly so fascinating and isolating to

their families if they have a household

and that has taken people out of the

system

and the key thing we need to do is get

the testing out first priority was our

to use second priority all the people

who got symptoms but the next priority

for us is to get the NHS workers so you

can test them quickly and then if

they've got it

fine they continue but they know they've

married once but they've not lost it

then they can come back to work or if

the the reason they just ate at home is

because one else in their families got

symptoms we would test

and see if they've got it on PPE the the

there is O'Connor there's a local and a

global we steal this I completely

understand this is a obviously in the

supplies in there because well I'm on

the right ones and that needs to be

these four

this will be even so this is it thank

you

tikrit question as if I'm a and firstly

to the experts new data from the Centers

for Disease Control and Prevention shows

that nearly 40% of patients sick enough

to be hospitalized in the US for a to

2254 is there any concern that the

pandemic is affecting younger people in

the UK worse than previously thought

and secondly Prime Minister tiny

redundancies are sweeping the country an

Iranian police have said that government

is not doing enough to help struggling

businesses retain workers you've

mentioned that the Chancellor is going

to talk more about this tomorrow but do

you accept that every day you delay

announcing new support measures will

cost thousands of jobs to go well first

of all on that variable emily

understands that we will stick by

businesses this country is getting too

advanced economies that has the

company's remaining parts back well it's

absolutely

now originally say trust me saying more

tomorrow about the package were pretty

inflexible workers support everybody

through this difficult time you mean

talking that trade unions and others

today and I will stick by their beliefs

but is on the second question you asked

it's clear that there are three things

that probably people need to think about

simultaneously firstly the great

majority people to get this part

irrespective of age will recover from it

and most of those very important to make

that point first off because I think

that isn't keep fighting for people to

remember it's particularly it seems to

be true for children and white children

isn't on the whole to have this as a

milder disease that probably quite a lot

harder in those cases how the second

thing is it is also true that particular

groups of older people vulnerable people

medically vulnerable that do get this

more severely and if you look in the

data from China to look at the data from

Italy

and if you look at the data in the UK

most of the deaths occurring in those

groups but and this is the point that

the u.s. is making and I think is

important point to emphasize that is not

to say that there will not be severe

voices amongst people who are younger

adults and that is important because

it's important the people don't

this this is a significant issue for

everybody

although the great burden of disease

will tend to fall in terms of severe

disease in the more vulnerable groups

and that's why you're given very

specific advice to people who are over

70 or have pre-existing health

conditions that there will be people who

don't fall into those groups who will

fall seriously ill unfortunately the

great majority will not that's somewhere

and so we do ask people yes take this

seriously to yourself as well as taking

it seriously for all of society and as a

way of taking pressure off the NHS thank

you bar instead of just two just pick

one Australia you've you've quoted this

figure of 12 weeks to turn the tide into

the first time you've said that you

haven't really defined for as what the

tide means but crystals or Patrick might

be able to explain what that would look

like does that mean that we will be well

over this and we'll be returning to our

normal lives or does that mean that we

will just hit the peak and we'll be

started to go back to the other side

what does that actually is and the

moment proceed you know in a way that

does not seen yet to be responding to

our interventions

I believe the combination of measures

that were asking them to take and better

testing now I can't stand here and tell

you by the end of June that we will be

on a downward slope

but I can't City can't say that that's

that of course we don't know where we

are and we never heard of how long this

thing will go on what I can say is that

this is going to be finite and we will

know the type I can see how well

measures are in place should start

having an impact on the rate of growth

of the epidemic and those are

significant measures as we all know and

they're expecting to then delay and

break transmission training chains so

you expect the epidemic to come down and

the sooner we get that down the more

then we can move into phases as well

when we can test and trace and make sure

we keep on top of this and there's a

start of clinical trials first patient

enroll today

there's the staff of vaccine trials in

April expecting these are things which

all together start to tell us that we've

moved from a phase of it's growing and

we need to take these measures to try

and stop it growing so what we're saying

put a lid on it and begin to start

looking at what we do beyond that in

order to get into the right position so

I think that's where we need to get to

and that's the timescale

that's pretty much it

Simon done probably due to being

unnecessarily booster issue black things

I also need a want to strike that vector

today but I genuinely think this we buy

the combination of these two things we

will turn a to follow and then I will

start to see we will see the impact of

our testing programs on the new tests

that will start to see those making a

difference and that is what my message

to two companies is is really think very

carefully before you you start them off

you'll start you do want to stand mind

good companies we do want to make sure

that people recognize there's they stand

behind their start they should step

we ended up in the sky behind British

clubs and as I say you've got more about

how to speak fruit from the translator

in the air more tomorrow above all in

the news thank you all very much this is

probably each other in deference to the

virus I think that I think there may be

a moment when we started to do this

remotely but I hope you agreed that

however we do it is important that we

should continue to have these

discussions every day I do think they're

valued by blue be trying these as candid

as we possibly can about what is going

on I hope that you find useful so we may

have to fight through now find somewhere

getting them done in a way that doesn't

look very else as they're working were

not following the advice that we give

you get each other but I see you worried

about the most questions never pledged

that if we have to

more legible than interrogation I was

absolutely sure gets to ask questions in

my business area
