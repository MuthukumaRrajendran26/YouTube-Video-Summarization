is this now dry salt cake lakebed in

botswana the ancestral home to all of us

not far away our wetlands that bear some

resemblance to what existed tens of

thousands of years ago when early humans

began to flourish in this part of the

world

Vanessa Hays of the University of Sydney

and other researchers have tested DNA

from people descended in this region of

southern Africa they mapped both genetic

material and the geography climate and

archaeology to conclude that early

humans here didn't all stay here the

climate in southern Africa changes at a

hundred and thirty thousand years ago

and these early ancestors of owls

migrated out of this region so

essentially these ancestors were the

first human explorers the geological

evidence suggests in what is now

botswana a giant lake lake magadi Gatti

once existed as large as our five Great

Lakes about 200,000 years ago early

humans lived there for 70,000 years the

Earth's orbit and climate changed the

lake began to break up into massive

wetlands lush green corridors were

created to the northeast and southwest

and early migration patterns began to

the northeast farming was developed to

the southwest coastal foragers humans

were on the move it is the migration by

the ancestors of the people living in

this region today who are linked to the

more than 7 billion genetically diverse

people that now exist all over the world

other researchers are dubious they point

to fossils found in Morocco of the

earliest Homo sapiens dating further

back 300 thousand years and some critics

say the study in one region cannot fully

address the complexity of human

development and migration but the

University of Sydney team say other

findings may be from an extinct branch

of human history they suggest the homo

sapien lineages from southern africa are

still with us today for many the science

is a work in progress and the study of

the origin of the species is still
