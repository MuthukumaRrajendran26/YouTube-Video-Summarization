the NDP is making its last pitch to

Quebec in the hometown of Jack Layton

resurrecting the memory of the former

leader the legacy of Jack Layton is

being carried out by a wonderful

courageous compassionate leader the NDP

is up four points since the start of the

election when it faced the prospect of

being wiped out in Quebec we're not in

any fear of that happening we've got an

incredible team and a strong base in

2011 the orange wave took Quebec by

storm with Layton at the helm then in

2015 the Liberals managed to steal their

momentum but in 2019 Justin Trudeau

can't count on the same support in just

one day he's made stops in six Quebec

ridings

five of them held by the NDP the Liberal

leader omits the possibility of an

Andrew Shearer government and we know

there's lots more to do and that's what

we're focused on but every election is a

choice and I'm not taking any of

Canadians voices votes for granted the

bloc québécois has regained some

strength since the last federal election

with a Francois Blanc che at the helm

the BQ could take 30 seats and

potentially be a force in a minority

situation most leaders have decided to

be somewhat more aggressive against the

bloc québécois it might mean that we

have become again a significant player

in politics and this political scientist

believes the bloc's energy comes as the

NDP and liberals are experiencing some

misfortune in Quebec in Quebec the rise

of the bloc since the beginning of a

campaign has changed everything that

forced the Liberals to shake a lot of

hands the desperate situation that the

other Progressive Party can commiserate

with Quebec is Canada's second largest

province and seventy eight seats are up

for grabs with such a close race the

vote here counts more than ever
