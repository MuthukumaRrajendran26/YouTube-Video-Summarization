thank you very much bishop maya all the

members of the family and on a reason

bishop i thank you for many things but

especially for the decades of guidance

and genuine friendship you gave to

elijah it is true that almost things

actually 21 years ago he invited me to

new psalmist on the Sunday before the

election and I remember you know you I

love that you introduce the staff

because we'd all be dead without the

people are helping us but if your

present your staff is always trying to

tell you why you shouldn't do something

or you shouldn't go somewhere I remember

this too very well the same it's Tuesday

Sunday before the election why would you

go

I get why you want to go to an

african-american church but why would

you go to Baltimore I mean come on

there are so good to you they always

vote for you what would you go for

Elijah Cummings he's been in the house

15 minutes

he literally hadn't finished one term

yet I said I just got a feeling this is

something we ought to do and if we do it

we all know whether it was right or not

and so the bishop rolls out the red

carpet thousands of people were there

and you may remember we got in some

trouble didn't we we got in some trouble

they people criticized us

or having get-out-the-vote event in a

church instead it was inappropriate and

as I remember Elijah reminded people

that our constitutional rights including

the freedom of religion the freedom of

assembly the freedom of speech dependent

on people giving voice to them in

elections end of debate then I got to

listen to Elijah talk that day you talk

about a lousy deal it was I had to

follow both the bishop and the lives are

coming and at least I'm getting in ahead

of you and President Obama today I'm

just sooo

[Applause]

in my old age on the warm of fact I'm

glad to do it anyway Elijah was great

and he ended with his quiet and reasoned

and rhythmic voice growing into his

booming voice by quoting that wonderful

verse from the fortieth chapter of

Isaiah they wait upon the Lord will have

their strength renewed they will round

up through with wings as Eagles they

will run and gotta go weary they will

walk and think not he just kept doing

more and more the crowd was going crazy

over the course of these last few days

I've had a chance to think a lot about

Elijah's life he really did sort of

mirror Isaiah who had one of the

greatest one-liners in the history of

human affairs when the Lord asked whom

shall I send and who will go for me

Isaiah said here are my Lord send me

Elijah coming spent a whole life saying

send me an entire lifetime it's not even

a teenager when he hauled down to the

swimming pool and joins a group to

integrate it and for his trouble gets

banged on the head with a glass bottle

living in a lifetime scar which he bore

with honor and then the people of

Baltimore sent him to Annapolis and then

you senator Washington on behalf of the

rest of the nation I'd like to thank you

you did a good thing

and then I was looking over all the

things that he worked on just in the

four years we were together he was

elected the year I was re-elected in

1996 he had this amazing array of

interest but we all know now that at

least until certain things happen

his legacy is how ardently he honored

his oath to protect and defend the

Constitution of the United States

[Music]

I think he did it for a lot of reasons

he loved the fact that his parent

humbled wives made his a great American

story and he loved that it confirmed his

faith but he knew that without the

Constitution the laws that were passed

under it the rights are guaranteed by it

and the abuses it was designed to

prevent without that Constitution he

would not have been in Congress and so

he said to himself I am certain everyday

I will not let this promised be sullied

and he did his best and while doing his

best and fighting his heart out sticking

out for Hillary and lots of other people

many of whom were voiceless and weak and

will never be known while doing all that

he actually made and one of the most

partisan periods in our country's

history a lot of Republican friends why

did he do that how did he do that I

think he did it because everybody could

see he was a real deal he was doing what

he believed his heart was in it and I

think he did it because no matter how

hard he fought and how passionately he

argued he tried to treat everybody the

way he wanted to be treated the way he

thought America should be treated

[Music]

[Applause]

you know you can't run a free society if

you have to hate everybody you disagree

with I mean sooner or later if if you've

been married 45 years and both of you

were thinking you're gonna have a

disagreement or two sooner or later if

you're in a business or a team or in a

campaign and you're thinking you're

gonna have disagreements

he believed that he's to treat people

and what you wanted to be treated and he

believed if everybody accepted his broad

endearing inclusive definition of one

America where we respect our differences

and think what we have in common matters

more and we all live under the same set

of rules and we all believe that under

those rules those of us who have more

than we need should do more to help

those who don't have enough everything

would work out okay now that's what he

believed and being friends he was so

proud that he could help resolve the

personal spat between his Republican

congressional friend and new member of

the Democratic caucus but he believed so

here's what I want to leave you with

Elijah spent his working life in Richard

ition of Isaiah he went again and again

and again

but I think in his lasting legacy to us

we should think again about the prophet

Elijah for this reason he was about to

be killed for his ardent promotion of

his faith he hid in a cave either within

or next to Mount Sinai he received a

message from God to go up and stand on

top of the mountain and wait for the

voice of God to speak to him so look

he's already fair to hurt pretty hard

time just like at the end of Elijah's

life he's already had a pretty hard time

you got to go through this too so

there's a lot just standing on the

mountain and a huge wind came so strong

it roped the rocks of the mountain but

the Lord was not in the wind then an

earthquake came shaking everything but

the Lord was not any earthquake in the

fire but the Lord was not in the fire

and then what does the scripture say a

still small voice

[Applause]

Alijah by that point had gotten rid of

all the pomp all the circumstance all

the glory for the still small voice I

love this Lin I love every minute ever

spent with him every conversation we

ever had I loved his booming voice but

we should hear him now in the quiet

times at night and in the morning when

we need courage when we get discouraged

and we don't know if we can believe

anymore we should hear him but our

Elijah be for us what he himself heard

the still small voice it keeps us going

keeps us grateful keeps us happy and

keeps us moving thank you

[Applause]
