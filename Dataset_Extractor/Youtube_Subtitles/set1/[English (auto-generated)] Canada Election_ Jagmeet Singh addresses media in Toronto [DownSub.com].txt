hi there folks today of course we're in

Toronto I want to talk a little bit

about what's going on here in Ontario

for a long time people in Ontario have

felt the impacts decisions that were

made by governments that help those at

the very top made life easier for the

wealthy it made life harder for everyone

else people in Ontario remember when is

when premier win at the time promised

not to sell off public assets then sold

off Hydra want which surely benefit

people on Bay Street but made life a lot

harder for families as Hydra bills went

up and now with mr. Ford as as premier

he's making life even harder for people

he's slashing and painfully cutting the

services the families need we see the

impact directly on students in

classrooms with the cuts of 10,000

teachers and education workers we're

seeing cuts to housing with a hundred

and sixty million dollars less funding

for housing for affordable housing

particularly we're seeing cuts to health

care the funding for autistic kids this

has been painful and difficult now mr.

Trudeau and ask the question what he

would do he surely said a lot against

mr. Ford but when pushed on this at the

Toronto Star editorial meeting he said I

wouldn't do anything to to change the

decision made by a politician or a

premier who's making choices to hurt

families you know I'm not gonna

interfere either doesn't think it's his

job to do anything to stand up for

people

I believe we don't give up on anyone we

never give up on people he was pushed on

the fact that his national housing plan

resulted in a loophole that mr. Ford

drove a bulldozer through and cut 160

million dollars and again he had nothing

really to respond to that to deal with

that

in fact his housing plan is 90% less for

GDP than what mr. Harper spent so he is

not responding to the struggles that

people are facing here in Ontario people

are hurting because of cuts to health

care to education they can't find

housing and mr. Trudeau is nowhere to be

seen

and Mr Shearer is certainly not going to

make things better he's in fact probably

gonna make things worse

and so mr. Trudeau is not helping and

just sitting back and saying

the words nice words but no action mr.

shears probably gonna make things worse

what people need to know is they do not

have to settle for Less as mr. Trudeau

keeps on telling people you've got to

settle for Less he's gonna scare people

into voting for Trudeau voting for

liberals instead of conservatives I want

to say to people you do not have to

settle for Less you can settle for you

have to settle you can actually build a

better future where we invest in housing

we invest in health care we expand

include dental care and farming care for

all we can make a brighter future

possible we've got the ability if we

make the right choices we can do it I'm

confident and excited that people can

see New Democrats a real option to take

on the powerful in the wealthy and and

make life better for everyone else we're

not in it for the rich I don't work for

the powerful I work for people

I want to make their lives better no see

you see questions yes we got it my man's

gonna call it out right here but

everyone's gonna have the question

yes I do I looked at that decision and

the court ruling was that the current

criteria are true restricted to limited

and I believe that that's correct people

should have the ability to make a very

difficult choice but a very important

choice and to die with dignity is an

important choice that people should be

able to make and there needs to be

criteria that reflect the importance of

this decision given that Court decision

there is certainly a lot of concerns

around the restrictions and the

limitations on access to this decision

and I want to ensure that people are

able to make that choice

but there's protections in place for the

vulnerable but absolutely I think that

given that Court decision and given a

lot of concerns I've heard we did we

definitely need to look at limiting or

removing some of the restrictions we

don't play like this is you do cool to

[Music]

you know for me I mean it's something

that I faced my whole life so it's not

something that I'm surprised by in that

case I think the guy was trying to be

friendly but you know that's that's not

that's the thing with when people say

mean things then they don't always

intend for it to be mean but it's

hurtful and a lot of Canadian space at

all the time

casual comments that to mean people

because of their gender their sexuality

the color of their skin their spiritual

beliefs that happens all too often

and I want to send a clear message to

Canadians who've been told to change who

they are just to fit in or to get ahead

I want people to believe be who they are

to believe in yourself to love yourself

and to celebrate who you are because

everyone should belong and I want to

build a world where everyone belongs we

well I mean kind of speaks to the

weakness of someone's argument if

they're trying to appeal to have people

vote for them based on the way they look

we're in 2019 I hope people aren't gonna

vote based on the way someone looks but

they're gonna vote for someone based on

what they believe in what they care

about and how they're gonna make your

life better I think that the notion that

people should vote on what you look like

it has no place in 2019 I hope it

doesn't at least and I am hoping the

people vote based on what's gonna

benefit the planet what's going to

benefit their kids what's gonna benefit

their lives and a government that's not

gonna make choices that benefit those at

the very top as we've seen liberals and

conservatives do but make choices make

make choose a government's gonna make

choices that benefit people that put

people first and put people at the heart

of every decision they make

well we're trying to be very very

careful with that it's very important to

me not to to create more of a carbon

footprint then we can and so we've made

decisions like staying in in one place

for longer we didn't fly back to

Montreal when we could have to be at the

climate crisis thinking that flying

across Canada to join a climate rally in

Montreal wouldn't be the best way to

show that we support fighting against a

climate crisis so we've been making very

prudent decisions around the way we move

around the country and we are absolutely

committed to buying carbon offsets

that's a part of our our commitment we

want to make sure that our commitments

are in line with our eye I can give you

the details on that but it's a

commitment that we made

come up

you need to buy any of it

kibosh yes

the question was about Mr Shearer asking

you heard the question I'm assuming yeah

and so I think it you know the fact that

he said it today but it didn't say

during a debate when asked the question

directly certainly shows a lack of

courage

so there are provisions they're just

simply completely unforced of

unenforceable that's that's my problem

not the fact that they don't exist

there's certainly there there are

provisions but what's the point of

having provisions on labor rights having

provisions on the environment when

there's no enforce ability that's to me

meaningless I mean that they can they're

just lip service which is exactly what

mr. Trudeau and the Liberal government

I've been doing is saying a lot of nice

things I don't deny that they say nice

things I don't deny that there's nice

words but if those words aren't

enforceable what benefit does that have

to the environment what benefit that

does that have to workers I would ensure

that if we put protections in place they

should be enforceable otherwise what is

the point of just simply having pretty

words that is exactly my criticism of

this government the fact that Mr Shearer

Phelan has pointed that out it's just

highlighting my exact criticism of a

government that thinks that saying

pretty words is good enough it's not

well there's there's a whole host of

mechanisms we can have enforcement which

requires that the protections are

brought before international laws that

they are there's accountability measures

put in place that there are penalties in

place if they're not followed

enforcement means making sure we use all

the tools available to hold to account

any breach in the rights whether it's

workers rights or in the environmental

rights without any accountability

without any enforceability what is the

point of any law laws are meaningless

unless is enforceability

so I think first of all we're gonna take

a huge step back the liberals talk a lot

of talk they're not gonna do anything

they promise a whole bunch of things in

2015 I don't think anyone takes to any

of their promises seriously they

literally repeatedly promise to make

sure they're the wealthiest pay their

fair share

statistics Canada in 2017 while mr.

Trudeau is government made it clear that

the 1% paid less taxes and earned more

wealth they are not going to do anything

about taxing the wealthiest they've not

talked about offshore tax havens which

is a massive part of our plan they've

not talked about asking the wealthiest

to pay more their plans are actually

making the wealthiest pay less and

increasing the wealth increasing the

income gap so I don't take with any

credibility their offers mr. Trudeau has

no credibility on this point our plan to

put a tax on the super wealthy is based

on a number of metrics one they're the

strict enforcement it would require self

reporting there's lots of information we

have already publicly available about

wealth and net wealth of various people

we would use all the tools available

that our CRA has to ensure that those

who have wealth of over 20 million pay

one percent on their wealth over 20

million this is a real measure that's

gonna generate 70 billion dollars

according to the PBO over a number of

years this is a massive way to increase

revenue but we're also talking about

closing tax loopholes on CEOs somebody

that mr. Trudeau promised in 2015 four

years later is not delivered again and

again we see mr. Trudeau says a lot of

nice things during any campaign but has

no credibility when it comes to making

sure

Joyce's are made to benefit people

rather than the wealthiest

I also want to be Gilly it's not just me

I mean Canadians don't have any trust

that mr. Trudeau's gonna follow through

on what he promises many Canadians have

come to me said you know what we were

really hopeful about mr. Trudeau we

thought he'd be great but he's broken so

many commitments that he mean to

Canadians whether its electoral reform

whether it's defending the environment

than buying a pipeline whether it's

saying that he's gonna help out

Canadians and give me 14 billion dollars

away in the last fall economic statement

to the richest corporations while

spending 19 percent less than the harper

government on housing again and again

he's broken people's committed the third

their hopes and made people less and

last more and more cynical i'm hoping to

replace that with some real concrete

commitment to making people's lives

better but the idea of looking at luxury

goods i think is more of a distraction

when we can look at offshore tax havens

which is twenty three billion dollars

that's what we need to focus in on when

we can look at CU a stock option

loopholes which would have come for

about a billion dollars of revenue when

we look at our plan which would result

in seventy billion dollars of revenue

according to the Parliamentary Budget

Office

those are real plans to ensure that the

wealthiest pay their fair share

so it's made it harder absolutely

because mr. Trudeau made those

concessions that are gonna drive up the

cost of medication that was a wrong

decision to make that was a concession

that was a worker a worse deal than

before it did not develop a better deal

not only did drug prices go up but

there's also gaps in the supply

management which heard farmers and there

was also a lack of protection on

environment and labor rights but what I

would do differently in terms of how I

could bring down the price of medication

is a universal Pharma care program that

is the way we bring down their cost of

medication in fact we make it free we

use the buying power of our entire

nation our plan is exactly that and we

put up ten billion dollars at the

federal level and we deliver a universal

Pharma care program which means that

everyone in our country can get access

to medication if you need medication or

in our country with our plan you'd use

your health card not your credit card

and that's the way we need to go that's

what all experts are saying we need to

go in fact the Liberals own committee

that was struck on studying this

question said the way to go is a

universal national single-payer public

pharmacare for all that's exactly what

we're delivering we're gonna do it in

one year

well the first thing that we were doing

what we're making very clear is there's

no rush to ratify this deal particularly

when right now in the states Democrats

are working to make those protections

that are there just in words make them

enforceable and so that would be the

first step to ensure that the

protections for workers and the

protections for the environment are

actually enforceable once that's

achieved then we can look at what other

things can be done but I certainly would

not be rushing to ratify a deal that is

not going to protect workers and make

things harder instead of easier yes

I mean that's one we've got to look at

it's a real concern that people are now

raising given them the massive

difference in prices between the states

in Canada with things like insulin and

that's come up recently

I think our commitment first and

foremost has to be to building a

universal farming care program so that

the millions of Canadians who can't

afford medication have access to

medication that's our first priority and

then we should do what we can to ensure

that there is no risk of that supply for

Canadians we can take those steps but

the first step is to ensure right now

there's millions of Canadians they can't

afford their medication and I've met

those people I've met seniors I've met

families that do not take the medication

they need life-saving medication because

they cannot afford it that is my first

commitment my first priority is to make

sure they get that medication and then

we'll look at other issues as they arise

and how we can solve them

my goal is this I can tell you my values

my goal is to make sure Canadians have

access to medication if there's anything

that creates a problem in that access I

would look at solutions for that but I

know that the first thing is let's not

get the the cart before the horse the

first problem is right now as we stand

here as I stand here on this day there's

millions of Canadians millions of

Canadians that cannot afford the

medication they need that's my first

commitment to make sure they get it and

the second thing if there's any concern

around accessing that supply I'll look

at solutions hi

awesome

thank you for the question students are

having it really tough right now

particularly with the recent cuts

brought in by mr. Ford - oh stop this

made it even harder for a lot of

students to get access to their

education so what I propose are a couple

of measures to help our students who are

struggling right now young people

shouldn't be worried they should be

hopeful and right now they're afraid for

the future so what I want to do first

off is for students that are right now

living with student debt that are

feeling the crushing weight of student

debt what mr. Trudeau has done over the

past four years has charged students

prime plus three percent interest on

their debt that means over the past four

years the Liberal government has

profited off of student debt to the tune

of three billion dollars and just to

give you a contrast of choices while

they profited to the tune of three

billion dollars off of students

mr. Trudeau forgave six billion dollars

in corporate loans just last year alone

that to me is completely wrong that is

such a wrong decision to make what I

would use immediately remove the

interest off of federal loans to give

students some relief the second step is

I would replace loans with grants and

increase access to Grants and ultimately

what I want to do is see a future where

there's no there's no barriers between

kindergarten and career the kids can go

and get their education without any

barriers and that means free tuition so

those are the steps that I'd work on to

achieving that
