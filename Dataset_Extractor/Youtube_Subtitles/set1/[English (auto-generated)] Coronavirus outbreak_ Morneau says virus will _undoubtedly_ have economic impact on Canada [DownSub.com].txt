now we're looking at a enormous

challenge in China with the coronavirus

I know it has all of us paying very

close attention certainly we are paying

very close attention in Ottawa what I

can tell you is that the health risk

remains low and that the health

authorities in British Columbia and

Ontario and in Ottawa and people here in

Alberta are working together well to

make sure we have protocols in place I

think we always need to recognize those

people who are doing a good job for our

country and for our health but I I do

want to acknowledge that the virus is

undoubtedly going to have an economic

impact I'm also sure that it'll be a

central topic of the meetings that I'm

going to next week next week I'm going

to the g20 finance ministers and central

bank governors meetings in Riyadh where

we'll be talking about the global

economy and the challenges certainly one

of the things that we will be focused on

will be the overall state of our economy

globally one of the most important

issues we'll be talking about will be

trade and the rising impact of

protectionism which we're seeing around

the world I want to tell you that from

our perspective we will be advocating

for rules based trade Canada is a

trading nation

we're the only g7 country with trade

agreements with all other g7 countries

and we know that advocating for

rules-based trading is critically

important for businesses for businesses

to invest and create jobs they need to

have confidence in the system

you can't take a leap of faith if you

don't have faith in the rules that

you're taking that leap in and around

the new NAFTA is making its way through

Parliament and we're confident that it

will be approved I want to just call out

premier Kenny and other premiers who

were in Washington last week advocating

for the fast approval of this any of you

talking to your members of parliament it

would be very helpful if you and

reinforced the importance of moving

forward on this rapidly for the

confidence of our economy and for our

business sector

I'll also be talking to international

partners about the importance of having

rules that work for everyone

we're focused on making sure that

international tech giants play by the

same tax rules as other companies we

don't want to give an advantage to

international companies that isn't the

same advantage for Canadian companies

and we're gonna continue to push in that

regard but as I said I'm sure that

coronavirus will be an area of focus we

can't know what the economic impacts are

right now Bloomberg came out recently

with an estimate that it would impact

the global economy by about 0.4 percent

in 2020 and thinking about 0.4 percent

we need to keep that in the context of

an economy globally that's growing at

around 3 percent so it's a significant

impact we also know that the impacts on

Canada will be real impacts on tourism

impacts on the oil sector and of course

impacts on supply chain for any business

that has a supply chain that is

integrated with Chinese producers or or

Chinese consumers even from that

standpoint oil fight prices have fallen

by about 15 percent during this this

crisis as a result of reduced demand and

of course we have many many fewer

flights going in and out of China so we

know the impact is real it's going to be

felt across the country but perhaps even

more so here in in the oil and gas

sector so in that context it's important

that we consider the state of the

Canadian economy to provide information

on how we're going to do right now the

Canadian economy remains strong as we do

our our budget projections we go out to

private sector economists and 14 out of

14 economists that we survey have

projected growth for our economy in 2020

as I think you know we've seen

significant job growth across the

country since 2015 with about 1.1

million jobs having been created during

that time period and overall our

economy's in a strong position our debt

as a function of our GNP is a is in a

very positive situation we have the

lowest level of debt as

of our economy among g7 countries it

really is the envy of other countries

we're projected to be the second fastest

growing economy in the g7 this year but

I will tell you that globally volatility

remains the key risk and obviously

that's been illustrated vividly over the

past couple of months so we know that we

need to be financially responsible as we

ensure that we have the capability and

the resiliency to deal with any

challenges that come our way

challenges that we might not be able to

see right now it's important that we're

prepared for this and I can tell you

that this will be an important guide for

us in this mandate of the government
