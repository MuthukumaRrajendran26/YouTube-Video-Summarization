baura full moon it is great to be back

in Northern Ontario joined by our strong

liberal team of course you all know Paul

LaFave he's a passionate community

leader and he'll continue to be a strong

voice for Sudbury in Ottawa for the

years ahead

BC 5 this morning I was able to do a

little canoeing on Lake Laurentian with

some local kids anytime I get out for a

paddle I'm reminded of just how

beautiful Canada is I say it all the

time but we really do live in the best

country in the world nature from our

gorgeous lakes to our towering mountains

is a huge part of Canadian identity

it makes us who we are Canadians get the

importance of preserving our environment

for our kids and grandkids too many

conservative politicians don't here in

Ontario you've seen firsthand what

happens when the Conservatives give up

on the environment Doug Ford fired

Ontario's chief scientist he got rid of

Ontario's cap-and-trade program which

funded energy efficiency initiatives for

homeowners renters and businesses he cut

funding for flood management programs by

50% and he cancelled a program to plant

50 million trees forcing our Liberal

government to step in to save it well we

shouldn't be surprised because that's

just what conservative politicians do

they cut taxes for the wealthy and the

big polluters and cut services for

everybody else and now Andrew Shearer

who's vowed that his first act as Prime

Minister would be to make pollution free

again wants you to double down on

conservative politicians twice the tax

breaks for big polluters and the wealthy

and twice the cuts for you and your

family while Doug Ford focuses on a buck

a beer

there are grade 12 stew

that might not graduate this year

because there aren't enough teachers to

offer courses they need Doug Ford cut

Ontario's Pharma care program a program

that was focused on helping our most

vulnerable kids and young adults think

about that for a second

cuts to the environment to education to

health care ontario can't afford to

double down on the conservatives

liberals are for moving forward for you

and for your family and that includes

protecting our environment and fighting

climate change when we were elected in

2015 about one percent of Canada's

oceans and coastlines were protected now

just four years later that number is at

almost 14 percent our government

invested 1.35 billion dollars to protect

Canada's land and freshwater the largest

nature conservation investment in our

history in the last four years we've

conserved land equal to three and a half

times the size of Nova Scotia and

created the largest national urban park

in North America we've also worked in

close partnership with indigenous

peoples in our conservation efforts

young people newcomers and families who

has to offer

now the people in this beautiful part of

the country know firsthand how great it

is to spend your weekends camping the

joy of roasting marshmallows with the

kids are jumping into the lake on a hot

summer day you just can't beat it but

not all Canadians are so lucky and we

want to change that that's why a

reelected Liberal government will expand

the learn to camp program so that by the

time they reach grade 8 all Canadian

kids will have had the opportunity to

experience camping and learn important

outdoor skills we'll also create a

national experience Canada program so

that each year 75,000 kids who qualify

will get to enjoy up to a four-day

adventure with their families in one of

Canada's national or provincial parks

because we have listened to the

courageous voices of our youth who are

demanding that their governments take

bold action to protect our nature for

future generations now we know that we

raise environmental champions by helping

the next generation experience Canada's

natural beauty firsthand my friends a

new Liberal government will continue

down the path of conservation and

environmental protection because we know

the best way to serve Canadians is to

make life more affordable today and plan

ambitiously for tomorrow our team will

increase access to before and after

school

care will make sure every Canadian has

access to a family doctor to mental

health services and to national

pharmacare will ensure that all

Canadians can take paid family leave

beaucoup

don't

every public history when we took office

in 2015 only one percent of Canada's

coastal and ocean areas were protected

we engaged with provinces with

territories with municipalities with

indigenous communities and we went from

1% protection to 14% protection in just

four years we know that not only can we

protect 25 percent of our land and 25

percent of our oceans by 2025 but we

must it is an essential part not just of

protecting biodiversity not just a

fighting climate change but of also

ensuring that future generations have

the opportunities that we've had growing

up and the economic opportunities that

come with biodiversity and better

investments in ecotourism and tourism in

general we know that this is the path

forward for Canada and that's why we're

going to do the original plan was to

protect 10% of our coastal areas and

oceans and we are past that at 14% in

four years and you're right the goal was

to do that by 2020 so we're one year

ahead of schedule and protecting our

oceans in regards to land we are on

track to protecting 17 percent by the

end of next year on schedule because we

know that protecting our nature

protecting our land for future

generation protecting our waters in

partner

with indigenous peoples is about

fighting climate change and it's about

level in your conversation with even a

I've had many great conversations with

all members of our caucus and all of our

MPs I had many good conversations with

madam Nassif but I respect the choice

and the decision made by our independent

greenlight committee that follows the

rules laid out by the Liberal Party and

assesses whether people are qualified to

be candidates for us in this election -

another story a PTAs investigation says

48 indigenous children died under your

watch and the time it took your

government to make necessary changes in

funding what accountability do you hold

for that we know that there is so much

more to do on reconciliation we know

that this is something that Canadians

expect and something we have worked on

very very hard over the past four years

we've closed the gap on a k-12 education

in First Nations communities now

indigenous kids get the same level of

funding as kids in the provincial system

we've eliminated 87 long-term boil water

advisories and we're on track to lifting

all the 50 some-odd that remain on time

we're continuing to move forward with

investments in health care and mental

health in community supports and

economic opportunities in infrastructure

and programs for young people we know

that there are still far too many

tragedies ongoing and indigenous

communities and that's why we must do

more

that's why we've committed to doing more

last night I made an announcement that

commits to working with indigenous

communities on guaranteeing quality

health care for indigenous peoples right

across the country moving forward on

closing the gap on infrastructure right

across the country we recognize that

there is much more to do and we will

keep doing it

last night in Thunder Bay you mentioned

duck for by name five times

Steve Harbor once and Adam sure not once

a certain point you understand the

strategy here but a certain point

are you not misleading voters by

campaigning you know who mislead voters

Doug Ford said he was for the people

then turned around and cut services for

everyone while cutting taxes for the

wealthiest and Andrew Shearer is putting

forward exactly the same vision that

Stephen Harper lost on in 2015 because

Canadians made a different choice and

Andrew Shearer wants us to double down

on the kinds of conservative leadership

that we see from the Rocky Mountains to

the Bay of Fundy that is fighting

against action on climate change and

this week Canadians and our kids are

asking a lot of questions about climate

change having great conversations about

how we're going to protect our

environment so I have a question for

Andrew Shearer will he commit to banning

single-use plastics that's something he

hasn't answered yet and I think

Canadians want to hear that there has

been an extraordinary amount of

mobilization by young people and by

Canadians across this country and indeed

around the world calling for real action

on climate change we have done a lot

over the past four years we brought in a

price on pollution right across the

country we move forward on banning

single-use plastics and and Russia or

still has to say whether or not he will

ban single-use plastics we're phasing

out coal we're investing in zero

emission vehicles we're moving forward

on protecting more of our nature

including with these ambitious

announcements today so I look forward to

marching with thousands of Canadians

tomorrow in Montreal like people are

marching right across the country and

around the world to fight for the

environment

we know that the choice is clear in this

election the Conservatives are running

against climate action they don't think

you need to do anything to fight climate

change and not only is that not going to

protect our environment that is not

going to protect our kids future

including their jobs it is time for

conservatives to understand that the

world is demanding climate leadership we

get that they don't and we will continue

controversy people talked about how that

eroded trust after the black faced

controversy you said you need to earn

between now and Election Day

concretely that would prove to Canadians

that you were someone who is trustworthy

I'm gonna continue to focus on the

things that Canadians care most about

Canadians yes care about fighting

against intolerance and racism and I

will keep standing up against

intolerance every single day but I will

also talk about how we're investing in

families investing in the middle class

instead of giving tax breaks to

millionaires the way Andrew Scheer keeps

proposing we're gonna stand against the

cuts the conservative premiers are

making across the country on

environmental protections and we're

gonna keep fighting them in court to

prevent them from making pollution free

again we are going to continue to focus

on the future of this country the way

Canadians expect their leaders to and

I'm going to continue to fight every day

for better opportunities for all

Canadians that's what this election is

about that's at the heart of the choice

people are making so how do you

reconcile that we inherited targets from

the Conservatives that they have done

absolutely nothing on and in four years

we've reached three-quarters of the way

to meeting those targets over the next

11 years Canada will meet and indeed

surpass our 2030 targets but we know we

need to do more and that's why we've put

forward concrete initiatives from

cutting taxes in half for innovative

companies that create zero emission

technologies to supporting Canadians

with more money up front so they can

retrofit their homes improve their

energy efficiency and save money every

single year today we're announcing that

we're protecting more of our nature

encouraging young people to be and

empowering young people and families to

get out and discover it even more so

they continue to fight for a better

future in a protected environment and we

know the protecting ecosystems and

conserving nature is a key element in

fighting against climate change we have

continued to move forward in meaningful

ways to reduce emissions and we know

there's much more to do but as I said in

2015 people said the same thing how are

you going to protect 10% of our oceans

and coastlines there's only one percent

protected now how are you possibly going

to do that well not only did we meet

that goal in four years instead of five

but we surpassed it to fourteen percent

the reason with the way we were able to

do it is because we made a commitment to

Canadians

and we kept that commitment the

commitment we make today to protect

twenty five percent of our oceans and

coastlines and twenty-five percent of

our land areas by 2025 is not just an

ambitious target it's a necessary target

to be able to protect the future of

young Canadians

I think some of the consequences of the

populist tendencies that we've seen over

the past few years in places like the UK

and the United States are clearly on

display for Canadians right now what we

put forward as a plan in 2015 and an

approach that we continue with is not

exacerbating fears or amplifying

concerns and anxieties but a laying them

with a real plan to fight climate change

to make life more affordable for

Canadians to reduce crime by

strengthening gun control when the

reality is our opponents want to lower

taxes for the wealthiest want to do

nothing to fight climate change

I want to weaken gun control this is the

choice that Canadians are facing and

seeing the consequences of the politics

of division and fear elsewhere around

the world should both make them proud to

be Canadian where we make different

choices and remind them of the

importance of the choice we are making

in this election do we go back to the

politics of division and fear and the

politics of the Harper years with Andrew

sheers plan or do we continue to choose

to say that you know we sell a lot of

sincere efforts and either one of those

files and I just wonder why Canadians

should believe you're being sincere this

time when you make certain promises

we made a commitment to grow the economy

by investing in Canadians and that's

exactly what we did we invested in

communities we invested in

infrastructure we invested in the middle

class and people working hard to join it

and the results speak for themselves

Canadians created over a million new

jobs most of them full-time over the

past four years while at the same time

we were able to lift 900,000 people out

of poverty including 300,000 kids we've

moved forward on some of the most

ambitious results ever in protecting our

environment by any government in

Canadian history by moving forward on

reconciliation in ways that are

meaningful tangible and are showing

results for indigenous peoples right

across the country in true partnership

and we've done so in a way that

continues to be fiscally responsible our

debt as a share of our gross domestic

product will continue to decrease every

single year under the liberal plan but

again if you choose not to take our word

for it that we're fiscally responsible

you just need to look at the independent

bonds and credit rating agencies around

the world like Moody's and S&P who've

granted only 11 countries their top tier

triple-a rating for their fiscal

sustainability and fiscal responsibility

and our government and Canada is one of

them we know that the choice Canadians

made in 2015 was the right one when

faced with a choice between

conservatives proposing cuts and

austerity as a way of creating growth or

our choice that was investing in

communities and in the middle class

Canadians chose investment and four

years later we have tremendous growth

and results to show for it

and that's once again the choice that

Canadians are facing the Conservatives

are proposing cuts and austerity we are

proposing investment because it's what's

working to help Canadians

it's what's working to grow the economy

and it's working to build a better

future for everyone yes you can

before the spring of 2021 deadline and

it's of course an important target in

and of itself to make sure that

everywhere

across the country you can drink safe

water from your taps but it's also a

commitment that involves investments in

education and training in infrastructure

in indigenous communities that are so

necessary and connected to it that's why

we are pleased that we are on track to

lift them all but we recognize that

there is always more work to do with

indigenous peoples on the path to

reconciliation and economic opportunity

for all yes it will go too long thank

you all
