[Music]

standby standby standby standby

just coming out

and it's just been thank you for coming

there's no pasaran the assistant

commissioners

I can confirm that at approximately 2:00

p.m. today Friday the 29th of November

police were called to a stabbing at a

premises near to London Bridge EC one

emergency services attended including

officers from the City of London Police

and the Metropolitan Police

a male suspect was shot by specialist

armed officers from the City of London

police and I can confirm that this

suspect died at the scene

a number of other people received

injuries during this incident as soon as

we can provide further updates on their

condition we will now have felt

sympathies go out to everybody who's

been involved in this and is anxiously

waiting for information on their loved

ones as soon as we can get that

information we will get it to you as you

would expect due to the nature of the

incident we responded as though this was

terrorist related I'm now in a position

to confirm that it has been declared a

terrorist incident we are working

jointly with the city of London police

as we continue to respond officers from

the Metz counterterrorism command are

now leading this investigation but I

must stress we retain an open mind as to

any motive it would be inappropriate to

speculate further at this time

due to reports that the suspect may have

had an explosive device specialist

officers also attended the same and wide

Corden's are in place to ensure there

remains no further danger to the public

however I can confirm at this time we

believe a device that was strapped to

the body of the suspect is a host of

explosive device officers continue to

carry out particular searches in the

area to ensure there is no outstanding

threat to the public those extensive

Cortlandt will remain in place for a

considerable time and I would ask the

public police continue to avoid the area

public safety is obviously our top

priority we will be enhancing police

patrols within the city and across

London I would ask anyone that

information image will footage of the

incident that can be shared with our

investigation team to do so on the UK

police image appeal website I would also

ask the public to continue to remain

vigilant and report any concerns that

they have to

I know I ordinarily take questions I'm

not going to take questions at this time

the Prime Minister has asked for a

personal briefing are we heading

- tell me straight immediately

we will update you again everything

yep

yes he's not here at them

you
