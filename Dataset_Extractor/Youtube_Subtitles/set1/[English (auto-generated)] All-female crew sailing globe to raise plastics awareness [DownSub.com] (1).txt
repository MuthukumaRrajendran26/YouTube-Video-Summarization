in the space of a century humans have

turned our pristine oceans into a broth

of plastic pollution and if nothing

changes the high seas will become a

thick plastic soup affecting sea life

the food chain and us and then really

being able to link chemicals in our

bodies to specific disease or bad health

Emily Penn says that's particularly true

for women's health issues that's why she

co-founded the all-female X expedition

voyages five years ago their latest trip

is a 30 leg journey to circle the globe

it will pass through four of the world's

five main ocean gyres where tons of

plastic can gather in huge garbage

patches the crews will collect samples

from these remote areas of ocean and

what they once were when somebody use

them when ashore they will speak to

local communities and governments and

they'll survey shorelines what we find

our microplastics

obviously cigarette butts strut plastic

straws a lollipop sticks fishing line

Canadian crewmember and Jenkins has been

organizing beach cleanups for years

she's sailing the first leg part of a

crew with a diverse set of skills last

number I heard is that there was

something of upwards of 10,000

applicants and only 300 women will be

chosen from around the world so

something I'm doing must resonate with

the decision making team and while some

innovators are looking at ways to clean

up the oceans this voyage is all about

long-term solutions we really need to

understand what type of plastic is being

mismanaged and ending up in our

environment and therefore how do we stop

that on land in the meantime back on

land an important part of the solution

lies in the everyday choices many of us

make when it comes to plastics Redman
