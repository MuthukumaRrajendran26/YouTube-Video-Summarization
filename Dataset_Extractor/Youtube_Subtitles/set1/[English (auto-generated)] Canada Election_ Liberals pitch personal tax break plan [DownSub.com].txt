it's not news but Canadians pay dearly

for their cellphones today Justin

Trudeau announced a reelected Liberal

government would slash those cellphone

bills by 25% within four years here's

how Trudeau claims that will work we are

going to engage with companies so that

they reduced by 25% they're built their

fees over the next 22 years and we will

strengthen and bring in further

competition into the market if they are

unable to achieve that the Liberals will

try and convince telecoms to lower bills

and if that doesn't work after two years

the Liberals would change some rules to

let more and smaller players in

something those big telecoms won't like

if that works Trudeau says this would

save the average family a thousand

dollars a year now this was a two-part

announcement Trudeau is also promising

to change the personal tax exemption

limit currently Canadians don't pay tax

on the first $12,000 they make that's

the 2019 federal personal exemption a

Liberal government would phase in an

increase to 15,000 by 2023 that rate is

linked to inflation but they say this

would still give a $2,000 boost over

inflation this is targeted at the middle

class anyone making up to a hundred and

forty seven thousand dollars a year but

if you make between a hundred and forty

seven and two hundred and ten thousand

dollars a year you'll still get some of

the tax break that was promised today

the Liberals say this will cost 5.6

billion dollars by the time it's all

phased in our plan lowers taxes the most

for people who make less gives the

middle class some breathing room and

ensures that the wealthy don't get an

extra hand up it has been four days

since the blackface story broke these

two policy announcements clearly an

attempt to change the channel a

strategic location here in Brampton

Ontario this is part of the key Greater

Toronto battleground ridings known as

the 905 a fight between liberals and

conservatives Brampton is interesting

there are five ridings here and it could

be a three-way fight all five elected

liberals in 2015 but new Democrat leader
