thank you very much for joining me here

today as I unveil our platform my plan

to help you get ahead and unlike Justin

Trudeau's so-called plan this has been

fully costed by the Parliamentary Budget

Officer this is a fully costed platform

with all the numbers now throughout this

campaign and thro my travels I've been

constantly reminded that Canadians are

truly the most fortunate people in the

world we are the keepers of a proud

history we have fought and help to

defeat forces of tyranny and help to

bring peace around the world we are the

protectors of a rich democracy one

rooted in a commitment to pluralism

personal freedom and individual

responsibility we are the stewards of

breathtaking natural beauty right here

on the Pacific to the Arctic to the

Atlantic I believe Canada's potential is

as fast as the distance between our

shores I believe our best days yet are

still ahead but we have to change of

course now

four years ago Justin Trudeau came to

office on a promise sunny ways and

positive politics he spoke of his

hopeful vision for the future but it

didn't take long for his professed

optimism to give way to outright

cynicism for his commitment to unity to

dissolve into divisiveness the last four

years have clearly demonstrated the

Justin Trudeau is not as advertised he

said he would be accountable and ethical

instead he has used the power of his

office to reward his supporters and

punish his critics he said he would help

the middle class instead he raised taxes

on 80% of middle-class Canadians and

imposed a carbon tax that's making

everyday life more expensive he said he

would balance the budget instead he's

running massive deficits that threaten

higher taxes and importance of social

programs like health care under Justin

Trudeau canes are working harder and

harder but they're just not getting

ahead and I hear it everywhere I go

everything is getting more and more

expensive there's less and less money

left at the end of the month your goals

are getting further out of reach and

you're falling further and further

behind what I'm here today to say that

better days are coming and that on

October 21st you'll have the chance to

end Justin Trudeau's cover-ups deficits

and tax hikes and elect a Conservative

government that will finally help you

get ahead throughout the campaign I have

announced several new ways my government

will lower taxes and put more money in

the pockets of Canadians and today I

want to highlight what that will mean

for three different families many

Canadians will be able to relate to

consider the example of a retired couple

living right here in to Wasson

under our conservative plan they will

get two thousand five hundred and eighty

dollars back in their pocket every year

to help them get ahead who example

identify me the Catholic Yentl sake I'm

okay yeah and I fainted any a Nouveau

Googler mom conservator or have they

meet Catalunya this song cannot do that

a dance a posh

or the example of a family of four soon

to be five in Montreal a new

Conservative government will put four

thousand six hundred and forty two

dollars back into their pockets and one

final example family of four in marker

each year this family will have three

thousand two hundred and sixty four

dollars more to put towards its future

we're the only party with a plan focused

on you and on your needs we're going to

start by scrapping the Trudeau carbon

tax that is making everyday essentials

more expensive for Canadian families

Justin Trudeau is re-elected gasoline is

going to go up thirty one cents a litre

well the average costs of natural gas

for Canadian household is going to

increase by four hundred and sixty nine

dollars a new Conservative government

will also introduce the universal tax

cut saving a couple earning average

salaries eight hundred and fifty dollars

we'll take the GST off of home heating

costs saving your family over $100 a

year we will introduce the green public

transit tax credit saving a family of

four who take transit up to a thousand

dollars will make maternity benefits

tax-free putting up to four thousand two

hundred and fifteen dollars back in the

pockets new parents will introduce the

children's fitness tax credit allowing

parents to claim up to a thousand

dollars for sports activities we'll also

introduce the children's arts and

learning tax credit letting parents

claim up to five hundred dollars for

arts and learning programs we will

expand the aged credit benefiting the

lowest income Canadians the most and

giving a senior couple up to three

hundred dollars back will boost

government matching to re SPS by fifty

percent

helping parents get more for their kids

education and will introduce the green

home renovation Tax Credit putting up to

three thousand eight hundred dollars

back in their pockets in the pockets of

families doing their bit to fight

climate change by making their homes

more energy-efficient still alive pass a

other hand has spent this campaign

telling Canadians how great everything

is going and perhaps in his world it is

I have no doubt that people who have

never had to worry about money aren't

concerned over the high price of

gasoline or the utility bill or their

mortgage rate but I'm here for the

people who just need a break the people

who are doing everything right going to

university getting a good job working

hard paying their bills on time but who

still can't seem to get ahead in life

whose hopes and dreams keep getting

further and further away the parents who

sit around the dinner table like mine

often did in a townhouse in South Ottawa

stressing over how they will make it to

the end of the month our conservative

platform is full of real concrete

measures that will help Canadian

families save and plan for the future

and I'm like Justin Trudeau we know how

much it will cost and where the money is

going to come from our platform has been

verified by dr. Jackman's president's

fellow at the University of Calgary

School of Public Policy who says this

fiscal plan is reasonably estimated

resulting in a budgetary balance in five

years our goal this election is clear a

new Conservative government that

empowers Canadians to build a brighter

future this in itself is a worthy goal

but ultimately it's part of a larger

vision Canada's success depends on

Canadians success and Justin Trudeau's

small petty vision of Canada of region

against

in Provence against Provence and

Canadian against Canadian is unworthy of

this great country

we'll return to the optimism and vision

[Applause]

you're planted balanced in 2024 does

rely on reduced interest payments to

help get you to balance especially in

the last few years

do you believe that there's enough

buffer built in and what happens if you

don't form it a second majority

government well absolutely I do believe

there's enough buffer built in this is a

responsible plan with prudent framework

and you hit the nail on the head we

believe that it's much better to have

Canadians tax dollars going into better

services or freeing up space for the

government to cut taxes then to be

paying interest on the debt and under

the liberal plan more and more of your

tax dollars going to pay just interest

on the debt their plan doesn't give us

anywhere any flexibility if we do

yeah well this is about developing that

develop strategies for enhanced care for

best practices and and things of that

can play a leadership role and bringing

conservative i Mr Shearer Melanie woods

HuffPost Canada I in the platform in

your leadership platform you talk about

restricting grant funding to

universities that don't commit to free

speech policies and we've seen the

Chicago principles adopted by provincial

governments in Alberta Ontario

how will universities you know pass the

tests at the federal level

well thank you very much for the

question I'm very proud of that aspect

in our in our platform there are threats

to free speech all over the world and in

here at home as well and that is why we

will have a regime put in place that

prioritizes federal spending federal

grant contributions to universities that

have taken concrete measures to protect

free speech on campus there are a number

of different models that we are looking

at this will be done in conjunction with

university officials I've already had to

started some of those consultations as

leader the opposition will continue

those

and ensure that students have the

knowledge and the confidence that free

speech is protected on campus and kind

of as a follow-up I know a lot of the

criticism of policies like the Chicago

principles has been around human rights

legislation existing human rights

legislation for example NBC LGBTQ folks

are protected against harassment

discrimination on campuses so would

banning a anti-trans speaker from campus

for example put a university at risk for

funding as it the goal of this program

is to ensure that legitimate debate can

be held we've seen phenomena all over

the world where where where people are

not able to to speak where events have

been canceled not because they violate

any particular code of conduct or a

university policy but just simply

because people protest it and then there

are concerns raised about security and

things like that so the goal here is to

protect robust discussion robust debate

and and of course the universities have

the right and the obligation to ensure

that students can take their studies and

security and without a fear of

harassment but we also have to make sure

that especially on university campuses

which were founded to have those

challenging ideas challenged and robust

debate that that can continue in Canada

hi mr. schirra David Cochran with CBC

News we've got about forty nine billion

dollars in tax cuts and spending over

five years in this plan and to get paid

for that and get rid of the deficits

about 67 billion in cuts in new revenue

and delayed infrastructure spending what

do you say to the people look at the 53

million dollars in infrastructure delays

and cuts and say you can't do this

without slashing programs and cutting

jobs well because we've shown exactly

where the money's come from we are

committed to increasing the transfer

payments for health education and social

programs that is a guarantee that if

that is costed and is outlined in this

platform we've said where we're going to

get the money front we're going to get

it from corporate welfare we're going to

get it from foreign aid from countries

relatively well-off countries that don't

need Canadian taxpayers dollars we're

also going to eliminate things like

March Madness where the government

departments spend hundreds of millions

of dollars in the dying days of the

fiscal year

we're going to and make sure that

government real estate is allocated

responsibly so that the government isn't

wasting money with empty office space

all over the country we're going to

protect core services while we make

government more efficient liberals

measure success in government by how

much money they spend

conservatives measure success in

government by actually getting results

and it's essential that we do this

because the choice is clear if we do not

get back to a responsible plan for

treating Canadian taxpayers dollars

wisely

we will see those massive deficits

threaten social programs and lead to

massive tax hikes this is the time that

we can get back on track and avoid the

Kathleen Wynne disastrous situation that

Ontarians know all too well and that

Canadians across the country have seen a

wave of upon a large oval cupola

they chose come March Madness will a

avec the system socio service socio men

a say it is all my Testament attacks a

mistress your starting next year right

away you're gonna start pushing off

billions of infrastructure spending into

the future to help you balance the

budget but a lot of that infrastructure

money would be tied up in programs where

there are agreements with provinces or

with municipalities on multi-year

funding going forward so how do you

expect them to respond to this sudden

jolt of cash moving out of the the next

five fiscal years I reject the

description of that what we know and

what the Parliamentary Budget Officer

has said is that the Liberal government

has no plan when it comes to

infrastructure they are

that most years they laps up to 40% of

the money that was earmark projects

aren't getting built and so what we're

saying is we're gonna send this the same

amount of money and we're gonna do in a

responsible way we're going to respect

all existing agreements for projects

that have already been signed off on

we're going to see those through and

we're going to put in place a

responsible plan that actually gets

money out the door and shovels in the

ground and and that is clearly not

that's what not what is happening and

the Liberals again will try to create

fear where we're and and division over

something that is simply not true

this is their infrastructure plan has

been a disaster it has been widely

condemned by fiscal experts and by

municipal experts who are saying that

it's not leading to the increased

economic activity and the increased

projects so we're going to keep the

total amount of spending over a

responsible period of time so we stop

boring billions and billions of dollars

from taxpayers to a project he's on deja

different even to Google you know that

predictor operatively million dollar the

country album as you just mentioned on

our you on the question of existing

projects we have made specific

commitments that we're already getting

tremendous feedback from not just

municipal leaders but also people who

live in communities like the Massey

tunnel replacement here in BC and like

the expansion to the Ontario and young

line in Toronto so it's quite clear that

with us with a Conservative Party you

actually get big projects going you

don't just get what the Liberals

sandwiches are false promises without

the shovels in the ground

Ian Bailey globe in the mail I wonder

because we'll go back to infrastructure

given all the infrastructure means

especially here in the Lower Mainland

why spend less why spend 18 billion

dollars it's not about it's not about

spending less the total amount of

spending continues at the same overall

level and we have to keep in mind these

are at record high levels the previous

Conservative government's spent billions

of dollars increased spending on

infrastructure to get these important

projects built and our plan maintains

that overall budget amounts so again the

Liberals are going to try to say things

that just aren't true and I will take no

lessons from a party that hasn't even

costed their own platform they're now

going to try to cost our platform when

they can't even provide costing for

their platform so I'm not going to

listen to anything that they're gonna be

saying today on our numbers the promises

are not being cost of some of these

projects so how will they get built

again I I reject the premise this is an

overall budget envelope that will keep

that will continue to be maintained with

the overall dollar amount is the exact

same there's no reduction in the overall

dollar amount what we're saying is that

we're going to make sure that projects

actually get built and that's what the

liberal governor has failed to do the

Parliamentary Budget Office said their

plan didn't exist that the projects

aren't getting built the money's not

getting out the door so we're going to

make sure the money that does get it

that actually goes out the door and gets

these projects built Oakland plum tree

not lava actual more real is a LaGrant

project or a deal a premier oil callate

DB per agent on a community part of

Canada good afternoon mr. chair Andrew

latin from true north

so your plan calls for balanced budget

legislation which seems to be based on

the premise that a government can every

year balance the budget barring

unforeseen circumstances why then commit

future governments to something that

you're not prepared to do for five years

well it's an we have a lot of work to do

to clean up the liberal mess and we want

to do it in a way

that can allow existing core services to

be strengthened we're going to increase

those investments in health care

education and social programs by at

least 3% every year while controlling

the growth of government spending in

other areas and by eliminating wasteful

practices like March Madness the public

the government hiring outside

consultants spending hundreds of

millions of dollars on outside

consultants when they have expert public

servants who could do the job within the

federal departments and of course by

ensuring that government real estate is

managed much more efficiently and on the

note of immigration how are you going to

under a conservative government deal

with the tens of thousands of asylum

seekers that have already come in

illegally who are denied their claims

and that's not eligible to stay well

just this week I made an announcement at

Roxton Road where we've seen tens of

thousands of people cross into Canada

illegally and I made the announcement

that we would closed the loophole in the

safe third country agreement would also

increase resources for our border

service agents that they can carry out

judicial decisions and and decisions by

by those who are hearing those

applications and by increasing the

number of judges who are hearing the

cases in the first place mr. chair this

is a mantra and I'm from relevant now as

you know there are less than nine days

left in elections and we're already in

the on 11th of this we are already

advanced pudding stage don't you think

you're too late to announce your

platform and my question is is it a part

of your strategy or was it because of

the pressure from the federal opponents

who've been often asking you you've been

doing it not at all this was always the

day that we had decided we would bail

our platform and quite frankly it was

because we had so many good things to

announce throughout this campaign even

just yesterday we announced further

measures for helping those who are

adopting children even though it was it

was the day before the advance polls we

still had great policies to announce in

fact there are some policies in this

platform that because we have so many

great ideas we weren't able to get them

all out before the platform launched so

I'll be highlighting them and next week

watch heard can you be impressed mister

sharing which specific economic data

points will tell you that your overall

plan is working for example what are

your targets for employment numbers

wages GDP growth well we're gonna be

looking at all of those things as we

implement this plan we know that

Canadians purchasing power will increase

when they have more money put in their

pockets we we can expect a GDP growth as

a result of of these measures more money

in people's pockets means more money at

their disposal to to invest in their

homes to invest in their children to

basically spend as they see fit

and that's the biggest difference

between liberals and conservatives

conservatives believe that the dollar

left in the hands of the hard-working

taxpayer who earned it is always better

spent than in the hands of the

politician who tax it so of course we'll

be looking at things like GDP growth and

employment numbers and we believe that

this is a much more responsible plan

than endless deficits endless deficits

that mean higher taxes and when taxes go

up to pay interest on debt that is not

good for the economy at all that we got

a truly shift from the GDP

they told the news on play they all knew

some coffee on Carl Honore particular

needs a miracle the economy called a

Google Mount hua I wanted a simple pay

later soon at them I had a question for

you about the cyber bullying elements of

your plan would enable parents sorry

people to sue parents and guardians of

cyber bullies and how effective well as

a father of five kids I think we can all

agree that we're entering into you know

a new territory when it comes to how our

children interact with each other and I

know I've spoken to parents whose

children have had to switch schools

because of bullying and a lot of it is

happening online now so what this

measure is about is about starting the

work to create a framework to protect

kids and to give parents the tools they

need and to have some accountability for

when when when tragedies happen and when

when children's our children are forced

to change schools or go through mental

illness or anxiety because of the

treatment they've had online this is

about starting the work to create a

framework around that to protect kids

and give parents the tools thank you

know all that comments they could come

and pair the second father Jimmy

properly and Kia to the back platform

socio and I just say as you Polly a very

sort of parent yeah he is on yeah

you don't really call Paschal victim the

cyberbullying and or set it is it a

common say that revive the pork a ratio

to Protege days and finally the dealer

or parent hi Mr Shearer this is Shelley

Hagen with Bloomberg News what would you

do if the global economy slows down

sharply would you abandon the balanced

budget the concerns that many are

raising about the potential global

downturn is precisely why we have to get

back on track now we can Justin Trudeau

has spent our way out of having any type

of flexibility if there is a downturn

those massive deficits are weighing down

our economy it means more and more money

has to be taken out of the economy

through either borrowing by the

government which takes money out of the

economy or by paying higher interest

payments on the debt which is just going

to banks and bondholders it's precisely

because there are some signs of possible

headwinds that we need to get back on

track we need to turn the ship away from

the rocky shoals and back out to clear

waters and that's exactly what this plan

does we are cyclical a Grande visit new

year the capacity there gonna be the

Canada that prop rotate the capability

really chronic hosting in the silicon

sample account directly in network

response I have acquired a large wrong

the economy a great will the amount on

color going on to what they poor l'ainte

arrested a money spent on interest on

the debt is wasted money it is it is

going to banks and bondholders that

money could be going into better

services or into tax cuts and that is

the difference that is the clear choice

here Canadians can now see an

irresponsible liberal plan that will run

massive deficits for years and years and

years and we all know what happens when

that is allowed to continue

it means threatened public services it

means higher taxes it means life getting

more and more expensive and Canadians

will fall further and further behind or

they can choose the conservative plan

which protects core services and

increases investments in health care

education and social programs but gets

back to balanced budgets so we can stop

wasting taxpayers money on interest

charges on the debt in regarding the

plan to eliminate the tax cap if it is

feasible why hasn't it been done yet

well it takes it takes a government that

has the purpose of mine to do it this

Liberal government spent their past four

years going after small business owners

calling them tax cheats all the while

protecting those who have offshore

accounts and and and things of that

nature so they made their choice they

thought that the local pizza owner a

pizza shop owner the local mechanic were

cheating on their taxes we believed that

they were creating jobs and

opportunities in their community so

we're gonna go after those who are not

paying their fair share of taxes

eliminating the

SCAP while lowering taxes on our job

creators and people who create

businesses in our local communities

Martin maketh man with news 11:30 about

fourteen point five billion dollars of

these cuts for five years falls under

the category of operating expenses other

operating expenses reductions can you

just expand a little bit on on what that

means yeah thank you very much yes so

I'll give you one example recently we

filed a request for information from the

government on what's known in Ottawa is

March Madness and that is when

government departments if they have

leftover money instead of returning it

back to the taxpayer and leaving it

there for for for future years blow it

all at the end of the fiscal year and we

asked the government how much money was

spent what were the types of items that

were purchased in that period of time

and the response came back and it was

hundreds and hundreds of pages of

examples so March Madness is one we're

gonna put it into that practice we're

going to stop the practice or at least

target the practice of outside

consultants being brought into

departments at exorbitant rates when we

have expertise within the public service

this is something that public service

unions have actually flagged

where you have people with expertise

within a department available to do the

types of works that outside consultants

are paying to come in and do and we're

going to rationalize federal real estate

we have so many office buildings all

throughout the country that are not

being fully maximized not utilized

properly which means that we're paying

far more for real estate than we would

otherwise need to so those are the

examples that were using to show that we

can protect core services and protect

employment levels within the public

service but stop the practice of blowing

money out the door in the in the last

few days of the fiscal year the March

Madness

DePaul's beaucoup - rondalee Daniel NFS

Cal all that eliminated will the pratik

bull a consult on TBN dollars in

department

caused a difference in Nam Connor the

function Arabic little experience

incapacitate affair

mm shows you know that rationale is a

the leis edifice Fatah the word

recession has been seemingly absent from

this campaign from from all the parties

but but your platform does mention that

word and yet as as one of my colleagues

pointed out there does seem to be this

sort of self handcuffing on the idea of

not being willing to run deficits in

during it you know times of economic

difficulty so in one since your party

seems to be the lone one to sort of

appreciate the clouds on the horizon and

yet you're also handcuffing yourself

with this this plan if we will not run

deficits under any circumstances as you

know I don't think anyone would question

Stephen Harper's credentials but during

times of real economic turmoil he did

run deficits so for some people

certainly economists watching this are

probably going to look at it and wonder

if there's a bit of a contradiction here

what would you say to people who who

would point out that well first of all

we're going to take steps within this

platform in it within our mandate that

will strengthen Canada's economic

activity under Justin Trudeau's

government we've seen tens of billions

of dollars of foreign direct investment

leave Canada they've investors have

pulled money out of Canada because we

can't get build big things built in this

country so by getting big energy

projects back on track by implementing a

national energy quarter we're going to

see a great deal of economic activity

linked to that leaving money in the

pockets of Canadians helping them get

ahead also helps the economy when

they're able to spend money on the

things that are important to them that

creates economic growth much better than

when the government is spending money

before them and again getting back to

balance budgets gives us more

flexibility reducing the amount of money

that we spend on interest charges frees

that up frees that up precisely for if

there are headwinds in front of us

and you know the Liberals have to

explain to Canadians if they spend money

quickly when times are tough and they

spend money quickly when times are good

when do they ever get back to balanced

budgets when do we ever get to the point

where we stop spending money on those

interest charges the answer what the

liberals is never the answer with us is

in a responsible period of time five

years getting back to balance budgets

protecting a core services and lowering

taxes putting money back in the pockets

of chaos all across all along the way

will there be any exemption in any

scenario where a government can run a

deficit under your legislation well the

the with our legislation we will ensure

that government has to find the money

for new types of programs if they are

going to you know bark on new spending

initiatives they have to find the money

for that that is how Canadian families

live their lives that is how Canadian

businesses live their lives and it's

time that we had some fiscal

responsibility at the federal level as

well thanks
