federal within the first 100 days of a

new Conservative government I will

convene a first ministers meeting on

January 6th 2020 in Ottawa to start the

process of breaking down

interprovincial trade barriers and

negotiate a truly free trade agreement

between the provinces that will create

jobs and opportunity from coast to coast

these barriers prevent the free flow of

people goods and services across

provincial borders they make it more

expensive to run a business

they hurt consumers with higher prices

and less competition and they

discouraged and frustrated reaming

innovators who want to change the world

we are missing out on a whole new

frontier of opportunity and prosperity

the International Monetary Fund

estimates that eliminating

interprovincial trade barriers could add

eighty billion dollars to Canada's GDP

this is incredibly frustrating think of

all the people we could lift out of

poverty and help get ahead in life if we

simply got government out of our own way

and I will appoint a minister of

interprovincial trade whose sole job

will be to lead these negotiations on my

behalf and oversee the implementation of

a new trade deal

it should not be easier to trade with

other countries than between Canadian

provinces we are one free country we

second century and beyond

first canada's first Prime Minister Sir

John McDonald once said everything is to

be gained by Union and everything to be

lost by disunion sadly the wisdom of our

first Prime Minister is lost on our

current one Canada needs a new approach

and for that it needs a new government

in 1861 with Confederation still six

years off in the distance MacDonald said

of Canadian Union we are a great country

and shall become one of the greatest in

the universe if we preserve it we shall

sink into insignificance and an

adversity if we suffer it to be broken

some 158 years later I stand before you

to say that I am ready to stand for our

union and to reimagine it for the 21st

century I will work with the provinces

in the same spirit of open federalism

our founders envisioned and I will work

tirelessly to tear down trade barriers

between provinces and territories that

have held captive our nation's potential

for far too long

only then can we unleash Canada's true

and limitless potential

so Canadians from coast to coast can get

ahead

and government conservator good morning

Mr Shearer Stephanie Levites from The

Canadian Press

what's wrong with the current free trade

agreement that exists between the

federal government and the provinces

signed in 2017

well when you talk to different

manufacturers and producers

of all different types of products there

are still many hurdles there are still

many barriers you can have a product

that is inspected provincially that then

has to go and get inspected by another

province after it it flows through there

there are still many hurdles on the

regulatory side as well

so those are the types of things that we

will be looking to eliminate to apply

standards all across the country if it's

you know if I can eat something that was

produced in Saskatchewan and inspected

in Saskatchewan but if I cross over the

border into Manitoba I can't that

doesn't make much sense for consumers

and so we're going to ensure that there

can be free flow of goods between the

provinces that's good for consumers it's

good for our businesses as well the

second question under a Conservative

government would you make any changes to

the current Supreme Court justice

nomination process and would you

consider formalizing the current deal

between the Trudeau government and the

province of Quebec around the specific

selection of judges from here we will

always work with the province of Quebec

to ensure that its place in in

Confederation is is respected and

protected and and we will we'll follow

the normal course for appointing Supreme

Court justices all that to respect de

leur col du Quebec tone that to a

confederation oh yes Eric Quebec mmm

aspect is not a course approach you are

normally lady Anya sound second with

second with respect a the process was

actual for normally leisure

hi mr. shears anniversary Oliver with

CTV national news historically a party

has not been able to form government

without Ontario and/or Quebec your party

is currently polling at a distant third

in Quebec an antenna and Ontario is more

divided than ever before with three

strong parties I'm wondering how you

think you can form a majority government

without strong support in both provinces

we are going to win seats all over this

country we're going to win seats in

Quebec we're going to insist in Ontario

that we that we haven't held before very

optimistic about our the results on

October 21st because the choice is

becoming more and more clear and

Canadians now see that there is only one

party there's only one leader who will

sure that life becomes more affordable

there is only one leader that will bring

us back to balanced budgets and put an

end to these endless deficits that are

raised that are leading to tax hikes and

threatening our social services that is

the Conservative Party there is now a

clear choice between our party and an

NDP liberal coalition which will raise

taxes kill jobs drive out investment and

cancel big projects I know Canadians

won't want that to happen and that's why

I'm very optimistic for October 21st and

on the tone of the election this

campaign so far seems to be more

negative with more personal attacks that

we've seen in years what do you think

about the tone and why do you think it

does appear to be more harsh this time

around well when you look at the types

of negative campaigns that Justin

Trudeau and his team we're running I

believe a lot of that you know a lot of

that comes from from the attacks that

liberals have made remember it was the

Finance Minister Bill Morneau who called

our deputy leader a Neanderthal it was

it's just just yesterday Justin

Trudeau's top adviser tweeted out a

picture of me shaking hands with a

construction worker wearing a safety

vest and making a link to racists

I mean that's just despicable and Justin

Trudeau has yet to apologize for that or

order his top adviser to to apologize

for that he has basically insulted

everyone who has to wear a

high-visibility safety vest to work

Justin Trudeau and his team are now

lumped in with races I mean that is

despicable and disgusting and that is

and the tone comes right from the top hi

good morning Christy Kirk up with The

Globe and Mail I just wanted to ask you

turkey is ignoring the threat of US

sanctions and is pressing on with its

attacks against Kurdish fighters and

civilians in Syria what is your

assessment of the kayvyun government's

decision to halt exports military

exports to Turkey well I would first of

all say that I believe that it was the

wrong decision to leave the Kurds to on

their own after they have fought beside

us and our allies singing the fight

against international terrorist groups

we would expect that any member of NATO

would live up to international law and

respect human rights and

and you know in these early days of this

conflict we would certainly follow the

same type of course of action we allow

Oquawka Synovus this is yonder less a no

Lily crude a practical act you take

control terrorism a global affection

knows ally a new one later on tonka in

marble yellow team by respectively the

walk there is a truman la loire

international and just on another matter

your platform does not explicitly refer

to race and diversity but it does refer

to francophones as minorities why is

that we will always stand up for the

human rights of all Canadians regardless

of their faith their background their

sexual orientation their race their

their Creed we will always uphold as we

always have is the this is the party of

the Bill of Rights this is the party of

John Diefenbaker this is the party that

has always supported an open inclusive

immigration system that welcomes people

from all over the world

cannot walk our exemplar we will not

feel it so this is a case is now before

the courts in Quebec and and we will not

intervene in this case this is not

something that we would pursue at the

federal level

mr. Sherr Michael Qatar with global

national just again you've invoked NDP

liberal coalition jug needs saying

walked it back yesterday saying he's not

looking for that kind of a coalition why

do you continue to stoke these fears for

voters that there will be a coalition

when at least one of the parties has

said that's not happening well he hasn't

ruled it out and he you know he hasn't

withdrawn or retracted his statements he

did and well he it's quite clear that

that the NDP and liberals will work

together to implement high deficit high

tax government and it's quite clear that

Justin Trudeau would pay any price to

stay in power so when we look at the NDP

platform and we look at their massive

deficits and the tax hikes to go along

to pay for it they need to be honest

with two Canadians exactly which taxes

will go up exactly which big projects in

this country they will cancel and

contains have a right to know that they

also know that this choice and the

choice in this election is now crystal

clear every other party wants to run

massive deficits and raise taxes to pay

for it we are the only party that will

get back to balanced budgets so we can

lower taxes and put more money in the

pockets Kings that is a crystal clear

choice now now polls are showing that

either way we're headed to a minority

government you've already said you're

not going to have a partnership with

anybody all of the parties say they

they're not going to partner with you

how is this sure government gonna get

anything done in a minority situation

well we're gonna get a majority

government in a minority situation sir

I'd like you to answer that question

we're gonna get a majority government

and you know you can I'll leave it to

others and pundits and analysts to

speculate my job in the next six days is

to go get that majority government

that's exactly what I'm going to do say

say pull a Liz an enlisted of the fairly

speculation mouthal mark responsibility

in the Ghanaian government measure Hotel

event in October it's a survival affair

good morning mr. schirra yesterday on

average CBC News would you change the

equalization formula to address Jason

Kenny's and Alberta's concerns so it you

know the Liberals locked in the

equalization formula for the next five

years without any consultation with

provinces I understand the frustration

in West

Canon Alberta and Saskatchewan when we

see big energy projects that could

create thousands of jobs and untold

prosperity not just for western

provinces but for all Canadians when we

see Justin Trudeau's inaction or

mismanagement leading to the

cancellation of those types of projects

or the massive delays I understand where

that frustration comes from I do think

there are some things in the short term

that can be addressed for example the

lag between real-time economic data and

and the changes that flow from that that

that can take several years for the

economic situation of a province to

trigger changes in the equalization

formula I think that given the type of

world we live in now where we can we

have access to to that information much

more quickly that's something that that

we can that can be addressed so those

are some of the initial steps so I think

the focus for premier Kenny and for

Western compromises is to get our energy

sector back on its feet and in your view

do you think Kobach gets too much

equalization money you know right now I

believe that the premier Legault shares

the same goal that my former premier

Brad Wall had which is to get Quebec off

of equalization to create the types of

conditions where there can be the

economic growth and the jobs that come

along with it to not need Equalization

and I am prepared to work with Premila

go to do achieve exactly that yes or no

do you think they get too much money I

think the focus has to be getting off of

equalization not needing equalization

that's the focus that is where there

will be much more productive work done

between the federal government and the

parents or government and that is

exactly what I will do on firstly as you

secular clear tape or mr. Lugosi the the

the trainer position in the PAP was

the Abbas wind Lipari quasicrystal mm

Kerry Co Quebec a more priority see the

travail avec premier ago por la

croissants economic good morning mr.

chair Katie Simpson CBC News a couple of

weeks ago after the first French

language debate you told reporters that

personally on the issue of abortion you

are pro-life but if you form government

that you will protect a woman's right to

you won't open that issue that's not

somewhere you're going given I'm curious

if that's your same approach to the

issue of same-sex marriage given that

you've been asked numerous times

throughout this campaign and even before

this campaign about whether your

position has evolved from 2005 you have

said that other people who are saying

the same things that you are saying at

the time in the House of Commons you

said you will protect the law as it

stands but you've never said either way

whether you actually personally support

same-sex marriage so do you take that

same approach that you take to abortion

or you personally are against it but

publicly and professionally will support

it is that your approach to same-sex

marriage do you personally not support

it but promise not to touch it if you

are elected prime minister as you know

at the time that I was first elected

there was a debate before Parliament and

indeed before Canadians there were two

elections that where this was an issue

before Keynes and I represented the

views of my constituents and my own

views at the time and society has moved

on and I have moved on that doesn't

answer my question so do you do you part

well but the question is do you take the

same approach into this social issue

that you do with abortion where you say

okay personally I am NOT for this but as

Prime Minister I won't go near it is

that your approach to same-sex marriage

I take the approach of protecting the

rights of all Canadians all kids

including LGBT Canadians

I'll always defend their rights and

defend the law so is that yes I will

always protect the rights of LGBT Kane's

and ensure that they have access to

marriage and and and protect a lot as it

stands mr. shear cottony the tarty

National Post twice this morning you've

promised to be the the Prime Minister

would stand up for all of Canadians

rights and then again this morning

you've promised not to stand up for the

rights of Quebecers were affected by

bill 21 if you become Prime Minister it

can't be both can it as I said our

position on this has always been the

same this is a decision taken by the

assembly I see now and is now before the

courts at the same time as due respect

provincial jurisdiction you're planning

to bring back the office of religious

freedom to intervene on behalf of

religious minorities in foreign

jurisdictions is bill 21 not the kind of

law that you envision the office

fighting in other countries as I said

this is a decision that was taken by the

assembly and elected representatives of

Quebec and we're not going to intervene

in this case good morning mr. chair

Juliet page CBC Quebec I'd like to hear

you on the GNL Quebec pipeline and

terminal project in the saguenay this

morning there's a group of 40 economists

who assigned a letter opposing the

project earlier this summer there was a

group of 150 scientists also opposing

the project both argue that replacing

coal by natural gas in other countries

is no longer the way to go in 2019 so

I'd like to ask you how would a

Conservative government take into

account those expert opinions and and

that science when it comes to to

supporting and approving fossil fuel

projects I believe it's self-evident

that if we can export our natural gas

and other countries have access to that

and are able to replace their coal-fired

electrical plants or there are other

sources of energy that that's better for

the environment and that's precisely why

our environmental plan that takes the

climate change fight global recognizing

that we extract our natural resources in

at the highest environmental standards

and when the world has more access to

Canadian energy it means that they're

not burning dirtier coal that they're

not buying oil and gas from regimes with

terrible human rights records so I

believe that projects that can attain

those very high standards should be

allowed to proceed that's actually a

fair say say we don't seal a total pile

opportunity there I stayed another

energy properly gas natural it per home

plus a li-listen 12 as a solar shaaban

because it seemed you prolong for your

mom's to save a sample I can not to the

plan for long FEMA and expect it aspect

Mondial at all News News along to show

up really project keeper attained lately

neva or Vermont health close anyway I

say a sincere poornathwa economy I

actually ask you the same question when

it comes to the third link here between

Quebec City and Levy all the experts

here Urbanists who have spoken out

publicly about it say this is not what

we need to do in 2019 we have to go

toward public transit and not toward

building new roads so I'd like to know

why you're supporting the project before

actually knowing although the results of

the studies that are that are in motion

right now I'm supporting this project

because I know that people of the city

of Quebec want this project it's quite

clear and we know that the work done

between the city and the province will

ensure that the third link will will

adhere to very high environmental

standards and will ensure that it's

built in such a way that respects

everything from fisheries to the water

we know that so in order to help improve

the quality of life for Quebecers for

the people of the city of Quebec to

shorten commute time so they can get

home to their families quicker we will

support this project the work will be

done by the municipal and provincial

levels and then the federal government

will be there as a partner and I should

add it's only our party that supports
