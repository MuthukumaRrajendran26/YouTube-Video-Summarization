good morning thank you for joining us

here in the in campaign central for

Joanne Roberts campaign Green Party

candidate here in Halifax and definitely

der the Green Party of Canada we're

joined by the leader of the Green Party

of Nova Scotia who also happens to be

our federal candidate in south shore st.

Margaret's Thomas Chopin burg and

Richard Sorachi who is an elected member

of Halifax City Council and is a very

played a critical role on our shadow

cabinet in the development of Mission

Possible Richard czarsky here for

Halifax Wes ho and Macpherson the

indomitable the extraordinary a little

bit first and running in Dartmouth Cole

Harbour for those of you in the national

audience who don't know her she's a

local entrepreneur at climate change

activists and a former candidate for

mayor and Matt no streets they're not

going and may I see it through my own or

to the travaille for summer moment no I

recognize the platform a pall along

small or not

Buju they COO at this initiative la

nouvelle source their revenues I'm

really really pleased and proud to stand

here in front of you want to acknowledge

we're on the unseated traditional

territory of the Meghna and to them I

say well Allen thank you we also have

some other thank yous which it may be a

bit unusual as I start this conversation

the Green Party of Canada's platform is

the result of the work not of some

backroom party staffers or focus groups

but as I indicated earlier lil Joanne

Richard are all part of the Shadow

Cabinet of the Green Party of Canada

with many others across the country and

we actually work based on the member

approved policies and then we look at it

again and say what do we need to do to

meet the expectation of Canadians this

platform has a lot of content that

wouldn't have been there if we hadn't

undertaken a tour called community

matters to visit every single province

we went to 34 communities and

listened and that's ten provinces and

the Northwest Territories between

February and August mostly low carbon

travel mostly by train that's another

story but it informed a lot of this

policy then we took the ideas we had for

new initiatives and met with the

Parliamentary Budget Officer and his

staff initially in May and again in June

and we started the process of figuring

out and it was it's an enormous benefit

to Canadian democracy that our

Parliamentary Budget Office had its

mandate changed into this I have to

thank the Liberals for putting in place

changes to the Parliamentary Budget

Office to make it part of their mandate

to examine party platforms we'd like to

make it obligatory in future elections

that all parties submit their promises

to the primary budget office because

then Canadian voters have a third party

nonpartisan expert group to look at

parties promises before an election so

this process has been a long one but I

also want to say the one person who was

with me on this journey was the director

of policy at the Green Party Angela

Rickman who came with me for the first

meetings kept working on this process

between our first meeting with the

Parliamentary Budget Office and the end

of June she was diagnosed with ALS and

she's on disability leave and I hope

she's listening because even after that

diagnosis and even having having to

leave work because of the accelerating

symptoms of ALS she's kept at it she

kept working on the budget she kept

calling the are the senior analyst at

PBO who was working with an app say to

dr. young the whole PBO team has been

amazing to work with because they face

their straight shooters they do number

crunching that's their job but I just I

just wanted to give a big thank you to

Angela because

a lot of people would have said could

have said I don't have time for this now

hi I'm done with budgets yeah Angela you

did it yeah you got us to the finish

line and we're really really grateful

another person who thanks who helped a

lot on the budget process on our staff

Steve Parkinson but our finance critic

in the Green Party of Canada this is

news okay my finance critic in the Green

Party of Canada is John Kidder my

husband and he's he also started working

with Angela at the point of her

diagnosis so that we had more backup and

we've we've our blood sweat and tears

has gone in to making sure that we could

number crunch some key promises that

we've made to Canadians and deliver them

so a few quick notes just so it's very

clear that the Parliamentary Budget

Office reviewed 24 of our planks this is

not we would never want to say that the

Parliamentary Budget Office has signed

off on our platform we need to draw some

clear lines we asked for 24 specific

items the big-ticket items to be

reviewed we are releasing every single

one of the items that the partnership

budget office reviewed we've asked the

Parliament she Budget Office to put

everything they did for us for this

platform and for this costing analysis

the piece is done by the Parliamentary

Budget Office our public so it's not

gone different all essential newly

social party pasca act to among news I

want dimande of Boucher although bill

Hodor butchered bullshit off sta

Parliament earful abuja the the Holmes

absolument public they laugh a share for

new news upon the Monday there were that

cat Elam on the platform Anneliese day

Libya Hall the obviously the Boucher

Parliament air so we don't glom may FC

Abdullah keep the set be whole the the

office the Parliamentary Budget Office

has done an amazing job in

analyzing so we know that we have the

revenue coming in to cover some very

large new programs we are able to put

before you a budget that is balanced in

five years but to do that we have a

number of really large new revenue

pieces let me remind you of the spending

promises we've already made we said

we'll bring in Universal pharmacare we

said will abolish tuition will invest in

post-secondary education will provide

Universal childcare will meet the

expectations of the Truth and

Reconciliation Commission of the inquiry

into missing and murdered indigenous

women we had to revisit our budget to

find 2 billion dollars for this year to

meet the new for new ruling of the Human

Rights Tribunal that the Government of

Canada owes indigenous children 2

billion dollars we had to go back and

say okay we've got to find two billion

dollars in there those things we have

done and how do we do it well the big

ticket items pharmacare turns out to be

a cost if you look through the budget on

clay what page to look at because we

have by category all of our spending is

laid out on health care and the

parliamentary and the pharma care piece

in this very next fiscal year 2020 to

2021 is almost 27 billion dollars it's

the net and in 21 to 22 28 billion

dollars and in 22 to 23 29 billion

dollars but it's essential we have to do

it so we accept the Parliamentary Budget

Office's analysis they have a caveat

which you'll see when you look at the

document that they didn't take into

account savings that accrue through a

bulk buying of drugs they didn't take

into account the provincial

contributions to Pharma care so when you

see those items we have included the

reduced cost of buying the drugs and we

used those statistics and the analysis

from the Eric Hoskins report done for

the federal

right but it doesn't change it much it

doesn't change the bottom line on

pharmacare much till we get to year

three and then we should begin to be

able to negotiate with the provinces

because they will be saving a lot of

money so the provincial contribution to

pharmacare doesn't kick in until year

three of pharmacare now I'm probably

diving into too many of the details but

I think it's worth explaining that is

the single biggest big-ticket item in

what we it what we promised to do and

here's the revenue pieces that let us do

it we're applying a very small tax on

financial transactions that will give us

18 billion dollars by 2025 we're raising

the corporate tax rate to be the

equivalent of what it is in the United

States that will give us almost sixteen

billion dollars we're closing the

capital gains lip hole that will give us

almost 15 billion we're applying

attached to commercial banks on their

profits that will be a bit more than

four billion going after tax havens

we've been aware of since the Panama

papers of specific Canadians who've

hidden money offshore that gives us

about five billion a year we're applying

a wealth tax one percent on tax above

wealth above twenty million dollars that

will give a 7.3 billion by 2025 and

we're cancelling a range of fossil fuel

subsidies that of course is about three

billion dollars and another area which I

think bears a note it's not a huge

amount of money but it's time to bring

the Amazons and the Netflix's and the

googles and the Facebook's into the tax

regime they mine our data and make a lot

of money out of Canada it's only 1

billion dollars by 2025 but it begins to

level the playing field and we close the

loophole that lets people advertise on

Google and Facebook and pay less in tax

than if they advertised in the Chronicle

Herald or put an ad on a local radio

station these are the things that bring

in enough revenue that we are able to

meet these promises without increasing

taxes for Canadians there are no income

tax increases regardless of your wealth

there are changes to the way we for

instance remove the corporate

exemptions for entertainment things like

owning up renting a box that SkyDome and

writing it off that comes to a

significant amount of money in a federal

budget

your doctor turns mountain Anwar

annually the earlier Duke trans mountain

and when we cancel the transplant and

pipeline you'll notice that when we say

fossil fuel subsidies are stopped at

three billion the Trans Mountain

pipeline for 4.5 billion dollars the the

old one we can never get that 4.5

billion dollars back they're still

laughing about it in Texas but they've

got our 4.5 billion and we own that

pipeline and that's not going to change

but spending a further 10 to 13 billion

dollars we will not do now you don't see

on our line item here that we've

recouped 10 to 13 billion because and

Canadians about people have asked me how

did we buy a pipeline for 4.5 billion

dollars where was that in the budget

of course it was never in a budget it's

what's called a non budgetary

transaction and on that same basis we

can cancel spending another 10 to 13

billion and that non budgetary

transaction saving will go to the

infrastructure we need for a Canadian

grid strategy so I know I'm diving into

too many details I think we'll stop at

this point and all of the candidates

here are open for questions as well I

didn't mention the Shadow Cabinet titles

Joanne Roberts is co-chair of Shadow

Cabinet

and because of her huge and impressive

journalistic career career

she is our critic on arts culture and

media richard czarsky given that he has

a PhD in meteorology okay so climate

little McPherson local food and food

security her restaurant wouldn't monkey

here in town if you're a journalist from

out of town may I recommend wooden

monkey and did you add it's definitely

farm to fork

she knows her suppliers really well and

they bring in what they have just grown

and then I have happy customers get to

eat local healthy food while supporting

a local economy so little is as green as

they come okay I said my Margit and

Thomas okay he's a fantastic human being

Steven Lewis was I love Steven Lewis I

once watched him at the UN and

introduced someone for whom he had no

biographical notes not a single note and

he said I'm afraid I have no information

on dr. Saunders run but I am reliably

informed that as he walks through his

hometown people rushed forward to clutch

at his Raymond okay that's that's Thomas

trappin burg all over the place okay so

because you'll see to the edge of a

subdued beneath whiticus jaw no great

loss will say good morning we were

balanced so three of the four major

parties

budgets one didn't from that one wife

and one might think the Canadians good

waters they don't mind a little deficit

spending give me a phone why is it

important for greens to I thank you for

the question because we've never been

slavish ly addicted to balanced budgets

we completely agree that if you need to

spend to stimulate the economy that's an

appropriate thing to do

Canada's current debt to GDP ratio is

quite stable if you look at the

long-term fiscal sustainability of the

federal government we're in good shape

we really are at you can't say the same

thing unfortunately for provinces or

some municipalities but overall Canada's

fiscal health at the federal government

level is very solid and interest rates

now are so low that it makes sense as

our budget does to spend money now we

are investing in a lot of infrastructure

we're taking one point of GDP or other

GST one point of the GST which will go

entirely to municipalities for

infrastructure we need to do that the

Liberal promises on infrastructure as

you may recall were pretty back-end

loaded we haven't seen a lot of the

infrastructure spending yet what

Canada's economy really needs right now

is a lot more investment we've been

where our GDP growth is roughly 1.5

percent per year and it's mostly in the

services sector so we really could if

investments been pretty flat so we are

not ideological about balanced budgets

but we do know that it matters to

Canadians and greens believe in living

within our means economically and

ecologically so we come to balance in

five years but as I said in the

MacLaine's debate as to Paul wells his

question if there was a change if we saw

a reason that we needed to increase

deficits because of a change in

circumstance we'd respond to that but we

believe Canadians need to see fiscal

responsibility it's something that the

Greens have always cared about and we

balanced the budget in the same period

of time in which Mr Shearer plans to

balance the budget but we do it by

expanding revenue because we're

significantly expanding social programs

so usually

words balanced-budget tend to align with

parties that are prepared to cut deeply

into services to Canadians for austerity

we are not like that we think we need

more spending we clearly need spending

we put 400 million in this budget just

for the just transition strategy for

workers in the coal sector who are

seeing phase-out coming soon

we're the only party that has done that

we're serious about protecting workers

in the transition to a non carbon

economy so our commitment to budgets are

balanced is not ideological it's just

prudent well we have funds in the budget

for venture capital we have funds to

assist green tech firms get up and

running now I hear you there's arguments

on both sides of going down the roads

we're going but we know that Canadians

need we don't want to add taxes to

individual Canadians that's clear that

we do call for a complete overhaul of

our tax code I should have mentioned

that by now we have the last tax

commission we had in Canada to examine

whether our tax regime was actually fair

and progressive that was in the 1960s so

we are cut misses interestingly enough a

call of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce

they wanted to let's look at our tax

regime and see if it's fair we have so

many different governments since the

1960's that have layered when I say

larded on to our tax code so many

complex boutique tax cuts accelerated

capital cost allowances all manner of

complications that we want to route and

you have a root and branch review and

reform of our tax code

but clearly lower and lower and

middle-income Canadians and even fairly

wealthy Canadians can feel that they're

overtaxed the super wealthy are

definitely the 1% of Canadians are

seeing increased levels of income and

wealth creating a growing gap between

the 1% and the rest of us and we don't

want to go down that road we want much

more equity so that's where we're

looking at the closing the capital gains

loophole closing this dock option

loophole and working to support small

business we don't change the tax on

small business not a bit we raise the

tax on larger transnational corporations

and to the extent that and I I love

working with entrepreneurs and I love

seeing them spin off their businesses

and help other entrepreneurs get going

honestly in looking at our budget I

don't think we've done anything to chill

that kind of entrepreneurial zeal we

want to work to ensure that Canadian

businesses also have the kind of robust

support from the Government of Canada

and patent protection as they go into a

fairly predatory world of global capital

well but as as Prime Minister should

that happen I definitely want to sit

down with entrepreneurs and if they're

experiencing a problem because of the

way we've structured this and I've met

with a number of entrepreneurs in in

establishing this budget we have a

number of informal business advisors I

think we've got the balance right

yeah those are over now we have to we

have to our our plan mission possible

calls for decarbonizing our electricity

grid and expanding it rapidly so that

every part of Canada wiII be able to

sell from one province to the other that

the grid itself would be 100% renewable

energy this is a key step in the deep

decarbonization of our economy so

burning coal is one of the first things

to go there and mining coal as well now

the the task force on coal sector

workers has already gone out met with

the communities met with the workers and

Nova Scotia should be able to rely on

100% renewable energy from for instance

hydro-quebec right now there's a pinch

point hydro-quebec power gets as far as

Monson and it's not actually a physical

pinch point as far as I can understand

it's just been historically that we

haven't accessed hydro-quebec there's a

lot of renewable energy available to

each part of Canada from another part of

Canada once we get the grid system

working properly so we don't want and we

don't want to leave any part of Canada

behind we don't want any worker to feel

insecure one of my favorite moments of

aha Eureka was as a former resident from

most of my my formative years and

through my 20s living in Margaery Harbor

we used to take the trailer down to

Inverness and we used to buy a ton of

coal and literally dump it back in the

trailer take it home and burn it in the

warm morning furnace and that strip

mined coal the Evans coal mine all that

activity that was going on in Inverness

has now turned into the Cabot links golf

course

not literally all of it but the part

along the shoreline so we have the same

number of people employed now in the

Cabot links Golf Course which as I think

a lot of people from Inverness County

realize has raised the economic activity

of the region quite substantially no

AirPort thank you very much but it's

there there's a transition to be had and

there's jobs in a decarbonized economy

and we we we should never ever have

allowed the donk in mind to open klein

coal never have been allowed to reopen

the Duncan mine that's an atrocity and

the workers there non-unionized in a

company from the states with a terrible

safety record we should never have

allowed the Duncan mine to reopen but

the federal government gave it a pass

said they didn't need to look at the

climate impacts of opening the Duncan

mine in any case Nova Scotia has

specific challenges in a number of areas

of the economy we are here to say that

the economic opportunities for Nova

Scotia are greater in a

carbon-constrained world where we focus

on industries that benefit this economy

more renewable energy by far energy

efficient homes that you don't waste

money the heating the outdoors in the

winter and cooling the outdoors in the

summer tourism our Fisheries Arts and

Culture making films there is no there

are a lot of really vibrant economic

opportunities in Nova Scotia that the

government's have just ignored the

places where we can employ the most

people and raise the quality of life and

the standard of living and of course

greens are very firm on child care and

farmer care and a senior strategy and a

dementia strategy and reducing the cost

of housing which isn't as critical

problem in Nova Scotia although in some

areas it can be here it is here not a

problem in Margaery

but affordability is a key issue right

across Canada once you eliminate the

cost of filling your car up at the cat

station once you eliminate the cost to

find fuel oil for a house that leaks it

to the outdoors your life is more

affordable add in that we will work with

every province our goal is guaranteed

livable income so that we eliminate

poverty right across Canada

every part of Canada will benefit from

our platform well when you regulate

under the Canadian of Rama Protection

Act which we the power to regulate is

there that becomes obviously one one

province at a time we'd have a

conversation a respectful conversation

and negotiation but the federal toolkit

includes the ability to say you can't

produce this much co2 from this

particular facility and then that's that

[Music]

transition

because that line is physically full

that tie line between New Brunswick and

Nova Scotia you can't that's why we

haven't been getting power from Quebec

as it's booked so let me be clear that

our policies and I'm very happy to at

some point I know that Richard and

Joanne Lillard comments are all chomping

a bit to answer some of these questions

so I will our plan here is not optional

our plan is based on global science our

plan if you heard got a ton Berg

yesterday at the United Nations is one

that we think Greta might find

acceptable maybe not we are not talking

about politics here and we're not

talking about illusory promises we're

taking the steps that are necessary

because we can't continue to burn coal

here or around the world it needs to be

shut down as quickly as humanly possible

we need to stop the being depart so I'm

gonna explain Mission Possible which we

launched in May says that by 2030 100%

of canada's electricity will come from

renewable sources our grid will be 100%

decarbonized

by 2030 that's about as fast as we think

we can do it but let me point to some of

the things that make sense our

commitment to a Canadian grid strategy

means that the grid isn't physically

loaded and full it means we think there

you know that's one place Anja Shira and

I can be found in agreement this country

needs energy infrastructure he thinks we

need pipelines I think we need an

electricity grid that works from coast

to coast to coast and not just me

personally that's Green Party policy if

we look at where do we create more

energy in Nova Scotia this is a of our

platform we democratize in

gee consider the town of Chester it's

been how many years now more than a

decade that that Chester has a windmill

that produces enough power that that's

last time I talked to the Manchester

several million dollars towards the town

budget comes from the wind power that

they have every community should be able

to generate its own renewable energy

direct creating a revenue line to local

communities because it's not right at

the municipal order of government in

this country has only one source of

revenue and that's property taxes by the

way negotiating with every province on a

new healthcare accord essential on

climate essential would be done through

our reimagined federalism a version

through a Canadian council council

Canadian governments that brings

indigenous governments and leadership

municipal order of government provincial

territorial and federal to the same

table to work things out so again back

to when you could a hundred percent

renewable electricity a grid that is

decarbonized is doable by 2030 and it's

essential otherwise the carbon budget is

the real budget I mean I'm holding up a

budget militia from poppy a certain

bullshit lame-o mellow Abuja came out no

primordial Sela budget to carb on planet

air we have a carbon budget that's what

that's at on work was speaking to it the

United Nations given the amount of

carbon were allowed to burn we run out

of everything in eight and a half years

at current rates of burning this isn't

optional

this is what we have to do if we want to

ensure that the stability of the global

atmosphere and climatic systems allows

children alive today

to get to their natural lifespan in a

world where human civilization functions

it's not about the environment it's a

it's a security threat it's not a joke

we're right up against it and that's why

Nova Scotia and every other part of

Canada Alberta and every part of the

world China and and China's invested

more in renewable energy than any other

country on earth so we're not in this

alone as a nation but we're gonna have

to get our own house in order so we can

step up in the world and say everybody

has to double their targets or triple

their targets because right now Canada's

target is the same one left in place by

Stephen Harper it was unchanged

yesterday despite Justin Trudeau's

announcement which is the right goal

zero net zero by 2050 well the news to

Justin Trudeau and any Liberal candidate

which is everybody in Atlantic Canada

running for reelection

you can't get to net zero in 2050 with

your current plans until 2030 our target

60 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 is

exactly double what Stephen Harper put

in place in May 2015 which the Liberals

initially said was too low was weak was

unacceptable

I remember Catherine McKenna saying in

Paris the Harper target is the floor

we're going to do better somewhere in 12

months between when the words left her

mouth in Paris and a year later the

floor became a ceiling and they haven't

reached it yet right so we're not here

to play politics about climate we are

here to say science demands these

actions you can't negotiate with physics

and if schoolchildren can see this as

clearly as they do and March and climate

strikes on the streets because we're

stealing their future

that's not rhetoric that's what we're

doing we're stealing our own children's

future and we know it we can pretend we

don't but we can right now step up face

facts and say those days are over

we have a plan we want everyone to join

in together

because this is the moment for societies

to rally around there's not as good a

word in English as there is in French

for this but no limo Alphonse a lead a

Astra Hasina when we say Astra has some

silly ladida project dissociate a

it's a positive saw statistic tool

amount on thumb tool Amman still upon

all-hands-on-deck we do this together or

we fail we do it

liberals conservatives block green New

Democrats we do it together or we fail

our children that's why our targets are

derived from science and I'm sorry that

the Nova Scotia government's targets

aren't but they they will be I'm sure

willing to join the rest of the world

and the rest of Canada when a lot of

green MPs are elected they'll see the

handwriting on the wall oh yes

no we budgeted the revenues to cover it

as opposed to asking them to cost it

well first of all Via Rail status quo

Via Rail doesn't work Via Rail should

work it doesn't have even us one of the

things that our platform is to create a

legislative framework for what we are

rails supposed to do Amtrak in the

United States has a legislative

framework

it gives it a mandate to provide

affordable transportation for Americans

Via Rail has no legislative mandate it's

run as a crown corporation with a board

that I think has charted a course for

Via Rail to be an antique system

designed for tourists so we need to

modernize via rail we need to invest in

Via Rail we need Canadian steel for

tracks for via rail not a whole new set

of tracks but as you'll see in our

platform ten kilometers of new tracks

here and there can help via rail run on

time we need to electrify the engines

even kameen I look at my carbon

footprint all the time I'm getting on

the train today to get to Montreal

tomorrow I take the train a lot and I'm

very well aware that it's an improvement

on driving or taking a

plain but if you compare the carbon

footprint of via rail to any train in

Europe we don't compare very well we

need to modernize enhance have daily

service and then Via Rail that comes the

backbone of a national transit strategy

with spurs or spokes to the hub however

you want to visualize it with light rail

buses Canadians in rural and remote

communities are so under serviced

compared to citizens of even developing

countries much less modern

industrialized countries we need to

invest in high-speed rail so I will ask

Richard because I don't know what the

hell effect City Council said on this

matter and I'd like to know and that's

one thing about Green Party folks is we

admit when something is new information

and I'd sure like to know about what

Halifax City Council said about via rail

and if my intuition is correct it was

just the way it works now that was a

problem I'm guessing I went from as I

said 34 communities I met with mayors I

met with mayors right across the country

sat down with mayors to hear what was on

their minds surprising how much I heard

about the opioid crisis how much I heard

from mayor's in New Brunswick that the

workers who came back from the oil sands

came back with addiction problems but

came back living on streets how they

brought problems that they never saw I

mean I'm a maritime ER I didn't know

that would be what I hear from mayors I

heard from mayors about the lack of

support for infrastructure I heard from

the mayor of Mission BC oh this is a

killer they've got a almost 40-year old

sewer line running under the Fraser

River and it's cracking the federal

government said they'd help them with

the infrastructure to build a new sewer

line they said they'd give them seven

million dollars the mayor came back and

said we've had to cost these additional

things like it costs $250,000 a day for

a monitoring vessel in the Fraser River

well we're doing the repair work we need

more money the federal government said

and in the Maritimes I need to

underscore what the Fraser River means

to us in British Columbia it's our

salmon so there's a sewer line that's

about that is

cracking under the Fraser River and it

needs repair the federal government when

the mayor came back to them and said and

I just was talking to him there came

back and said we need more money to

build the project they said sorry no

more money and since you can't do it

give us back the seven million we

already gave you in the same month in

which they announced two hundred and

twenty million dollars to LNG Canada

which is a consortium of foreign

companies to build a project it blows

through our carbon budget so I've

listened to mayor's a lot because I

learn a lot from municipal order of

government I also frequently meet with

the Federation of Canadian

Municipalities and we made sure that our

budget meets their expectations and what

they're asking of all parties for

committed dollars for infrastructure yes

yeah we had a microphone

well I one of the things that we really

want here in Halifax is to have via do

seven days a week as a train from here

to Montreal so the Chamber of Commerce

was having a big event here in town and

Mayor Savage was there so I went to ask

him if he supports that and he's not

quite ready to do that but because he

doesn't think we have the population so

we looked at what would happen because

there's quite a lobby here to make that

happen if we put that in as a hub where

we brought people into the city so they

could make that travel and he said well

you know if someone was willing to

support it yeah so we have put that

money in this budget to support that so

that that can start to happen and then

you build that passenger you know you

start traveling by passenger train so

yes we've spoken to Mayor Savage about

it you think he's supportive as long as

he doesn't have to pay for it yeah do

you want to comment yeah I did want to

comment on the fact that Halifax council

quashed the deal with CN Rail we did not

it was an in-camera session and we've

been negotiating with CN I think in good

faith trying to create commuter rail

which of course

counselor out hits original premise

we've been working on it for the better

part of a decade and the response that

we got back was so onerous the the the

shareholder direction that Siena takes

is purely about shipping has nothing to

do with passenger rail so they decided

that we were not a priority at all and

that in order to do any sort of a study

they would create the conditions that

were so onerous that we couldn't we

couldn't possibly agree to them and if

we did agree to them we'd bankrupt the

city basically and so there is no

political will on a federal level or a

provincial level to make sure that CN

comes to the table with a municipality

like HRM where we try to make decisions

for the best interests of our residents

and what you get back is Oh Hal effect

City Council has quashed the deal that

is not the case and the other thing I

want I've also met with CN Rail I mean

there are a lot of issues for

transportation in this country we've got

such it ah there's what you get when you

cross the country and listen to

Canadians is a sense that right across

the country while we are doing well

economically and we have low

unemployment rates this is good and we

are a healthy robust and industrial

society with good social safety nets we

think but when you cross the country and

listen to people you realize that the

wheels are falling off the bus right now

you can hear a couple of folks are

beginning to drop we have to invest in

Canada fast we have to invest in our

health care system fast we have to

invest in post-secondary education we

have to invest in our infrastructure and

because the stories you hear make it

very clear that different levels of

government are so busy kind of papering

over the problems that they're not

willing to address them we're willing to

address them and I mean I look at

something as simple as getting prairie

grain to the Port of Vancouver this is

the kind of conversation I have a

and rail which is what put it in my mind

well Harper killed the wheat board who

would have thought that that would lead

to large freighters using free

Anchorage's in my writing and making my

constituents so unhappy who would have

thought it would mean that Prairie

farmers can't get their grain to market

because the Wheat Board used to

consolidate the sales and have more

predictable shipments what happens with

a container ship that has whatnot

container ship rather a freighter that

has four holds so they pull up at the

Port of Vancouver and they can get some

grain so they fill up some grain and

then the ship goes back and sits at free

Anchorage the whole chain from Prairie

farmer through the train tracks being

clogged to putting passenger rail on the

siding costs prairie farmers money costs

their shippers money costs the Port of

Vancouver money and costs my

constituents a good night's sleep and

what does it start with we're a modern

industrialized society with nobody

paying attention anymore to getting

things to work smarter and better and we

think that against you know against

whatever public expectations there may

be about grains we're serious about

getting transportation to work better

for the farmer for the shipper for the

passenger for the environment these

things come together around doing things

smarter

she's wondering why there is a

discrepancy and I'm glad and thank Janet

I should have mentioned the fact that we

knew there might be some glitchyness in

not having had our full costing from PPO

when we brought the platform out and our

change in the trends it is a change we

realized that 0.5% was still trivial to

those doing financial transactions but

in order to meet the higher number we

did not expect pharmacare to be a twenty

seven billion dollar amount we have

adjusted and readjusted that's the one

place and absolutely correct we went to

zero point five from zero point two and

it's absolutely correct that the

platform language and how we budgeted

but we're obviously where the two come

together is the budget rules because we

need to make sure that our revenue is

sufficient to cover our our commitments

and we were not prepared to reduce one

iota our commitment to Universal

pharmacare

no no we just know we got we got our

planks costed by by the PBO and the

platform was put to bed in terms of an

arm this is backroom stuff there's an

there's there are not I see if there's

any other examples our sugary drinks tax

you'll find in the budget was at the

last minute as someone was editing the

platform they thought that sounds like a

low level of detail we don't need to

include in the platform it was always

intended to be in the platform a tax on

sugary drinks is for the purpose of

discouraging empty calories that lead to

an increase in diabetes the Heart and

Stroke Foundation the Diabetes

Association I was confident it was in

the in the platform went back and looked

and where did the tax on sugary drinks

go no it's in the budget but it's not in

the platform so there are some areas of

discrepancy and unfortunately I made the

call I take responsibility for this that

we could not delay our platform till

today and we're not prepared to be in in

you know September 25th are we today

yeah I did not want a September 25th

with an election that started September

11th be releasing our full platform

there are very few minor discrepancies

between what's in the budget and what's

in the text to the platform they are yes

that was always in our intention for

this book for this budget and this

platform and we knew the people when I

first met with PBO back in May that I

mentioned they told me they were they

were already planning to cost the wealth

tax so we didn't put that in as one of

our asks but we we've adopted it's it's

in the tits in the aspirations of the

platform it's not as crystal clear as it

could have been it was always our

intention so it's not a change it's just

clear in the budget now

has a time I can't I would yeah this is

the first year in which the PPO has had

this within their mandate I can't say

enough about how grateful I am to them

we were assigned a senior analyst from

the beginning we submitted more planks

than other parties it's true it we

didn't get our final final on a few of

these items till a point when at the

point that we launched our platforms we

still didn't have absolutely all

elements and that meant that we were

taking a bit of a risk but we were

confident that on the revenue items we'd

already seen that we could hit balance

and meet all of our promises there were

some honestly surprises that meant we

had to rethink our budget make sure we

could cover everything make sure that we

did our due diligence I can't say enough

about how grateful I am to the

Parliamentary Budget Office for the

diligence for the accessibility and and

you know when you're at again are in our

particular circumstance where a key

point person working with their senior

allit analysts received a terminal

diagnosis in the middle of the process

we also had an extremely close

relationship and a lot of personal

support coming from PBO for what we were

dealing with internally it was it was

harder than it might have been and but I

can't say enough about how grateful I am

to their for their hard work

oh yeah well the Human Rights Tribunal I

mean there were things that change as

you go forward we had to account for

another two billion dollars we weren't

expecting to make sure that I could say

to Cindy Blackstock and me net Green

Party of Canada is fully committed to

the decision of the Human Rights

Tribunal we would not go to court to

appeal it we want to ensure that every

indigenous child who's owed a good start

in this country knows the Green Party of

Canada recognizes that 2 billion dollars

is just the beginning but we will meet

that court ruling

I just had the chance to go through some

of the stuff sir well they weren't good

at first they were really good it's

popular but what it does what it doesn't

do is it doesn't provide the kind of

educational benefits that we provide

through eliminating tuition and

investing ten billion dollars in

post-secondary education so it's a

popular program I I would respectfully

disagree that it's virtue singling

although I think I like virtue signaling

better than by signaling if we're going

for signal but what what the doctors

have told us as a party we have met with

the Heart and Stroke Society we have met

with the College of Family Physicians we

have met with the Diabetes Foundation

I'm a member of the parliamentary caucus

on diabetes and TB we know that sugary

drinks constitute empty calories that

are now available in schools in vending

machines and that if you're hungry and

you grab a sugary drink that will fill

you up instead of going for an apple or

a glass of water or some milk right

we're looking at what affects that the

dietary standards of our children today

we know that for the first time and as a

child born in Knight no no that's all an

old lady born in 1954 when I was a child

we didn't have access to sugary drinks

the way kids do now the volume of empty

calories offered to children today and

that's just one of the factors a more

sedentary lifestyle there may be many

factors yeah there oh we also have

dental care for in the platform for

anyone as low income but this is the

first generation where we can look at

our kids and realize they're gonna be

less healthy than we are that's not a

nanny state issue the corporate state

that now operates in Canada we are as

much we are we are living in an occupied

state as dr. Ursula Franklin used to say

we're in an occupied state transnational

corporations have occupied our democracy

a tax on sugary drinks is a small step

but it does communicate it does mean

that at the level of a price

differential it could encourage families

to say okay bless sugary drinks more

water less sugary drinks glass of milk

less sugary drinks putting an apple in

the bag to go to school it's important

why you can't huge also there's a huge

environmental footprint I had a good

friend that was the vice president of HR

for coca-cola and I visit her all over

the world and we spent a lot of money on

resources and water and energy to ship

basically sugared water all over the

world so that's not just an impact on

the health which is huge teeth decay it

is awful for kids we all know that this

is this is a no-brainer for me but the

environmental footprint to ship this

bottled water or plastic bottle water

all over is another big game change

there's a lot of ripple effects to one

thing right so yeah so the tax on sugary

drinks is a health measure advocated by

experts and we listen to experts that's

that's our bottom line nobody has ever

come to me to say attacks on sugary

drinks from a medical organization from

a group of doctors from a group working

on a specific disease issue no one has

ever come to me and said make sugary

drinks more wildly more widely available

that'll be awesome no that is something

coca-cola will tell us

and yeah not so much any other questions

wait Mircea to Lomond met two tattoos

and thank you to the wonderful

candidates who are here I want to

mention two other cats I'm really

excited about Cape Breton just want to

say that we have no liberal incumbents

in Cape Breton so you know that's that

you
