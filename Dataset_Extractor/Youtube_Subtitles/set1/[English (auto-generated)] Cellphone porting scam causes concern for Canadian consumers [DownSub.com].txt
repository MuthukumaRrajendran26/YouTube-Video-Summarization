you are watching global national

it's been quite the fight for one

Ontario woman who recently had her phone

number hijacked fraudsters abducted her

digits and transferred them to another

carrier gaining access to everything on

her smartphone

it's called unauthorized porting Sean

O'Shay looks into what the major telecom

companies are doing to protect consumers

you get the fraudster basically on the

other end of the computer law yes which

is just it's the most it's the creepiest

you know feeling that someone is in my

personal items

Carolyn Morgan had her phone number

hijacked and thieves used it to work

their way into her email and steal from

her credit card this charge for I

believe it was seven hundred and

something Canadian dollars and I said no

that's not me

it all happened in January right after

she got this late-night text message for

her phone provider Rogers it wanted her

to confirm she was porting her number to

another wireless carrier porting is the

term used to describe a wireless carrier

moving your phone number from one

company to another typically after a

customer decides to change phone

companies but wants to keep the number

what he remember thinking when that text

was great I read it twice and then I

went oh my gosh Morgan says she called

Rogers immediately she said she sat on

hold 24 minutes that's exactly what

happened at the 24 minute mark and

that's when I realized oh there's no

phone service

she then reported the problem through a

chat line to Rogers but it took 20 hours

for the phone number to be restored

meantime the hijack of her phone number

used to authenticate Bank and email

accounts had been breached

Rogers customer service manager

explained Rogers wasn't to blame and

wasn't responsible what are you doing

for me as your customer in this case a

spokesperson told us we take protecting

our customers personal information very

seriously and as fraudsters evolve their

tactics we work with other carriers to

continually strengthen processes to

prevent unauthorized porting Morgan and

other victims say they wish the phone

carriers would be more careful they

literally handed the fraudsters are the

criminals the keys to the kingdom by not

double triple checking not having

any reinforcements in place to make sure

I'm the person who actually requested
