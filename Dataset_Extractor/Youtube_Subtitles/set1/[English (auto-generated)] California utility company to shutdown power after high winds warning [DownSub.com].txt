and we will be making that decision here

within the next hour or two our to

proceed with that d anodization and we

anticipate that we will start that

de-energization sequence you know by 8

to 10 p.m. time frame and if we see the

weather pattern continue to shift you

know we will do our level best to

minimize that impact to our customers

and communities in that area even though

we're seeing the weather pattern shift

on the start time at the moment we're

still anticipating that the weather is

going to subside at noon tomorrow again

being a forecast and if that changes to

earlier or later we will provide that

update accordingly thanks for your

patience

that we're paying for years of

mismanagement to the hundreds of

thousands of people we're going to be in

the dark tonight what do you say to them

who think that they are suffering for

your mistakes

I appreciate that sentiment and we share

the sentiments that have been out there

in terms of the impact that this has now

I can't go and speak into the mistakes

of the past what I can tell you is when

we look at the climate and the

environment in which our electrical

assets live operate breathe in it's very

dynamic and that environment has changed

drastically over the last several years

given the drought conditions given the

amount of dead dying and deceased trees

given the amount of vegetation that is

right and ready to be a strong fuel

source for a potential wildfire so the

environment that coexists with our

electrical assets has completely changed

from my perspective and the way that we

need to maintain our assets construct

them that's also changing and we that's

exactly what we're doing as part of this

with the hardening of the wires and the

high fire threat areas because you had a

marker for this year correct we did sir

so we have a target of 150 miles and we

have completed a hundred miles and we

are on track to complete a

commitment 150 miles this year right but

you have 25,000 miles of wire in -

higher threat areas and and your reports

say that you're having a hard time

finding people to actually do the work

and also the materials what steps are

you taking to do that much more quickly

because clearly that's the key reason

you're doing this because you can't

trust your own or couldn't at this point

correct well not necessarily say that we

can't trust our equipment I keep coming

back to the fact that it's the

coexistence of our equipment with the

environment and the factor of safety

that existed in the environment

naturally when the electrical systems

were compromised does not exist anymore

and that's the factor of safety that

we're looking to get from our own

infrastructure so we are actively and we

have put all hands on deck approach to

be able to get all qualified personnel

available in our service territory and

just this year we brought in more than

2,000 qualified linemen to do the

enhanced inspections which is

unprecedented we did 18 months of work

in a four month time frame so we're

doing everything we can we've nearly

doubled the amount of vegetation

qualified personnel that we have

clearing vegetation in and around our

electrical overhead system we have now

more than 5,000 individuals focused on

that effort Kristian you're next

appreciate the question you get you got

three you got three in a row we'll cut

what walk up we'll come back we'll come

back to you we'll come back to you we're

going to christian about we're also

getting a lot of frustrated viewers who

are asking if this is going to be their

new normal in other words right now

we're wondering it we have a lot of

frustrated viewers we're asking if this

is going to be our new normal in other

words what's to prevent this from

happening again in two weeks two months

perhaps even again next year is this

something people should prepare for for

periodic blackouts for days or a week at

a time going forward what's to stop that

from happening and I thank you so much

for that question and and that's what's

on top of our mind and this is exactly

the things that we're trying to do so

that we reduce the

duration and the frequency of the public

safety power shutoff events because we

know the impact that it has to our

customers and our communities itself but

given the amount of risk on the on the

especially in this time period with the

fuel conditions high wind conditions

we've seen it we saw it last year in

November we saw it in October of 2017 so

this is three years in a row and just

like we are here in the seismic part of

the world we're dealing with wildfires

is the new abnormal within California so

this is something from my perspective

right that we all have to work together

to find the right solution set for and

our focus is to continue to work on

upgrading our infrastructure so we

reduce the amount of times that we have

to do the Public Safety power shut off

and the potential duration and the

impact so customers should anticipate

similar shutdowns in the future until

this work is completed unless the the

weather changes come significantly and

the vegetation condition and the fuel

loading condition and the land and the

forest management changes significantly

within the state I would say yes I think

what we need to understand I think

sumeet hit on the earthquake part of

that people have plans for earthquakes

how to deal with them they're prepared

they have their go packs they have a

plan for their family we suggest the

same thing for a wildfire it's a very

similar concept we have a plan that

we're executing now to turn off the

power we want our customers and

communities to be prepared to do the

same thing they should have a plan we're

gonna go back here to Natalie with NBC

berry and news following up on this line

of questioning the new normal is is

climate change in wildfires your utility

in Northern California are you

fortifying your utility system to be

able to survive those wild fires or is

this the new normal we are absolutely

doing that and that's really what I was

speaking to in terms of the effort that

we have we have more than 8,000

qualified personnel working on

clearing vegetation doing enhanced

inspections doing undergrounding

overhead resiliency of the system to

really have that electric infrastructure

that now naturally creates the factor of

safety that the environment has taken

away from the coexistence here so we can

understand the conversation

when will that work be complete a

multi-year journey it's it's not it took

many years to get to this you know

condition the climate change the

environment but the drought conditions

we've discussed the vegetation

conditions changed in a very rapid

fashion and we do have a significant

risk on our electrical system and this

is the measure that's needed as a last

resort to ensure the safety of our

customers and communities and as we

continue that infrastructure work and as

we continue to do that work safely and

as quickly and expeditiously

expeditiously as possible we'll be able

to reduce the impact of the public

safety power shut off events so it's a

multi-year journey this is Emily Turner

KPIX 5 so you don't you want to talk

about climate change and you don't want

to talk about mistakes made in the past

but there are a lot of angry customers

out there who will not let that go why

is your utility not prepared for this

new normal so when my perspective I have

not spent my focus time and energy on

looking at the past we are where we are

but the electric infrastructure and the

environment and there's a lot of

questions in terms of could we have done

things sooner should we have done things

sooner we are at this point in time and

what I could tell you is that we are

doing everything that we can and I can

tell you the 24,000 employees that we

have in this company and thousands of

contractors that are supporting us

because they're an extension of our PG&E

family are sacrificing their lives

personally to be able to ensure the

safety of our customers and communities

we have not and I have not gone back to

look at why wasn't done we are where we

are at the moment and we can all Monday

Morning Quarterback this right from my

perspective but our focus here

is to ensure the safety now and on a

going-forward basis and have that

unwavering commitment to do that and

that's exactly what we're doing and

that's part of your community wildfire

safety program the multi-faceted program

that's correct what percentage would you

say but okay well - two questions one so

would it be fair to say that you

actually have no estimate as to when the

work will be done be completed is that

fair to say

yeah the we do have an estimate and that

estimate we've put forward as part of

the wildfire mitigation plan that was

filed publicly available and that's

those approved there's one behind I'm

sorry which plan that you're running

behind on if you tell the PUC in July

that you're ready behind even that plan

no we have when you look at the the

goals and the commitments of the plan

respectfully sir we are at would have

exceeded many of those milestones the

area that we are continuing to fall a

little bit behind schedule on is our

enhanced vegetation management program

but we have line of sight to be able to

complete all of that work as well by the

end of this year and what percentage

would you say you are at what percentage

are you the work at this point 50

percent 75 25 percent what work sir in

the total scope of the work how far

along are you 25% 50% 75% depends on

what type of work sir that we're talking

about just about the overall program so

we talk about the overall program for

system hardening we are right on plan in

terms of 75 percent complete when we

talk about system enhanced vegetation

management we're about 50 percent

complete when you talk about weather

stations high-definition cameras we've

done all of the work that we had on plan

for this year so when you look at the 53

commitments that are outlined in the

2019 wildfire mitigation plan we have

either met many of those commitments or

exceeded them and we're doing our level

best to bring all the qualified

personnel here so we can continue down

those aggressive goals because we

realize the implications of those goals

because as all goes back to the safety

of the infrastructure and the customers

communities Judy how fast the winds

actually get in the North Bay today

because we've been hearing a lot of

concerns that it actually wasn't that

windy even on the peaks there and given

the delay in phase two when do you

expect power will be fully restored to

everybody yeah great question I'll take

the first one first and then Sammy can

handle the second one on restoration so

so winds actually at North Bay and don't

get complacent because the strong winds

are coming tonight so we're gonna very

much like October 2017 the strongest

winds occurred once the Sun set and we

had the fires ripping over some of the

elevated terrain in the North Bay of the

northern Sierra and we're expecting a

very similar setup tonight so the

strongest winds are are on the way if

not occurring now if I was checking a

Mount st. Helena live I could I could

guarantee that that station is ticking

up as an indication of what's to come as

far as restoration I'll turn it out why

was Marin County de-energize at like

2:00 in the morning or whenever it was

this morning if they haven't had any

intense wind even on the peaks there yet

yeah I think Sumi touched on this but

this had to do with the

interconnectedness of the grid correct

me if I'm wrong no thank you Scott and

thank you Judy for that question so

given the complexity and the complex

nature of the de-energization sequence

and the multiple areas within our

service territory that are in scope the

Dene organization sequence that we had

to implement has to ensure that

continued stability of the grid itself

and that's the reason why we

unfortunately also had to impact the

moraine and some of the additional areas

that really are going to see that peak

risk time period this evening going into

early tomorrow morning it really has to

do with the the nature of the system

itself

the very last thing why or what is the

total number of customers that will now

be impacted across the entire event

before was 800,000 but it sounds like

it's been scaled back some people are

going back on I think people are going

to get a little confused about what

what's the right customer number to use

yeah so this is a multi-part event with

different stages of weather weather

different parts of our service territory

so ultimately that number of 800,000

customers is still appropriate in terms

of total customers impacted but some

customers may be impacted for a less

duration than others

so at the moment we're forecasting

anywhere from 600 to 650 thousand

because of the additional switching

operations we were able to do to reduce

impact to 50 thousand and especially if

we're able to bring Humbolt on this

evening that's an incremental 60 to 80

thousand here in the front row we'll go

in the back and then we'll come to the

front row no you're going first in the

back hi Gail from kron4news so your

customers are angry with the lack of

communication and calling it horrific

you know would one day notice for

potentially hundreds of thousand

something households will be in the dark

or do you want to take that question

customer communication so thank you for

the question as to me stated this is a

dynamic event and as the event continues

to unfold we're doing our very best to

be in advance of that and communicating

to customers there are some instances

where the conditions changed and we were

communicating with customers closer into

the actual event than we would have

liked to but we're doing our very best

to provide ongoing communication and

ongoing support to our customers it is a

it's a unique website and we'll be

pushing that out to all of you at the

conclusion of tonight's press conference

it will be on all of our social channels

and we'll be tweeting that out at the

conclusion of this of this conference

thank you perfect I'm making bolts view

with KCBS radio so I want to make sure I

understand the East Bay South Bay phase

it was noon it got pushed to eight it

might be 10 is there a world in which it

doesn't happen at all can we keep

pushing this back

through the night or can we tell those

customers oh no it's happening

we just are pushing you back as we watch

the weather yes based on the latest

weather forecasts that we monitored it

looks like this waves first gonna start

in the Sierra and it's pretty much

starting now it's going to arrive in the

North Bay a little bit later and then

it's gonna arrive farther south in the

East Bay and South Bay basically Santa

Cruz Mountains at the time that was

communicated about 8:00 p.m. tonight and

a little bit later so essentially based

on the latest weather forecast models

I've seen the winds are are still

expected to arrive we could see peak us

over some of the elevated terrain in the

East Bay like Oakland Hills North

Oakland Hills South some of those

weather stations as well as you know

Sunol Ridge some of the ridges of East

Bay as well as the Santa Cruz Mountains

we could see gusts you know 45 50 miles

per hour tonight overnight is the kind

of peak risk period I know we're talking

about weather here but based on the

latest forecast I believe it too

happened however we're monitoring

conditions 24/7 and if the weather

doesn't materialize as expected then we

do have the opportunity to abort in any

situation but we'll need some good

confidence in that happening that is

what we're doing a level best to be

judicious right both in terms of the

timing and aligning that with the

weather forecast

and also minimizing the impact of

potential catastrophic wildfires so

because we do understand the disruption

they're shutting off power causes on

this issue of safety to employees there

are reports of a Gihon of PG&E station

or office in Northern California and

shots at a PG&E event of e fo for the

CHP reported this evening can you talk

about D have specific reports of

assaults against workers or property you

think what you're referring to is what

may have occurred in Clouseau County I

think that occurred yesterday or last

night we would refer to the local

authorities for the details of the

incident itself which is the the reason

why

in our prepared remarks I ended on that

comment it's critically important for us

to be able to get this message out there

when you see a marked PG&E week vehicle

or contractors that are working on our

behalf

again just a reminder they're no

different than our customers and their

families and their kids go to the same

schools that our customers do so it's

critically important that we're

providing a safe environment for them

and those are the types of you know

incidents that really cause us concern

again in that specific incident we don't

know the specific details the local

authorities may have that but it's you

know our responsibility to ensure that

continued safety not just of our

customers and our communities but our

employees and our contractors as well

and by keeping everyone safe that's

going to help get everybody's lights

back on quicker if there's a law

enforcement situation that's just going

to cause the dirt the outage to continue

to go on sure can we get you a

microphone I would love it thank you Dan

that much of the billions of dollars

that was earmarked for maintenance at

least part of it has wound up in

shareholders pockets can you assure me

that every dollar earmarked for

maintenance over the past ten years has

actually gone to maintenance thank you

for that question de and I haven't

focused on that that is not a question

on top of my mind at the moment that's a

historical issue from my perspective

there's a lot of people that are focused

on that issue the unwavering focus that

we have and every single individual and

every single employee and every single

contractor at this moment is to ensure

the continued safety of our customers

and our communities given the adverse

weather forecasts that we are seeing in

regards to the catastrophic wildfires

and that is our only focus at the moment

I am not focused on that so respectfully

last question or one more here and one

for Kristian Jean le with NBC Bay Area

News one is sort of a well let me ask

one and then I'll ask you a bringing

power back on you said the weather event

is supposed to end on Friday does that

mean that's when inspections will begin

and inspections will happen too during

the day if there are repairs needed can

repairs happen at night and so if the

weather event ends on Friday when is the

earliest folks and say Sausalito can

expect to have their power back on okay

thank you for that thank you for that

question so in regards to you know the

process so there's two different areas

you mentioned Friday so Friday applies

to our phase three which is in the

Tehachapi area because we're forecasting

that peak risk to continue through

tomorrow into Friday so that's the about

4,300 customers we identified in the

Tehachapi Kern County area in regards to

a large majority of our customers that

have been impacted in Sierra Foothills

and East Bay and South Bay we anticipate

at the moment again this is the weather

forecast to be able to have the

all-clear meaning the adverse weather

forecast

sub size and traverses through our

service territory during that time frame

at which point we can begin our visual

inspections and as we do the visual

inspections and we identify circuits and

lines if there's no damage we'll be able

to do that restoration in a very short

timeframe where there is potential

damage that may take some additional

time so a key takeaway if we get the

adverse weather that subsides around

noon tomorrow

that's when we're going to commence with

more than 6300 qualified personnel 45

helicopters to start the visual

inspections and safety inspections and

you're going to start to see the

restoration come on at that period of

time we do have to typically stop at

sundown because those visual inspections

can only be done safely during daylight

hours

technical questions so these these

happen in waves why does it happen in

waves our people act a substation and it

would be the reverse in bringing power

up I'm going to guess it

in waves can you explain the waves sure

it's the coexistence of the weather

itself so Scot previously talked about

when you typically see this northeast

offshore wind pattern it starts with the

north south winds and Sacramento Valley

comes in through Sierra Foothills and

then later traverses to the north bay

area and then later traverses to East

Bay so different parts of our service

territory

see peak risk at different points in

time and then with the electrical grid

it is the source feed typically is at

the substation so when we start to

de-energize especially the large

footprint that we're talking about here

we also have to work closely with the

California Independent System Operator

Cal ISO to ensure that we're not

compromising the stability of the power

flow because we are all interconnected

on the Western grid so that's the reason

why at times you'll see an impact North

Bay even though there may be a peak risk

that's happening in the Sierra Foothills

so that's the reason why you see the the

wave and the sequencing and the reason

why we do the sequencing is again what

we stated before we want to minimize the

duration of the impact of the power

outages to our customers know we have if

we could do manual operations but

primarily we leverage remote

capabilities through what's called SCADA

it's a supervisory control and data

acquisition system where we have the

ability through our control center to be

able to operate our system we're coming

over here to Christian you don't have a

microphone so nobody can hear you on the

line quick question for mr. Emoto about

the that website and how it unfolds two

things first off when people are able to

access it if they are currently in a

power shutdown area we'll this forward

information to them about when their

power may be restored or is this simply

a site to let people know which homes

are going to be affected firstly

secondly are you sure that it's robust

enough because there have been a great

deal of complaints about the current

website which I believe last night's who

needed said and received seven to eight

times it's normal volume are you sure

that this new website is real bust

enough to handle the volume so the first

question is initially as we launch

tonight customers will be able to go and

find out information around their

community and their specific home as we

move into tomorrow we're going to start

building the capabilities for us to post

estimated time of restoration for

customers so tonight it's outages and

then as we move through the next 24

hours we're going to build out the

capability so that we can have customers

receive information through that source

around estimated times of restoration

for their homes and their communities

the second question around the

robustness of it it is robust we're

using a third-party to host this we've

been working very closely with Cal OES

and the CPUC they have been supporting

us and reviewing this as we have been

building this out and we are confident

that it has the robustness to handle the

volume that our customers are going to

need as as they come into the site this

will not be a site that customers can

use to pay their bills or to do other

types of transactions that will still be

housed on PG&E comm this site will be

specifically focused on supporting

customers through this event last

question for George so again just to be

clear if your initial you're saying noon

then a is it now that you're looking at

more like 10:00 p.m. is the window to

start phase two yeah so our goal

typically is before we get into the

actual weather event window several

hours before that we would start the

de-energization sequence so that we have

our system D energized and in a safe

state and condition before we start to

see the adverse wind events so you know

that conversations happening and the

decision making hat is happening at the

moment right now in our Emergency

Operations Center so that window is

anywhere from 7 p.m.

to the 9 p.m. timeframe to actually

start the power set of X there and again

it could you know be moved to later if

you know the weather pattern shifts

again so that's at the moment the best

available information we have and again

just to summarize from Jay's question

earlier you're looking at 600 to 650 is

gonna be the affected amount just to

clarify that correct

the total customers impacted were about

800,000 but where we are in terms of the

50,000 that we were able to bring back

because of what I discussed and the work

we're trying to do to bring Humboldt

back if you add that together it's about

a hundred thousand so we're kind of in

that 650 700 you know estimate the the

fifty thousand were within the Sierra

Foothills area in different parts of our

system we were able to do the operations

and bifurcate the customers that are in

the lower fire risk area compared to the

elevated and extreme fire risk area okay

so we've got to get back to make some

decisions for the East Bay tonight so

we're going to thank everybody for

coming appreciate you being here and

we'll do another one of these tomorrow

night we are committed to doing these

throughout the process to make sure you

guys are up to date so thank you

you
