hello I'm Mercedes Stevenson and this is

the West block politics perspectives and

players late last week Conservative

Party leader Andrew Scheer released his

party platform outlining exactly what he

would do for the country if he is

elected as prime minister why did he

wait until so late in the campaign to do

this and what are some of his promises I

sat down with the Conservative leader to

find out almost immediately after his

platform was released in British

Columbia

here's that conversation Mr Shearer

welcome to the West block thank you for

joining us thanks very much for having

me again this has been a unique campaign

it's been a campaign that often we hear

this from viewers and from voters across

the country who's been very negative

people describe it as a race to the

bottom a competition over who's the

bigger liar instead of a vision for

Canada what do you say to voters who are

frustrated with your campaign and

frustrated with the way that politicians

have conducted themselves I'm actually

very pleased by our campaign we've every

day we've had a positive message about

how we're going to make life more

affordable for Canadians we start off

almost every day with an announcement

about a tax cut or a new tax credit and

and that is what our message is so you

know every campaign other things come up

as well and we obviously respond to some

of the false attacks that liberals or

other parties might make against us but

by and large every day we are telling

Canadians a story about how we're going

to run a government that lives within

its means so we can put more money in

their pocket so they can get ahead but

you've run a lot of attacks against

Justin Trudeau and you're just now

releasing your costed platform

it's Friday before the Thanksgiving long

weekend you would promise to release it

before voters went to the advanced polls

that didn't happen why did you wait so

long

well the ads that we're running a speak

to the the question of trust this

election I believe the ballot question

is who do you trust to lower taxes to

put more money in your pocket and when

we look at trust we can't trust Justin

Trudeau broken promises from the last

campaign outright lies that Yves told

that he's told when it really as it

relates to the SNC lavell an affair and

things of that nature

we promised Canadians that we would

unveil our platform with plenty of

plenty of time for election day and

before advanced polls we did that today

here in

Columbia and this is the perfect weekend

for people to discuss around the

Thanksgiving Day table a Thanksgiving

supper table and talk about what each

party is offering and what the different

platforms contain so we thought that

this was the perfect time we also had

great news to announce even even this

week we had exciting new measures that

we were announcing for Canadians and so

if you and if we announce your platform

too early sometimes you're not able to

highlight each and every specific policy

people won't have had a lot of time to

digest it if they're voting today though

which a number of Canadians will

thousands of Canadians across the

country engage in advanced polls and I'm

sure the dinner table at Thanksgiving is

where lots of people will debate

politics but they haven't had a chance

to look at this in depth and in detail

don't you think that that runs the risk

of playing right into the concern some

voters have that you're going to cover

govern through significant cuts or what

the Liberals have been saying you're

going to govern like Doug Ford not at

all and I think when people look at each

and every day we've announced fully

costed platform announcements it's all

with parliamentary budget officer

analysis and that is in sharp contrast

with the Liberals not only do they fail

to do that throughout the campaign but

when they release their platform over

half of their commitments weren't even

costed so I believe that Canadians over

the course of this campaign up to today

and Beyond have enough information to

say that okay the Conservatives are

going to run a responsible plan to get

back to balanced budgets they've

announced exciting tax cuts like the

universal tax cut which will leave $850

in the pockets of a average income

earning couple the public transit tax

credit the home renovation tax credit

and they're gonna see that under Justin

Trudeau it's going to be massive

deficits with which threaten those

social programs or a Conservative

government that will get back to

balanced budgets and lower taxes there

are billions of dollars worth of cuts in

here cuts that you're proud of but would

you run an austerity government not at

all and that is it's all about choices

it's it's the priorities what we're

saying is we're going to take 1.5

billion dollars out of the corporate

welfare envelope right now they're

billions of dollars are sent to highly

profitable companies or companies that

take the taxpayers dollars that they

receive and they actually invested

overseas we're going to reduce the

foreign aid budget by 25 percent

we also are going to look at how the

government operates

in and of itself not programs and

services but how it spends money within

departments we're going to eliminate the

practice of March Madness which you know

in Ottawa the end of every fiscal year

hundreds of millions of dollars are

blowing out the door rather than

returned back to the Treasury we're

going to look at the practice of outside

consultants coming in often two or three

times the hourly rate of the highly

trained experienced public servants that

could be doing the work that outside

consultants are doing and in that way

we're going to free up the money to

bring in the universal tax cut to bring

in the public transit and the kids

sports and activities tax cut so it's a

choice with the Liberals you pay higher

taxes on inefficient government with the

Liberals you get a balanced budgets

lower taxes more money in your pocket

will you commit when it comes to cutting

government operating costs that you will

not cut services and you will not cut

any jobs absolutely and and we're going

beyond that we're actually going to

increase spending for health care and

education we are committed to the

current formula which means at least

three percent increases every year for

health care post-secondary education and

important social programs on corporate

welfare you talk about cutting examples

like giving the money to Loblaws for

their refrigerators but a lot of

economists are saying we could be

heading into a global recession if we

are plunged into that next year are you

ruling out the possibility of corporate

bailouts for big Canadian companies like

Bombardier or for example your

predecessor Stephen Harper who bailed

out the auto industry mmm what we're

saying is that when you look at when you

look at the current fiscal state tens of

billions of dollars a year in deficits

have a cost that represents cuts in and

of itself because every time the

Liberals bar another ten to twenty

billion dollars in a fiscal year that

has to be paid back and has to be paid

back with interest so when we look at

how various various government programs

this is go this goes across all

different departments there are so many

different types of programs that provide

some assistance or another - to

corporations and what we're saying is

we're going to put in a criteria that it

can't go to highly profitable companies

it can't go to companies are going to

take that the taxpayers dollars of

Canadians and invest in other countries

that can't go to pay for bonuses for

executives we're going to establish

those criteria it's much better if we

are facing some troubling

and there are some signs around the

world and anytime you see protectionist

streaks go through various countries

there's always some risk when you look

at the foreign direct investment that

has left Canada especially in the energy

sector of course that means that we are

going to have to be prudent that's

precisely why we have to get back to

balanced budgets now the Liberals have

left us with no flexibility no room to

maneuver in the event of a downturn with

these types of targeted broad-based tax

relief proposals that we're bringing in

as well as getting our energy sector

back up we're going to see a lot more

economic economic activity thanks to

that but does that mean that you would

consider bailouts for big corporations I

mean when you look at a catastrophic a

potential catastrophic failure like we

saw in the auto sector when you look at

what our largest trading partner does

when there's a systemic shock to one

sector or another obviously governments

have to make decisions in the moment

what we're saying is today looking at

the liberal plan five years out billions

and billions of dollars worth of

deficits each and every year adding to

the cost of the debt meaning hundreds of

millions more billions of dollars more

every year just going to pay banks and

bondholders the people who own that debt

that's wasted money that's money that

could be going into better services for

canyons or into tax cuts as you just

said you don't have a lot of wiggle room

the Liberals if you win have not left to

a lot of local wiggle room due to the

deficit if you end up in a situation

where there is also a recession you're

going to have to make some tough

decisions about how you come to balance

are you committed to coming to balance

on the budget within four years no

matter what even at the cost of

potentially having to raise revenue or

cut services or would you be willing to

push that off so this is a classic

liberal tactic where they create a giant

fiscal mess and then they say well the

Conservatives aren't going to clean it

up the way that the way we want them to

we're not going to take any lessons from

them they're already out trying to put

press there their message and I'm not

going to take any lessons from a party

that can't even cost their own platform

and now they're trying to attack our

platform we but we we have confidence in

our economic plan that we've a table

it's based on Parliamentary Budget

Office projections it's based on the the

analysis that that

Canadian economists look at what the

trends are going to be like for the next

few years already won by your own

numbers you don't have a lot of wiggle

room with this plan so if you have to

spend unexpectedly or if you're not able

to save in the way that you've projected

you could be in big trouble well I

disagree I think when when you look at

the amount of wiggle room we free up by

lowering the interest payment charges

that the government currently has to pay

that's billions of dollars a year

difference between the Liberals in our

plan that's significant and that

actually gives us more room to maneuver

so we made the commitment we're not

going to raise taxes we're gonna lower

taxes we're gonna put money back in the

pockets of Keynes Justin Trudeau has to

explain where he's going to get the

money for his platform we know he's

going to raise the carbon tax we know

he's he speculated on raising other

taxes with our plan you can be sure

we're gonna get back to balanced budgets

we're gonna increase spending for

healthcare education social programs and

leave more money in the pockets of

Keynes why are you looking at reducing

the amount of infrastructure spending

and you're saying it's the same amount

the Liberals have committed to but over

more time cities are saying we need

clean water we need new cedar sewers we

need a transit system what do you say to

those cities what we say to them is that

we're going to be there we're gonna be

there as partners we're to get those

projects built right now the Liberals

don't have an infrastructure plan to

actually get the money going into the

ground into shovels in the ground what

we're saying is that we're going to

spend the exact same amount of money

over more time for a slightly longer

period of time in order for that plan to

work for the projects to actually get

underway that allows us to stop the

practice of borrowing billions and

billions of dollars well still at the

same time getting important projects

built we've made significant commitments

a rock-solid commitment for the the the

yagna Ontario line expansions in Toronto

the Massey tunnel replacement here in

in the Delta region and the quasi only

at Quebec so those are significant big

pieces of infrastructure we're committed

to as well as all the other types of

projects that other municipalities will

be asking for and we're going to help

communities municipalities meet the

standards that we're going to set to

stop the practice of raw sewage getting

dumped into our oceans rivers and lakes

so we're going to be their full partners

in infrastructure maintaining record

levels those same high levels of

spending and I know the Liberals are

going to try to say otherwise but the

fact of the matter is what our plan will

actually get projects built their plan

isn't you talk a lot about the

difficulty the average family has in

making ends meet and one of the big

areas that people say they experienced

significant expenses in and it can be

very expensive for the government in the

long term is the ability to pay for

their medication the other parties are

all saying that they would introduce a

national pharma care program you're not

offering that why not well what we've

said is that when you look at the km

population up to 95 percent of Canadians

are eligible for some coverage or

another either a workplace plan a

provincial plan that exists already and

what the Liberals are talking about is a

multi-billion dollar plan to replace

what the free market is providing many

many people and what provincial programs

are already covering so it doesn't so

for them they have to explain where

they're going to get the billions of

dollars to pay for that and I don't want

to see Canadians get less coverage than

they currently have with a current plan

and have to pay more for it so we've

announced that we're going to start the

process for filling in the gaps and

we're going to start with people who

have rare diseases whose medications

often cost astronomically higher than

than other types of medications we're

going to start with that and then we're

going to prudently work with the

provinces to to fill in those gaps are

you worried that could cost you with

voters who were being offered the chance

to have what are often significant

expenses covered by the other parties

with a Pharma care program no because we

know that the Liberals are gonna make

life more expensive on the whole and

what the Liberals it's always raised

attacks over here and then pretend to

give some back over there

Canadians won't be better off paying a

higher carbon tax they won't be higher

off paying higher payroll taxes small

business owners won't be better off

paying high

taxes under the liberal so we're gonna

leave thousands of dollars in the

pockets of Keynes we're gonna help

canyons deal with the affordability of

the cost-of-living crunch and I'm very

confident that Canadians will look and

see in fact the Liberals have been

promising this since the 90s the fact

that they've hired it's based on

recommendations from a Kathleen Wynne

era cabinet minister I don't think

Canadians are gonna have any faith in a

program developed by one of Kathleen

Wynne's cabinet ministers and they're

certainly not going to have confidence

in this Liberal government being able to

administer a program of that nature

speaking of Kathleen Wynne you haven't

campaigned with Doug Ford you did

campaign with mr. Kenney the premier of

Alberta who you imported why hasn't mr.

Ford been a part of your campaign

well the premier decided that he was

going to stay focused on provincial

politics he's got a big mess to clean up

after so many years of Dalton McGuinty

and Kathleen Wynne raising taxes running

deficits being mired in scandals he's

got a lot of work on his plate is he

just too toxic to bring him near your

campaign you know it's when we talked to

Canada sigh I check in with my

candidates every single day and when our

candidates are going door-to-door

they're hearing about affordability

they're hearing about the S&C lavell and

scandal they're hearing about the crime

in their communities that's what they're

focused on that's we're hearing at the

doors questions about which Paulette

other politicians are campaigning with

federal leaders it has never come up at

the doors and we're gonna continue to

face focused on providing Canadians with

a plan to make life more affordable so

they can get ahead there are questions

about who is Andrew sure you're still

really having to introduce yourself to

voters and you face a lot of criticism

from the Liberals when it comes to some

of your personal values they say you're

too much of a social conservative you

didn't march in the climate marches you

never marched in a gay pride parade what

do you have to say to voters who wonder

especially moderate voters in this

election who are swinging and youth

whether or not your values align with

theirs

well my message is the same as it's

always been and first of all it's always

a challenge for a leader of the

Opposition to to be introduced to

Canadians it's I've spoken to with other

leaders of the opposition and they've

all said the same thing that

really up until an election campaign

that Canadians have the opportunity to

to get to know you and to hear what you

have to say we are a big tent party and

everyone is welcome in our party if you

believe in individual liberty if you

believe in smaller government and more

dynamic free market then your you have a

home in the in the Conservative Party of

Canada we are inclusive party that

respects the point of view people from

all different walks of life people of

all different sexual orientations from

all different ethnicities for all

different faiths and i pride myself on

being the type of leader that finds the

common ground between all different

kinds of conservatives to focus on

making life better for Canadians but you

personally is the leader why wouldn't

you March in a gay pride parade or the

climate freight it seems like there's no

downside to that for you well you know

there's lots of different ways to show

support to the LGBT community

I've got had a motion in the House of

Commons to call on the government to do

more to help people who are being

persecuted because of their sexual

orientation I participated in the

historic apology to public servants who

were persecuted because of their sexual

orientation and when it comes to the the

climate March I saw a lot of signs in

that March that said actions not words

when I see Justin Trudeau marching in

that for it in and that in that protest

it just rings of such hypocrisy and the

irony was incredible here is a prime

minister is basically marching against

himself and so we decided on that day

that we were going to make announcements

on significant concrete ways to make

life better for Canadians including

investments in public transit which we

know has a an impact on reducing

emissions turning abroad right now

Turkey is making an incursion into Syria

they are killing Kurds who have been

Canadian allies in the war against Isis

do you believe that turkey should remain

as a member of NATO given these

activities well that is a very important

question I think NATO members are going

to have to be looking at obviously we

would expect that all members of NATO

live up to the obligations the

international international law and

human rights

very concerned about the situation I

believe it was a mistake to pull troops

out of of that part of Syria and

basically leave our allies you know the

Kurds who had fought side-by-side with

us against the the fight against Isis so

I'm very concerned of what's going on

there

there are questions inside the

Conservative Party here at home about

your leadership and about how you've

done in this election that you've not

been able to pull it out of the Hat or

pull ahead despite some gifts like the

blackface video which politically was an

unforced error that the Liberals have

had to deal with snz lavalla

and and still it seems like you can't

get traction and they're already looking

at who your successor is have you talked

to Peter MacKay who is the name floated

as the potential successor since those

stories surfaced I am focused on October

21st and our entire team is and and I I

hear every day from our candidates

across the country from people have

helped our party in the past they are

excited about October 21st very

optimistic I'm very confident that we're

going to former that we are going to

form a majority government have you

talked to Peter McKenna I speak to Peter

MacKay often I see him at many different

events my my current schedule has me and

here in British Columbia today and

debating the other day in Ottawa but I

know Peter is a committed member of our

team at our convention in Halifax in

2018 I paid tribute to the fact that

he's a builder he understands the need

to keep a party united to to work to

achieve the ultimate goal which is

providing good government to Canadians

government that respects their tax

dollars and makes it easier to get ahead

in this country I know that's what he's

focused on that's what I'm focused on

that's what our entire team is focused

on we're here in BC and the pipeline and

any pipeline really is very

controversial here you've pledged a

national energy corridor in order to do

that you may have to override the

objections of indigenous people and of

provinces are you confident that you're

willing to put that pipeline through put

that energy corridor through at any cost

the the key is to address environmental

concerns when people say if you put a

pipeline here you threaten this aquifer

or it's not safe in this region and a

proponent can say that's a legitimate

concern you're right we're gonna go and

dress that that is precise the the

constructive way that we can deal with

people and we can work with people who

have environmental concerns

conservatives are environmentalists we

want to protect our waterways we want to

protect our oceans

we have to acknowledge the fact that

there are some people who are saying no

no matter what who are blocking projects

no matter what not because they may have

a specific concern that could be

addressed but they just don't want the

energy sector to develop in Canada that

that is their agenda and so to those

people we say look we're not going to

allow a small group of people block the

types of projects that bring enormous

potential an enormous prosperity to

indigenous Canadians to people all

throughout Canada manufacturing jobs

that depend on the energy sector

refining jobs we're saying we're going

to develop a geographic space with a

national energy corridor to address

indigenous concerns to find out the the

most environmentally friendly wave the

most the route that it takes into

account all those sensitivities that is

the best for our environment and then

we're going to allow projects to proceed

does that mean though that for example

the entire province of Quebec or our

first nation would not have the ability

to say no at the end of the day I

respect provincial jurisdiction I also

respect federal jurisdiction and I'm

confident that Quebecers I will want to

choose energy - a new it's right now

we've got a significant percentage of of

gasoline being used in Quebec that comes

from the United States

Quebecers don't want to send their

consumer dollars to Donald Trump's

America I believe that they'd rather

support Canadian energy and that's why I

believe that this energy quarter

achieves that will allow Quebec to see

realize its benefits when it comes to

hydro and-and-and here in BC you know we

we see people in British Columbia

protesting and blocking exports of

Canadian energy when on the eastern side

of Canada we have tanker after tanker

foreign oil coming up the st. Lawrence

are coming in from the United States

that doesn't make any sense when I speak

to Quebecers about it

they're very excited about the prospect

of having Canadian energy in in in in

Quebec and also allowing Quebec to share

its hydroelectricity without with with

other project provinces which is

something that's very important to

Premier Li go as well you made a big

promise on immigration saying that you

would stop people from making irregular

border crossings in order to do that

you'd have to change something called

the safe third country agreement you'd

need the United States to agree to that

the Liberal government has explored it

they haven't gone

kind of a bite from the Donald Trump

administration what would you offer to

mr. Trump to change this agreement which

so far is working just fine for them

well we don't actually know what the

Liberals have done you know they've had

very mixed messages on this they've said

sometimes they were considering it then

that they weren't so we don't know what

type of efforts they've actually made I

believe it's in both our country's best

interest to have an orderly border a

safe orderly and compassionate

immigration system where our country's

borders can be it can have its integrity

maintained so I'm caught confident and

optimistic that there will be a

willingness on the side of the United

States we we also have some tools at our

disposal here at home that we get that

will contemplate as well the goal is to

make sure that our immigration refugee

system prioritizes people who follow the

rules and are facing real danger and

someone who is crossing in from upstate

New York is not facing the same type of

persecution that someone who's waiting

in a refugee camp or fleeing Civil War

is facing and I don't believe that

people should be able to jump the line

or skip the queue because they have the

means to get upstate New York when there

are so many you know hundreds of

thousands of people who would be killed

if they left a refugee camp our system

should prioritize those people Mr

Shearer thank you for joining us thank

you very much that's all the time we

have for today thank you for joining us

for the West block I'm resetti Stevenson
