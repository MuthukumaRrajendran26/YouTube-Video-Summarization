thank you for joining us here today for

our second national caucus meeting since

the election and welcome and

congratulations again to all of you you

fought you fought hard and you won the

right to represent your constituents and

the reason why Justin Trudeau lost his

majority is because the people in this

very room who worked so hard and it is

so exciting to see so many more

conservatives in this room

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

it's great to see our new members from

Atlantic Canada it's great to see our

new members of parliament from Ontario

[Applause]

because of all of you we are the only

national party that has this new

subpoena CIA CIA shut to ope and now

this is it this is the week it's time to

get to work Canada Jemaine especially to

commune back upon go state level and

he's on juniper had quit juvenile

tomorrow the House of Commons is back in

session and the stakes could not be

higher

our country is more divided than ever

deep cracks are showing in confederation

under the Liberals our economy is

bleeding jobs in Alberta and

Saskatchewan and forestry workers in BC

and other ramifications are spreading

across the country nearly half of

Canadian families are 200 dollars away

from financial insolvency at the end of

every month a record number of Canadians

declare bankruptcy this past September

president wanted FME kennedy so a

distant allow play the links of ability

other thing do one in number record the

Kennedy on declare a fight on September

there continue to be worrying economic

science and the threat of a possible

downturn grows every day meanwhile

infrastructure is not getting built

leaving major urban areas like the GTA

strangled by gridlock and at a time when

Canada needs strong relationships more

than ever

Justin Trudeau's poor judgment lack of

professionalism and love of drama

continues to weaken Canada's position on

the world stage at the NATO summit

he's also abandoning our friends what

they just did to Israel at the United

Nations

ladies and gentlemen I still believe I

am still convinced the Canada's best

days lie ahead too late to turn things

around it here in Ottawa we as a team

stand together United we are focused on

one shared goal and prosperity getting

rid of a scandal-plagued deficit running

Liberal government and replacing it with

a Conservative government that puts

Canadians first and will heal this

country

[Applause]

suppose a supermodel ever had upon

c-clone J don't late deficit in

opposition consummate lease they sponsor

black eagle-vail donator the Thule

Canadian now I am optimistic because I

believe that Canadians will see that

they are not alone all those who are

disappointed in their government will

see that there is still a party that

fights for the success of all Canadians

there is still a party that believes in

the best of Canada and there's still a

party that will bring this country

together not by tearing one region down

or pinning parts of this country against

each other but by uniting Canadian

and as we form the strongest opposition

in history Canadians will see that the

problem is not their fellow Canadians

their problem is not other parts of this

country their problem is Justin Trudeau

and the way he has divided Canadians

[Applause]

Dilys want to Canada the Canadian for

vodka program Nepalese author Kennedy

the problem is just aims to do and all

Canadians have put him on notice they

have given this Liberal government the

weakest mandate in Canadian history

despite all the pundits and experts

saying just a little while ago that the

Liberals were easily going to coast to

two or three majority governments he has

already lost the trust of most Canadians

because while he had his majority he was

able to do pretty much whatever he

wanted he even abused the power of his

office to reward his friends and

punished his critics but in this

minority Parliament we are putting him

on notice we're not going to let them

get away with anything

we're not going to let them get away

with raising taxes or attacking small

business owners we're not going to let

him attack our energy sector with bills

like c69

we're not going to allow him to cripple

future generations by massive amounts of

new debt news that only bachelor and

your background car new bachelor Kong

conveys all staple these attack condos

on till please he knows how to open up a

portal you need a Canadian we'll fight

then we'll fight some more we're gonna

fight for our farmers across this

country we're going to fight for

manufacturing workers in Ontario we're

going to fight for energy workers in

Alberta and Saskatchewan we're gonna

fight for forestry workers in British

Columbia all that so that could put a

project or lady a-okay back at a pet

show don't let logic we must fight

because we are the only party that can

heal this country ladies and gentlemen

now Jesse Jude has been dragging his

feet he's delayed bringing back the

House of Commons for quite a long time

because he knows what's waiting for him

here in this room he knows that as the

loyal opposition we are waiting to hold

him to account because our loyalty is

not to the government our loyalty is to

the Canadian people and when the prime

minister of this country puts his agenda

ahead of the good of all Canadians he

will indeed find himself opposed they

call the premier minister disappear

until FL passe ceasing to her a lonely

being the Thule Canadian FFF as an

opposition leader who's he knows this

and I believe he fears this he's afraid

to face us in question period and he's

afraid to see what's going to happen at

committees anniver bad news out front

they open tomorrow and I bailed this sir

good news a lot fair on committee Holly

Montana there is important to work to do

ladies and gentlemen to unite the

country to respect the taxpayer to stand

up for Canada on the world stage to

protect and create good-paying Canadian

jobs our economy is slowing down and the

threat of a global recession is very

real in Canada instead of being in a

position of strength is on shaky ground

Trudeau's never-ending deficits and

out-of-control spending not only

threaten the livelihood of future

generations the deficits something the

states could always say they bounce off

the control

- 11e of the futures in a hostile but

he's also severely weakened our ability

to respond in times of crisis so my

message to Justin Trudeau is this

vacation time is over no more free rides

the population Canadienne consume you Oh

massages do it Claire

I had to clean a la PA Oh clean past wah

Canada needs us Canadians need their

government to work for them so let's get

to work

the Canadian people are counting on us

and our conservative caucus we will

deliver for them let's get to work

[Applause]
