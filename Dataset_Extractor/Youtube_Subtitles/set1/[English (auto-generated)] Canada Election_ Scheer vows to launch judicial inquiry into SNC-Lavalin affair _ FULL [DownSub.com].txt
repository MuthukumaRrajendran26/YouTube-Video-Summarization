Justin Trudeau fly Canadians on the very

first day the story came to light

he said the story was not true that

wasn't like he said he never pressured

Joey will scramble that was why he said

she never came forward to him with her

concerns that was also it took enormous

cocoon of all consummate air apparently

mezu who descended first a new

Conservative government will launch a

judicial inquiry into Justin Trudeau's

corruption scandal at every turn judo

has stopped the truth from coming out

and preventing Canadians from getting

the answers they deserved he's shut down

three parliamentary investigations into

the scandal he refused to cooperate with

the ethics commissioners investigation

and he's currently stonewalling the RCMP

it's a cover-up on a historical scale

the only way to get to the bottom of the

scanner and get the answers may be in

scissor is to hold additional fire the

only way to do that is to defeat Justin

Trudeau

second we will pass the no more cover

ups that to prevent corrupt politicians

like Justin true from hiding behind

cabinet confidential

to escape the police investigation

cabinet confidentiality exists to

protect sensitive matters of policy in

order to create a good policy it doesn't

exist to protect corrupt leaders that is

why and the most serious criminal cases

we will allow the RCMP to ask the

Supreme Court of Canada to rule on the

disclosure of evidence no longer will

occur Prime Minister be able to be the

gatekeeper of his own price the measures

I've announced today another general

announced later the campaign will

safeguard our democracy against the

whims of sleazy and unscrupulous

politicians but our best protection

against the abuse of power remains the

Democratic vigilance of citizens Justin

Trudeau has so far managed to appoint

the legal consequences for his actions

but now this case is before the people

and with your help the verdict will

arrive twenty years mr. Trudeau

dollar cycle skills valley circumstance

criminal news around premature at a GRC

the Saturday and a crucible for what

accent or discussion the consent a means

the surface on a policy era say mature

adult Lisa and occipital on contributing

an operator repetition Iskander

Vince conduct earmark way states with

all sorts of gradual and unfashionable

minister the first envelope medical male

protection Consulate's a little part

that's not vision of democratic

discipline except a sacred or RFC

activity that consequence lega the

sources

in America speeding away

the dilemma exceed CDL extra a fire with

a company page 43 decision this will

become Omega D lambda B Mehmedi cocaine

so as I've always said on this issue the

most important part remember is that it

is not up to politicians to interfere

the decisions have been dependent

because of those decisions must be left

independent prosecutors and

for evidence the president of SEC level

himself admitted that the Denver product

jobs issue he never threatened to move

the headquarters those realize that just

only Mr Shearer JP Tasker CBC News many

Quebecers say they accept us into his

explanation that he was just trying to

protect job what do you say to those

people who believe this bull up there is

much new ability any time a politician

interferes in an independent court case

that is a very serious issue we do a lot

to live in the kind of country where

powerful politicians can use the power

of their office to reward their friends

the punishment revenues the reason why

people come to Canada when all around

the world is often to escape as very

kinds of countries and so it is

essential that the government in place

protects that independence under Jeff's

and Trudeau that has been undermined a

Conservative government

we say s on sell that one systemically

self aimed in Toronto they shall get it

is ultimately

they what it is that we saw it is in

their position or a queasy

a city essence you know

presently it is mesosystem she's yet

soo-ji stem students at the path may be

affected customers your assessment do

you think Justin Trudeau has committed

that's up to the air CP to decide

ultimately they should be able to do

their work what we do know is that

Justin Trudeau continues to block key

witnesses from sharing their information

fears with this measure that I'm putting

in place that I will put in place uh

Spencer that type of thing will not be

possible in future Justin Trudeau should

not be the person who decides whether or

not Justin Trudeau is the best you I

think that's a pretty basic common sense

position that most Canadians accept good

morning is to share Joy's papers

fools during an election campaign

is this about justice or is it a

political fight this is about the truth

coming Jessica's boarded several

attempts for parliamentary

investigations into the scandal he has

refused to make cabinet conferences is

refused to let Jimmy Vasser able

complete her testimony so this helps the

tape will ensure that Canadians will

have the answers to the scandal I think

it's very important that we shine a

light on Dustin's Rose corruption we get

to a lot of exactly what how you

participate tomorrow in any public

climate event you personally I will be

but will you personally be participating

I will be setting my support to them and

I'll be make other events on the

campaign making that accessible to the

public but our party will be supporting

these types of demonstrations of a real

desire for action and I really

sympathize

with Justin Trudeau's failure on the

environment files so we will have

representation there will be delayed so

that's an elephant just happen cooperate

to me

there is also a large happening in

Vancouver

Christy Kirkpatrick local mail aptn has

reported that 48 indigenous children

died in the foster care system directly

related to indigenous agencies

specifically what is your plan to

address the deaths of indigenous

children in foster care and address

finding in athletes well we'll have more

to say specifically on those types of

issues so campaign but I will say that I

believe it is incredibly important for

the Government of Canada to work with

indigenous leaders to ensure that

children in care is very

highest levels of care possible funding

is there behind it to ensure levels of

care address the needs

great facility to ensure the regime

around these types of situations are

vestiges of choice first and you were

part of a government that spent over a

decade fighting the Assembly of First

Nations and the person

right start you know what would you say

to those who might say you might not

have the moral authority to speak on

this well I as leader this party I have

an opportunity to to turn our course on

this exhibition either should not be

taken very very seriously

it was should be over to teach you the

rationale to a categorical recognize

that they are calling this the cover

today Pamela Courson cetera escalate

this is about mr. to do yesterday I woke

idea clean

so say

a lot of concern on the bottom of the

inspector massively Ottoman people in

breeding reserve on Selma there's no

snow if organism I get hungry awfully

selfish about the Super Market Analysis

organism sigh a technique which is about

able to be successful especially not

like Percy

happy

on this less business with

Justin went freelance mister here the

other day you could serve express her

discomfort at Winston's trying to keep

around fighting me over

you suggested that you're not

comfortable with safe injection sites

you suggest if you're served an

uncomfortability consolidation first of

all now and that whatever think the

therapy is not something you'd be

willing to sort of put forward with

these are the strategies that Supreme

Court has recognized are effective that

researchers say are saving lives why are

white way not only the research the

science there why are you uncomfortable

with these strategies what would have

actually said is I believe that

decriminalization of drugs is a terrible

idea and one that people will not

reporter I've also said that communities

that are impacted by these supervised

injection sites should have their voices

American sir I've also said that I

believe it's it's much more beneficial

to people who suffer from addictions to

have a robust recovery

those are the things I've said

of course that with the strategy of the

previous concern recovering focus on

addictions but everyone working in space

said that isn't enough there needs to be

a strategy in place to fight the

contamination of drugs often now

fentanyl is debating cause of death more

than 10,000 people are dead again why

are you singing that the research and

those were familiar with this should not

be constant here well this is what I

just said I said that communities

address I've said that focus of

government should be coming off and

equalization of drugs is about it yeah

those are the things I've actually said

the cervical national studies show that

vast majority of Canadians centimeter

money on e-bay to carbon tax and

economists agree the term affects the

best policy tools the lower emissions

while protecting the economy I want to

ask you why misleading comedians but

economists are saying that the best

thing to do is carbon tax and misleading

them by stating carbon tax a lot of

applause comedians one of course there's

the Congress carbon tax what we do know

is that just secures carbon tax anomaly

has fallen brother

targets and the cost of living is

getting higher and higher and we do know

that the carbon tax will be even higher

with these made electrodes and policies

at these amounts about any details of

oxidase will lead to massive increases

in the cost of living and the cost of

fuel and possibly competing and the

constellations we know that we also know

that overwhelming majority of Canadians

are going to be worse off with this

carbon tax people have to drive before

businesses kids out of school

small businesses who have to pass that

cost on to customers we know what there

perfect accent that so-called ebay cover

expenses more vascular business today

all the showman and records are highly

in favor with us into the different

funding that jobs for SNC Laughlin by

announcing this today are not costing

yourself boats and Obama's just so

desperately need them not at all I know

that Quebecers are tired of the news

does the excuse me messenger those the

scab losers are same thing wrangle

sponsorships you know backers have seen

practices are able to

at the line unchecked and when we talk

to people throw back they are just as

concerned about the undermining of our

justice system as any other Canadian

there is no Canadian leader there are no

pagans who believe that the Prime

Minister can - be able to pick up a

phone and overturn the decision of an

independent prosecutor in a court case

and that is what happened carefully we

just ensure attempted to use the power

of his office to overturn the decision

the pendant prosecutor it was only

thanks to a whistleblower who is that

subsequently fired by Justin true that

any of these details like Geordie will

see they had by taking the brave stand

that she then we might never have known

that's why the announcement I'm making

today both in terms of the Avery and

they don't work

was an extra can you speak up a little

bit

if you want the next government and

festival or cover-ups time the or simply

will be free to investigate if they find

the evidence

clarity's mainly you know rich lawyers

turn trees in the paper don't

necessarily bring these very satisfying

results if you pass that well obviously

they're artistic reasons things

sometimes leads rcpd charges and

sometimes anything else much like during

if you should agree that otherwise might

not have come to light so we believe

both they're needed in this case on the

topic of brexit we've asked a few times

about this issue and last time you

answered that you support the light of

the British people to choose and I think

we all agree that Britain should be a

democracy

remember in the past we did not support

the light of Liberty to choose new

supported brexit you supported Britain

leaving the European view so I'm gonna

actually specifically about the best

dude still today support Britain leaving

tonight what I said last time I guess

was that I always support the rights of

Nations to chart their own destinies

when it relates to many matters of

public policy for British lawmakers and

I said I've always supported the rights

of Nations to be able to chart their own

course and how about over their own

systems that's now

hello Mr Shearer Matthew as raley-ross

millennial over the past few days

Liberal Party staff related to Trudeau's

campaign have prevented and Rouladen

conservative journalist for attending

campaign event going to forests and

police for harassing this practice is

not so different than what Harper's

government is alleged to have done

elected you will not bar journalists or

covering campaigns I have a transparent

campaign

that click that Saturday a lot compared

to the San Joaquin situation Daniel now

I can access me the vision their

relative is a superficial yes

with everything unfolding in Washington

London are you worried the Canadians

attention to be not at all

I believe the Canadians are engaged in

this campaign I am seeing people all

across this country stop Nia and

restaurants and hotels and places small

businesses that are visiting they're

asking me questions about policies

they're challenging we on our on our

policies ask me questions about the

other party's policy so I believe that

Canadians are very engaged and will

continue to become more engaged as he

like

and what a Conservative government

maintain Canada's chief science advisor

and precise advisors in various federal

departments yes
