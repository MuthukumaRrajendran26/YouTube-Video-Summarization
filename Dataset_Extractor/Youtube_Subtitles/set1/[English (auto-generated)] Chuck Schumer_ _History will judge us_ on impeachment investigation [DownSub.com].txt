last night Speaker Nancy Pelosi

announced that the House of

Representatives would begin a formal

impeachment inquiry of President Trump I

have spoken to her many times over the

past few days I know she did not make

this decision lightly and took no

pleasure in making it it is her

carefully considered judgment that it is

now in the best interest of our country

and our Constitution to proceed with an

impeachment inquiry I strongly support

speaker Pelosi's decision if we don't

reckon with president Trump's persistent

transgressions the very foundation of

this great Republic is at risk the

president kept pushing and pushing and

pushing the constitutional envelope

finally the president's conduct made an

impeachment inquiry unavoidable the

events of recent days have brought

sharply into focus the question of

whether President Trump abused the

powers of his office and betrayed the

public trust for personal political gain

in open defiance of the law his

administration has thus far sought to

block the transmission of an official

whistleblower complaint to Congress the

nature of that whistleblower complaint

has been deemed both credible and urgent

by one of President Trump's own senior

level appointees the Inspector General

of the intelligence community according

to public reports this complaint may

detail how the President of the United

States corrupted America's foreign

policy by pressuring the leader of a

foreign nation to damage a leading

political rival an offence the president

may have committed whether there was an

explicit quid pro quo or not the

president went on to admit on live

television that he spoke to the

president of Ukraine about his political

rival and about military aid to the

country

the timeline of events that led to the

whistleblower complaint must be

scrutinized the nature of president

Trump's communications with President

Putin as well as ukrainian president

celeste zalenski should be requested and

provided with special focus on the phone

call that took place with mr. Putin a

few days after the zalenski call on July

25th the timing of the departures of the

United States Ambassador Ukraine and the

former Director of National Intelligence

and his principal deputy must be

investigated as well as the movements of

president Trump's personal attorney Rudy

Giuliani the correspondence between him

and the White House and his interactions

with foreign governments we must learn

what actions President Trump or his

aides took to withhold congressionally

directed security aid to Ukraine and why

and more besides

the answers to these questions and

others can be pursued by the House

committees involved in the impeachment

inquiry and that is precisely what the

inquiry is for the release of the

transcript of one of president Trump's

calls with president zalenski which just

came out will not a swayed our concerns

or the public's concerns based on early

reports it may heighten them we must

remember the president was reported to

have several calls with president

zalenski over the summer and his

reputation his administration has a

well-earned reputation for dishonesty

altered facts an incomplete disclosure

in public releases we need to see the

complete unredacted whistleblower

complaint without further delay the

whistleblower must be allowed to testify

without fear of intimidation and then we

must pursue the many relevant avenues of

inquiry that I just described

yesterday afternoon the entire Senate

all 47 Democrats and 53 Republicans

agreed to my resolution calling for the

whistleblower complaint to be

transmitted immediately to Congress a

reflection of the seriousness with which

these events are viewed on both sides of

the aisle this was unexpected in the

past when we've asked to look into

president Trump our Republican

colleagues of stonewalled but to their

credit they realized the seriousness of

this situation and unanimously agreed to

support our resolution I hope I pray it

is a harbinger of things to come where

we can look at the facts not the

politics and come to conclusions because

without doubt the White House and the

president's congressional allies will

rush to call this effort a partisan

witch hunt no matter how serious the

allegations or how even-handed the

inquiry I'd remind everyone that just

yesterday every Senate Republican agreed

that the White House's decision to block

the whistleblower complaint from

Congress was wrong there was unanimous

bipartisan agreement in the Senate on

that point not a single senator objected

but let me be clear

nonetheless because I know accusations

of partisanship are already being

written this inquiry was not taken up

for partisan reasons and it does not

prejudge an outcome our framers in their

wisdom assigned to one chamber of

commerce the right to accuse and to the

other the right to judge the House of

Representatives will investigate and

determine whether sufficient evidence

exists to accuse the president of an

impeachable offense or impeachable

offenses if it comes to that

the Senate will be the scene of the

trial senators the jurors

we must take our responsibility with the

utmost gravity our framers not trusting

our liberty to one branch of government

alone afraid of the ever-present danger

of tyranny of an overreaching executive

provided and remedy to Congress should

the executive attempt to subvert or

violate the Constitution of the United

States we are not yet at the stage where

any judgments can be made one way or the

other but I remind my colleagues today

that if the day should come when we are

called upon to carry out our

constitutional duty history will judge

whether we did so faithfully or not

history will judge if each of us acted

as a solemn juror of democracy who

placed fidelity to the Constitution and

our system of government above the

narrow considerations of partisan

politics
