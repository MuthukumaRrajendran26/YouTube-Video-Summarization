of April first all restaurants and

commercial facilities that serve food

are prohibited from serving food to

customers in their premises restaurants

and other commercial facilities can

prepare and serve food for delivery or

take out only the operator of that

restaurant must ensure that all persons

maintain appropriate social distancing

from another one another when picking up

their food grocery stores will remain

open but they must also maintain

appropriate social distancing within the

between their customers bars will be

closed personal service businesses such

as hair salons and massage therapy

offices will be closed all businesses

that are not listed in the schedule of

critical services that accompanies the

order must close between April 1 and

April 14 the closure does not prevent

these businesses from operating on a

remote basis a business may accept

orders on the internet or over the phone

for delivery to pick up as long as the

employers are not working at the place

of business

the order does not prevent employees or

others from coming into the business to

perform such thing as repairs to provide

security services or to take out items

from the business premises if the

business is going to operate on a remote

basis nothing in the order restricts the

operations of delivery of services by

the federal provincial or municipalities

nothing in the order restricts any

activities of a publicly funded agency

organization or authority that delivers

or supports government operations or

services including healthcare services

this means the order does not affect

institutions agencies or other service

providers who provide health care

services such as hospitals Regional

Health Authority Authority and private

agencies who provide a range of health

services all businesses listed in the

schedule of critical services that

accompanies the order may continue to

operate if these businesses allow

members of the public to attend their

place of business the operate of their

business must put in place measures to

ensure that appropriate social

distancing rules are fall

this order does not affect how members

of the College of Physicians and

Surgeons of Manitoba the college of

registered nurses in Manitoba the

College of licensed practical nurses of

Mount Oba or the College of midwives of

Manitoba provide health care services

under the order any other health

professionals may continue to practice

if they are providing services for a

publicly funded agency such as a

government or Regional Health Authority

or business listed under the schedule in

addition health care providers can

continue to provide emergent or Urgent

Care municipal taxi services or

municipal transit services taxis and

other private vehicles for hire can

continue to operate the operator of the

vehicle must ensure measures are taken

to ensure reasonable separation between

persons within the vehicles it's

difficult to list a specific distance

but a reasonable level of spacing is

expected the older this order repeals

previous orders so there's only one

public health order and effect at any

one given time we are seeing the ongoing

transmission of this virus and other

jurisdictions we're seeing the

community-based transmission and other

jurisdictions and so we need to continue

to adapt our response to this virus we

need to continue to escalate our social

distancing recommendations and all our

measures to protect ourselves protect

others protect their communities protect

their health care workers these measures

are yet another step to limit the

transmission of this virus and to

flatten that curve the most important

way of reducing the spread of this virus

is for people to stay home if you're

able to stay home wash your hands

frequently this is especially important

if you are ill it's especially important

if you're in a high-risk category such

as those over age 65 those with

underlying medical conditions or those

with immune compromised if you cannot

stay home you need to practice social

distancing physical distancing at all

times

I want to remind Manitobans that we are

not helpless against this virus that

actions such as these are are in place

to limit the effect of this virus on our

population now is not the time for fear

now is the time for knowledge now is the

time for action and these orders are

furthering that action that we've been

taking all along to be proactive and out

ahead of this virus so thank you to all

Manitobans who have already stepped up

and thank you to Manitobans who will

continue to help us in our battle

against this virus Thank You premier

thanks Brendon thank you so much to you

and Lynette for your ongoing work and

for the work of your team's you very

much appreciate I know Manitobans have

expressed and myself and many of the

members of the Legislative Assembly how

appreciative they are and so I just say

to you thank you you're focused efforts

on our behalf if there are any questions

we can take those now thank you for your

just a reminder to media the one round

of questions and they'll follow up

questions addressed to the premier

please from CTV Winnipeg Michelle why

only so this is our response for right

now certainly we've been been flexible

and adaptive and no response so we're

having this in place April 14th for now

but we are constantly reviewing all of

our strategies and we will extend if if

necessary from the Winnipeg son Josh

disclosures out there to help support

employees who have been laid off and all

the rest are there any plans to support

these things that you have to course

completely they're not going to have any

income coming in big bills that they

have to pay pay rent so I'll be looking

at down the road and kind of brings

relief especially a lot of these

businesses who may not have

to take on extra debt or a lot of extra

bet to cover these costs yeah it's a

good question Josh we were waiting for

more detail we heard the upgrade of the

federal percentage on wage relief for

businesses on Friday which was well

received there were premiers including

myself who pushed very hard for the

initial offer of 10% to be raised

significantly because we didn't feel

that was going to work or have any

uptake that that offers some assistance

I think to small businesses who are in

that category of being able to maintain

their staff to as great a degree as

possible and avoid layoffs in the first

place so we're waiting for more detail

on that later today I hope so we'll be

able to see where that fits in with

other programming but certainly other

programming possibilities are on the

table and being examined and we are

mostly focused right now of course on

making sure we're as prepared as we can

be to protect the health and well-being

of Manitobans and vulnerable Manitobans

in particular now and in the future from

the CBC Manitoba Bartley favorite pop

star part listen to the CBC here why

hasn't Manitoba provided more of its own

measures in terms of financial

assistance to businesses workers and

renters well we have taken numerous

actions well over a hundred and fifty so

far in the last three weeks and respect

of various measures some of them are

cash offsets some of them are

modifications of existing programs to

move resources where they're needed some

of them are assistance direct and

indirect to daycare for daycare for

emergency personnel and the like we're

working in partnership obviously with

the federal governments of Federation

the federal government has already

introduced some programs and we expect

more to come to protect the national

economy we're in charge of protecting

our health care system for now and for

the future and so our measures are

significant and there are more

on the way from the Canadian Press be

entered from the Canadian Press premier

Lee you've seen another problem since

they shut down non-essential retail

outlets and businesses and then the

exemptions are quite numerous big you

know liquor stores they open Canada

stores stayed open we haven't seen the

schedule yet but am I to assume

correctly that that liquor stores will

remain open Canada stores will remain

open and things that some people might

not be essential will stay open well I

think what you're gonna see I'll share

with you a little bit of a summary on

this now but I'd encourage you to go to

engage em BCA you'll be able to review

the entire Act it does follow somewhat

similarly I think to what other

provinces have done in some respects but

it was designed with Manitoba input

specifically from our our people closest

to the small and medium-sized

enterprises closure is now going to be

required for in restaurants hotel and

motel restaurants but delivery will be

available fitness centers yoga studios

garden supply stores sporting goods

stores tutoring services hair salons

barbers nail salons personal care

services to some degree chiropractic

dentist physio optometrist all

previously notified they'll still be

able to offer in those medical fields

urgent and emergency services only in

terms of no closure required grocery

stores banks pharmacies public transport

with the caveat that the doctor has

mentioned earlier about social

distancing physical distancing I should

say hotels and motels for lodging

laundromats home services contractors

veterinarians

kennels farmers markets food banks

shelters and so on and manufacturing

businesses as no closures required this

is our preliminary list based on the

research and planning input that we

received from business leaders around

the province but I would not suggest

that there would be absolutely no

possible changes in the future or

modifications to it and so because we're

an incredibly diverse province

economically

I would encourage Manitoba small

business people or those who work in

small businesses to go on engage mb dot

CA and if they have other suggestions on

on measures that they think we should be

taking to adapt our situation to make it

work better to protect the safety and

well-being of people I am very

interested and I know our governments

very interested in hearing those from CJ

OB Diana mr. Traynor's Diana from six

ABC jo be here a slightly different note

I know it was seeing quite a few people

outside these days as far as one to get

outdoors in the night's weather we've

seen there either these parking lots at

parks tent some people on the trails

what are your thoughts on this and is it

possible we might see some further

measures on physical distancing or see

restrictions on to outdoor spaces that

people are getting outdoors kind of

interview maybe not respecting that

physical distancing requirement thanks

Diana thanks for raising that because

it's a really interesting issue and I

think it allows me to highlight the

importance of all of us working together

to educate one another on these measures

to make sure that we're encouraging each

other all the time to remember old

habits die hard

my wife and I like to walk holding hands

and we're trying we realize you can't do

that that's that's a bad example so

we've stopped that but but there are

other examples as well and I think I

think making sure that we don't do

anything but encourage people to

exercise all the time practices like

good hand hygiene like this the physical

distancing you talked about is really

important on the other hand we don't

want to have to close down all parks

playgrounds and outdoor areas because

people have already told me they're

getting cabin fever and would like to

get outside and a beautiful what we hope

will be soon a beautiful Manitoba spring

so I'm calling a Manitobans to make sure

that they practice these measures and

that they coach one another to do the

same we need to respect the fact that we

can save a life if we do this and not

many generations

the opportunity to do something like

that you can save your own life and you

can save the lives of others by

practicing the physical distancing

measures that we have been promoting so

much those are the fundamentals of

dealing with this issue this is how we

we beat this thing

next we have Larry from the one big Free

Press

mr. prettier Larry cush at the Free

Press do you have an estimate of how how

many businesses in the province are

affected by this latest order or the

number or the percentage of businesses

affected by this order today Larry I

don't I have a good understanding that

we need to take these measures in all of

the businesses so named that it will

protect the health and well-being of

others and I'm proud to say that I have

seen and I have had reported to me so

many examples where these businesses

have already taken measures some of them

to close in advance of this order some

of them to go above and beyond the

physical distancing requirements others

to protect their employees with specific

measures I know the employers and the

employees and small businesses across

the country will support this measure as

difficult as it is because they know

that what will result is better health

and safety protection for all of us and

the protection of our health care system

out into the future as well next we have

Brittany from Global News good afternoon

mister premier on Friday we heard of two

high-ranking WREG officials who had

traveled before the ban was in place so

while there were cases in the country of

kovat 19 and they're now in social

isolation just want to get your thoughts

on examples being set by that and what

your thoughts were people still

traveling just before a pandemic was

declared you know I think there'll be

lots of room Brittany for for armchair

quarterbacking I'm not going to add to

it we've made the directive very very

clear to all government employees at the

every level

that they need to adhere to the

recommendations and follow them closely

and that's what we're seeing and

experiencing today is about the private

sector but we need all hands on deck we

need all hands wash too on a regular

basis so that we protect each other in

that way the measures that we've taken

are designed to apply to those returning

to the country and that's the protection

we need from them we need cooperation

100% cooperation from all who are

returning to the country or traveling

interprovincial e to do the self

isolation to follow the guidance of the

doctor and Lynette in respect of how to

protect ourselves but how to protect

others as well and thus far although

there have been some sad exceptions for

the in the vast majority Manitobans are

following these directives we're going

to need to continue to do that and not

take our foot off the gas this is not a

sprint this is a marathon and we need to

make the necessary steps now to make

sure that we keep that slope ANCOVA down

from City News Stephanie Ramirez

specialist 16 City needs just wondering

why now it seems it's another

jurisdiction for further along in their

fight against the pandemic affordances

kind of public health water and

thundering why now for the public

authority well every province a

different stages Stephanie I think in

the battle and we're all working

together cooperatively but some of us

did more earlier certainly we were the

first to order equipment protective

equipment were the first to really

promote through educational mechanisms I

think effectively and with your help

with the help of the media get the word

out on the fundamentals which I am

clearly hammering today and make sure

those are followed and those those

practices will pay dividends down the

road and as we continue to move forward

with better availability of testing and

improving the turnaround time for calls

and lessening the wait time when people

need information and and improving the

response rate the rapidity of the

response when tests are done each of

these measures is going to assist us so

we're injecting more resources as a

government in each of those categories

and many many more

to make sure that we're doing a better

job of heading this thing off I think

there were three or four other provinces

that announced restrictions of various

kinds on this frankly some of them are

far along in terms of cases at a

different stage in the cycle than we are

but we feel these are prudent steps to

take now and these are the measures that

we've been have recommended to us and I

support the doctor and we'll implement

them from CDC Canada pathetique we high

below from Radio Canada

mr. Pallister thank you for a first of

all for answering that for giving us a

French statement in your introduction I

have another French question for you

know if it's possible for you to answer

in French basically you insert that in

English but what kind of financial help

will the province provide to those to

those businesses and companies who will

be financially affected well continue a

survey continue a co-op or a part an era

of economic responsibility propelled

avail economy the Canada a poor not

ratash the primary responsibility of a

the system the Sante a cooperation also

let it do Nevada Google Aramis a twice

important poem from 102.9 eh TM daddy -

9 th TM mr. premier last week you

announced the freeze our rent increases

and suspension of eviction of eviction

hearings for renters would the

government considering adding similar

measures for business owners who rent

property especially in light of today's

announcement

that's a really it's a very good

question it's a very difficult question

as well we have thousands and thousands

of businesses in Manitoba each with

different

rental or lease agreements some who own

their own properties and have mortgage

payments and the cash flow demands on

small business are real I know I come

from a small business background and a

farm background so I totally get this so

that's why I've said earlier that we're

working in partnership with the federal

government determine the nature and

detail of the programs they're offering

there's not a lot of point in working

without that cooperation because if we

have programs that are confusing then

small businesses won't know how to get

help at this point we have some clarity

on some of the federal programming we've

already focused on preserving the the

needs of our more vulnerable people as a

priority and as we move forward I would

suggest to resources that Manitobans can

use to get updated information first of

all you could just go to engage MBTA for

initial information on today's

announcement but there's also additional

information that will be available on

there they'll be very helpful to you if

you are a small business owner or work

in a small business and secondly use the

resources of your chambers of commerce

and I will put this advertisement in

right now shamelessly as a form of

Chamber of Commerce president myself and

say your chambers of commerce are

tremendous resource to you and if you're

not a member you should join because the

Manitoba chamber and the Winnipeg

chamber as well as the Canadian

Federation of Independent Business and

for larger companies our Business

Council are excellent excellent

organizations that act as a great

resource to you and can in this instance

as well and I'm sure they'll also be

tremendous allies in helping us to get

information not only on proper hand

washing and what to do in terms of

coughing and sneezing but also in terms

of the supports we need and the

information we need to get through this

together all of us all hands on deck all

clean well wash hands of course thank

you from the Brandon Sun drew thank you

a previous is a drew from the Brandon

Sun um

can you comment on why this this order

was issued now like what's changed over

the weekend to make this necessary today

well there's not a magic manual for

dealing with this pandemic because we

don't have any apart from maybe the

Spanish flu over a hundred years ago we

don't have really an identical scenario

or one that's that close we have dealt

with disease before we've dealt with

epidemics before but the magnitude of

the potential consequences of this one

are greater than anything we've seen

most of us in our lifetimes and so I

would suggest that our timing is

appropriate for Manitoba and may not be

appropriate for BCE or PEI but it is

appropriate timing it's a not an easy

decision to make and it is the right

decision and we're taking it in the

right way at the right time with a

little bit of notice or small businesses

and their employees can adjust and adapt

as well and that's sensitivity that

we've used in the past on changes in the

school system changes in child care

changes for the private sector changes

in the public sector to allow people to

transition to working from home is

assisting us in I think dealing with

this in a way that recognizes the more

we can do proactively the less we'll

have to do reactively and the more we

can do to instill confidence in our

people the less stress they'll have to

put up with that's unnecessary we're

trying to alleviate that stress not just

with a call line to help you if you need

help and counseling that's coming up

soon but in terms of consistently in the

doctor rusyn miss Siragusa deserve to be

congratulated on this putting

information out there that Manitobans

can see and have faith in that will

assist us in dealing with this on the

basis of facts on the basis of science

and with foresight from the Flin Flon

reminder Cathy this is Cassie from the

Flin Flon reminder I'm noticing that mom

it appears that mining operations are

included in essential can you kind of

walk me through that decision well I

think I think it's been customary and

the other jurisdictions as well Cassie

that that's been the case I'd

also say though that for Flin Flon I

think this is a good example of where

the reasonableness of decision-making to

suit Manitobans needs shows up because

you've got Creighton across the way if

we had a two-week isolation for

everybody who went over to Creighton or

came from Creighton to see you we

wouldn't be able to operate either

community very effectively this is one

example of where the doctor has shown I

think in his adjudication of the

situation some some excellent

sensitivity to realities facing

Manitobans and particularly Manitobans

in Flin Flon area from the thompson

citizen ian wondering how this order

applies to public transport like bus

lines and airlines providing service

between cities what they have to

possibly limit the number of passengers

they can have on in order to comply with

running right so the they are allowed to

continue to operate they are expected to

provide a reasonable spacing between

clients and so this isn't a specific

number isn't provided but it is expected

that a reasonable distancing should be

accomplished on on all of these

transports and finally from CKD n Matt

Matt Hamill from 7:30 seek ADM I was

wondering if you know disclosure of

non-essential businesses is there

anywhere if someone in the community

notices that a business is still

operating is there some sort of way to

report that what do citizens do if their

concern yeah I'm sorry

Matt I don't have that right in front of

me I'll see if we can get it while I'm

still talking to you we have a we have

an email address that you can call what

you know we'll do we'll put it on engage

Manitoba right away if it's on the

engage Manitoba dot CA website for

information for folks if they see

non-compliance and they can report

that's good and as I said earlier and I

we've had tremendous support and

cooperation from the smokes is in the

province so I don't want this taken the

wrong way but if small businesses are

not doing what they need to do one thing

you can do to help is to tell them that

they're not doing that and to tell your

friends because there are other choices

out there businesses are not respecting

the health needs of others including

their customers and employees then it's

important that you let your friends know

that at the same time but we'll get that

put on the engage MB dot see a website

right right now so that you'll be able

to share that with listeners and readers

as the case may be I want to say thanks

to everyone thank you doctor it's a

pleasure we appreciate it I wish we

would have met under different

circumstances but that being said it's a

pleasure to be working with you and the

best interest amount of Tobin's and I

say thank you again all right everyone

good afternoon I'm Brent Russo

Manitoba's chief provincial public

health officer today we are announcing

24 new cases of covin 19 bringing our

total to 96 the total number of deaths

related to Kovan 19 remains at 1 at this

time there are 4 individuals receiving

care within hospital one of which is in

intensive care

all others are recovering at home we

have two individuals that are listed as

recovered public health investigations

are continuing to confirm details and as

information is received we'll update

that on our website over the weekend a

total of 14 hundred and thirty tests

were completed at Kadim provincial lab

bringing a total to date to eighty-five

hundred and fifty tests I understand

there's a mobile testing site in Dauphin

opened at the MPI building this morning

Lynnette we'll be able to speak more to

the logistics of those sites but I want

to ensure that public health officials

are engaged in developing these sites

and these sites do not pose any risk to

the public remember that this virus is

spread through clothes prolonged contact

coming within one to two meters of an

infected individual so certainly at

these sites are professionals who are

performing the assessments and testing

will be within that range and will wear

their appropriate protective equipment

but the public is at no risk due to the

location of these sites so again this is

a time for credible information not fear

not panic and so these sites do not pose

a risk to the public

that's particularly true of drive-thru

sites where these individuals are not

even leaving their their cars but again

these this virus are spread through

close contact so there is no no need for

the panic to beacon are they the public

to be concerned about these sites I want

to be clear that we do not release

personal health information about

individual cases unless there is a

public health reason to do so upon

receipt of a positive test Public Health

does a thorough investigation of the

case ensures they are isolated does a

thorough contact investigation including

places attended during the infectious

period should any information arise that

the public needs to be aware of Public

Health will definitely disclose that

information Public Health will

definitely disclose that to contacts of

symptoms to watch for and the need to

self isolate for 14 days but we do not

share personal health information unless

it is important to the health of the

public we continue to enhance our

messaging on physical and social

distancing you've heard of the new

orders that are in place today and some

that will take place in effect on April

1st these are important strategy in

trying to interrupt the transmission of

this virus stay home if you can if you

must go out please practice social

distancing at all times

wash your hands keep two metres from

other people stay home if you're sick

stay home if you can certainly if you

are in a high-risk category of those

over age 65 those of underlying medical

conditions or with immune compromised

there's also questions we receive about

notifying the public of specific

locations within a geographic region of

clients again we will do so if there is

a public health need to do so but as we

are enhancing our social distancing

messaging if you were aware of a case

within your town or city you should

practice social distancing if you are

not aware of such a case you should

practice social distancing so it does

not help the the public to know the

specific locations of these cases

because we're asking everyone to stay

home practice social distancing at all

times if there was a reason to to

announce where a specific case was and

the location Public Health definitely

would would do so please do not share

unfounded rumors we know that this now

is not a time for fear this is a time

for credible knowledge we see in much of

the social media - it's easy to share

stories that may not have been

corroborated so really this only

instills fear and sometimes panic so

encouraging everyone just school for

credible information visit our website

Manitoba dot see a backslash ku vid 19

but don't share unfounded information

I've mentioned it many times that we are

not helpless against this virus these

steps that we continue to take are

limiting the transmission of the virus

we've enhanced the public health orders

today further enhancements take effect

April 1 this is to interrupt the

transmission of the virus Manitobans are

taking action now to limit the impact of

this virus by doing so we're protecting

ourselves the people around us our

community as a whole

and we're also protecting our healthcare

work

or healthcare workers are at the front

line being heroes to to Manitobans but

putting themselves in in line of this in

the line of this virus so we want to

protect them as much as we can stay home

practice social distancing and we're

going to be improving the outcomes for

for many many Manitobans and again I'll

end by thanking all my children's who

have already stepped up taking these

measures we know it's difficult we know

that starting April 1 the difficulty

level may raise for many people you're

doing your part to essentially save

lives in Manitoba and so we really

appreciate that and all match Tobin's

are going to continue to ask us to work

together in our battle against this

virus so thank you thanks good afternoon

everyone I'm Lynnette Siragusa I'd like

to start today by giving a special thank

you to Pam mark and Hudson DePauw of

Paterson green in call Ross Manitoba as

well as Chad and Melissa schmidt from

East Creek Farms these two families

reached out to their regional health

authorities southern health Santa suit

on Friday and donated two hundred and

ninety five respirators on behalf of all

healthcare workers I want to thank the

families for their generosity it is

clear that public health emergencies

bring out the best in our communities

and donations such as these are

excellent examples of how companies and

individuals can step up and support us

we know that the expanded health orders

will have an impact on many businesses

and that the effects of kovat 19 are

being felt far beyond health providers

working throughout the province so I do

just want to express our appreciation

and continued support from businesses

who are offering their supplies

including the n9t

five respirators for use in the health

system during this challenging time

we've also received businesses offering

to help and specifically ask how they

can donate some of their supplies so one

example is Canada Goose has volunteered

to make apparel for our health care

workers and we are working on a more

formal process so that when donations

come there's a process that they can

follow and we will have more details

available tomorrow the requirements and

challenges that we face change daily and

they require swift action and constant

surveillance and contingency planning so

I want to be clear that we are

adequately supplied right now we have

stocks available but we have to continue

to take every step to make sure that we

maintain preparation for a virus that

has overwhelmed health systems in other

parts of the world part of the

challenges that are coming to us right

now is that some borders have closed and

some production has stalled in certain

parts of the world which affects our

ability to source and acquire the

equipment and supplies that we need so

our logistics team to give you some

perspective who order our supplies and

they do we meet with them every day and

they continue to say that we are good

and and we believe that but they have

had to be very creative in their

purchasing so normally in our normal

world they would deal with 60 vendors

approximately 60 or 70 vendors and in

for the past few weeks and months they

now deal with 600 vendors across the

world trying to make sure that they have

what we need to protect our staff and

the public so it's just an example of

how we need to keep working together and

to get through this so

for any company who has supplies on hand

even if you're not sure if they would be

useful we'd be happy to connect with you

so look around and we will give you more

details tomorrow on how how we can

connect you in just to give you an

update on operational matters so our

online self-assessment tool had 8,000

web views yesterday and since we

launched it on March 17th the English

and French versions have received almost

350,000 views with the weekend now over

dinah care is back in action and we'll

be calling patients to confirm that they

are negative and we'll provide them with

some information as well as to what they

need to do if anything changes so

keeping up with the very much increased

lab volume so that it's good to have

their partnership and I do want to

remind everyone that if you are kovat 19

positive public health will call you

immediately as soon as they get those

results so just so you know that is our

top priority

community testing site a new community

testing site will officially open in

pine falls at ecole Power View

hours are 9:00 to 4:00 Monday to Friday

as dr. rusyn mentioned often now we'll

be opening as of I think 1:30 this

afternoon their testing center at the

MPI Service Center and this is open from

10:00 till 3:00 seven days a week and

just to remember that these are testing

sites that require a referral these are

not walking clinics

another update I wanted to provide for

you was with regards to the RAM clinics

so the rapid access to addictions

medicine clinics they provide a valuable

service for those struggling to overcome

substance use addiction so despite covet

19 these services are

to continue at all locations throughout

the province but there will be some

modifications so whenever possible they

will try and have virtual or phone

visits but for those that need to meet

in person they will be scheduling and

staggering appointments so that they can

respect the rules of social distancing

and limit the number of people in the

waiting rooms for some of the smaller

around clinics they are limiting entry

for clients only so for those patients

who typically bring a support person or

a loved one with them to these

appointments they'll be able to

participate but virtually not in person

and that's all I have today so we can

open it up to more questions thank you

thank you and the reminder to reporters

please identify yourselves before you

ask the first part of your question and

then of course you have a follow-up

question for this session from CTV

Michelle about the message to the

cottage right so I think that there's a

there's a number of things there with

with the cottage message I think that

one is that now is not the time to

travel right now is the time for social

distancing now is the time to stay home

if you can the other issue there is that

traveling to the cottage to rural areas

where you might be seeking health care

should you need could potentially

overwhelm those those areas should you

get ill so the messaging is is there

that right now it's it can be difficult

times we know everyone is is finding

some challenges with this but you know

the message is now is not the time to be

traveling now is the time to be staying

home now is the time for social

distancing

and then also ages are any of the people

in hospital under 40 you tell us a

little bit about very good well you know

so I get reports of hospitalizations as

soon as they come in to public health I

don't have all of that information on me

right here I think that going forward

we're gonna try to be able to list the

the age range of individuals that are in

I see were in hospital but I don't have

that right now but we're gonna look to

to have that from the what a peg son

Josh I'm Josh Oliver 20-page son we're a

little over I guess about a week and a

half left or so of schools being closed

and child care centers been closed is

there much more thought to keeping them

close longer or just shutting them down

to the school year considering if we do

that teachers will probably need time to

prep and put things together for their

students yeah there's definitely

thoughts going going on and you'll

likely be hearing some more information

on that in a near future sense of how

long these orders are going to need to

be in place so people have an idea I've

heard everything from few weeks and most

people are now saying months some

jurisdictions saying six months what's

kind of the prognosis on that what the

not just about looking at models from

across all of that and hopefully we'll

yeah it's it's tough to give a solid

figure on that but social distancing

strategies you know they they'll need to

be in place for many many weeks to have

a strong effect what that exactly looks

like may be different in different

jurisdictions but but we're not looking

at these strategies being just just a

couple weeks now the overall strategy

could change and within there there

could be some rotating of the strategies

within that time frame but we are

looking at some methods of social

distancing for for many many weeks

problem the CBC Manitoba Berkeley dr.

wissen bought the key via Skiba I don't

know my own name at CBC here um a couple

of weeks ago you talked about a really

pretty week benchmark after the first

reported case of Kovac nineteen based of

the model you are looking at being when

you would see community transmission are

you expecting it now and if not when

right so we're we know that it's that it

is coming I can't confirm sustained

community-based transmission right now

but as these numbers continue to climb

as more and more of this virus is

introduced into the community we are

going to see community based

transmission and when when that exactly

occurs it's it's difficult to pinpoint

that but but within this you know this

week within the next couple weeks we

fully expect to see that and we'll keep

everyone you know informed when we when

we see sustained community based

transmission but a lot of these steps

these steps are are typically taken once

you see that so we've had the schools

are suspended we're now taking measures

to close non-critical businesses so

these are the typical things we put in

place once we see sustained

community-based transmission so we're we

are a bit ahead of things here all right

honorable to note when does the health

care system expect to see the serbs that

we've already seen in some of the North

American jurisdictions is still expected

end of April is it expected in May I

know that there is specific health care

planning being done all the parties

should probably have their own

healthcare sources when will that surge

be expected in the healthcare system

yeah and again it's it's really

difficult to you know to speculate at

that we've been you know prepared

right from the beginning you know we've

been preparing for since February to be

able to respond to any such surge like

that and we continue to prepare over

time and a lot of you know our actions

are we're hoping will give us more time

to prepare even and so it's difficult to

to predict we know that once we see

community widespread sustained community

based transmission we're going to expect

to see that surge in cases and then when

you see a surge in cases a small but

predictable amount of those cases will

will need hospitalization thank you from

the Canadian Press Steve hi it's Steve

Lambert from the Canadian Press I've got

a question specific to you n95 mask

Alberta last weekend announced a

protocol that appears to allow

healthcare workers who conduct nasal

swabs to wear n95 masks here now at 12

another problem says they're given

surgical masks but given the very close

distance that one requires to conduct a

nasal swab why are nurses here not given

n95 masks so the n95 respirators are

specifically required for aerosol

generating medical procedures we follow

the guidelines that were developed by

the public health agency of Canada as

well as the World Health Organization

and we do appreciate that there can be

some difference in evidence but that to

us was the best evidence available and

we also relied on clinical experts

within the system to let us know further

look up research but also give us their

clinical guidance and it was determined

that that would be the direction we

would take and as a follow-up we've seen

in other jurisdictions on you know China

the u.s. Italy health care workers

falling sick and dying

and is Manitoba properly giving people

personal protective equipment to health

care workers even those who may not be

according to guidelines facing what

would normally be a danger requiring a

respiratory mask are we not should we

not be erring on the side of caution and

and and giving people extra protection

given what's happening elsewhere in the

world making sure that our staff and the

public are safe is our number one

priority and we are relying on evidence

to guide our decisions so in a time

where equipment is limited we have

ordered enough more than enough and we

continue to to search and find and get

more n95 masks or whatever it be even

surgical masks and gloves and gowns so

that our staff are protected it's very

important that every staff member and

how did dawn and off their personal

protective equipment that is a key part

of protecting yourself and also changing

out the mass in appropriate timelines so

we would never put our staff or the

public at risk and we are following the

evidence that we have available to us as

well as clinical guidance from our

experts from CJ OB Diana

good afternoon giant Foxwell from 680 CJ

OB dr. Grusin

as far as the services that are to

remain open from April 1st to April 14th

how do you come up with that enlist did

you kind of take Ontario's list and kind

of use that I haven't read the whole way

through but it does look very similar is

it kind of something based off of other

jurisdictions or did you just did we

just go and kind of decide what we

needed here there was we did look at

other jurisdictions and the type of

businesses that they included and

excluded from their orders and then we

took time here to to put a Manitoba lens

on it and had a lot of engagement from

many partners to to look at what a

appropriate list is and then just like

any of these orders we're gonna revisit

it and see what's what's working what

isn't and if there's any any changes

that need to be made and just as a

follow-up say someone is under isolation

at home maybe they tested positive for

home in nineteen and then they recover

what does it look like sort of them

going back to their daily life now that

they are testing negative or they've

been considered recovered obviously with

the social and physical distancing

guidelines it seems like a many kind of

people be told to maintain similar

isolating principles or what does that

look like when summers recovered from

Kovac 19 what does public health tell

that right so the so someone who is at

home recovering from covet 19 which the

vast majority will 80% of cases were

likely to just recover and and improve

at home after 14 days from the date of

onset of her symptoms and if they have

no further symptoms than they would be

released from self isolate or from

isolation and so the issues regarding

social distancing still still apply to

us all but they wouldn't be under a

public health isolation at that time

worked in a in a critical business than

they would be able to to return at that

time thank you

from the Winnipeg Free Press Larry

so dr. Woodson I'm wondering is has

Public Health completed its

investigation into the workplace where

the woman who died of Cove it'd have you

looked into the workplace and can you

tell me whether any of her co-workers

have tested positive

certainly the investigation on that case

would be completed and

you know I if the person was infectious

while they are at work then definitely

the workplace would have been involved

in the investigation and any co-workers

who had close contact with that

individual would have been contacted and

advised itself isolate and monitor for

symptoms so it's a typical typical

investigation and if just like any

individual if they were symptomatic

while at work then that investigation

would include their workplace so we we

have a number of cases ongoing I can't

really speak to you know which contacts

of which individual have tested positive

but but certainly if that individual was

ill while they're at work that

investigation would have been done my

follow-up is is there any particular

concern or evidence to show that you're

getting more cases connected to dental

offices Dental Supply Company is

especially since there were and would

have been a number of people from

Winnipeg Manitoba at that March 5th 7th

Conference big conference dental

conference in Vancouver any as the

dental either dental offices or a Dental

Supply Company is a hot spot I can't

describe it as as necessarily the hot

spot we know that that's hearing about

cases in many jurisdictions regarding

that conference we now know that we are

past the incubation period of that of

that conference but but certainly that

that conference I know of many

jurisdictions reporting cases from there

I don't have in front of me a number of

cases linked to that we haven't really

been our efforts haven't been really

focused on disclosing that publicly

certainly - I know that in our

jurisdiction letters went out to all

attendees of that of that conference

weeks ago to advise of the need to self

isolate but I don't have in front of me

Larry a number of cases that are linked

to that from global Brittany

good afternoon Brittany Greenslade

Global News dr. Bruce I know the premier

got asked about this earlier but just

want to get your take on it

parks are full parking lots are full

people out still playing baseball

throwing that around people that are

sitting in the backs of their cars with

the hatches open to keep that six feet

distance but still you know hanging out

with other people is that social

distancing and can you give people a

better understanding of really I know

you say stay home but to really drive at

home to people yeah I think that the a

strong message should be stay home for

the for the most part right so if you

can stay home especially if you're ill I

would say especially if you're you know

over 65 or have underlying medical

conditions stay home we know that health

is not only about this virus and so

staying physically active getting in the

outdoors as the weather gets gets nice

is important as well it's just really

always keep in mind the importance right

now of physical distancing and so when

you get to these parks if you felt like

going on a nature walk or a walk on the

trail but you get there and you see many

many cars and a lot probably turn around

you know if there's a number of people

there this is not gonna be not conducive

with physical distancing so we want

people out we want people to stay

healthy mental health is a big issue but

if there's a large group of people you

need to consider turning around and

doing whatever you can to keep that 2

meter distance

and my second question would be I know

that you guys are going to be putting

online case data including Possible's

and some locations where people may have

come into contact with a confirmed case

that currently is not up on the website

and as of right now the last flight

information confirmed cases seems to be

from two weeks ago so of our 96 cases

well you don't believe we're seeing

sustained community transmission yet are

we seeing any community transmission yet

we it depends on on our definition for

that certainly we mentioned before that

we've had a number of cases related to

travel certainly the vast majority of

our cases are related to travel we know

that we've had cases that are directly

linked to known cases and so that is

community transmission it's just that

when we know the transmission chain

especially if the original case was was

a from travel and in a close contact of

that case is identified that's is

community transmission but but once you

link it to a compared to a known

transmission chain it's it's not the

type of transmission we're thinking

about when we see you just test positive

and we can't link them at all to travel

or to a known transmission chain that's

making us think that their virus is just

being transmitted then in in the

community so right now we are

investigating cases and so we I cannot

say that we have sustained community

based transmission but there are our

cases that we're still trying to link to

to travel or to other cases and so we'll

update frequently and as soon as we can

when we look at some of the epidemiology

if we get the sense that we're seeing

this community transmission then we will

make Merriman's aware of that

from City News definitey doctors in

stock mutual city news just wondering as

the lab around sought its capabilities

for testing when will be able to loosen

the restrictions on who can be tested

right so right now we're testing

certainly only symptomatic people and

and that's likely gonna stay that way

we're testing returning travelers from

international or from inter provincial

travel with symptoms now any healthcare

worker regardless of their travel or

contact history who are symptomatic will

be tested we're doing the same for any

hospitalized patients that are

symptomatic with the respiratory

symptoms and then we're also in

congregate settings or an isolated

community so we have expanded that

testing as we as we move forward as we

see the dynamics changing then we may

extend that testing further right now

that's our testing criteria and we're

continuing to work with the lab the lab

is doing an outstanding job at

implementing many innovative strategies

to try to increase their testing volumes

and as we see that as we see the demand

rise as we see the changing dynamics

that will we'll adjust our criteria as

well right but you have a ballpark of

when that might be when it might open up

to all symptomatic people these are

community transmission is coming do you

know if it'll be a week please it's

tough to to say right there's a lot of

variables at the lab for that purpose so

you know one strategy and many

jurisdictions are using is once we see

widespread community transmission we

know that the majority of people right

eighty percent of people will have mild

symptoms and can recover at home so if

we're if we're seeing widespread

community transmission then staying home

when you're sick for 14 days is is

another strategy and so as we as we see

that those are some of the strategies

that were put in place but we're working

with with the lab but I can't give you a

definite date as when we're going to do

that okay and then just a quick

follow-up I just wondered if you could

give

general description of the kinds of

businesses that are considered essential

this is a 74 point document but very

specific discussion but just generally

when people ask like what is going to be

considered as essential that can

continue to operate right the critical

services so you're right it's it's a

long list and it certainly doesn't apply

to government so provincial federal or

municipality and then we're looking at

in broad terms of supply chains certain

manufacturers of goods and services for

the household right grocery stores will

remain open certainly health care

providers in in other health care

professions open for urgent or emergent

issues but it's really a to ensure that

we have the necessary goods and services

still available to to Manitoba pne's

while at the same time enhancing our

messaging about social distancing and

then and in really closing those

non-essential non-critical services that

we mentioned earlier thank you

from CBC Radio Canada patrick i am

doctor recent that Fuko from Radio

Canada good question for you is it

possible that we can see eventually a

measure that the one that is being taken

into a sink a bank right now where they

announced that the grocery stores would

be closed every Sunday could we see

something like that yeah good so nothing

is off the table here so when we place

these orders in now they're going to

take place take effect on April 1 we

have right now just in force for two

weeks but we know that that sure could

be extended but we're going to continue

to review these these orders and see if

there's other implementation that we

need to do then we're going to do it but

we're going to do it based on on what

we're seeing in our jurisdiction

from 102 9v HTM Navi good afternoon

my question is for dr. riesen in regards

to the 24 cases that were announced

today as well as the 36 givers States

cases that were announced between Friday

and Sunday you in the very least confirm

whether these are any of these or

northern Manitoba cases at this time

there was a one case in the northern

Health Region we've had a couple of

calls to the station from people who

live in apartments who are concerned

about shared air conditioning or shared

air ventilation units and their

buildings and are concerned about air

exchange even two before that this is

not an airborne virus but could you sort

of clarify for those who are living in

that sort of situation or that sort of

building that they are whether this is a

concern for them or if these concerns

are founded or not

so those are that is not a concern so

this is spread by a contact and droplet

spread so it doesn't get aerosolized

under normal circumstances we know in

certain healthcare procedures it's a

possibility I realized but in in the

community we're not we do not see this

virus be aerosolized so you do not need

to be concerned about you know forced

air furnaces or any any type of HVAC

systems of the sort this is contact and

droplet spread only thank you from the

Brandon some drew thank you up this is a

drew mate for the Brandon son um right

now we're seeing I believe 9 confirmed

cases of Koba 19 in the paramount Health

Region because none of the helps of any

sense of whether those are all trouble

ated or whether they might be also based

on that community trend ESPA

transmission

yeah you know we we do have that

information I don't have that in front

of me for all the regions so you know as

the you know our contact invested

investigations go on we you know we link

it to either travel or to a known case

if we can but I don't I don't have the

pair Mountain health numbers right so

right in front of me you from the Flin

Flon reminder Cassady hi this is Kathy

from the Flin Flon reminder I'm

wondering if you can maybe walk me

through you are giving cases by Health

Region and not getting into any more

specific location from that why are you

giving the Health Region then I think

that's just been typical typical

practice for us to break it down by

Health Region

I think it gives a you know a little bit

of a sense on the distribution in the

province but again it's not to affect

behavior because we want all Manitobans

to practice social distancing at all

times if you were at risk of being in

contact with a case Public Health will

be in contact with you if Public Health

was aware of a potential transmission

within a certain site or geographic

location that we were concerned we were

not able to reach all contacts by

typical methods then we would announce

that publicly and so we break it down

give a little bit of that of the of the

breakdown of the provincial numbers but

again it's not really to change people's

behavior we want everyone right now

whether you're aware of a case in your

town or city to practice social

distancing now now is that time and is

there any way we could get the numbers

for the amount of tests completed in the

northern region I think it is broken

down that way and what we can get you

that okay thank you

from the Thompson citizen Ian wondering

is the things you mentioned on one case

in the northern health reason was that

among the latest 24 and when were those

tests completed it was one of the new

cases and I don't know when the when the

test was taken on this specific

individual like border communities that

regularly travels into a you know

community in Manitoba like would someone

from Saskatchewan ever be tested at a

site in man token if that was the

closest site it strictly divided by

problems no health care services are

portable amongst the provinces so if

somebody from any province attended or

from anywhere was in Manitoba need a

testing they would that testing would be

done from CKD em Matt Matt Hamill 730

CKD M we have a testing site a

drive-through testing site that just

opened up here in Dauphin it was

originally scheduled to be opened on

Saturday I was wondering if I could get

any insight into the reason for the

delay or I heard there may have been an

issue with the facility the NPI service

center but that is where its opening now

I'm just looking for some clarity on

that I think the Regional Health

Authority is quite happy with the MPI

structure and and the facility so I

don't think that was an issue I think

there were some questions and concerns

by some that needed to be addressed and

I believe that happens

okay was it was there any sort of

negotiation with the municipal

government or can you it say anything

yeah I don't have all the details but

there was work with members of the

community and and likely the municipal

government as well thank you all right

Stevie and Michelle Michelle do you have

other questions

I suppose ask again what your

recommendation is on wearing masks in

public over the last couple days we've

kind of seen Ramona Tobin's who are not

ill just Jen in the general public I do

not advise wearing masks I advise

against wearing masks the general public

we should save those masks for people

who need them

you know ill ill individual especially

presenting to health care facilities

health care workers assessing and caring

for ill people where those math should

be used those math do not provide

benefits to the general public just

wearing them out on your day to day

activities my advice is if you're really

concerned about contracting a virus

stay home wash your hands frequently if

you do go out then maintain that

physical distancing the masks aren't

going to be of use to you there's an

Ontario company making these covert 19

tests Spartans the Ontario government

has ordered hundreds of thousands of

them is Manitoba also looking at that

order or anything

I think the our labs been looking at a

number of different different options I

can't speak specifically to that that

specific situation but the lab is

looking at many ways of increasing our

capacity here for testing from the

Winnipeg Sun Josh is Josh I think you

just kind of answered this question but

you know how long it'll take to get to a

potential full capacity for the CAD

inferential lab and what that looks like

well I mean the I mean their capacity is

has increased probably about 400 percent

on this so there isn't really a full

capacity they just keep increasing their

capacity that they're that they have so

we're not looking at a certain certain

level to get to or just increasing it as

we can and then we'll adjust our testing

strategy so that we ensure we're testing

the most appropriate people within that

capacity what's the biggest or what are

the factors in increasing that capacity

are we looking at just having enough

reagents on hand is having enough staff

on hand whether the we exactly be

determining that yeah those are all

factors you know up to now the the

reagent has been one of the biggest

factors but there's many many factors

that go in so the reagent is one

staffing is is another even the test

testing equipment such as swabs viral

transport media as we test and test and

test all of those things have increasing

demand so it's multifaceted but up to

now the the reagent has been a has been

the major shortage

from CDC Manitoba Berkeley dr. Reiss

enormous surges last week the premier

hinted at the use of hotels for some

unspecified reason are you planning on

doing it other jurisdictions are using

hotels as hospitals hotels are vacantly

we're looking at different places where

we can help people self isolate if

they're not able to at home depending on

where they're setting is so yes the

answer is we're looking at all options

hotels being one but also beyond that

and I mean it has health care though not

just isolation sorry what are you

looking my question with hotels for

healthcare purposes healthcare purposes

like providing please are you - you -

yes divert either positive or not

positive people in - ha into into hotels

are you going to treat them as hospitals

that was my initial question no I think

they know I think if they need a

hospital we're gonna make sure they have

a hospital my second question in dr.

rusyn last week you identified one

healthcare worker as testing positive is

that person a nurse and if and other

what is the total number of healthcare

workers in Manitoba tested positive

right so the the health care worker that

I referred to acquired the the infection

through travel and then and then really

the it was a non health care setting for

that an entire period so I don't have in

front of me the the total amount of

health care workers I mentioned that one

because I knew of that one specifically

on on the requisition but but I don't

have a list of that you we do our

contact investigation on all of these

individuals occupational health

infection prevention and control come

into

play if we have a healthcare worker

that's diagnosed within the healthcare

setting and thorough contact

investigation is on we don go related to

other staff related to clients but I

don't have a number in front of me on

how many cases our health care workers

provide that later

we'll go look and see what what type of

things were we're releasing from the

Canadian Press these people ambered from

The Canadian Press dr. you talked a few

times about the information you may or

may not be releasing um people are

worried about you know health care

workers people on the front lines we the

general public given our fastest to

sprint and in some parts of the world

why are you not releasing information

about where people might have been in

the province when they were contagious

when when when where people might have

been at risk yeah well we we definitely

will release that information if we feel

that people are at risk so remember this

virus is spread through close prolong

contact so to know that there was a case

somewhere in your town shouldn't really

change much what you do right you should

be practicing social distancing if you

were determined to be a close contact

with an individual public health will be

in contact with you for health care

settings if we had a health care worker

or a another known case that we felt

could have been in close prolonged

contact with a number of people that we

would say weren't able to identify then

we absolutely will announce that

publicly and and give people information

so it's it's not about won't really

release information we'll release any

information that we think will benefit

the health of the public

and to pull of Ombuds question what if

there have been health care workers who

might have been contagious while at work

can you say whether or not that is

happening to date if that if that occurs

then we would be looking at the the

period of infectiousness looking at all

the close contacts during that at that

time and the precautions taken and if we

felt there was a number of people at

risk that we couldn't identify then we

will make that announcement and and let

Manitobans know that if they were in

this certain location during this period

of time that they should be aware that

they may have been in contact with with

Kovan 19 would not be a public

announcement if you could face what you

believed with all the contacts for sure

that's right wouldn't be of benefit to

the public to announce that if we knew

that all the contacts have been

identified from CJ OB Diana dr. rusyn

it's Diana's on six ABC J OB just a

quick question if you're under isolation

at home say someone had returned from

traveling it is spending not 14 day

period back home what happens if there

was to be something like an emergency

where a water pipe burst or a furnace

broken at home would someone be able to

come into that house and fix things

given that the person is under that

self-isolation or what would the

situation be there yet so it's so it

depends certainly those type of services

are not are excluded under the orders so

those those services will maintain will

be able to continue to operate after

April 1 if a person is self isolating at

home but as as not showing any symptoms

then these type of emergency measures

could still take place there should be

adequate social distancing within the

house because remember this is only

spread through close contact so that

would be would be there so if we had a

say a case that was isolating at home

and something like this happened

we would have public health involved and

make sure that any such you know repairs

were done but when we're done in a safe

manner okay just a quick question with

regards to obviously restaurants and

cafes closed for in-person dining under

the Public Health Act April 1st April

14th what do you say to Manitobans who

might be kind of concerned obviously you

can still order for takeout or delivery

some people might be a little bit wary

is that what would you say to them

obviously that still being available

right so our supply chains are going to

be fully operational so food grocery

stores even takeout and delivery from

restaurants is not going to be affected

here so again these these steps are can

be troubling to people but we want these

steps to we take these steps to make it

clear that we are enhancing our

messaging regarding the need for social

distancing so this this may sometimes

raise anxiety but like we said this is

the time for action and so these steps

are necessary but we do not need to

worry about you know access to food of

the this nature are the critical

services will in place they maintain our

supply chains but at the same time we're

putting measures in to limit the spread

of this virus but manitoba's can kind of

rest assured that it's not unsafe to

order takeout I guess my question is

very free support me does I didn't catch

that last one sorry sorry I just kind of

a clarification Manitobans can rest

assured that it's still safe to order

food for sort of delivery or take oh

there's not that's correct yeah this is

this is still fine if you're going to

pick up your your order those operators

are going to need to ensure that safe

social distancing is is applied within

the facility and delivery again is just

a

a very quick delivery and everyone

should be washing their hands all the

time thank you

from the won a big Free Press Larry just

following up on an answer you gave me to

a previous question you said the letters

went out to various people who attended

that Vancouver dental conference and

they're asked to self isolate I'm

wondering like what such a big

conference in so many attendees why was

the public not alerted to the risk of

transmission from from that particular

event and are you sure you were able to

contact everyone from Manitoba who

attended yeah I think that the there was

a lot of messaging through through media

about about that conference the

messaging went out through through the

associations so that Dental Association

and so I think the messaging was very

broad and that was the the messaging

that went out and I think it did reach

reach everyone that was affected

follow-up is on cancer surgeries are

there any cancer surgeries in Manitoba

now being postponed and if so what type

in conversation with these surgery team

the only surgery surgery would have to

they they're looking at eating each

individual case and they would only

prolong a surgical case if there would

potentially be a negative outcome in

which case then it would proceed so I

can't speak to every individual type of

surgery it would be dependent on what

the prognosis was in that individual

person only if there was a risk to the

patient into surgery a risk in delaying

the surgery it would Prost it would

proceed right so if someone had my type

of cancer and needed surgery we would

not delay that surgery it's gonna result

in a negative outcome does that make

sense only if delaying the surgery would

would produce a negative outcome or if

it wouldn't produce a negative outcome

by delaying you're saying they might be

doing we do not want any negative

outcomes for the patients in Manitoba so

if they need surgery and a negative

outcome would result from delaying the

surgery then we would not delay the

surgery we would proceed with the

surgery no more questions from global

thank you from City News definitely if

there's no special secret city news just

wondering earlier in the press

conference you return to confusion over

community testing sites and that they

don't pull the risk to the public just

wondering if that had anything to do

with the lane of the dolphin site

opening the well I don't know the

necessarily the details of the

particular site on what happened but we

know that this is a time where there's a

lot of misinformation a lot of fear a

lot of anxiety and so we're putting

these sites together and and we've seen

that they've been expanding over time so

you just want to make sure that the

public is aware that these are not

putting anyone in harm's way that this

virus is spread only through close

contact and so these these sites are

safe

Thanks I'd maybe have some directed the

question on that sorry I wasn't sure who

had watched you this particular I'm good

yeah so each Regional Health Authority

really takes accountability to

operationalize these individual sites so

I was aware that at the dauphin site

there was a bit more communication that

needed to be happening within the

community but I don't have all the

details to that how do you thank you can

you see your a G of Canada Patrick

Patrick 102 9 see.htm Navi apologies if

this is already been asked but I would

just want to clarify wearing northern

Manitoba this one confirmed presumptive

case is wait like we've been saying

we've limited our identification to the

Health Region there's a Northern Health

Region travel-related I don't know the

public health investigation just just

started on that yesterday so I don't

have all of those answers

from the Brandon's son Drew

okay from the Flin Flon reminder Cassidy

hi the Cassidy from the reminder here

I am wondering what goes into the

decision on where to place a testing

site well that's that's up to the

Regional Health Authority to look at

their geography and what the population

demand is and where their structures

available so it might be in an existing

structure it might be in a structure

that we don't typically use and and it's

subject to change based on the demand so

when we first started with the testing

sites there was a huge surge of testing

we are seeing at some sites the the

numbers are coming down so we'll just

continue to evaluate and Trust the RHA s

as to what what works best to make sure

that their communities have access to

testing thank you so much have a great

day thank you

from the Thompson citizen Ian measures

are taken to places like Compton where a

lot of health care workers come in and

out on like you know a two week basis

how does that address to reduce the risk

of you know people

well I think the same rules would apply

that there's still that stay home if

you're sick

basically and we have been in contact

with some of the agencies that provide

staff from out of province that they

should stay at home

yep stick

from CKD m-matt our final reporter no

more questions thank you alright then

thank you very much that concludes this

afternoon maybe everything
