I'm not surprised by it I didn't think

that would happen but if it's the

tabloids they've driven them out then

it's a shame that our press is sending

our Royals out of the country so I think

in the context of what's going on in the

world with like Iran and this is

probably not the most dramatic thing to

happen but I think it is a shame that

they've decided to do that I certainly

understand I think I understand the kind

of scrutiny and another way that the

media was betraying Reagan mother I can

see why they would feel they need to

step back

it's myth unforeseen I think I think

milk should do whatever they want to do

really I just hope they can fund

themselves for their new ventures in

life rather than from the public purse I

think interested if something had public

like life and not working senior Royals

and I think they need to scare down the

security or pay for it themselves after

their own private funding I just think

what what that wedding cost and and

that's a goodie honestly I think the

nation made it more than that back from

the publicity and but it's the

television right so

like honestly there's often an apt

surgeon in sales and sort of thing and

that sort of things I don't think I

don't think it's it's any loss in that

regard I just think in what it does to

the credibility of the institution I

think that's the shame I think because

he's a bit more junior than it's not

like foods Charles or William maybe not

so much but it could set a precedent and

a trend going forward did they really

participate in a country this is a thing

I'm not too sure it's it's not I don't

think it's gonna change anything

particular about you know the states and

affairs of the country really so I'm not

not partically concerned about it to be

honest so and I think the rest of the

society won't probably mind too much

about it

you
