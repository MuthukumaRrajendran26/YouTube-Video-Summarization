I want to begin by thanking the other

speakers the attendees here today

highlight the pledges towards parody

that both male leaders who are up here

before me made I think that's an

important element but you know what when

I come to events like this I'm so

pleased that we get to start I get to

start this day with a women's

empowerment event but if you asked me

there's one place I think we need to see

better parity and that is in the

audience of panels on women's

empowerment in conferences around the

world thank you for the chance to

participate in the launch of the African

women's leadership fund it is really

inspiring to be surrounded by so many

leaders who have done so much to advance

gender equality and human rights here on

the continent and around the world

this is crucial work work that benefits

not only women and girls but entire

countries advancing gender equality is

not just the right thing to do it's the

smart thing to do you know the facts

you've seen the research you've

witnessed the results in 2018 Ethiopia

became the latest country to appoint a

gender balanced cabinet with ten women

taking on key portfolios like defense

trade and transport increasing the

participation of women across all

sectors leads to better outcomes not

just for women themselves but for our

businesses our communities our economies

as I have seen directly within my own

cabinet having more women in leadership

positions leads to better decisions and

that's why our government has made

advancing gender equality a priority at

home and abroad

many of you in this room

have been working to promote gender

equality for decades African women many

leaders in this room have been at the

forefront of this fight since the

beginning but we know there is more work

to be done so long as women are denied

opportunities just because they are

women

that's why Canada has been working with

like-minded partners and leading experts

to help move this agenda forward it's

why we chose to make gender equality and

women's empowerment a core theme of our

g7 presidency two years ago a theme that

has continued to engage the

international community at those levels

that was really important to me for our

g7 not just that we have a session on

women's equality because those come up

every now and then in various

organizations know we made women's

empowerment a horizontal priority

through every single theme and

discussion we had at the g7 that year

whether it was economics security health

oceans women are involved in everything

and as we all know women are often the

solutions to everything

in 2018 we set up the Elsi initiative to

include more women in UN peacekeeping

missions thanks to the partnership of

countries like Senegal Ghana and South

Africa were making meaningful progress

we're committed to continuing this work

and understand the leading role our

African partners are playing today as

part of Canada's increased support to

the African Union I'm pleased to

announce that we will provide 10 million

dollars to help build the capacity of

the African Union Commission to advance

gender equality

[Applause]

this will support the African Union's

important work on priorities like

economic development trade and

investment regional integration and

peace and security 2020 is a big year

for gender equality but while we mark

important anniversaries and celebrate

progress we cannot lose sight of the

work that lies ahead we cannot take for

granted what we have achieved and

instead we must vow to redouble our

efforts achieving gender equality both

at home and abroad must be the business

of every nation of every person

regardless of gender if we are to

empower women men need to be allies

willing to share and fight alongside

women for gender equality and

opportunities for everyone because we

all know this no country can reach its

full potential without the full

participation of all of its citizens

that's why Canada has stepped up as your

partner your friend in this fight and

will continue to stand alongside you

once again thank you all for the

opportunity to be with you here today
