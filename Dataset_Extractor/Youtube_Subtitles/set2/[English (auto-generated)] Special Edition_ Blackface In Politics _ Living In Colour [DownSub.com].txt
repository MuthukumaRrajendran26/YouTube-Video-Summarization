welcome to a special episode of living

in color

I'm your host fair enough sir and a

special episode because in the past 24

hours we've seen three examples of our

Prime Minister current Liberal leader

Justin Trudeau painting his face in

blackface he has since apologized he's

talked about his own white privilege but

is it enough we are in the middle of an

election campaign joining me now to

weigh in on this is Sabrina gaffar

Siddiqui she's a doctoral researcher in

racism and discrimination as well as

Andre demise he's a contributing editor

of Maclean's magazine thank you both for

joining me Trudeau has just come out and

said he is sorry again the second press

conference he has held he started that

press conference apologizing to

racialized communities is it in that

foundry I'll start with you I mean it's

not for me to decide whether it's enough

like I can't accept an apology on anyone

on behalf of anybody other than myself I

I'm upset that there's even an incident

during this election that requires this

kind of an apology because you know I

was told in the lead-up to the 2015

election that diversity was their

strength and that you know this kind of

behavior is unacceptable when it comes

from when it comes from political

leaders so what I will say though is

that what's bothered me so far is the

amount of people who are either

accepting this apology who are not

people have colored themselves accepting

parents widows apology on behalf of

everybody else and who are calling it a

distraction or telling people who are

you know hurt by this that they are

endangering the Liberals election

prospects and that's that's absolutely

ridiculous to me the idea that

somebody's election prospects takes

precedence over everybody else's

humanity that's that's not what this is

supposed to be about okay the next Lindt

andre i want to bring you in on this

because we're not a monolith of people

of color right there's different

viewpoints and some people of color are

not as outraged as some people who are

not of color and saying that this this

election had racist undertones from the

beginning before even this happened tell

me more so I think the important thing

to remember here

is that yes it was completely racist it

was wrong and there's absolutely no

denying that the apology was important

and I'm glad that the the Prime Minister

apologized but what I'm afraid of is

this becoming a one-person issue just a

political issue just an election issue

as someone who's been doing research you

know in this area for a good decade of

my life racism has existed before you

know the Prime Minister engaged in this

behavior and it's been a persistent

pervasive insidious problem in Canada

way before theirs right let's go back to

the specific case though and I want to

talk a bit about blackface with you

Andre you did a podcast on it which

which is really interesting but also I

mean I've been criticized when I tweeted

this people were upset that I've ruined

Halloween now right that people some

people really don't understand the

gravity of this can you talk to us a bit

about that so what a lot of people fail

to understand is that blackface is not

just you know painting your face and

even mocking people blackface is a long

history of dehumanization towards black

people and towards other people of color

because there was a history and theater

of British actors rounding up their

faces and pretending to be people of

South Asian descent but where comes to

blackface in the United States that

began in the eighteen thirties and the

progenitor of blackface and jump Jim

Crow was an actor named Thomas D rice

and he became popular at the same time

that the British abolitionist movement

was reaching such a crescendo that the

slavery abolition Act was passed we

received full assent in 1834 blackface

was like the the mainstream means of

propagandizing people into believing

that freeing black people in the United

States was going to turn a savage race

loose upon upon innocent white people so

that is the background radiation that is

a context in which the blackface exists

you can't divorce it of that origin can

can you explain to me what brown faces

and it Sabrina I'm happy for you to jump

in on this too because I this is

personally the first time I heard this

term was yesterday yeah I mean I I can

tell you the reason why so many people

are minimizing this and

saying that well you know I mean it was

just a costume blah blah blah it's

because there is no understanding

there's a lot of ignorance when it comes

to how how offensive something's you

know doing something like like this is

for marginalized people but the fact

that we're even having this conversation

again I feel like that is what the focus

should be on the fact that we're having

a conversation about race that we

haven't been having otherwise and I

think the the other interesting thing is

in this election I mean we saw a

headline recently the people within the

NDP say that they are not ready for a

prime minister with a turban we've had

in the Conservative Party candidates

who've aligned themselves you know with

with a one with a white supremacist or

have made a homophobic or racist

comments in the past so this race has

really been an undertone this election

what do you have to say about that Andre

what have you noticed I I'm trying so

hard not to laugh here because we can

say that they they might not be ready

for a prime minister with the turban

well apparently we've already had here's

here's the other thing I want to know

why it is it look it's not funny but it

kind of is the only I have to ask

because if I didn't laugh I'd cry you

know how I like how often do we have to

have these kinds of conversations before

we understand that racism is a problem

in this country everything is a one-off

scenario there's no connection between

any other events everything happens in

isolation so therefore there's no

grander conversation we had so my

reaction to that is either to be

profoundly depressed or just to laugh at

people's ridiculousness you know an

inability to confront their own problems

but you think here's a question I have

there's a lengthy tradition of blackface

and theater not just in Toronto or in

Canada but in Quebec as well how many

times did we have to have the

conversation that televising blackface

is actually not okay that doing a

theater production where people pretend

to be somebody like pique Subban by

wearing blackface is just not okay and

in Quebec they really seem to love the

rock base and this is not just a

tradition within Quebec it happens like

it seems to be tradition

with these like sort of like that use

these rich families these Laurentian

leaves these politically connected

people in Canada but also in the United

States as well like you we saw that

example with governor Ralph Northam I

think was earlier this year or last year

and then became like a spate of us

elected officials who also had to admit

yes I did appear in blackface in college

as well yes it's in my yearbook I feel

sorry for every you know storage unit

curator who is right now feeling like a

barrage of requests for their yearbook

caches but what what is it about that

class of people that blackface is so

funny to them and I you know based on

you know the research that I've done and

the studies that I've done really what

it is is a means of expressing to a

subordinated group of people that they

are subordinate and that the dominant

class can take their most sacred aspects

of their culture and even take their

skins and say we own this that they're

they're able to mock it that there's

nothing that belongs to you that we

can't own and consume ourselves I just

have to ask why is that so funny when

the prime minister was talking he was

talking also about his own children I

mean we're parents here and I want to

bring in Sabrina quickly on this because

Sabrina you you as a mother even what is

what does Trudeau have to do to take

responsibility here does he have to take

responsibility here even more

accountability and responsibility you

know obviously these things are very

very important I personally felt like

his apology was sincere officially the

second time that you know what I just

watched at the moment the discussion

about intentions and because somebody

asked me this question we know about

intention versus impact and you know

really the question is not about

intention it's not about whether what he

did he thought was right or not and a

lot of people were really focusing on

that and really focusing on the fact

that you know why did you do this what

made you do it well I mean I think for

people like us who who are knowledgeable

in this area the reason why he did it

was because we live in a society where

there is structural racism all around

and we live and and benefit from that

racism all the time with our various

different privileges that we had you

know when things like this happen that

we look at them in isolation and we

think of them as one of you know moments

and we need accountability for this

particular moment and this person needs

to apologize what concerns me more is

the entrenched you know racism the

institutional racism the problems that

are so you know we've got the

over-representation of indigenous and

black people in the criminal justice

system we have income inequality you

know we have so many issues that I feel

are important and we should be

discussing them but instead as always

and I say this as a Muslim woman you

know the election talking points are

always so visible like we always focus

so much on the visible parts of of race

and ethnicity you know a woman wearing a

hijab you know the color of your skin a

turban on your head that's not the only

time that racism shows up and this

Canadian exceptionalism is just it's

it's all around you know we're seen as

the beacon of light of hope of you know

there's this myth that we are not racist

and we're better there's this you know I

am better than right now mentality that

that you know we're not going to vote

the way that that Americans voted or

British people voted with brexit you

know I I would argue otherwise yeah you

make such a good point and Andre I think

what both of you are making and I think

it's so brilliant is that these things

are happening in isolation we aren't

linking them together and we're not

seeing really what's happening in this

country then when we see something we

are surprised but I have to say this is

a specific instance this has never

happened as far as I can remember

something this big in a federal election

with somebody who is an incumbent Andre

back to you and I mean I listened to

your podcast too today has the Prime

Minister taken responsibility what what

does he have to say what does he have to

do is this gonna impact the election

what do you think well being a cynical

and nihilistic as I am I don't know that

it's actually going to move the needle

by October be

we get trapped in that strategic folding

conversation where it's like hey do you

want us or do you want the bad guys

right so I I don't I I I am cynical that

it's actually going to change much by

the time the election comes around but

one thing that that does bother me is

why you know why is it that we are

pinning Trudeau to the wall on blackface

when to me the moment that he should

have because I've heard the question

asked as to whether he should step aside

he was asked that at the press

conference the moment that question

should have been asked is when grassy

narrows protesters interrupted him at a

fundraiser - - and they were protesting

the the rivers and rivers in the land

where they live being filled with

mercury poisoning

and his response to them one his

seizures the speech was interrupted was

to say thank you for your donation to me

that was the moment that structural

racism and personalized racism

intersected in such a way that he

shouldn't have been seen as fit to leave

the country anymore that's when he lost

moral standing for I just want to

mention that you know what really

concerns me and you know this is like a

civically engaged Canadian I think what

concerns me is that something like this

is instead of instead of allowing us to

have the right discussions I think it's

going to result in voter apathy voter

malaise where I mean we saw this already

happen you know in the US where you had

a choice between two not one not so

perfect and another not so perfect

person I'm being polite by saying that

but you know and people just didn't vote

and you know that that's what I'm afraid

of

are we forgetting and I'm not doing this

either/or comparing one racism against

other racism but when are we gonna be

having the conversation about the

conservatives having a direct link to

white supremacy white nationalism and

their connection to rebel media you know

how is it that that conversation somehow

bypassed all this attention you're not

in your head Andre well I just I just

wanted to add

the point here the reason that this is

getting such global attention and I

heard the word distraction and it just

it raised the flag with me immediately

because it seems to me that people pay

attention to what they perceive to be as

racism when they have very highly

visible markers of it like when they

have evidence of it it's like does this

did this person give an expression of

racism that is so unacceptable that we

can't deny that it's actually racism and

it usually happens at a couple of points

one is when somebody uses an open racial

slur and the other time is when somebody

you know does something like dressed in

blackface or brown face or yellow face

or red face you know whatever the

outward expression of that is and the

fact that we have to wait for those

gotcha moments to have these

conversations tells me that we're so

politically unsophisticated that you

know do we our kin are we even capable

of having this conversation at all

Sabrina and Andre I really appreciate

your time I know we were saying we don't

have these conversations and the

mainstream media until there's some sort

of moment but we've had living in color

on air for the past year I encourage our

viewers to go back look at previous

issues again that's living in color on
