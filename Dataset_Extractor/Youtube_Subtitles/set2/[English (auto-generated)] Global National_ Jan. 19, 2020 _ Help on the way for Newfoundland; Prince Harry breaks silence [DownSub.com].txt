[Music]

on this Sunday night the military

mobilizes to Newfoundland the rush to

get troops on the ground we're also

reminded that Newfoundland is very much

an island and the race to dig out after

record-breaking snow no banks are so

high he can even get over the federal

plan to rewrite Canada's assisted dying

legislation plus the princes perspective

on his new common life in Canada what I

want to make clear is we're not walking

away

global national with Robin Gill good

evening and thank you for joining us

help is arriving in Newfoundland and

Labrador as the province digs out from

an historic snowfall Canadian forces

have mobilized to assist with the

recovery in areas that have been buried

in nearly a meter of snow but the

federal government is warning there will

be logistical problems times like this

of course we're also reminded that

Newfoundland is very much an island and

at times like this it makes it even more

challenging to make sure that we get the

resources in place that we need to get

there a state of emergency will remain

in effect until at least Monday in st.

John's and other hard-hit communities

but before Newfoundlanders have even had

the chance to finish clearing up this

pile of snow another storm is set to

move in Mike Armstrong has our top story

tonight walking down the middle of this

street glenda 9 is about a meter off the

ground it's a little tougher when he

steps off the road

denying left home Sunday to see his

granddaughter she was supposed to have a

party for her 6th birthday but like just

about everything else in Newfoundland

it's canceled despite the struggle to

get to the door it turned out not to be

working the only way to get his

granddaughter out come on I think is by

the window little Olivia's father Josh

denying tried to keep the door cleared

during the storm but lost the battle

between Friday morning and Friday night

I was out and cleared cleared a doorway

away four or five times before I gave up

at it because it was just too much it

was coming down too fast

this was not a normal storm it wasn't

just the amount of snow but how it was

blown about

but it left will take time to clean up

how much time is the question snow

removal crews are busy and exhausted but

until their work is done people are

stuck against each other now that ain't

going over anyway not open

an official state of emergency remains

in effect in Saint John's and several

other communities people are still

supposed to stay at home

however some restrictions have been

lifted pharmacies were allowed to open

so people can get medicine and gas

stations are now allowed to sell fuel as

long as it's for snow removal vehicles

snowblowers or generators about 3,000

homes are still without electricity

Newfoundland Power says mobility is a

big issue crews can't repair what they

can't get to the federal cabinet is

meeting in Winnipeg three ministers

addressed the storm Sunday the defense

minister says about 150 to 200 soldiers

should be on the ground ready to help by

the end of the day this could surge up

to anywhere between 250 to 300 by

tomorrow in the coming days

the search continues for 26 year-old man

missing since the storm

Josh wall disappeared Friday in the town

of roaches line meantime roads around

hospitals have been opened people can

access them as long as they can get out

of their homes progress absolutely but

getting back to normal

all right this way it's still a long way

away Mike arms from Global News the last

thing anyone in Atlantic Canada wanted

was more snow but that's what hit the

Maritimes today people in Nova Scotia

New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island

had shovels in hand as the white stuff

fell and accumulated quickly in places

like Halifax in Fredericton the snowfall

warning has now ended there the same

storm system caused chaos in Toronto

conditions were extremely dangerous for

drivers they were being warned to stay

off the slick roads

hundreds of crashes have been reported

heavy blowing snow and fierce winds made

it near impossible to see in some areas

Montreal is woke up to a winter

wonderland today and are also busy

digging out after the city was blanketed

by snow fortunately no more is in the

immediate forecast snow has been falling

across the prairies as well it's still

falling in Regina where an extreme cold

warning is in place temperatures they

are set to plummet and could drop to

minus 40 degrees tonight with the wind

chill

more than a third of Americans aren't in

the clear just yet bitter cold is

gripping parts of the US hammered by

dangerous winter weather a monster storm

triggered another deadly avalanche and

continues to cause treacherous travel

conditions despite the system moving out

to sea Jennifer Johnson reports

officials are blaming heavy snow for

triggering another deadly avalanche this

time at Farmington Canyon north of Salt

Lake City search and rescue crews tried

to find a trapped 18 year old he was

later flown to a hospital but did not

survive his father says the teens blow

up backpack failed to deploy

another tragedy from a massive winter

storm that has swept across the Upper us

blizzard conditions shut down highways

it's hard to stop police in several

other states report staggering

statistics over 800 kilometers of a

major highway shut down in Nebraska in

Minnesota police reported nearly 200

crashes and in Pennsylvania a pileup

involving 15 tractor trailers closed

busy interstate 90 in both directions at

airports across the country delays and

cancellations put a halt on Trump lers

plans we have passengers we're dealing

with and then just trying to keep the

conditions good even in winter ready New

England crews worked all night to keep

the roads passable it's a quick head

we've got to get out there and spread

salt and traffic will grind the salt in

and keep the road safe until we do that

till it's time to go plow a bizarre

weather change of events for people in

the Northeast

after temperatures hit 21 degrees

Celsius last week as this monster storm

starts to wind down some decided to make

the best of it it's so exciting and

there's so much energy and enthusiasm

down here we're really excited to be

here and spend the day here and this

advice for those who don't like winters

messy weather great I love the weather

you don't like the weather as people dig

out from this massive storm and wind

chills in the Dakotas expected to

plummet to 40 degrees below zero Florida

may look like a tempting option Jennifer

Johnson global news there is sadness and

grief in Ukraine tonight as the bodies

of the victims of downed Ukrainian Air

Lines flight 752 are returned to their

native country the world is still

waiting to find out exactly what

happened in the moments before the plane

was shot down by Iran and his Abigail

Beaman explains there's concern the

Iranian government may be backtracking

on its promise to turn over the black

boxes

at Kiev's Airport a chance to remember

11 victims killed on flight PS 752 as

their bodies return home in Montreal

shared grief at this memorial 57

Canadian citizens were on the plane 29

permanent residents we know 30 have now

been buried in Iran and the prime

minister said this week families want

about 20 victims to come home to Canada

Armen more a table lost his twin brother

and sister-in-law please go investigate

and find what has happened that night it

was a necessary steps to stand up for

their families

Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister flew

to the cabinet retreat in Winnipeg

straight from his rare face-to-face

meeting with his Iranian counterpart I

stress that then I said you know Iran as

a as a pact to choose either they go to

the pad of transparency accountability

and are taking full responsibility when

you say to the world you take full

responsibility that comes with

consequences but since he left new

reports emerged that Iran may not turn

over the black boxes for a third-party

investigation when Francois Philippe

champagne heard that he reached out

again in writing to push for it perhaps

the delay in handing over the black

boxes related to something on that black

box that may implicate Iran furthers the

two Canadian Transportation Safety Board

investigators who were on the ground in

Iran left for Ukraine Sunday after six

days examining the wreckage more are on

standby for when a decision is made

about the black boxes I mean I'm sure

there'll be a more of an update of what

type of work that needs to be done but

one thing I can assure you is we're

working very hard to making sure that

that the investigation that is going to

be conducted is going to be credible and

independent not a lot of answers as the

world waits for Iran's next move and

Canada doesn't have a lot of options

after years of economic sanctions and no

diplomatic relations with Iran abigail

Beeman Global News Winnipeg

a new development on Harry and Megan's

departure from rural service the Duke of

Sussex spoke at an event in London

tonight he says he and his wife had

hoped to continue the Royal duties

without public funding while living an

independent life but Prince Harry says

they couldn't reach an agreement to do

that I've accepted this knowing that it

doesn't change who I am or how committed

I am but I hope that helps you

understand what did it come to that I

would step my family back from all I

have ever known just take us to take a

step forward into what I hope can be a

more peaceful life buckingham palace

confirmed the couple will stop using

their royal highness titles harry megan

and their eight month old son Archie

will divide their time between Canada

and the UK now the Duke and Duchess of

Sussex are classified as internationally

protected persons so technically the

Canadian government must provide them

with security when they visit but their

new deal with the Queen is raising

questions about how much time they will

be spending in Canada and just how much

their security will cost Canadian

taxpayers Canada's public safety

minister says the federal government is

still assessing Canada's role as we do

in every case if individuals require

security that's all determined by a very

thorough assessment assessment by our

officials to determine what's necessary

and and what the costs might might

therefore be but again that

determination has not yet been made

meanwhile Megan's estranged father is

offering some blunt scrutiny of the

situation in a recent interview Thomas

Markel accuses his daughter of

cheapening the royal family and says

he's embarrassed that she and Harry made

this decision she actually got every

girl's dream every young girl wanted to

become a princess and she got that and

now she's tossing that away for it looks

like she's tossing away for money

landscape heat waves and a long-running

drought field the biggest wildfire

crisis ever recorded down under a

hundred and four thousand square

kilometres of land were destroyed that's

an area the size of the Maritimes the

government is planning to receive for is

destroyed by fire but experts doubt that

will match the scope of the destruction

coming up the federal plan to rewrite

the rules around medically assisted

dying

one Leto on the go reliable accurate and

easy to use the global news sky tracker

weather app

one of Canada's beloved an influential

artists Gordon Smith has died at the age

of a hundred Smith was born in England

and moved to Canada in the 1930s where

he studied art during the Second World

War he served as an intelligence officer

for the Canadian military Smith was

guided as a painter under the mentorship

of the group of seven artists Lauren

Harris his work can be found in major

art galleries including the one bearing

his own name Smith died at his home in

West Vancouver last night the federal

government is running out of time to put

new medically assisted dying rules in

place last year a Quebec judge deemed

the current law too restrictive and

unconstitutional Ottawa now has less

than two months to rewrite it and as

Linda Ellsworth explains they want your

input on the new legislation which is

expected to be tabled next month when

medical assistants in dying or made

became law in Canada and 2016 many

aspects of the complicated topic were

covered by the bill in particular a

fundamental aspect of that law was the

end-of-life criterion which basically

meant that it was restricted to people

who were at the end of their life and

we're going to pass away anyway the

trouble is with the law by providing a

right to one person you may create

vulnerabilities of others but a few

months ago the Superior Court of Quebec

heard the cases of Nicole gladden and

Jean - Sean who wanted the right to

doctor-assisted deaths even though they

weren't dying I don't want to die I want

to stop the deal I want to stop the

sufferings the ruling the Quebec

Superior Court has said that that part

of the law is unconstitutional and so

the federal ministers of justice and

disability inclusion we're in Vancouver

as part of an eight City cross-canada

tour asking experts on the subject for

input we've had a number of

very interesting roundtables across

Canada from Halifax to Vancouver and

there's a diversity of opinion but but a

lot of interesting and and specific

concrete suggestions in terms of meeting

the the criterion to the Quebec is very

quickly because the court-ordered

deadline is March 11th not much time to

rewrite such a complex law my goal is to

get a draft bill in front of the House

of Commons during the month of February

we haven't ruled out the possibility of

asking for an extension but for the time

being my priority is getting that bill

in front of the house they're also

asking the public to participate in an

online questionnaire as of yesterday

over a hundred and 150 thousand people

had participated in the online survey in

you know in only a short period of time

you'll find it on the Department of

Justice Canada homepage is the

Aylesworth global news still ahead the

bold pleads targeting cargo trucks in

the Greater Toronto Area

staggering new data shows the number of

tractor-trailer thefts and cargo crime

is on the rise in the Greater Toronto

Area thieves are stealing anything from

meat to liquor the Ontario trucking

association says more needs to be done

to combat these crimes including

changing the laws to include stiffer

penalties for those convicted global

Toronto's Camille Cara Malley reports

this video uploaded to YouTube this

drunken stolen appears to show a

Brampton man going head-to-head with a

tractor trailer thief before the alleged

cargo criminal drives off something

trucking company manager harm Ajith Jan

has seen firsthand it is definitely a

concern cargo theft has been a concern

for the last five years around the

Greater Toronto Area only peel and York

Regional Police have units dedicated to

tackling cargo and tractor-trailer

thefts the number of robberies in the

past five years in Peel has soared in

2015

ninety eight cases of cargo theft in

2018 that jumped to a whopping 341 cases

reported the GTA is the hotbed of cargo

crime in Canada there are more goods

stolen in Canada than all of the US and

2018 peel region comes only behind

California as the highest jurisdiction

for cargo crime police say the criminals

will steal anything including meat

that's what was in the stolen tractor

trailer that rammed into a gas station

just outside Toronto killing the driver

a rare fatality in what police call a

low-risk high-reward crime with the bad

guys netting roughly 30% of the stolen

goods value after reselling we've had

loads million dollars worth so you do

the math they're making pretty good

money for One Nights work

the Ontario trucking association says

that money is used to fund more

nefarious criminal activity it's easy

because police are struggling to keep up

and a justice system that allows the

cargo thieves to walk right back out

onto the streets they're usually

released within

24 hours and there unfortunately back

out doing exactly what they were doing

before

truckers are calling for change I think

the laws need teeth the laws as are

currently written do not differentiate

between simple crime and cargo crime

police say part of the responsibility is

also on the trucking companies to beef

up security

Camila Kamali Global News Toronto up

next we check in on st. John's

Newfoundland in the aftermath of the

storm

most people in st. John's are still

digging themselves out of the

record-breaking levels of snowfall that

buried them this weekend as we reported

earlier the military is mobilizing to

assist but for now it's neighbor helping

neighbor the weather networks Chris

Murphy is there to give us a little

perspective on the snowy situation all

right well you clearly see today it's

all about the big dig digging out look

at the size of these snow banks it's

unreal I have never seen this as a

result of one storm maybe back to back

to back

we call this that's the cavalry right

there hooking up the power now they've

done most of the larger grids now

they're just working their way down the

line and trying to get everybody there

but as we just take a little walk here I

mean for all we know there could be

stars under these snow banks but those

have been digging out I've also been

noticing a lot of people helping each

other out so people have been asking me

yes its record-breaking is this an

unprecedented storm

well we actually get storms like this

our storms similar size almost every

year it's just this year it was st.

John's turn to get hit it just hit the

sweet spot and call this a weather bomb

and that what happens is that the

barometric pressure plummets at least 24

millibars in 24 hours or less

essentially it means that it's like a

storm and then it gets injected by

steroids and that's how we happened we

had the cold air from the continent

colliding with that warm air coming up

from the Gulf Stream the last time I

could ever remember storm anything

comparable to this would have been the

one known as white one back in February

2004 Maritimers remember they're still

talking about that storm in Halifax and

this one here well this one's for the

books no doubt about it talking with

power this rivals you know some of the

bad ice storms we've had if you look

back at our rich history of Canadian

winter storms we'll have to add one more

I guess we should come up with a name

for it I'll let other people decide that

so going forward well we got to take

advantage of the calm conditions and

clear skies because there's more snow

coming in tonight another 10 15 plus

centimeters of snow and that means that

people will be digging out again

tomorrow so it won't compare to this but

it will be adding a little bit of insult

to injury

as it were but just one more look

everybody doing their job to the city

crews they've been really big thumbs up

thanks Chris and that is global national

for this Sunday I'm Robin Gill tonight

your Canada is a resilient Robin in a

snowstorm in Oshawa Ontario thank you

for watching

Donna freeze and we'll be back here

tomorrow have a great night
