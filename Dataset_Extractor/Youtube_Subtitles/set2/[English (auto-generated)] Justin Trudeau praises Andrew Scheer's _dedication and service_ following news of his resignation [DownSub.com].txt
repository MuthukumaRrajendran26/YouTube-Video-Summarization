the right honorable Prime Minister I

know there will be many more moments for

us to reflect and celebrate and the

dedication and service that the member

opposite has offered and continues to

offer to Canadians in his work as an MP

for Regina Capel and his work as former

Speaker of the House and in his work as

leader of the Conservative Party of

Canada

I know thoughts first and foremost are

for family I want to salute Jill and

recognize his kids who I know better

than most have made significant

sacrifices to see their father take on a

leadership position like this and

I know from the many conversations I've

had over the years with the Honorable

leader that he sees very much the way I

and so many others see our

responsibilities as parents doing good

parents to our kids

in a similar way that we are politicians

we are in this house not in spite of

having kids but because we have kids and

are dedicated to building a better world

for them with everything we have and I

respect that deeply of him and thank him

for that focus on a better future for

his kids

an extraordinary privilege that is

enriching and wonderful and I know that

the member opposite has shown tremendous

strength and compassion as he has done
