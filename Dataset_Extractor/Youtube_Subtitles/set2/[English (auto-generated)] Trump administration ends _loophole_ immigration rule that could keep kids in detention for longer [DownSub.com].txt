good morning thank you for joining us

today to discuss important action in the

administration is taking to address the

ongoing security and humanitarian crisis

at our southwest border publishing a

final rule to implement the Flores

settlement agreement this year we have

seen an unprecedented flow of family

units primarily from Central America

coming to our southwest border during

the first ten months of this fiscal year

US Customs and Border Protection

apprehended or encountered almost four

hundred and seventy five thousand

families ninety percent of whom crossed

our border unlawfully between ports of

entry three times more than any previous

full-year record and the month of May

alone we saw eighty eight thousand six

hundred and thirty members of family

units arrive at our border four times

the record month in the last major surge

as I've testified multiple times and as

experts throughout this administration

as well as leaders from previous

administrations have explained the

driving factor for this crisis is

weakness in our legal framework for

immigration human smugglers advertised

an intending migrants in know well that

even if they cross the border illegally

arriving in our border with a child has

meant that they will be released into

the United States to wait for court

proceedings that could take five years

or more this key gap in our immigration

framework comes from a 2015

reinterpretation of the Flores

settlement agreement an agreement that

is now more than two decades old by a

federal district court judge this

reinterpretation which applied for the

first time the requirements of the Flora

settlement to accompany minors has

generally forced the government to

release families into the country after

just 20 days and incentivizing illegal

entry adding to the growing backlog in

immigration proceedings and often

delaying immigration proceedings for

many years

this single ruling has substantially

caused and continued to fuel the current

family unit crisis and the unprecedented

flow of Central American families and

minors illegally crossing our border

until today after nearly two years of

work by the Department of Homeland

Security and health and human services

professionals consideration of over

100,000 comments from stakeholders and

members of the public and a

comprehensive review the Trump

administration has established a new

rule to respond to the realities of

current immigration flows a rule based

in the principle

that family should remain together

during immigration proceedings while the

Flores settlement agreement is

operationally outdated and does not

respond to the current immigration

crisis it has many important aspects and

principles like the need for special

protections for children and high

standards for government facilities that

were adopted as defining features in

this new rule this is an extensive and

detailed rule but this morning I want to

highlight four key elements first and

foremost the new rule permanently

establishes standards of care in custody

for children and families these

standards are high in doing so the rule

fulfills one of the central original

purposes of the 1997 Flores court

settlement agreement to ensure

appropriate care for all children a

national standard of care ensures that

care of custody care in custody of

children and families is not a policy

decision and should not be subject to

the ebbs and flows of state and local

politics instead all children in the

government's care will be universally

treated with dignity respect and special

concern in concert with American values

and faithful to the intent of the

original settlement the facilities that

we will be using to temporarily house

families under this rule are

appropriately fundamentally different

than the facilities where migrants are

processed following apprehension or

encounter at the border there are campus

like settings with appropriate medical

educational recreational dining and

private housing facilities for example

the first family residential center in

Berks Pennsylvania has suites where each

family is housed separately furniture

bedding towels clothing and toiletries

are provided there's a large community

living room that has big-screen

television cushioned couches and lounge

chairs a gaming area and a separate

library that contains books other

television sets video games and board

games facility also has an entire wing

dedicated to classroom learning where

minors at the facility go to school five

days a week another wing is a medical

facility where minors and their parents

receive any necessary medical care

including all immunizations required for

later admission to u.s. public schools

there are also phone banks to call

relatives consulates attorneys and other

representatives in all federal excuse me

in all family residential centers three

hot meals a day are provided and snacks

are available throughout the day all of

our three family residential centers

offer a variety of indoor and outdoor

day

the recreation activities for children

and adults indoor activities offered

include a variety of sports group

exercise classes arts and crafts classes

movie nights and even seasonal holiday

themed activities outdoor recreational

facilities include soccer fields

volleyball courts and play structures

the FRC's have video conferencing set up

for court hearings and private meeting

rooms so the families can meet with

their attorneys or representatives child

care is provided to the parents while

they meet with their attorneys of

representatives or attend to these

hearings interpreting services are

available 24 hours a day via telephone

attorneys and Representatives approved

to appear at immigration court hearings

are provided access to the residents at

various times each week enabling

families to obtain counsel and not have

to appear in immigration hearings as pro

se respondents the new rule will ensure

that children and families in the care

of the government are temporarily housed

in facilities that are appropriate for

their well-being second the new rule

closes the legal loophole that arose

from the reinterpretation of Florist

which Congress has refused to do

allowing the federal government to house

alien families together in appropriate

facilities during fair and expeditious

proceedings as was done by the previous

administration in 2014 and 2015

prior to the 2015 court ruling that

restricted our use of the frcs

immigration proceedings averaged less

than 50 days granting those with

meritorious claims prompt relief and

permission to stay in the US with

appropriate documentation while swiftly

repaid training those with meritless

claims who have comprised a substantial

majority of the families arriving and

being processed our goal remains as in

the previous administration to provide

an expeditious immigration result while

holding families together which

particularly benefits legitimate asylum

seekers with meritorious claims the

current system however serves those with

meritless claims and leaves all migrants

in a state of limbo for years in recent

months the majority of final orders of

removal for families who recently

arrived at our border have been issued

in absentia over 85 percent this rule

changes that dynamic the result of

holding families together under the

previous administration was a dramatic

reduction in the flow of unlawful

crossings by families the 2015 court

ruling upended that process and the

direct and predictable result has been

to family surge crises at the border

first in 2016 and now at unprecedented

levels this year when fully implemented

the new rule will restore the humane and

effective procedures employed in 2014

and 2015

third by closing this key loophole in

Flora's new rule will restore integrity

to our immigration system and eliminate

the major poll factor fueling the crisis

as I stated earlier this this year has

brought record volumes of families to

our southwest border in the first ten

months of the fiscal year US Customs and

Border Protection has observed at four

hundred and sixty nine percent increase

in the number of family units

apprehended between ports of entry from

our FY 18 numbers while this year's

increase is especially dramatic family

apprehensions have increased at an

annual average of 72 percent over the

past fiscal year fiscal years in fiscal

year 2013 before florist was

reinterpreted the total number of family

and its apprehended entering the United

States illegally on the southern border

was fourteen thousand eight hundred and

fifty five again by August of this

fiscal year we have already seen almost

four hundred and seventy-five thousand

family and it's apprehended by

eliminating the incentive to make the

journey of the United States as a family

the new rule will reduce the

unprecedented volume a family units at a

strain the already limited resources of

our department components and put

children throughout the region at risk

the scale of this crisis has required us

to ask a tremendous amount of our boar

Patrol agents and CBP officers as they

have stepped up this new rule provided

them with well-deserved relief and allow

them to rededicate the resources and

time towards stopping criminals at the

border the job they signed up to do and

fourth the new rule will protect

children by reducing incentives for

adults including human smugglers to

exploit minors in the dangerous journey

to our borders using them to beat the

system and be released into the United

States so far this fiscal year border

agents have identified approximately

6,000 migrants who have fraudulently

presented as members of family and it's

at the border in response US Immigration

and Customs Enforcement Homeland

Security Investigations has conducted

two DNA pilot testing programs that have

definitively identified dozens of cases

and which children had no familiar

relation to the adults claiming that in

the first operation operation double

helix 116 out of 84 family and its are

identified as fraud

based on negative DNA results in the

second operation of the operation 79 of

our 522 family and it's tested have been

identified as fraudulent based on

negative DNA results to date these

egregious examples of migrants posing as

family and it's that Isis uncovered

demonstrates the necessity of this new

rule no child should be a pawn in a

scheme to manipulate our immigration

system which is why the new rule

eliminates the incentive to exploit

children as a free ticket or as one

gentleman in Guatemala told me a

passport for migration to the United

States this action by the administration

is just one part of our overall effort

but it's an essential one that will do a

great deal to address the crisis we are

facing to emphasize again at the heart

of this new rule our two core principles

that family should remain together

during immigration proceedings and that

conditions for care of children must be

appropriate the new rule establishes a

high national standard for - for care of

children and families in custody allows

the government to keep families together

for fair and expeditious immigration

proceedings restores integrity to our

immigration system and eliminates the

incentive for children to be used or

exploited to enter the United States the

for security and migration challenges we

face require a whole-of-government

approach and we look forward to working

together including with our

international partners to continue to

address them thank you I look forward to

taking your questions we've done this

before as the department homeland

security in 2014 and 2015 under then

secretary jeh Johnson family residential

centers were established and these

proceedings were implemented during that

time period the average stay was under

50 days for completion of immigration

proceeding

CGT is released over 130,000 family

units since March as you and you all

said because your systems are over well

are you prepared to detain all of these

family units starting tomorrow or will

more bed space active yeah we're not

gonna be detaining every family unit

that arrives starting tomorrow

what Flores the regulation

implementation does and again it's not

going to be effective for 60 days from

publishing in the Federal Register which

is Friday but it allows us to keep

families together through their

immigration proceedings we have three

then the residential centers about 3,000

total family beds in those centers but

that's going to allow us to bring

families in finish immigration

proceedings as one of a multi-layered

strategy we're also working with Central

America we're working with Mexico to

address integration flows we have the

migrant protection protocols which can

be used to have families waiting in

Mexico during their immigration

proceedings as well so what this will do

is substantially increase our ability to

end the catch and release challenges

that have fueled this crisis for

families you've said that eliminating

the incentive for families to make the

journey to the u.s. is obviously one of

the primary goals here but is it

possible that families considering

coming here will not really listen to

the Flores ruled issue they will hear

words that you just said like campus

like settings suite for each family

families will remain together library

gaming area three hot meals soccer

fields and they'll say wow that sounds

great let's go I don't think so in our

experience that the main driver for

immigration flows is the the perception

that they'll be successful in being

allowed to stay in the United States if

we have a process it gets immigration

results and the vast majority are being

repatriated and in timely fashion that's

the message that people will see five to

seven thousand per person a dangerous

journey in the hands of smugglers to the

US ultimately not successful within a

matter of weeks and months that's going

to be what changes the dynamic that's

what happened in 2014 that's what that's

what's happened whenever we've been able

to effectively implement

and immigration consequences for people

that don't have meritorious claims so

obviously there will be litigation as

you know all new immigration rules of

face litigation in my career so we do

expect a you know a dialogue in the

course and in fact this rule

contemplates terminating the flora

settlement agreement and actually

there's a legal proceeding just to do

that coming out of the implementation so

we do expect litigation we do hope to be

able to implement as soon as possible

again we have approximately 2,500 to

3,000 beds depending on family

configuration first of all thank you for

rolling the press conference today we're

leaving to your trip to Panama can you

speak to the Washington Post report that

you're looking to strike an asylum deal

that would allow the u.s. actually we've

got a much broader agenda for our trip

to Panama we're engaging in a

ministerial meeting we do a monthly

ministerial with the interior and

security ministers from Central America

it started just with the northern

triangle countries with the US as an

observer now it's expanded to include

Costa Rica and Panama we're gonna have

Colombia there we're gonna be talking

about regional security issues on a

broad basis in terms of our bilateral

discussions with Panama it's a new

administration they were inaugurated

last month my counterpart the Interior

Minister Minister morones is a strong

law enforcement background we've had

great initial conversations we're going

to talk about our broad security

relationship and building on a strong

foundation for partnership information

sharing with Panama that will include

the movement of drugs through the region

that will include human smugglers and

traffickers and a dialogue about the

irregular migration flows but there was

not going to be any specific agreement

negotiated on this trip

all these countries are concerned about

extra Cottonelle asylum-seekers the

flows come through the entire isthmus of

Central America the the smugglers that

are bringing them are charging 25,000 to

50,000 per person for these flows we

have seen security risks embedded in

these flows so absolutely this will be a

topic of conversation for all the

ministers the purpose of holding

individuals at the administrative

custody during immigration proceedings

is to get an immigration result as

expeditiously as possible and for those

that have meritorious claims to have

them released and for those that do not

meet the standards to have them

repatriated the the rule also

establishes very clear parole and bond

procedures for the release of

individuals going through their

proceedings for various reasons so

there's no intent to hold families for a

long period of time in fact we have the

prior experience that shows we were able

to average under 50 days that that is

the intent for a fair but expeditious

immigration proceeding

but follow up on that after the time

period in 2015 in which 50 days it's

dramatically different from the time

period now the backlog has exploded to

900,000 cases it's an average of two

years what other steps are you taking to

ensure that you can get in that 50 day

period given that the backlog has

actually worsened much more dramatically

since then sure just make an important

distinction here the the detained docket

this is the Court dockets that

immigration judges operate where people

are held in immigration custody and ice

custody those move much more quickly

than the multi-year numbers you're

hearing for the non detain docket that

nine hundred thousand to a million case

backlog is on the non detain docket the

detain docket actually moves for single

adults much more rapidly than 50 days so

we do anticipate being able to keep

these cases on track docket non just

mean docket there's been a lot of

movement there's been sort of

ever-changing requirements for these

immigration judges in terms of what they

should be prioritizing those things are

connected so what what other steps can

you take yeah we work closely with DOJ

the executive office for immigration

review and we're targeting those

priority cases that are going to make an

impact on this humanitarian and border

security crisis that means those recent

border arrivals and the detain docket as

well as micro protection protocols will

continue to be the focus for timely

adjudication to build more family

residential countries that we've been

devised

so I'm just wondering if if that is the

case we could confirmed it how would

this Agreement you know - just a quick

reminder we did ask Congress for

additional family beds in the 2019

budget process and in the Supplemental

we did not receive them so I think

that's important to recall but going

back to 2014 when we established family

residential centers in the first place

the initial housing for families was at

a dorm like setting at the Border Patrol

Academy then under secretary Johnson and

really those initial hearings getting

results and having families repatriated

had a significant deterrent effect on

the flow and so by the time the family

residential centers were built out they

had enough capacity to manage the

ongoing flow we anticipate a similar

reaction when migrants and smugglers

understand that a child is no longer

that that free pass or quote/unquote

passport to the u.s. for migration so

both we do have funding for the family

residential centers that it currently

exists they do include significant

standards and again this is all

articulated in this this multi hundred

page rule we do have contract

professionals medical professionals

mental health professionals counseling

professionals all going to be on staff

at these centers and managing and

interacting with the families and

children

publish again it goes to the register

today published Friday

officially and then it's effective 60

days later
