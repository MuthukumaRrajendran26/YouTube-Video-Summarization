I'm announcing the House of

Representatives moving forward with an

official impeachment inquiry that's

Nancy Pelosi the Speaker of the United

States House of Representatives calling

for an official impeachment inquiry

against President Donald Trump but what

does that mean and how close are we to

an actual impeachment the short answer

were not close an official impeachment

inquiry is just step one the inquiry is

launched to officially investigate the

president for potentially breaching the

law and policies six different

committees including the Judiciary

Committee will bring forward their

strongest cases which may point to these

breaches those results will be analyzed

by the judiciary committee we may see

some additional focus on some of this

investigative information that other

committees have come up with and then I

think the next question after that is

will the Judiciary Committee choose to

do what's called report out articles of

impeachment to the full house at this

point the Judiciary Committee will

either vote in favor or against the idea

of releasing a report it would be the

decision by the House Judiciary

Committee to have a vote in committee to

send articles of impeachment

it's the delineation of what conduct

they believe the president has engaged

in that constitutes grounds for

impeachment if the Judiciary Committee

votes against the idea the official

impeachment inquiry ends if they decide

to vote in favor of releasing a report

then the report goes to the House of

Representatives a group consisting of

435 members the House of Representatives

would then go through the report and

vote to either approve or disregard the

breaches committed by the president if

the house chose to approve one or more

of those articles then they would go

over to the Senate where there would be

a trial so you can think of this a

little bit like the decision by a grand

jury to indict someone on for a

particular crime the Senate which

consists of 100 members would then vote

and decide whether or not the president

should be removed from office

an official impeachment inquiry was also

done against President Nixon in 1973 and

president

Clinton in 1998
