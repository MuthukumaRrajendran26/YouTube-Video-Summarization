Andrew Shearer says he'll stand by a

candidate who has said derogatory

remarks in the past as long as they

apologize now the conservative leader

made the comments while speaking with

reporters on his campaign plane enroute

to Vancouver in four days on the

hustings Shearer has had to deal with

these questions after some liberal

cabinet ministers posted videos showing

current conservative candidates

espousing discriminatory beliefs the

latest video is a vada wall wedding

dress designer and candidate in the

Capitol Justyna McCaffrey she was

telling a reporter a year ago that she's

bothered by Liberal leader Justin

Trudeau's quote preoccupation with the

French for example the Quebec people she

has since apologized but there are also

questions about her apparent friendship

with faith Goldie a woman who has been

banned from Facebook and who has been

accused of promoting white supremacy a

party official says it has been years

since the two women have even seen each

other earlier this week Shearer was

forced to let go of a candidate in a

Winnipeg area who hid his Facebook

accounts in which he made discriminatory

statements however he continues to stand

by Ontario candidate goddamn Alec who

was reportedly blocked from running for

the Ontario PC Party because she shared

multiple posts on social media that were

homophobic and anti-muslim now all of

this because she apologized as long as

someone takes responsibility for what

they say and and and and and addresses

the fact that in 2019 some things that

may have been said in the past are

inappropriate today

if anything that they've ever said in

the past caused any type of hurt or

disrespect to one community or another

and have apologized for that I accept

that you know I accept the fact that

people can make mistakes in the past

every party has had issues with past

comments coming back to haunt candidates

and Shearer says this is just an effort

by the Liberals to distract from their

own problems
