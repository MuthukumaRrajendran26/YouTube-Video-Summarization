I'd like to start with something that

you'd probably rather forget but the

fact that you've been exposed to someone

who wore blackface on what we know of

three occasions most recently in 2001

when you were 29 years old and a teacher

it is the biggest hit your campaign has

taken so far it's all down to you it was

you doing that

putting that makeup on what does that

done to your campaign and what does it

say about your judgement I think it's

something that I've recognized was a

terrible mistake I should have known

better at the time but I didn't and I'm

I'm going to have to work a long time to

continue to demonstrate the kind of

focus I've had on fighting racism

fighting discrimination fighting

intolerance as I've worked on as a

politician you know your critics say it

makes you a hypocrite that you set high

standards for other people but you don't

live up to them yourself

certainly has had high standards for

myself as well and I hurt a lot of

people I care about deeply it was a

terrible mistake and I take full

responsibility for it I applied those

high standards to myself I will always

fight against racism and tolerance and

discrimination and I heard a lot of

people who who considered me an ally you

know people have been fired for the

doing this certainly lost their

reputations for it you've asked for

forgiveness but why should Canadians

give you a pass because your leader of a

party I have someone who has

demonstrated throughout my political

career and indeed as Prime Minister that

fighting anti-black racism fighting

systemic discrimination fighting

unconscious bias and putting real money

and real initiatives and working hard to

fight all this intolerance is something

that I'm I've done and I'm going to

continue to do and I'm going to continue

to do even more given that I have

obviously not lived up to that in the

past when did you stop thinking that

darkening your skin was acceptable

was it something did someone tell you

hey

you know this is crazy you're you're

covering not only your face your throat

your hands I think in the video even

your legs did someone say to you Justin

you not to give this up as I've spoken

about I represent one of the most

diverse multicultural ridings in the

country and the work I've done in you

know the late 2012 2008-2009 to be a

better representative a good

representative for people by spending

time in mosques and good Juarez and with

the Haitian community and all the

diverse communities in my writing and

fighting for them let me to understand

to a much greater degree the kind of

discrimination and intolerance that

people face on a daily basis because of

the color of their skin and that's where

why I understand now which I should have

understood then that it is always

unacceptable so is when you got into

politics I think the years following my

father's death involved a lot of changes

for me I went back to Montreal in 2002 I

went back to school studied engineering

studied environmental geography I got

involved more with Katimavik Canada's

national youth service program I did

more environmental and youth activism I

was learning a lot more about public

engagement a lot more about service and

obviously I am a very different person

today than I was back then

so 2001 was the last time have you

talked to your mother about this

yes I've talked to my mother I've talked

to my kids I've talked to what did you

have friends my mum my mom as someone

who has lived through very difficult

times

in the public eye some of it possibly

deserved some of it not she reminded me

to stay focused on both the people I've

hurt and how I'm going to do better in

the future was she disappointed in you I

think everyone a lot of people who know

me we're disappointed in me you

disappointed in yourself sure of course

I hurt people who I care about deeply

and who trusted me and that is something

that I I need to understand but also

something that I'm going to need to work

for the rest of my life to do better you

know lots of people are making fun of

you comedians late-night talk show hosts

you become the butt of jokes do you

think you've embarrassed Canada on the

world stage I think we we've seen a

social media world and indeed an

entertainment world that has you know

chosen to poke fun at me for many things

in the past I think at the same time a

lot of people know that the things we're

doing is the government and the things

that we've achieved and what we stand

for also matters and you know people

will do what they do I'm gonna stay

focused on serving Canadians in the

right it's made headlines around the

world that other stuff doesn't this did

oh there have been other times that

there have been headlines around the

world for you don't think this was

stands out as a tactically absolutely

this does absolutely this does and it

forces me and us to continue to do even

more to fight discrimination and racism

it's certainly something that I'm going

to do are there any other skeletons in

the closet things that you've done in

your past that

you're not proud of that you've

disclosed to your staff we've all made

mistakes in the past but my focus has

been on certainly over the past years on

serving Canada to the best of my ability

and making the kinds of decisions that

have led Canada to do extremely well

over these past four years whether it's

job creation or lifting people out of

poverty or fighting against

discrimination and tolerance we we see a

time in the world where there is a lot

of cynicism and skepticism around

politics around politicians around their

institutions and they're always going to

be things people can point to to become

more cynical inspecting skeptical my

focus has been on trying to demonstrate

that we can do things and we are doing

things that make a real difference in

people's lives I asked you if there are

any more skeletons in the closet that

you've just go disclosed to your staff I

think we've all done things that we are

unhappy with and things that we learn

from and I'm no different than anybody

else so there could be other things I

think they're no different than anyone I

know I'm not perfect about it people

also know what I stand for let's talk

about climate which is top of mind for a

lot of Canadians in this campaign and

they in the world we're living in now

you announced a plan to push Canada to

Net Zero emissions by 2050 that sounds

like a bold plan what specifically are

you going to do what measures are you

going to take to do that

we first of all are going to be meeting

our 2030 targets on track as we've

committed to but we need to do much more

that's why part of what we're doing is

bringing in

panels of experts who will determine the

intermediary targets that will be

legislated every five years in order to

meet them so let me stop you on that

legislated every fight so legally

binding targets that what companies and

provinces will have to we're going to be

talking with experts we're going to be

talking with the the kinds of people who

know what it's going to take to do it

based on what we've already done those

experts yet against rated one ability to

bend the curve we've it did Minna

demonstrated that we can reduce

emissions because we are going to be

meeting those 2030 targets 2030 targets

2030 yet right but you're not track we

are on track we are absolutely on track

canada remains one of the biggest

emitters per capita in the world

emissions have been going up and we as a

country on track under your eliminate

all to reach meet our emissions

reduction targets by 2030 and the way

we've done that is by putting a price on

pollution is by moving forward on

protecting our oceans in moving forward

on banning single-use plastics on

changing behaviors on investing in in

renewables we have demonstrated real

action on this and i agree we have more

to do but the choice canadians are

facing right now is between a government

that has done lots and will do lots more

or a conservative government that has

never done anything to fight climate

change and is not serious about it and

doesn't even understand that fighting

climate changes not just an

environmental imperative it's an

economic imperative and that choice that

people are facing right now i mean i

give you credit for saying yes we need

to do more absolutely the Conservatives

are the ones who think we need to do

this so we're gonna talk separately to

the conservative leader but I want to

ask you about your policies and your

plans and the National carbon tax as has

essentially fallen apart you have not

been successful in putting that in place

actually have put that in place and in

framework penque pretty well dissolves

how do you say this to solve there it's

not a it's not a national carbon tax

it hasn't been so it hasn't been as

successful as you would like it yes it

has and it is in place in every province

across the country the pan-canadian

framework on climate change is in place

and that's that's a good place to start

because if people aren't clear on that

we have brought in a price on pollution

right across the country and yes there

are conservative premiers who are

fighting against it in provinces from

from the Rockies to the Bay of Fundy

because they don't think we should be

moving on family there they're spending

millions in court of taxpayer money to

try and fight that pollution pricing but

we are winning and that price on

pollution is in place right across the

country now yes Andrew Shearer says he

will make pollution free again if he

gets elected but we moved forward on

that and I'm glad to correct people on

that we have a price on pollution right

across the country right now one that

returns more money in the provinces that

refuse to do it then they actually pay

out getting back to your planet was

announced today what will you do to

companies who can't meet these targets

or won't meet these targets or the

legally binding the plan we announced

today features cutting in half corporate

taxes on big and in small companies that

are developing zero emission technology

because we know there is trillions of

dollars in opportunity around the world

for zero emission technologies and now

Canada is going to be able to be a

leader in general and how much money

would that generate that well we can

imagine the the the companies that set

up shop in Canada because they are

paying less taxes than anywhere else in

the world to make those initiatives were

already been been judged to be one of

the easiest company countries to set up

environmentally clean and cutting-edge

clean tech businesses we're continuing

to create that advantage so we create

jobs and growth and economic opportunity

on solutions that the world is going to

need that's a a tangible thing where we

create solutions that work for Canada

and work for the world as well in

contrasts with others who don't think we

should be doing anything on the

environment so I think people are hungry

for details on how you're going to do

that when would we

know that I am very excited about this

coming week where we will be laying out

more pillars of our environmental plan

where we will demonstrate that we are

serious about tackling climate change

and really emphasize that choice that

Canadians are facing between

conservatives who don't believe in

acting on climate change and don't

understand that it's not just the

environment but it's our economy that is

at stake did you hear Greta turn berg at

the UN her address did you find it

how did you find it was it unnerving for

you as a world leader was it unsettling

I found it incredibly compelling and

challenging and really important even

with everything we've done and

everything Canadians and particularly

young Canadians Greta is not the only

one we've seen the millions of young

people marching around the world and

young Canadians telling me everyday we

need to do more but even with all those

voices we still have conservative

politicians at the provincial level

fighting any action on climate change

and this election is pivotal for young

people and for all Canadians on to

whether we make a choice to continue and

do more on fighting climate change or

else we stick our heads in the sand and

try and hide from the changes that are

going to be challenging our kids another

issue that's top of mind for Canadians

is healthcare and you announced some

plans yesterday to help Canadians find a

family doctor thousands of Canadians as

you know don't have a family doctor my

aging parents didn't have one when they

died I didn't have one when I moved here

from the UK took the years to find one

this is an issue that's really affecting

the daily life of so many Canadians how

are you going to make that happen the

same way we moved forward when we signed

the previous group of health accords

with the provinces just a couple of

years ago in investing in greater home

care and investing in greater mental

health care we sit down with the

provinces we set clear targets we invest

more federal money in provinces so they

can deliver on these targets of

delivering more health care and more

health care practitioners to communities

particularly remote

communities that need them and yes it

requires partnership with the provinces

an ability we demonstrated when we

renegotiate the health accords with all

10 provinces and 3 territories a few

years ago we're gonna need to move

forward obviously there's going to be

negotiation with the provinces and the

question for Canadians is who do they

want negotiating with Andrews with with

Doug Ford and Jason Kenney and that

choice is very clear when you see what

Kenny is doing what Ford is doing and

what Shearer is proposing to do so are

you promising more family doctors

yes we're we are making a commitment

that the federal money invested in

healthcare is going to help more

Canadians get there help Canadians get

family doctors yes so I think that's

another one where people want detail I

don't get how that's gonna work well

that is in negotiation with the

provinces that is the federal money but

federal government putting six billion

dollars forward as a down payment on

helping the provinces reach targets to

make sure that people can have access to

family doctors and nurse practitioners

and the kind of health care supports

they need you're promising a national

pharma care plan to UM when will that be

in place and how much would that cost

but we recognize that again Pharma care

is something we need to work on with the

provinces there are some things that a

federal government can do we've already

put in place things that will reduce by

thirteen billion dollars over the next

ten years costs of prescription drugs

for Canadians and it's so effective the

drug companies are taking us the court

on that we're moving forward on creating

a pen Canadian Canadian drug agency that

is going to be establishing a formulary

and we're actually also tangibly moving

forward on high cost drugs for rare

diseases which we know is an incredible

challenge for families facing a

particularly rare diseases so we've done

concrete things that move towards that

the next steps is to work with the

provinces to implement their

recommendations in the expert panel and

on Pharma care and that is what we are

there to do yesterday you talked about a

six billion dollar down payment and to

make this happen what's the real cost of

this though there have been others who

have costed it estimated perhaps fifteen

billion dollars a year why don't you

just be clear with Canadians we want to

do this for you this is what it's going

to cost and here's how we're going

pay for it because we're not the only

ones who have a say in doing it the

provinces also have a responsibility to

express what they want and many

provinces already have systems that are

partially there as we work together to

figure out what the national framework

will look like that will become clearer

but like we did in the 2015 election

where we committed three billion dollars

over four years and ended up assigning

health accords that actually invested

even more money than that over the ten

years phrase frame these are

conversations that we need to have but

the question of course for Canadians is

do they want to double down on

conservative leadership when it comes to

their their health care every single

answer you give me comes back to that

it's a choice and they're facing as you

know I'm not gonna give you a lot of

detail in terms of numbers of what I'm

gonna cut or how much things are gonna

cost but I'm gonna say trust me don't

trust that guy your very first question

to me today as we were walking was about

what's the difference between running

with a record now and running in 2015

well what I can say now is look at what

we've done look at what we've been able

to look at how we delivered on those

province promises to Canadians from the

2015 election of investing five and a

half billion dollars in health care in a

home care and another five billion

dollars in mental health look at what

we've done on actually reducing drug

prices for Canadians look at the help

that we've given to families with the

Canada child benefit with lower taxes

for the middle class and raising them on

the wealthiest 1% yes there is an

advantage of having a record to run

because we can say that we did these

things and we're going to be able to do

the next things as well

that's what re-election is about and

that's we're looking at Canadians and

saying we've got lots more to do and we

have a vision and a plan to do that and

the others well they are putting forward

well the Conservatives are putting

forward the exact same approach that

Stephen Harper did I mean when they cut

taxes they cut taxes for the wealthy

that's what you see in every little

piece of their plans they put

was not running in this campaign but his

platform you ask Andrew Shearer where he

differs from Stephen Harper and he will

not answer you because so he is exactly

the same frame of tax breaks to the

wealthy in the hopes of creating growth

so with respect let's talk about you

sure and not not the past conservatives

is still the choice for four years ago

your campaign was about sunny ways you

promised Canadians you would do politics

differently

in the four years you've been office

they've been in office you were found

guilty twice of ethics violations what

have you learned from that that we

continue to have more to do to

demonstrate the kinds of translations

you name is a we as a government we but

these are musical issues where were you

oh sure well let's let's talk about that

one where I was sticking up for Canadian

jobs and trying to move forward in

balancing in respecting our judiciary

while at the same time protecting

Canadian jobs and even before the

commissioners report came out I had

asked an expert panel including headed

up by Ann McClellan to talk to all our

former AG's to figure out how we can

make sure that governments in the future

never get into that situation of having

to balance these impossible things

without a roadmap to do it I understand

that but the ethics commissioner said

you push too far I for partisan reasons

I accept the ethics commissioners report

but I disagreed with his conclusions but

I fully accept his report and therefore

will move forward in measures to make

sure that no future government has that

has that conflict but I will not

apologize for standing up for Canadian

jobs because that is what Canadians

expect me to do to fight for the public

interest you lost two female cabinet

ministers who were prominent and star

members of your cabinet very

well-respected because they said they

lost faith in faith in you what did you

learn from that that's that is a

question for for them as to why they

left no when I left you when they are no

longer part of your cabinet I know you

can argue about they were kicked out of

you that that relationship was severed

and they said they lost faith in you as

a leader

why did you learn from that was there

any soul-searching there absolutely was

and we already brought in ways of

connecting and communicating and dealing

earlier on with people who have concerns

there was there is a need to keep a

better flow of communications within an

organization and that's one of the

things that we've learned from getting

back to the last campaign compared to

this one you promised a lot of things

then and some of them you've delivered

on some of them you've not the first one

electoral reform balancing the budget

meeting climate targets I know you argue

that you're on course others say that

we're not where we should be yeah we are

going to eat our climate targets doing

politics differently and you've been as

I said to ethics violations why should

Canadians trust you now because we made

a commitment to Canadians to grow the

middle class and help people working

hard to join it and we delivered on that

you are today compared to the leader you

were for always every single day in this

job I learn more I learn better ways to

do things I grow in my capacity to serve

Canadians and that is something that

that I feel every single day in our

ability to do even more and that's

reflected in the ambitious platform

we're putting forward with a vision for

the next four years that is going to

continue to take us in that right

direction and that's that's a choice

people are facing do we continue to move

forward or do we go back so I think at

the ballot box for a lot of people it

comes down to when the two candidate to

frontrunner are neck-and-neck

although the polls today are suggesting

you're falling behind a little bit that

it comes down to who do we trust to run

this country that's a fundamental

question about who you are as a leader

not just your policy no it's also a

question about who has the better vision

for the future who gets where the

country is go

and has the team and the capacity to

deliver on that and that's why I'm so

excited about contrasting yes my vision

with the vision of the Conservatives

that does not have a clear vision for

moving this country forward whether it's

on things like banning assault weapons

they want a week in gun control we are

going to strengthen gun control they

don't think we need to move forward on

fighting for a cleaner future and

protecting the environment I know that's

the only way to create jobs and a better

future for our kids and when it comes to

taxes we are all about lowering taxes

for the middle class and for people

working hard to join it they are

actually giving tax breaks to the

wealthiest because that's what they've

always done this conservatives we're

running out of time there's a couple of

quick questions I want to get you bill

c21 you have been sitting on the fence

about that one saying let's leave it to

Quebec critics call it legislated

discrimination can you make it clear to

Canadians what you think about that

legislation I have made it very clear

many times I disagree with that

legislation I do not think we should be

legitimizing discrimination against

anyone anywhere in this country and I've

said it to Quebec as I've said it to all

Canadians but at the same time I know

that the Charter is working the way it

needs to

Quebecers have taken that legislation to

court and are defending the Charter and

we are watching it as it goes but I am

the only federal leader who has not said

that I am never that I'm closing the

door to intervening later this is too

important this is a matter of

fundamental freedoms for people and I

don't think the federal government

should close the door on that why don't

you just say I will interview because I

haven't made that determination yet I am

watching Quebecers defend their charter

rights in court let me ask you about

equalization payments Premier Kenny has

said he wants equalization reform

and that he will call for it no matter

who is elected Prime Minister are you

open to that idea we renewed the

equalization formula has it currently

stands based on a year worth of

conversations with the premiers

conversations with the provinces we

renewed a formula that was actually

created as it is now by Jason Kenney and

the government he was part of so I think

it's playing a lot of politics right now

to be so upset about something that he

set up for political gain right now I am

going to continue to to defend the

system we have in place because it works

and quite frankly if Andrew Shearer

disagrees with Jason Kenney or agrees

with him he needs to answer that

question as well because I'm going to

continue to stand up for the national

interest so taking the parties and stuff

out of it which is what I'm always

trying to do do you believe that the

equalization formula as it stands now is

fair yes everyone in the country and

it'll stand the way it is it'll stand

for the next for the rest of the five

years that we renegotiated with support

from all the provinces just just a year

or so ago one final question about

opioids thousands of people are dying

across this country have died and

continue to die because of opioid

overdoses in all walks of life the Green

Party has said they will decriminalize

drug possession are you open to that

idea we are moving forward on things

that actually work whether it's a safe

consumption safe supply harm reduction

we have demonstrated that we're moving

forward on a evidence-based process

which involves front more funding for

frontline workers more addiction

treatments more supports for communities

there's lots more to do we have done a

lot we're going to continue to do the

things that work specifically are you

open to the idea of decriminalizing

right you know right now we are focused

on safe consumption and harm reduction

so that again that's another question

for the conservatives of why they want

to turn back safe consumption and hard

and reduction this election is a choice

no we're not we're not looking at the

full decriminalization

at all right now there are other things

that we are doing that having a big

impact and we're going to make decisions

based on science and again it goes back

to the choice that Canadians are facing

do we continue to base our decisions on

science and saving lives

with things like safe consumption or do

we go backwards as the Conservatives are

proposing and one more question you're

taking a lot of heat for not costing

your platform our platform will be

absolutely fully costed and we are

working when we release our full

platform very shortly very shortly in

the next week very shortly you can't

expect Canadians to believe all the

promises nothing comes for free right

you need we've we demonstrated in 2015

an incredibly ambitious platform that

was fully costed we're doing exactly

that again and this time we get to work

with the PBO because we made a change

that ensured that every party could work

with the PPO to make that Parliamentary

Budget Officer to make sure that their

platforms are properly costed all right

well look for that mr. Trudeau thank you

so much

always a pleasure thank you
