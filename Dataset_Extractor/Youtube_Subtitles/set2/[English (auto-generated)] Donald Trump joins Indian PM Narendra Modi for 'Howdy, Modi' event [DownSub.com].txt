to celebrate the growing partnership

between India and America two

democracies committed to the same vision

of the future that vision as all of us

know is based on the common hopes and

the shared dreams of our people both

nations shaped by the legacy of British

colonialism both nations deeply

cognizant of the price of freedom we

hold the same truths to be self-evident

that all are created equal endowed by

their creator with the same right to

strive for a better life a vision yet to

be realized in either of our two great

nations completely our constitutions

begin with the same three words We the

People

the father of Indian independence

Mahatma Gandhi who's one hundred and

fiftieth birthday we mark on October 2nd

once defined democracy as and I quote

Mahatma Gandhi something that gives the

week the same chance as the strong

that my friends at its heart is what the

ideal of American democracy and Indian

democracy are all about unequal

opportunities to dream and work hard to

make that dream come true I'm proud as

all of you are that the us-india

relationship has remained bipartisan

with both Democrats and Republicans

working to bring the two nations closer

in pursuit of that goal and our common

principles in recent decades President

Clinton had the vision to forge a new

path for us Indian relations President

Bush

where was he from President Bush

strengthen the ties between our two

nations and President Obama Obama

solidified them and President Trump

continues that effort today

[Applause]

25 years since the founding of the

Congressional Caucus on India and Indian

Americans the United States and India

cooperate in every way imaginable from

counterterrorism and clean energy to

defense and space exploration we are now

working together in ways no one could

have envisioned a decade ago in 2008

Congress passed the civil nuclear

agreement and in 2016 established India

as a major defense partner ladies and

gentlemen I am proud of Congress's role

in forging these closer ties as I am to

serve aside wonderful Indian American

congressional representatives you've

seen some of them introduced like Raja

push to Moorthy from Miller giant Paul

ami bera and ro Cana and I'm proud to

serve along the other members of

Congress who were introduced here the

heart the heart of our relationship

remains the people-to-people ties that

bring us even closer the Indian

Americans who are making such an

extraordinary such an extraordinary

contribution to America thank you

you and millions of other Indian

Americans are the reason why the

us-india relationship continues to

strengthen and remains bipartisan you

are the reasons why so many Americans

now look to India and see not only a

partner but also a trusted friend

[Applause]

throughout this country Indian Americans

have built strong diaspora communities

that have opened their arms to their

neighbors

they've given back through services

doctors teachers artists researchers

entrepreneurs lawyers engineer and in

every sector of our economy and American

Life

mr. Prime Minister they are making a

difference in America

and of course they serve in our military

and in our government in every field in

the brought in sight intellect

innovation and yes inspiration most

importantly they have worked to broaden

their fellow Americans understanding of

India its history its traditions and the

vibrancy of its democracy ladies and

gentlemen I've experienced this

firsthand in my County that we call

Saint Mary's County that County has been

enriched by a growing Indian American

community my next-door neighbor dr.

Bernard Shaw

and dr. Ella Shaw who are here today

with me and with the prime minister have

become dear and trusted friends they are

extraordinarily respected and beloved

members of our community I am part of

their family and they are part of my

I have traveled to India with my friend

Vinnie Shah what an extraordinary

country what an extraordinary people and

is through them that I've met so many

other Indian Americans and learned about

Gujarat and India

it's people its history and about the

challenges and successes of Indian

American community here in the United

States on behalf of all of us I want to

thank the thousands of Indian Americans

who have made a difference in America

what you have done to build closer

relationships between two great

countries two great democracies and for

all you do to make America a better and

stronger nation ladies and gentlemen as

we welcome Prime Minister Modi to Texas

we are inspired by the modern India he

leads while mindful of the challenges it

faces undeterred as it reaches into the

new frontier of space and equally

determined to lift millions out of

poverty

back on earth making strides and access

to education clean water healthcare and

while helping to lead in developing

advanced energy technologies for a

greener and healthy India and like

America

proud of its ancient traditions to

secure a future according to Gandhi's

teaching and neighbors vision of India

as a secular democracy were respect for

pluralism and human rights safeguard

every individual America and Indian must

strive to make our promises and

aspirations a reality for all our

citizens on the eve of Independence

Nehru praised Gandhi's mission too and I

quote a quote that all of you surely

know wipe every tear from their eye and

they made a pledge for India's future

that so long as there are tears and

suffering so long our work will not be

over and in that sense the work of our

countries is not over as he took his

oath for office for the final time

Abraham Lincoln called for malice

towards none and charity for all he

asked his fellow Americans and I quote

to do all which may achieve and cherish

a just and lasting peace among ourselves

and with all nations together together

we the people of India and of America

must and will continue to motivate one

another and the world to pursue the

vision of peace justice charity for all

to strive malice towards none and to

wipe every tear from every eye for those

of us

[Applause]

for those of us born in America or India

or the sons and daughters of those who

were that must be our commitment and our

mission with malice towards none to wipe

every tear from every eye it is then

that we will we will be both great and

just and good

it is this unfulfilled mission that

brings us to Texas today it is the

shared hope that binds us in common

personal purpose two democracies two

histories one partnership one dream for

a better tomorrow welcome Prime Minister

thank you very much thank you all

ladies and gentlemen please give a round

of applause to Prime Minister Modi and

majority leader Hoyer we look forward to

welcoming the Prime Minister back to the

stage shortly in the meantime in honor

of Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth

anniversary and the impact of his

message of non-violence on America's

civil rights movement led by dr. Martin

Luther King jr. we present a fusion

gospel singers

Donald Trump that I can tell you the

I'm happy to report that the

relationship between the United States

and India is stronger than ever before

the ties between our two nations are

grounded in our common values and our

shared commitment to democracy we are

free nations with great faith and a

fierce devotion to our national

independence we are governed by the rule

of law

guided by commitment to justice and

strengthened by our love of Liberty our

two national constitutions both begin

with the same three beautiful words We

the People

that means that in America and India

like we honor respect trust and power

and fight for the citizens we proudly

serve under Prime Minister Modi's

leadership the world is witnessing a

strong sovereign and thriving Republic

of India in a single decade with the

help of Prime Minister Modi's pro-growth

reforms India has lifted nearly 300

million people out of poverty and that

is an incredible number credible that's

incredible

in the next decade 140 million Indian

households will rise to the middle class

in both India and the United States

we're seeing something really remarkable

our people are prospering like never

before because we are slashing

bureaucracy and cutting job-killing red

tape in the United States thanks to our

massive tax cuts and all of our great

senators and congressmen and women that

are here today and pro-worker policies

our economy is breaking one record after

another since my election we have

created over six million new jobs we

have created over 750,000 jobs right

here in Texas

and very importantly that includes

70,000 new Texas manufacturing jobs they

said that couldn't be done

unemployment think of this unemployment

in Texas is currently at the lowest rate

ever recorded in the history of our

country and unemployment in the United

States has just reached the lowest level

in over 51 years and very soon we think

that will be broken to be a historic

number unemployment among

african-americans asian-americans and

Hispanic Americans have all reached

their lowest levels in the history of

our country over the last two years the

unemployment rate among Indian Americans

dropped by nearly 33 and 1/3 percent

wages are rising incomes are soaring and

inequality is falling at the fastest

rate in many many years in the past 12

months alone the average worker has

taken home $1,000 extra in rising wages

and over $3,000 with tax cuts and all of

the other things that we've done and for

the first time in history most new hires

of prime working age our minorities and

women first time that's ever happened

through our pledge to America's workers

we have secured commitments for nearly

14 million employment and training

opportunities for American workers done

through our great American companies we

passed the biggest tax cuts and the

biggest tax reforms in the history of

our country we slashed a record number

of job-killing regulations giving the

average American households more than

three thousand dollars every year and

never in the history of our country no

matter how long the presidency have

regulations been cut to this extent

every day the Indian American community

is helping to strengthen our country and

build our future Indian Americans are

pioneering groundbreaking medicines to

save countless lives they're developing

revolutionary technology that is

changing the world and they're founding

new businesses that provide jobs to

thousands of our fellow citizens

Prime Minister Modi I look forward to

working with you to make our nation's

even more prosperous than ever before

and that's what's happening the economic

miracles taking place today are just

beginning here in the United States

there has never been a better time to

hire invest grow and pursue your dreams

Indian companies employ tens of

thousands of Americans across a range of

industries including American steel in

2018

India's jsw steel announced that it

would invest up to five hundred million

dollars to revitalize a shuttered steel

plant in the great state of Ohio and we

welcome India's growing investments

right here in the Lone Star State

nations around the world are investing

in the United States because they know

we have the best economy and the best

workers in the world

they have never invested in our country

like they are today and we want to thank

everybody and India has never invested

in the United States like it is doing

today and I want to say it's reciprocal

because we're doing the same thing in

India

on Tuesday two Japanese companies Toyota

and ASA announced a combined investment

of almost eight hundred million dollars

which will create over 900 new jobs

right here in Texas at the same time we

are working to expand American exports

to India one of the world's

fastest-growing markets we are committed

to ensuring the Indian people have

access to the finest goods in the world

products stamped with the beautiful

phrase made in the USA and very soon

India will have access to another

world-class American product NBA

basketball Wow sounds good that sounds

good

next week thousands of people will

gather in Mumbai to watch the first-ever

NBA basketball game in India

am I invited mr. Prime Minister I may

come be careful I make up when it comes

to expanding our commercial relationship

no issue is more important than energy

security for the first time ever the

United States is the number-one producer

of both oil and natural gas on planet

earth and number one by far with much of

it coming right here from the great

state of Texas that means more jobs

higher wages and lower prices at the

pump yesterday we were thrilled to hear

about the Indian company petrol in its

pledge to purchase up to five million

tons of LNG per year from the United

States which could lead to billions of

dollars of LNG exports to India in the

coming years and we have plenty of it

over the last year crude exports to

India have grown by 400% and liquefied

natural gas exports continue to soar at

record numbers thank you these

tremendous exports not only expand

employment in America but they increase

freedom and security for India to keep

our nation safe the United States and

India are forging an even stronger

security partnership US defense sales to

India have also reached 18 billion

dollars over the past decade we make the

greatest defense mechanisms and

equipment anywhere in the world

and India knows that well we're looking

forward to concluding several new

defense deals very soon there are a lot

of them in the works here in America

we're creating the United States space

force and we're working closely with

India to enhance space cooperation in

November the United States and India

will demonstrate a dramatic progress of

our defense relationship holding the

first-ever tri-service military exercise

between our nation's

it's called Tiger triumphs good name a

good name very good name today we honor

all of the brave American and Indian

military service members who work

together to safeguard our freedom we

stand proudly in defense of Liberty and

we are committed to protecting innocent

civilians from the threat of radical

Islamic terrorism

thank you both India the United States

also understand that to keep our

community safe we must protect our

borders

since taking office my administration

has launched a far-reaching effort to

improve screening and vetting of

applications for entry we are working

hard to ensure that those who would

threaten our security are denied

admission into our country and we are

enhancing our vetting efforts like never

before

not even close we're doing it on a daily

basis and will soon be setting records

in every one of the aspects of border

security border security is vital to the

United States border security is vital

to India we understand that and we are

further taking unprecedented action to

finally secure our southern border and

stop illegal immigration and I want to

thank the President of Mexico who right

now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern

border

it's been incredible what's taken place

in a short period of time illegal

immigration is deeply unfair to millions

of wonderful legal immigrants who work

hard pay their taxes follow our rules

and obey our laws yet there are those in

Washington who would raid your health

care to front free benefits they want to

fund free benefits to those who enter

our country illegally we don't want to

do that we don't want to

because if we don't do it they won't

come I will never allow politicians to

take away your healthcare or give it to

illegal immigrants my administration

believes our first duty is to the

highest loyalty of all we must always be

for the American people whether it's

african-american Hispanic American

Indian American we are going to take

care of our citizens first we are going

to take care of our Indian American

citizens before we take care of illegal

immigrants that want to pour into our

country

we want to build a nation where every

family immigrant and us born can live in

a safe community with access to great

school work at a job you love and have

the best chance to reach the American

Dream we love the American Dream and

just in concluding I want to say that

America has always been a nation of

pioneers and patriots risk takers and

free thinkers and dedicated workers who

have honed a trade mastered their field

and teach their children to always give

their very very best every day Indian

Americans helped write this story of

American greatness and everyone here

today has a crucial part to play in

building an even grander and greater

American and Indian future

to help achieve that exciting vision we

are strengthening our cherished bonds

with the nation of India and we are

proving the awesome power of democracy

and unlimited potential of free people

together we will continue to deepen the

ties between our nation's

we will honor the faith of dignity of

our citizens and we will achieve

incredible advancements for our people

for our children and for the world we

will discover new cures and save

millions of lives we will advance

cutting-edge technologies and lift

millions and millions of people out of

poverty we will pioneer new frontiers in

space working together raising the

sights of humanity we will uphold our

values defend our Liberty and control

our destiny the United States and India

will make our nation stronger our people

wealthier are dreamers bigger and our

future brighter than ever before and it

won't even be close I want to thank
