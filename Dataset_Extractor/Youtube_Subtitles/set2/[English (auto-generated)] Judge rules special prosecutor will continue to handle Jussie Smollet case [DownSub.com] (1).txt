well I notified the judge because when

mrs. Fox's attorney no.2 notified me

about it I had not remembered at all

making his contribution judge Tooman is

the one who appointed me and so I

immediately notified judge Tooman

because I wanted him to consider whether

there was anything about it that could

in any way interfere with my ability to

be special prosecutor as a result today

I'm very very very pleased with the

order that Judge Tumen is entered

judge Tumen has considered all of the

facts he's considered the law in

Illinois and he has concluded that I

have absolutely no conflict of interest

there's no appearance of impropriety and

based on these facts that I should

continue a special prosecutor I'm very

grateful for his ruling and I intend to

continue a special prosecutor

I do not know kim Fox I have never met

Kim Fox I have no never even so much as

talked to her so I have no biases in

favor of or against her and there's no

reason whatsoever why I would have any

reason not to continue a special

prosecutor but Judge Tooman is the

person I wanted to make that decision

because he's the one that appointed me

and so today when he made his ruling

that based on the facts and the law

there just was absolutely no conflict of

interest or appearance of impropriety I

was very pleased with that ruling he's a

great lawyer and he's a very good

litigator and he's supporting candidates

and that's important to support

candidates so somebody brought this up

and he did the right thing and he

brought it in front of the judge and we

all talked about it and the court ruled
