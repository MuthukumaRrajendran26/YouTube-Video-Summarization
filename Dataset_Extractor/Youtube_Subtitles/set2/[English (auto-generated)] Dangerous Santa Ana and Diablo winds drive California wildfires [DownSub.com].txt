if fire is the bomb wind is the cannon

in California the wind is a marauding

delivery system whipping small fires

into a massive destructive force this

fire is rapidly spreading right now it

is the nature of California's geography

and weather that winds blow this time of

year but now they're blowing faster and

hotter because of the high winds we do

have a number of branches down wind can

start the cycle blowing down branches

onto power lines into brush setting off

fires then complete the cycle picking up

the fire and fanning out 43 counties in

the state of California we're

experiencing red flag warnings we're

experiencing at or near historic wind

events California winds this time of

year start around high pressure in the

deserts of Nevada and the states nearby

the Diablos in Northern California and

the Santa Anas in the South fanned the

flames so there are now vast areas under

so-called red flag warnings as winds

blow over the Sierra Nevada mountains

and are forced through canyons they pick

up more speed trees provide fuel and so

does the sprawl of homes and buildings

with more people to cause fires and more

in danger from them this can all happen

without climate change but with it the

conditions are more extreme droughts

that are longer temperatures higher the

air and ground drier ideal conditions

for fire to ignite and spread with the

wind before 2003 California really

didn't have a wildfire problem and now

it's got a huge one there has been a

noticeable trend for these winds that

get much more powerful as the climate

continues to heat up this is a

record-setting event certainly for this

Santa Ana season wind not only spreads

fire it can curb efforts to knock it

down if it is extremely windy ultimately

we may have to ground our helicopters

it's being called California's new

normal but is it

that's not normal because I think we're

going to see these fires burning bigger

hotter and more unpredictable ways down

the road every year there's always fires

here brush fires but because of the wind

you know it's different for Californians

a sense of foreboding we

adds exponentially to a danger that is

already getting worse by the year Eric
