what's really sad about it is I prayed

for the president all the time and I

tell him that I pray for his safety and

about his family I think now we have to

pray for his health but as this was a

very serious meltdown on the part of the

president I was expressing my

appreciation for where our troops have

done in Syria and by all accounts from

the generals they have just really done

the job very well that he's now pulling

out the explanation for that is what we

asked for all members of the House to

hear and that was supposed to be

tomorrow but now then they somehow comes

boned it today my concern that I

expressed to the president is that

Russia has for a long time always wanted

to have a foothold in the Middle East

and now he has enabled that to happen

and I have concerns about all roads

leading whether it's a foothold in the

Middle East whether it's placing and

doubt and a military assistance to

Ukraine which is to the benefit of Putin

whether is placing in doubt our

commitment to NATO article 5 which again

our own roads lead to Putin the list

goes on and on
