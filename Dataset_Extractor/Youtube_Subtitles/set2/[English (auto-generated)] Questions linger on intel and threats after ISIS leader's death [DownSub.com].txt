this is where the world's most wanted

terrorists met his end after an

operation by US Special Forces film

edited I mocked that during the raid Abu

Bakr al-baghdadi was cornered before he

detonated an explosive vest ending his

reign as the leader of the so-called

Islamic state he was a sick and depraved

man and now he's dead he's dead he's

dead as a doornail as the American

President took a victory lap the

Pentagon provided more details about the

operation inside Syria which came after

the u.s. received specific intelligence

about Baghdadi's location Baghdadi's

death will not read the world of

terrorism or end the ongoing conflict in

Syria but it will certainly send a

message to those who'd question

America's resolve Isis has lost its

physical territory and now its leader

but its reach is driven largely by

ideology sympathizers around the world

have carried out brutal attacks all on

their own with the u.s. pulling back its

forces in northern Syria experts warn it

will be nearly impossible to keep up the

pressure on the terrorists former home

base the follow up from this operation I

think will be extremely difficult which

is unfortunate there's already a risk

that thousands of Isis fighters could

return to battle they're currently held

in prisons in northern Syria that had

been under Kurdish control until the

Kurds were forced to flee to make way

for a Turkish invasion then there's the

matter of Syria's oil fields which the

US says it will guard we are still

committed to the contra Isis campaign

and we don't want them to research they

get a lot of their revenues from that

ironically the Kurds recently abandoned

by the Americans provided the key

intelligence needed for this raid that

included a stolen pair of Baghdadi's

underwear which was used for DNA

verification as well as access to

someone in Baghdadi's inner circle

someone who could give them a

room-by-room layout of a compound where

the terrorist leader was hiding Donna
