regi what's the latest on the second

whistleblower and what this person's

going to say well Robin we don't know

exactly what was said when this

intelligence officials spoke with the

inspector general but their legal team

which represents the first whistleblower

as well says they made a protected

disclosure under the law and cannot be

retaliated against this whistleblower

has first-hand knowledge the original

whistleblower said he had spoken with

numerous government officials that had

concerns the president was soliciting

interference from foreign nations and

this person could help corroborate that

this new whistleblower could also dispel

Trump's claims that the first complaint

was hearsay and fiction critics have

long accused Donald Trump of subverting

his own political interests over

national political interests and if

Congress gains access to this

information it could help Democrats that

are looking at Trump's requests for

investigations into political opponents

and what value he might gain from them

it's perfect the call was perfect what

the president sees is a perfect phone

call with the president of Ukraine is

being dissected word by word across

America this is obviously a very

complicated legal issue president

Trump's alleged request for Ukraine to

open an investigation into the Biden's

and a similar public request to China

China could be considered a federal

violation of US campaign finance law

soliciting a thing of value from a

foreign nation is strictly off-limits

American election should not be

influenced by foreign actors who

necessarily don't have the United States

best interests at heart

the term thing of value however is vague

leaving it open to interpretation and

debate I think that it is relatively

clear that if you receive something that

is of value to you and that does not

have to necessarily be cash it can be an

in-kind contribution for Institue a

campaign there are rules and laws

surrounding what a campaign can and

cannot do when it comes to benefiting

from a foreigner and someone domestic

during the 2016 campaign to women

alleged to have had affairs with Donald

Trump were paid to stay quiet those

payments were seen as a way to influence

a campaign and landed Trump's personal

attorney Michael Cohen in jail if

Democrats draft articles of impeachment

they may look at Trump's requests for

investigations as political game it is

clear from our precedents that

information can be a thing of value

opposition research polling data mailing

lists other kinds of things can be

difficult to value it can be hard to

ascertain but that doesn't mean that it

doesn't have value because the thing

that people hold to be the most valuable

is democracy
