well good afternoon everyone

as President Trump announced yesterday

United States and joint special

operations forces conducted a successful

raid on Saturday night resulting in the

death of Abu Bakr al Baghdadi the

founder and leader of Isis this

operation was the culmination of a

multi-year interagency effort to find

him and then capture or kill him Baghdad

II and the thugs who follow him were

responsible for some of the most brutal

atrocities of our time his death marks a

devastating blow for the remnants of

Isis who are now deprived of their

inspirational leader following the

destruction of their physical Caliphate

earlier this year I want to thank our

brave service members who took part in

this daring raid along with our

interagency partners who supported the

mission there is no guarantee of success

in an operation with this level of

difficulty and president Trump knew this

when he made the bold decision to order

the raid confident in the expertise of

our forces our servicemembers conducted

themselves with incredible skill and

professionalism and they executed the

raid in all of its facets brilliantly

not a single United States service

member was killed in this high-risk

operation despite Baghdadi's death the

security situation in Syria remains

complex multiple state and non-state

actors continue to vie for control of

territory and resources within the

country as we have learned from our

recent history in the Middle East it is

very easy to get drawn and to continue

conflict if our objectives are not clear

acting as a police force out to solve

every dispute is not our mission our

mission in Syria today remains the same

as it was when we first began operations

in 2014 to enable the enduring defeat of

Isis

a recent repositioning of forces within

the country is intended to posture us to

continue this mission and give the

president options while returning the

balance back home to the United States

those who remain will continue to

execute at arute

terrorism operations while staying in

close contact with the Syrian democratic

forces who have fought alongside us

additionally the United States will

retain control of oil fields in

Northeast Syria at the height of

Baghdadi's reign these oil fields

provided Isis with the bulk of financial

resources used to fund its terror US

troops will remain positioned in this

strategic area to deny Isis access those

vital to those vital resources and will

respond with overwhelming military force

against any group that threatens the

safety of our forces there these oil

fields also provide a critical source of

funding to the SDF which enables their

ability to secure Isis prison camps and

conduct operations against Isis among

other things last week I was in Brussels

for the NATO defence ministerial and I

spoke with our allies about the

situation in Syria I reiterated our

commitment to the defeat of Isis and

called on other nations who have much at

stake to offer their support to help

mitigate the ongoing security crisis

turkey continues to bear responsibility

for the consequences of their

unwarranted incursion which has brought

further instability to the region a

number of allies have expressed their

desire to help with the implementation

of a safe zone along the syria-turkey

border the United States remain focused

on our core mission and continue to work

closely with the defeat Isis coalition

as we implement the next phase of the

campaign Baghdadi's death will not rid

the world of terrorism or end the

ongoing conflict in Syria but it will

certainly send a message those who'd

question America's resolve and provide a

warning to terrorists who think they can

hide the United States more than any

other nation in the world possesses the

power and the will to hunt to the ends

of the earth those who wish to bring

harm upon the American people Saturday's

operation is just one example of the

incredible determination and great skill

of the United States military I'll now

ask general Milley to bride G with some

additional details on the operation

thank you

sir good afternoon everyone as a

secretary yes--for stated United States

special operations forces under the

and control of the United States Central

Command general Frank McKenzie conducted

a counterterrorism operation was

resulted in the death of the founder and

the leader of Isis Abu Bakr Baghdady

intelligence from numerous organizations

throughout the Department of Defense and

across the entire interagency identified

the target location approximately four

miles from the Turkish border in Italy

province of Syria in order to reduce the

risk to US forces and prevent

miscalculation and escalation an action

consistent with operations in the past

we coordinated with appropriate

militaries and other organizations in

the region through established

deconfliction mechanisms during the

mission US forces were infiltrated by

helicopter and once on the objective

secured the target compound the assault

force was engaged with small arms fire

and the threats were quickly eliminated

our forces are isolated the compound and

protected all the non-combatants while

clearing the objective US forces

discovered al-baghdadi hiding in a

tunnel the assault force closed in on

Baghdad e and ended when he detonated a

suicide vest Baghdadi's remains were

then transported to a secure facility to

confirm his identity with forensic DNA

testing and the disposal of his remains

has been done and is complete and was

handled appropriately the success of

this complex operation is an incredible

testament to the professionalism of the

men and women of the joint force and our

interagency partners in the courage and

the bravery they put themselves in

harm's way time and time again to

protect our great country the secretary

and I will now take your questions thank

you you mentioned the the oil fields in

securing the oil fields in the east of

Syria has the deployment of

reinforcements that you announced last

week had begun and could you describe

more fully what that what you intend to

do that we have begun deploying

repositioning additional assets into the

vicinity of dars Arwa as I said the

other day includes mechanized forces and

other types of forces that will continue

until we believe we have sufficient

capability to ensure Isis and other

destabilizing actors are denied access

to that oil facility

follow up but have you had any

indications of any challenges to your

presence there or not at this time sir

do you have video of Baghdadi's final

moments and also are you partnering with

the Kurds again on the ground can you

explain how difficult this operation

would have been if you didn't have

troops or bases on the ground in Syria

and in Iraq oh we do have video photos

we're not prepared at this time to

release those they're going through a

declassification process I think what

you'll see here in the coming days will

set up some operational tactical level

briefings by Central Command and you'll

be provided some video and photos etc of

that we to carry out this operation if

you didn't have troops on the ground

from an operational standpoint the

United States military can strike any

target anywhere any time yeah I was

gonna say the same thing we have

incredible reach we can strike anybody

anytime anywhere the terrorists should

be aware of that they should have seen

that now after us doing this multiple

times and with regard to your question

regarding the SDF we stay in continuous

contact with them what would you destroy

the compound what kind of ordnance is

used to destroy the compound also you

mentioned that you had video do you have

video from inside the tunnel itself and

if so were you able to get that because

that k9 was wearing video or did you

have something else okay how about one

and a half the name of the canine please

and that was

so ordnance uses multiple types of

ordnance used to include the chasms the

GPUs Hellfires

as well as many guns small arms fire etc

so we use a variety of munitions and

those the bombs were used at the tail

end in order to destroy the compound

which you saw on on various videos etc

your second question about the video I'm

not gonna classify the video what we do

have and don't have at this time I've

seen a lot and I'll wait until

everything's appropriately Declassified

here in the coming days and we'll make

sure that you're provided that we're not

releasing the name of the dog right now

the dog is still in theater the dog the

canine the military working dog

performed a tremendous service as they

all do in a variety of situations

slightly wounded and fully recovering

but the dog is still in theater returned

to duty with its handler so we're not

going to release just yet photos or

names of dogs or anything else for

testing like unity protecting the dog's

identity that's four questions now daddy

was just his remains were disposed of

appropriately in accordance with our

SOPs in accordance with the law of armed

conflict Baghdadi's headquarters his

compound or was he just passing through

and if it was his headquarters how much

material did you take away there was

material taken away I don't want to

characterize exactly what or how much

yet until it gets exploited properly but

as a matter of course we always do

sensitive site exploitation on any

objective anywhere to do that as to

whether it's his headquarters it was an

area in which he was staying on a

consistent basis prisoners he took some

how many and whose custody or the

now they're in our custody and they're

at a secure facility can you tell us how

many there were two adult males taken

off the objective alive and they're in

our custody thank you for your time

today I wanted to look at what's next

aspect the president alluded to

materials being collected from from the

site itself can you in any way elaborate

on what's been collected what's being

looked through now what do I mean we

must not do for operational reasons

because that information it needs to be

exploited properly for any follow-on

missions that we may choose to do and I

think they've what next is it we will

continue the mission and the mission is

to ensure the enduring defeat of Isis in

the region and that's our mission we've

seen reporting that this raid was

launched from al Assad from Erbil can

you clarify and where it came from

operationally we're not going to discuss

the location from which the raid took

place

it took place obviously in somewhere in

the region can I take you back to the

question on the oil fields and the

military role in the oil field mission

if I may so you're gonna protect them

again and keep control against Isis and

other potential potential of a series do

you does it include the possibility in

your view that US troops are prepared to

deny access to the oil fields to either

Russian and/or Syrian forces is that in

fact part of your mission to

specifically deny them access and my

follow up on to that is how do you know

when you what do you need to see to know

you're done with the oil fields mission

presumably you're not keeping troops

that are absolutely forever how do you

know when you're done what do you need

to see but Russia and Syria please yeah

so the question you're asking Barbara is

about purpose and end State on and then

the waste would be the military

questions so I'm gonna punt over to the

secretary specifically for that but your

millet the military tasks that we

been given is to secure continue to

secure tamp which is down along the you

know that is down along the tri border

area will continue to do that and to

secure the Conoco oil fields in and

around da Rozier that is in the vicinity

of the middle Euphrates River Valley

that you're familiar with and the

fundamental purpose of securing those

oil fields is to deny those oil fields

access to Isis in order to prevent Isis

from resurgence because we are still

committed to the cutter Isis campaign

and we don't want them to research they

get a lot of their revenues from that

but I'll let the secretary talked about

in States what you want to do in the oil

fields does that include

Denine access preventing Russian or

Syrian forces which now changed the

battle space so the short answer is yes

it presently does because in that case

we want to make sure that SDF does have

access to the resources in order to

guard the prisons in order to arm their

own troops in order to assist us with

with the defeat Isis mission so that's

our mission is to secure the oil fields

general Milley president Trump described

yesterday Baghdady whimpering and crying

before he died can you elaborate or

confirm those details I said I was that

same question yesterday I know the

president had planned to talk down to

unit and unit members but I don't know

what the source of that was there but I

assume it was talking directly to unit I

have not talked to unit members no

that's correct

I've talked to the commander of CENTCOM

and others but not down to the unit

members down at that level of disability

thank you for doing this so the SDF

communi has said that there was an SDF

member that was part of this raid he's

talked about the intelligence that the

SDF provided putting a person inside

with Isis can you confirm all of those

details on your end and then also on the

oil fields can you just talk about the

overall picture in Syria now after these

last couple of weeks putting more people

in to protect these oil fields are there

gonna be more troops now in Syria than

there were before I'll take the second

question first and I'll let the Chairman

ask answer the first one look we're as I

said we're reinforcing our position in

at Dara's our that area we also were

given the earlier directive to retain

forces at the an 10th garrison at the

end of the day we will be sending troops

home that's the president made a

commitment to do that but in the

meantime we're going to reinforce and

make some other moves to ensure that we

can accomplish that mission of securing

the oil fields in order to deny him

access to Isis we're going in then don't

want coming out I don't know at the end

of the day my expectation is that it'll

be fewer than what we had before and

they will be going home it helped me I

remind me the first question this was a

u.s. only operation for personnel that

were on the objective I know you're

referring to there was a comment

somewhere reported in the media that the

SDF had soldiers or troops or one person

or something on the objective with our

forces I'm not going to comment on what

may or may not have happened with the

SDF on the objective the actions on the

objective the the aircraft coming in the

aircraft overhead and the soldiers

conducting assault was a US only

operation
