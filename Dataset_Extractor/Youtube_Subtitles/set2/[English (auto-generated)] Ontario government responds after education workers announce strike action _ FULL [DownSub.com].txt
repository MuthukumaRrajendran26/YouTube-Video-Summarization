good to be with you all just to provide

a bit of an update last weekend when QP

walked away from the bargaining table I

told my negotiating team through the

mediator to be available to meet at any

time to get a deal and that offer still

stands today we were close and I believe

we can get this deal done soon for the

best outcome for our students I call and

QP today to accept the dates to lock it

in and let's move forward and get back

to the table this week to resolve this

regrettable situation in unnecessary

disruption for our students the deadline

Bergling or deadline bargaining is part

of the process this is not unique

creating a pressurized environment is

not unique now not withstanding I remain

determined to reach a deal and I remain

mission focused on keeping kids in the

classroom of this province

I appreciate concerns parents are

concerned with keeping ounces a flood

strike action only 48 hours 48 hours

after commencing the partial withdraw of

service and we know these types of

actions ultimately only hurt our kids

now I can't speak to why they're ramping

up only days in to this job action but I

do sincerely hope that QP agrees to meet

with my team as soon as humanly possible

because we send ready today to land a

deal and to negotiate in the interest of

our kids I continue to stand with

parents as we work to protect our

students futures continue to invest in

their potential and keep them in the

classroom of this province our students

deserve no less I'll take a few

questions yeah they're the only group

right now with the calendar that is able

to be in a straight position EPOS not

what's SPF is not there's a federal

election on the 21st how much of this do

you think is political leverage you know

III I'm not gonna opine fundamentally on

what is driving them I mean 48 hours

they initiate a labor action

now at this stage you know they're

taking action a potential strike on the

day of the first debate I mean I can't

opine on what is their calculus what I

can tell them fundamentally what I could

tell you is that the focus we're

expanding so much energies in the days

leading up to Monday we should really

expend those energies at the table to

get a deal I mean at the end of the day

for every party that is interested in

the in our kids and keeping them in a

safe learning environment I think we

should focus more on our children and

less than the politics I mean just

yesterday you know the prime minister

made comments on this issue I think we

need to deep politicize the process I

think less politicians in the process

less politics is really in the interest

of our kids I think we need people to

put the interests of our children ahead

of their own political self-interest

which was my message to the prime

minister so my message to anyone who

seems to one inject and infuse a

needless partisanship at a time when

parents want it to be a focused

resolution oriented table that gets

deals that ultimately keeps their kids

in class yeah I mean look my my mission

for the coming period because as I noted

in my remarks this is not unique jobs I

mean to be quite frank historically a

lot of these circumstances have played

out to create that pressurized

environment and I understand that

I mean deadlines bargaining as I

mentioned is not a unique form of

negotiating you know I think the

priority for me in the context of the

toolbox is to is to really exhaust every

single option available to get a deal

through negotiated settlement I mean the

best option I would submit for the crown

for the government for the union members

themselves for the trustees is a

voluntary negotiated settlement

historically that is the best way to get

a deal so you know I don't really want

to talk too much about those

hypotheticals I just don't think we have

we collectively have done all of our due

diligence to get a deal through that

through that table the follow up it's

not off the table though completely what

is on the table for me today is getting

a deal

to get a deal what issues are you

willing to move on sure well I mean

first off on Sunday when keepy announced

chris that they're gonna be walking away

not was saying that we were quite close

by the admission I think of most parties

we extended I extended on my direction

to our mediator to the mediator rather

mr. Kaplan

we offered additional dates for the

government to meet and those dates are

before I think the other parties as I

understand I've heard anecdotally that

that the kewpie said broadly that they

would accept more dates to meet should

there be a meaningful discussion I hope

they lock them in and we officialize

them and get them in place that we can

meet in the coming days I mean I stand

ready to meet today and I think the

first step is to expend these energies

at the table to get a deal that is

really the only solution oriented forum

where deals can be made historically

there is no alternative at least when it

comes to a voluntary agreement by all

parties I think when it comes to the

details

I think we've noted broadly on job

security and on a few other issues we've

provided additional latitude to get

there which is why that issue isn't the

the fundamental sticking point here

you know we've I think demonstrated a

reasonableness at the table which was

necessary because I was mission oriented

in getting a deal what has been the

sticking point and as communicated by

others as well is the issue related to

sick days leave extended leave and as

you know I mean this principally for me

the concern is creating a system where

we have effectively a revolving door of

staff and no permanency no stability no

predictability for a child to have

access to the same you know worker in

the education sector in their classroom

and we think that ultimately undermines

their learning I mean there's a fiscal

consideration although I would have

submit it's actually not the primary

motive of my concern I mean when we're

spending thirty five million dollars a

day on sick leave

instead of reinvesting those dollars in

our kids and better textbooks and

improved technology in the classroom etc

I think that race is concerned but it

actually to be honest with you is not

the principal issue it is the fact that

we have in this province

rather high-level sick days on average

more than 15 per year and I think that's

a concern for a lot of people in the

system the trustees have noted this you

know rather vigorously their concerns on

both sides both fiscal and from the

students perspective I'm really talking

about the kids perspective because I

think having more permanency and finding

a way to bring those numbers down is

best now I don't want to get you know

respectfully you know I've I think

expended I've communicated rather

liberally I think I need to appreciate

that the end the deal I knew I want to

deal at the end of the day I want to

deal and the best practice is to allow

that discretion of the table but that is

the issue that's in the public that is

the sort of the core issue and I think

for you know know there as you know you

know roughly 130 days of sick leave

about 120 of which are paid in 90

percent 11 at a hundred percent I just

think that there's a need to have a

somber discussion at the table in

confidence away from the spotlight allow

for us to in good faith really talk

about these things and find a way

forward that it's constructive but

ultimately allows their children to be

in classrooms in Ontario I've been very

clear that my hope and my expectation is

that we would never compromise the

safety of kids I think as a broader

principle one of the things I commented

on some days ago was when keepy provided

that directive that list of issues a

list of services that they will not be

or they're discouraging or directing

their staff not to do the six item on

that list was the administration of

medicine to a child who's ill now I

think as I've said and I do believe this

I know quite a few key members and I

think in the heart of hearts they're

gonna do the right thing I'm a bit

trouble that that was even on the list

to begin with but you know look I think

the system overall the ecosystem around

our kids from administration to the

student to the Boards of Education to

the Ministry of

to the to the workers the EAS as well as

of course the teachers I think we're all

going to have to put the kids first and

so you know I think QP will have to

answer the consequence of that decision

I think for me my hope is a no child has

service disruption that they're in a

safe environment and they're able to go

to school on Monday that's the that's

the goal for this week and it's the goal

for the coming days and I really hope

and I hope that my parents hear this

that we want to get a deal that keeps

their kids in the classroom to this

province parents in cottage country with

a Trillium Lakeland District School

Board received a letter which in part

reads one of the directives to keep

these staff is that they are not to

operate school security door buzzer

systems it goes on to say that they do

not have available administration staff

to monitor those buzzer systems so the

doors will be left unlocked if someone's

to walk into a school in our office and

harm injure or even worse just students

here in this province who's at fault

well my expectation is the safety of

every child is not compromised

full-stop I appreciate that and my

response to hearing that is that a no

child and the problem should have their

safety compromised there should be

protocols in place to ensure every

single child is in a safe learning

environment in the province of Ontario

and my mission now was saying the

decision by qp2 today ramp this up after

effectively 48 hours of partial withdraw

of service is that we can remediate that

problem by getting a deal before any

child's could be in a place where

they're unsafe you know I think we've

demonstrated a reasonable flexibility

that I think is necessary but I think

that that spirit needs to be matched on

all sides I think you know we've been

fairly clear that on you know at the end

of the day we're prepared to be

reasonable and flexible to get a deal

and I think that nimbleness is required

by everyone you know

I think we've also demonstrated on a

variety of subject matter including job

security that we've had we've

demonstrated a reasonableness where

we've moved a bit on that I think with

respect to you know issues were

ill-prepared to move on I think we've

really in word indeed been fairly

reasonable through this process to be

quite frank but an issue we have cited

an issue that trustees and boards have

cited that I think requires discussion

at the table is focused on is focused on

leave where you are we have scenarios

where where education workers are

literally a revolving door of staff

coming through schools no permanency no

predictability that's a problem you know

we talked about EAS and talked about

kids I mean talk about kids with

disability particularly intellectual or

developmental disability many of these

parents one of whom I spoke today this

morning will tell you that having the

same worker in place is critical to the

success of their child so we so we so we

seek so so we seek so we seek to ensure

to mitigate a scenario where they're

present and we try to create a situation

or an environment where they are more

present by fixing that issue but I

actually don't think on our end that the

obstacle is with us I think we've

demonstrated a reasonableness through

this process you know what I I will

obviously I expect education workers and

teachers and the province of Ontario to

be in class with their students

educating their kids in just a few yes

especially when kewpie already seems

determined to ramp it up even further

you know you know Colin I think there I

think for us we just have to remind

ourselves of what's transpired in the

past versions of labor strife with

parties literally all three parties I

mean these types of environments happen

by design pressurized environments

deadlines bargaining is not unique to

the government and for the parties that

drive at that approach so you know but

yet deals have been made deals

overwhelming

deals have been made negotiated by the

party so you know I remain cautiously

optimistic that if we can if cute people

accept those dates and lock them and

officially we'll get at the table we'll

get back to the table today hopefully as

soon as humanly possible but we stand

ready to do it literally today and to

get back to the table to get a deal I

think there is a prospect actually I

mean to be quite frank you know what

we're talking about fundamentally most

issues were resolved last Sunday

overwhelmingly we made progress this is

where I face a bit of frustration and a

bit of you know you know just trying to

understand why why have they made this

decision today and I can't answer that I

really don't like a knot I'm just

perhaps have a similar question mark but

what I can say but I can say is that

from our perspective I will remain

absolutely determined notwithstanding

the noise to get a deal and I will do

anything I can to keep the room focused

on our kids and not on ourselves it is

my expectation the kids will remain in

class learning but it is also my hope

that we will not be in a situation that

QP will come back to the table lock in

those dates so that we can land a deal

to mitigate against any of those

circumstances that you've enumerated per

day on sick leaves but also a

disproportionate amount of these sick

days are being taken on Fridays and

Mondays which is causing the burden on

the province the response from them you

know I mean I will let KP speak for

themselves I mean I it at the table

we're trying to maintain a level of

discretion I've heard their comments

publicly I'll let them speak for

themselves I do think there's a serious

concern about the effects it has on kids

the fact that we have situations where

staff are literally coming and going

where you have student students some

students who really need to have a

presence of staff particularly on the a

side for kids with with autism or other

intellectual or developed with

disabilities so

I'll let them speak for why they seem so

determined on that matter I think for us

though I'm just going to continue to

signal to keep e signal to you and to

the parents of this province that I

stand ready today to get back to the

table I'll take one more question yes

the situations that they deal with

I mean oftentimes these are very

difficult very stressful situations yeah

these folks are in day to day the

average ei makes thirty five to forty

thousand dollars what do you say to

those who think that you're pinching

pennies with frontline staff in the

wrong place yeah you know I think the

undercurrent of your questions that many

A's work hard and I know that they face

challenges in the classroom I know that

they care about the kids I've met many

aides I can tell that they are driven

for the right reasons why they made this

a vocation

so I share a concern about safety of

EA's I obviously want to make sure we're

able to retain talented EA's the

retention of quality staff is important

to be able 'ti to attract new talent

because we need more EAS and the

province increasingly given the changing

profile of students in the class so you

know my message is we've provided I

think a very reasonable and fair offer

on the table where you're seeing and

that increases every single year in the

basis of that contract and I also think

that you know the the benefits and all

the other sort of aspects then that that

governed those deals I think provide

provide incentive for people to stay in

the system

you know we've got as you know as you

noted over 120 130 days of sick leave

and other sort of benefits associated

with that line of work within the public

service so we think that our approach is

reasonable it is very much student

focused it respects their craft and

their work ethic and it also ensures a

reasonableness about the way forward

because as you know there are many

people and in the province of ontario we

have the low as at least as of 2018 we

have the lowest rate of income growth in

the nation and I think that's a

challenge for people at home who face

difficulty

and the fact that we provided an

annualized increase no matter what of 1%

as the baseline I mean and to be fair

these things are before negotiating so I

can't really prejudice that but that's

the item that we've led that we've

introduced not past at this point I

think is actually very fair and as I say

we've been reasonable at the table we've

been open at the table to understanding

any other way we can maybe you know find

a solution and I think that that spirit

needs to be now matched by by all

parties ok thank you so much
