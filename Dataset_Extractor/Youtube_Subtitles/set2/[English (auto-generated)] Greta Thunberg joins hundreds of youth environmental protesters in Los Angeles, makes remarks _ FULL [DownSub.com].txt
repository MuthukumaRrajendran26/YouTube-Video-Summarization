earlier this week I visited paradise in

California and I met with survivors who

showed me around the devastation streets

with no houses

I heard heartbreaking stories 18,000

buildings were destroyed and at least 86

people died today

in California would you see the one

price happening just round the corner

bonfires are being intensified by

declining prices but it's not just here

everywhere around the world would you

see these horrible environmental

feedbacks that countless of people are

suffering and dying from right now we

are living in the beginning we find it

and we cannot continue to look away from

this crisis anymore

I mean what is it that seem to be heart

so hard to understand

we have been repeating the same message

over and over again the scientists have

been repeating the same message over and

over and over again and yet they are

still not being listened to it is the

year 2019

why is the world still ignoring the

science and those most affected by this

crisis why are the people in power still

pretending that everything is fine we

can just continue to live like now as if

there was no tomorrow well there is such

Amaro it is the Torah but we young

people will live and we need to fight

for that tomorrow and we need to protect

this as if our lives depended on it

because it does

people are already suffering and dying

from the climate and ecological

emergency and it will continue to get

worse doesn't it mean anything to the

decision-makers we will I will never

understand how they can put short-term

interests above human lives above the

planet itself and our very future but we

young people we say no and if our

parents won't speak up for us that we

will we are on the line and we will make

sure the people in power don't get away

with the older generations are failing

us they are failing future generations

but future generations do not have voice

and the biosphere doesn't have voice so

we will be the voice that's up

[Applause]

and we will be the voice speeds up for

ourselves

[Applause]
