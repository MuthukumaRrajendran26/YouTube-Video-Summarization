the fake news right I think that I think

it's fake news it was fakeness those

words may mean less now than ever before

president Trump often spouts the phrase

to attack stories he doesn't like no

matter how true they are he'll use the

term fake news to describe objectively

true information as fake but really it's

true but he just doesn't think it should

be on the news media agenda at a time

when it seems like made-up stories lurk

on every corner of the Internet the

Society of Professional Journalists is

fronting a campaign to get news

consumers to understand what fake news

really is real fake news isn't news at

all using satire and humor the

organization is attempting to trademark

the words fake news telling global news

since Trump took office we've worked

really hard to teach people what

journalists do and how we do it this was

another direct example of that it gives

people a call to action to go to the

website to do your own research it's not

just a certain head of state we're going

after the group is hoping that public

awareness will curb attempts to devalue

their work and its importance

the term fake news may have been

popularized in the United States but the

campaign to trademark the two words is

the brainchild of a Calgary based

advertising agency that became alarmed

at what they saw happening here in

Washington we know the importance of a

free and independent press as as a

defender of democracy the campaign

claims they will send a cease and desist

letter each time fake news is uttered by

anyone you'll be hearing from us even

though legal challenges will likely get

the best of them the campaign doesn't

really enjoy success of whether the

trademark is approved or rejected but

successful or not avoiding the

rabbit-hole that fake news can lead

someone down is the key take away copy

interpret news how they experience news

how they reflect on news

those are really important concepts so

America because when all else fails it's

important to remember

that's matter Reggie Cecchini Global
