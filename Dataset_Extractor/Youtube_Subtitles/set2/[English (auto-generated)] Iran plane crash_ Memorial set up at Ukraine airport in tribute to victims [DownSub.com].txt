the sweet smell of flowers walks through

camps International Airport as soon as

you walk in the front door come from the

departures zone it hits you it is so

beautiful but then it turns in your gut

in your head when you realize what this

mountain really means there's tributes

and flowers and a lot of cards all in

honor of the 176 people who were killed

on board a flight that was supposed to

land here flight 752 was supposed to

arrive on Wednesday but instead people

are coming here and laying flowers

yesterday Ukraine's president stopped by

to add his bouquet of condolence it was

also a National Day of Mourning

in this country instead of families

embracing each other and gathering

together they are instead trying to

figure out exactly what happened people

in Canada Ukraine and many other

countries are just reeling now once

again Iranian officials have said they

did not fire any missiles that goes

against what Prime Minister Justin

Trudeau has said as well as other

political officials it has looked like

that plane was shot down now our

Ukrainian officials are on the way on

the ground in Tehran trying to figure

out what happened Canadian officials are

also on their way they've been invited

but what they'll find it's unclear

because of the amount of time that has

passed for now as people passed by and

stopped to pay their respects

there is no doubting the amount of

sorrow and pain being felt here Crystal
