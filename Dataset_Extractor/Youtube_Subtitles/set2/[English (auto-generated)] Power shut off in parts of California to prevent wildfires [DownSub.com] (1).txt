as high winds and wildfires tear across

California millions of residents are in

the dark left without power to traffic

lights homes schools and businesses

people not to use do without the power

here

generators sold out long ago in this

darkened hardware store the owner is

guiding customers by flashlight to buy

flashlights unfortunately we've run out

of some of those products that they need

more than 800,000 customers had their

power turned off in a pre-emptive move

by Pacific Gas and Electric the largest

utility provider in California the

company feared downed powerlines could

start fires in the tinder-dry conditions

we took this step to ensure the safety

of our customers and our communities as

a last resort and we're committed to

reducing the risk of catastrophic

wildfire events there's good reason for

caution last year the company's

equipment was blamed for starting the

deadly fire in the town of Paradise 85

people were killed 13,000 homes burned

to the ground if the choices I had to

shut him down or to potentially start a

fire they shut him down but not everyone

feels that way

blaming the utility company for failing

to maintain its equipment do your job

protect the public the decision to

preemptively cut power isn't just

inconvenient those who rely on certain

medical devices say it puts their lives

at risk what are you gonna do with

people like myself because I know I'm

not the only one the utility has warned

this unprecedented action could last for

days

lines and equipment will need to be

inspected before they can be

re-energized even after the risk of

wildfire subsides Jackson frost co
