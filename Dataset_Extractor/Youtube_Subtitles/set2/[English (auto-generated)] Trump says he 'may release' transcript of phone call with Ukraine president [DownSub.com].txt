but this is a case I hope you get to see

the call because your question you will

see I did not ask for did I did not make

a statement that you have to do this or

I'm not gonna give you a I wouldn't do

that I wouldn't do that with that being

said what I want is I want you know

we're giving a lot of money away to

Ukraine and other places you want to see

a country that's going to be not corrupt

the president is a good man he got

elected on the fact that he was going to

get rid of corruption in Ukraine that's

I think the primary reason he got

elected so he gets elected on the basis

of ending corruption in Ukraine well I

think that's good and that's what I want

to see

but when Biden does a thing like that

then there's still corruption and that's

not good I can do it very easily but I'd

rather not do it from the standpoint of

all of the other conversations I have I

may do it because it was a very innocent

call on both his part of my wait a very

nice call it was really a congratulatory

call because he had just won it was just

confirmed and he's the new president and

I think he's going to do an excellent

job I will tell you it's a great call

it's a very honorable call it's a nice

call the Ukrainian government last night

very strongly they announced that this

call was a very nice call that was and

they also said there was no pressure put

on him like the character over to your

left there was no pressure put on them

whatsoever I put no pressure on them

whatsoever good F I think would probably

possibly have been okay if I did but I

didn't I didn't put any pressure on them

whatsoever

you know why because they want to do the

right thing and they know about

corruption and they probably know that

Joe Biden and his son are corrupt they

probably know that Joe Biden and his son

are corrupt all right but the fake news

doesn't want to report it because

they're Democrats if that ever happened

if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden

did if a Republican ever said what Joe

Biden said then beginning the electric

chair by right now look at the double

standard you people ought to be ashamed

of yourself and not oh we have some

great

is around but you got a lot of crooked

journalists you crooked as hell
