they're significant because they seem to

show the exact thing Donald Trump has

denied and they come as the impeachment

inquiry ramps up tonight vice president

Mike Pence has been ordered to produce

documents about his own interactions

with Ukraine as the White House faces a

subpoena to do the same anything having

to do with corruption I actually feel I

have an obligation evolving explanations

now have president Trump claiming he had

a duty to act in pressuring foreign

governments to investigate his political

rival I don't care about politics but I

do care about corruption despite no

allegation of wrongdoing against Joe

Biden or his son Hunter Trump has openly

called on the governments of Ukraine and

China to launch investigations in the

case of Ukraine text messages delivered

to the impeachment inquiry show there

may have been a blatant quid pro quo the

messages show American diplomats

pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe

Biden if they wanted a meeting between

Ukraine's president zalenski and

President Trump at a time when US

military aid to Ukraine had been

suspended US envoy kurt volker wrote to

one of zelinsky's aides assuming

president said convinces trump he will

investigate / get to the bottom of what

happened in 2016 we will nail down a

date for visit to Washington in August

the aide replied when there was a date

Ukraine would announce the

investigations into the gas company

where Joe Biden's son worked Burr yzma

and election meddling William Taylor the

top US diplomat in Ukraine then began

questioning what was going on are we now

saying that security assistance and

White House meeting are conditioned on

investigations then as news about the

whistleblower complaint became public

Taylor wrote I think it's crazy to

withhold security assistance for help

with a political campaign the US

ambassador to the EU Gordon Sun Glenda

Trump a point he wrote back the

president has been crystal clear no quid

pro quos of any kind the text message

that I saw from ambassador Sunland who's

highly respected was there's no quid pro

quo he said that

Trump has said this was all about

investigating corruption but when asked

today if he has ever sought foreign

investigations into people who aren't

his political rivals he couldn't name

anyone
