order this is the result of the fourth

and final ballot 540 ballots were cast

awesome he gave other oppressing

engagements taketh away

I'm serious business the number of votes

cast for each candidate was as follows

Chris Brant 213 silenzio oil 325

to balance were spoiled silenzio oil has

obviously secured more than 50% of the

ballots cast so the basin for the house

the question is that sir Lindsey Hoyle

takes the chair of this house as Speaker

[Applause]

as of our that opinion say aye for the

country no I think the eye is heavy the

eyes have it I invite some Lindsey royal

to take the chair of the House

[Applause]

[Applause]

oh no clapping yeah

ooh can I just say mr. Clark thank you

for the way that you've we've kept you

longer than expected I really appreciate

it

you've been stuff first on the job that

you've done it really is appreciated

God just say thank you to all that comes

of it who ever had been selected would

have made a great speaker and I've got

to say those who withdrew Sir Henry

Bellingham and Shelley Farah we thank

you for the way that you wanted to

ensure that we didn't stay another two

legs of course it is about the campaign

as a discussed it's about the challenges

ahead for me in this chamber I stand by

what I've said I stand firm that I hope

this house will be once a great

respected house not just in here but

across the world but one thing it's the

envy we've got to make sure that tarnish

is polished away that the respect and

tolerance that we expect from everyone

who works in here we'll be sure and

we'll keep that in in order I also want

to say to my family

[Music]

[Applause]

no copy

[Applause]

there's one difficult part to want to

get over there is one person who's not

here my daughter Natalie I wish you'd

have been here we all miss it as a

family no more so than a memory I'm

gonna say she was everything to all of

us she will always be missed but she'll

always be in our thoughts

[Applause]

I want to hopefully show that the

experience of Xian previously will

continue as I promised I will be neutral

I will be transparent I think this house

we can do more to ensure that that

transparency continues no more so than I

believe that the Commission

I have never sat on the Commission I've

never even seen the minutes of the

committee so I do believe there is a

little bit of transparency once again

and I've got to say thank you as I said

to my family but also thank you to my

office there also with it and that

they've been with me for a long time in

fact bamboos up there and she'll get all

embarrassed it's been with me for 21

years

she let the University and said I'm

never going to get married I'm never

good enough children I don't want any of

this life guess what she's married she's

got children the same with Peter and

Mike they've done a fantastic job

they've been really good so Lord says

can I say thank you to everybody it's

been a long night I'd all to keep

anymore but I do stamp I will upset this

house will change but it will change for

the better thank you

I'm no good at all the first time the

Prime Minister

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

Mr Speaker I want to the ones who join

with me in thanking first of all the

father of the house for the way he's

conducted renewed y-z I'd pay renewed

tributes to my right honourable and

learning friend who outranks just about

every member not just in length of

service but also in distinction mr.

speakers held six cabinet posts

including two offices of state and his

hush puppies have been found propped up

on the desk of ministerial offices in

four separate decades mr. speaker and

his continuing physical and intellectual

robustness are a tribute to the benefits

of a lifetime's diet mr. speaker of beer

and carry and Castel cigars all of which

I hope you will continue to enjoy in a

long and happy retirement at Trent

Bridge or touring the famous jazz clubs

in West Bridgeford this has been

congratulating you on your election I

observe that you have prevailed over an

extremely strong field and that every

other candidate earlier on spoke

forcefully and well and I'm not going to

presume mr. speaker to identify exactly

what characteristics other members of

this house saw in you I when they

elected you just now but I speaking for

myself after long happy years of dealing

with you I think I know what it is

and let me say whenever any of us is

preparing to speak in this chamber we

all know that there is a moment between

standing up and when the speaker calls

you when your heart is in your mouth and

in that moment of anxiety about where

you're going to make a fool of

yourselves on

and indeed at the moment when they sit

down and the deafening silence the kind

leanness of the speaker the kind

leanness of the speaker is absolutely

critical to our confidence over the

years I have observed that you have many

good qualities and I'm sure you will

stick up for backbenchers in the way

that you have proposed I'm sure that you

will adhere to a strict Newtonian

concept of time in p.m. hues but I

believe you I believe in Newtonian but I

believe you will also you will also

bring your signature kindness kindness

and reasonableness to our proceedings

and thereby to help to bring us together

as a parliament and as a democracy

because no matter how fiercely we may

disagree we know that every member comes

to this place with the best of motives

determined to solve to serve the oldest

parliamentary democracy in the world and

to achieve our goals by the peaceable

arts of reason and debate invigilator by

an impartial speaker remains one of our

greatest gifts to the world Thank You

mr. speaker and congratulations

the other thing I've got to thank was

all the stuff of this house to underdogs

in the way that she run this election

campaign so I thank everybody in the

house can I know called upon the right

honorable Jeremy Corbyn he took the

opposition Thank You mr. speaker can I

join others in offering my

congratulations to you on winning the

election and thank the father of the

house for conducting the election in the

ways he did but also congratulations and

commiserations to the other candidates

who didn't succeed in getting elected

but nevertheless made sure we had a very

good campaign and very serious debate

all across the house because I think

that was very very important we also are

very well aware of your abilities at

chairing the house because we've been

through finance bills and budgets where

your robust in ensuring that people

stick to the point and the subject which

is some comrades in the house of my side

and other members on the other side

sometimes deviate from the subject in

hand unprecedented I know but there we

are

in your position mr. speaker you're

going to need eyes in the back of your

head it's a difficult job you don't know

what it's coming at you next and so I

realize you've actually been in training

in this so I've been looking at a

photograph of you at the weekend

apparently

apparently watching the rugby Cup final

whilst at the same time not watching the

television so the only conclusion I can

draw from this is that you literally do

have eyes at the back of your head

because you were able to make some very

wise comments about the progress of the

match that you were apparently not

watching at the same time so I think

these qualities alone

equip you to be an absolutely brilliant

chair of this house as you've said and

many know the job of speaker is not just

a ceremonial one it is about the rights

of back ventures to be able to speak up

it is about the power of Parliament to

hold government to account that is the

whole principle in point of a

parliamentary democracy that we have a

strong Parliament that can hold the

executive to account and I know that you

will stand up for that principle because

that is what you believe in it's

absolutely the heart of our political

system I also know that you take the

well-being of everybody who works in

this building and the well-being of

members very very seriously because this

is a fevered imaginative fevered and

very imaginative place that we all work

in people are put under enormous stress

and sometimes people find themselves in

a very lonely and desperate place

because of that both staff and members

this house I know you take your

responsibilities in that area very very

seriously and they know that you want to

make this an even more compassionate and

humane place in which to work and I want

to close by thanking you for your work

thanking you for taking this job on but

also assuring us that you will always

stand up for the democratic values that

this house represents and the power of

an elected parliament to express its

views and hold the executive to account

because that is the whole principle

behind our parliamentary democracy
