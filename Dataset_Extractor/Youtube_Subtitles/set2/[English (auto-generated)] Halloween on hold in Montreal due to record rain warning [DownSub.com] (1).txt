it would be completely unfair to do this

Halloween story and draw from another

holiday to save draw parallel with the

Grinch

again that would be completely unfair to

materials mayor we want to be proactive

Valarie plant is not canceling Halloween

and holds no hatred for the holiday the

mayor announced with a tweet she's just

postponing it one day suggesting kids of

all sizes trick-or-treat tomorrow

instead well initially I thought it was

hilarious

meteorologist Anthony Farr analysis he

was a little shocked at first but then

looked at the frightful forecast it's a

combination of the wettest weather ever

recorded in Montreal and on October 31st

along with strong gusts a dangerous

combination that's when it gets to be

that next level of seriousness and and

probably a good idea to just hold off

and keep the kids at home know this

won't surprise anyone but a lot of kids

right now are questioning the mayor's

judgment to change the world ride

celebration because like for example on

Christmas you wouldn't change that a

different day and the Halloween you

probably should not either

I just rather go both days both days is

that an option my day we went out in

snow now for parents there are two sides

those who are having a little trouble

with this postponement it's Halloween

it's not tomorrow so yes I'm going

anyway and there are others who agree

with it for safety and slightly selfish

reasons Oh had to happen it's gonna be

unsafe and you guys I just don't want to

go out in the rain there is the chance

this is win-win for kids

they'll be drier and get more loot who

wouldn't want a trick-or-treat after

stores cut their prices and put candy on

sale my carbs are global news Montreal
