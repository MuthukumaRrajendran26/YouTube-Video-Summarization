thank you very much mr. president mr.

secretary general distinguished

delegates ambassadors and world leaders

seven decades of history have passed

through this hall in all of their

richness and drama where I stand the

world has heard from presidents and

premiers at the height of the Cold War

we have seen the foundation of nations

we have seen the ringleaders of

revolution we have beheld saints who

inspired us with hope rebels who stirred

us with passion and heroes who

emboldened us with courage all here to

share plans proposals visions and ideas

on the world's biggest stage like those

who met us before our time is one of

great contests high stakes and clear

choices the essential divide that runs

all around the world and throughout

history is once again thrown into stark

relief it is the divide between those

whose thirst for control deludes them

into thinking they are destined to rule

over others and those people and nations

who want only to rule themselves I have

the immense privilege of addressing you

today as the elected leader of a nation

that prizes liberty independence and

self-government above all the United

States after having spent over

two-and-a-half trillion dollars since my

election to completely rebuild our great

military is also by far the world's most

powerful nation hopefully it will never

have to use this power Americans know

that in a world where others seek

conquest and domination our nation must

be strong in wealth in might and in

spirit that is why the United States

vigorously defends the traditions and

customs that have made us who we are

like my beloved country each nation

represented in this Hall as a cherished

history culture and heritage that is

worth defending and celebrating and

which gives us our singular potential

and strength the free world must embrace

its national foundations it must not

attempt to erase them or replace them

looking around and all over this large

magnificent planet the truth is plain to

see if you want freedom take pride in

your country if you want democracy hold

on to your sovereignty and if you want

peace love your nation wise leaders

always put the good of their own people

and their own country first the future

does not belong to globalists the future

belongs to Patriots the future belongs

to sovereign and independent nations who

protect their citizens respect their

neighbors and honor the differences that

make each country special and unique it

is why we in the United States have

embarked on an exciting program

of national renewal and everything we do

we are focused on empowering the dreams

and aspirations of our citizens thanks

to our pro-growth economic policies our

domestic unemployment rate reached its

lowest level in over half a century

fueled by massive tax cuts and

regulations cuts jobs are being produced

at a historic rate six million Americans

have been added to the employment roles

in under three years last month African

American Hispanic American and Asian

American unemployment reached their

lowest rates ever recorded

we are marshalling our nation's vast

energy abundance and the United States

is now the number one producer of oil

and natural gas anywhere in the world

wages are rising incomes are soaring and

2.5 million Americans have been lifted

out of poverty in less than three years

as we rebuild the unrivaled might of the

American military

we are also revitalizing our alliances

by making it very clear that all of our

partners are expected to pay their fair

share of the tremendous defense burden

which the United States has borne in the

past at the center of our vision for

national renewal is an ambitious

campaign to reform international trade

for decades the international trading

system has been easily exploited by

nations acting in very bad faith as jobs

were outsourced a small handful grew

wealthy at the expense of the middle

class

in America the result was 4.2 million

lost manufacturing jobs and 15 trillion

dollars in trade deficits over the last

quarter century the United States is now

taking that decisive action to end this

grave economic injustice our goal is

simple we want balanced trade that is

both fair and reciprocal we have worked

closely with our partners in Mexico and

Canada to replace NAFTA with the brand

new and hopefully bipartisan US Mexico

Canada agreement tomorrow I will join

Prime Minister Abbey of Japan to

continue our progress in finalizing a

terrific new trade deal as the United

Kingdom makes preparations to exit the

European Union I have made clear that we

stand ready to complete an exceptional

new trade agreement with the UK that

will bring tremendous benefits to both

of our countries we are working closely

with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on a

magnificent new trade deal

the most important difference in

America's new approach on trade concerns

a relationship with China in 2001 China

was admitted through the World Trade

Organization our leaders then argued

that this decision would compel China to

liberalize its economy and strengthen

protections to provide things that were

unacceptable to us and for private

property and for the rule of law two

decades later this theory has been

tested and proven completely wrong

not only has China declined to adopt

promised reforms it has embraced an

economic model dependent on massive

market barriers heavy state subsidies

currency manipulation product dumping

force technology transfers and the theft

of intellectual property and also trade

secrets on a grand scale as just one

example I recently met the CEO of a

terrific American company micron

technology at the white house micron

produces memory chips used in countless

electronics to advance the Chinese

government's five-year economic plan a

company owned by the Chinese state

allegedly stole microns designs valued

at up to eight point seven billion

dollars soon the Chinese company obtains

patents for nearly an identical product

and micron was banned from selling its

own goods in China but we are seeking

justice the United States lost 60,000

factories after China entered the WTO

this is happening to other countries all

over the globe the world trade

organization needs drastic change the

second largest economy in the world

should not be permitted to declare

itself a developing country in order to

game the system at others expense for

years these abuses were tolerated

ignored or even encouraged globalism

exerted a religious pull over past

leaders causing them to ignore their own

national interests but as far as America

is concerned those days are over to

confront these unfair practices I placed

massive tariffs on more than 500 billion

dollars worth of Chinese made good

already as a result of these tariffs

supply chains are relocating back to

America and to other nations and

billions of dollars are being paid to

our treasury the American people are

absolutely committed to restoring

balance to our relationship with China

hopefully we can reach an agreement that

will be beneficial for both countries

but as I have made very clear I will not

accept a bad deal for the American

people

as we endeavor to stabilize our

relationship

we're also carefully monitoring the

situation in Hong Kong the world fully

expects that the Chinese government will

honor its binding treaty made with the

British and registered with the United

Nations in which China commits to

protect Hong Kong's freedom legal system

and democratic ways of life how China

chooses to handle the situation will say

a great deal about its role in the world

in the future we are all counting on

President Xi as a great leader the

United States does not seek conflict

with any other nation we desire peace

cooperation and mutual gain with all but

I will never fail to defend America's

interests one of the greatest security

threats facing peace-loving nations

today is the repressive regime in Iran

the regime's record of death and

destruction is well known to us all not

only is Iran the world's number one

state sponsor of terrorism but Iran's

leaders are fueling the tragic wars in

both Syria and Yemen at the same time

the regime is squandering the nation's

wealth and future in a fanatical quest

for nuclear weapons

and the means to deliver them we must

never allow this to happen to stop

Iran's path to nuclear weapons and

missiles I withdrew the United States

from the terrible Iran nuclear deal

which has very little time remaining did

not allow inspection of important sites

and did not cover ballistic missiles

following our withdrawal we have

implemented severe economic sanctions on

the country hoping to free itself from

sanctions the regime has escalated its

violent and unprovoked aggression in

response to Iran's recent attack on

Saudi Arabian oil facilities we just

imposed the highest level of sanctions

on Iran's central bank and sovereign

wealth fund all nations have a duty to

act

no responsible government should

subsidize Iran's bloodlust as long as I

runs menacing behavior continues

sanctions will not be lifted they will

be tightened Iran's leaders will have

turned a proud nation into just another

cautionary tale of what happens when a

ruling class abandons its people and

embarks on a crusade for personal power

and riches for 40 years the world has

listened to Iran's rulers as they lash

out at everyone else for the problems

they alone have created they conduct

ritual chants of death to America and

traffic in monstrous anti-semitism last

year the country's supreme leader stated

Israel is a malignant cancerous

that has to be removed and eradicated it

is possible and it will happen America

will never tolerate such anti-semitic

hate fanatics have long used hatred of

Israel to distract from their own

failures thankfully there is a growing

recognition in the wider Middle East

that the countries of the region share

common interests in battling extremism

and unleashing Economic Opportunity that

is why it is so important to have fold

normalized relations between Israel and

its neighbors only a relationship built

on common interest mutual respect and

religious tolerance can forge a better

future

Iran citizens deserve a government that

cares about reducing poverty ending

corruption and increasing jobs not

stealing their money to fund and

massacre abroad and at home after four

decades of failure it is time for Iran's

leaders to step forward and to stop

threatening other countries and focus on

building up their own country it is time

for Iran's leaders to finally put the

Iranian people first America is ready to

embrace friendship with all who

genuinely seek peace and respect many of

America's closest friends today were

once our greatest foes the United States

has never believed in permanent enemies

we want partners not adversaries America

knows that while anyone can make war

only the most courageous can choose

peace for this same reason we have

pursued

ball diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula

I've told Kim jong-un what I truly

believe that like Iran his country is

full of tremendous untapped potential

but that you realized that promise North

Korea must denuclearize around the world

our message is clear

America's goal is lasting America's goal

is harmony and America's goal is not to

go with these endless wars wars that

never end with that golden line my

administration is also pursuing the hope

of a brighter future in Afghanistan

unfortunately the Taliban has chosen to

continue their savage attacks we will

continue to work with our coalition of

Afghan partners to stamp out terrorism

and we will never stop working to make

peace a reality here in the Western

Hemisphere we are joining with our

partners to ensure stability and

opportunity all across the region in

that mission one of our most critical

challenges is illegal immigration which

undermines prosperity rips apart

societies and empowers ruthless criminal

cartels mass illegal migration is unfair

unsafe and unsustainable for everyone

involved the sending countries and the

depleted countries and they become

depleted very fast but the youth is not

taken care of and human capital goes to

waste the receiving countries are

overburdened with more migrants and they

can responsibly accept and the migrants

themselves are

exploited assaulted and abused by

vicious coyotes nearly 1/3 of women who

make the journey north to our border are

sexually assaulted along the way yet

here in the United States and around the

world there was a growing cottage

industry of radical activists and

non-governmental organizations that

promote human smuggling these groups

encourage illegal migration and demand

Eurasia of national borders today I have

a message for those open border

activists who cloak themselves in the

rhetoric of social justice your policies

are not just your policies are cruel and

evil you are empowering criminal

organizations that prey on innocent men

women and children you put your own

false sense of virtue before the lives

well-being and countless innocent people

when you undermine border security you

are undermining human rights and human

dignity many of the countries here today

are coping with the challenges of

uncontrolled migration each of you has

the absolute right to protect your

borders and so of course there's our

country today we must resolve to work

together to end human smuggling and

human trafficking and put these criminal

networks out of business for good to our

country I can tell you sincerely we are

working closely with our friends in the

region including Mexico Canada Guatemala

Honduras El Salvador and Panama to

uphold the integrity of borders and

ensure safety and prosperity for our

people

I would like to thank President Lopez

Obrador of Mexico for the great

cooperation we are receiving and for

right now putting 27,000 troops on our

southern border Mexico is showing us

great respect and I respect them in

return the US we have taken very

unprecedented action to stop the flow of

illegal immigration to anyone conducting

crossings of our border illegally please

hear these words do not pay the

smugglers do not pay the Coyotes do not

put yourself in danger do not put your

children in danger because if you make

it here you will not be allowed in you

will be promptly returned home you will

not be released into our country as long

as I am president of the United States

we will enforce our laws and protect our

borders for all of the countries of the

Western Hemisphere our goal is to help

people invest in the bright futures of

their own nation our region is full of

such incredible promise dreams waiting

to be built and national destinies for

all and they are waiting also to be

pursued throughout the hemisphere there

are millions of hard-working patriotic

young people eager to build innovate and

achieve but these nations cannot reach

their potential

if a generation of youth abandoned their

homes in search of a life elsewhere we

want every nation in our region to

flourish and its people to thrive in

freedom and peace

in that mission we are also committed to

supporting those people in the Western

Hemisphere who live under brutal

oppression such as those in Cuba

Nicaragua and Venezuela according to a

recent report from the UN Human Rights

Council women in Venezuela stand in line

for 10 hours a day waiting for food over

15,000 people have been detained as

political prisoners modern-day death

squads are carrying out thousands of

extrajudicial killings the dictator

Maduro is a Cuban puppet protected by

Cuban bodyguards hiding from his own

people while Cuba plunders Venezuela's

oil wealth to sustain its own corrupt

communist rule since I last spoke in

this hall the United States and our

partners have built a historic coalition

of 55 countries that recognize the

legitimate government of Venezuela - the

Venezuelans trapped in this nightmare

please know that all of America is

united behind you the United States has

vast quantities of humanitarian aid

ready and waiting to be delivered we're

watching the Venezuela situation very

closely we await the day when democracy

will be restored when Venezuela will be

free and when Liberty will prevail

throughout this hemisphere one of the

most serious challenges our countries

face is the specter of socialism

it's the Recker of nations and destroyer

of societies events in Venezuela remind

us all that socialism and communism are

not about justice they are not about

equality they are not about lifting up

the poor

and they are certainly not about good of

the nation socialism and communism are

about one thing only power for the

ruling class today I repeat a message

for the world that I have delivered at

home America will never be a socialist

country in the last century socialism

and communism killed 100 million people

sadly as we see in Venezuela the death

toll continues in this country these

totalitarian ideologies combined with

modern technology have the power to

excise new and disturbing forms of

suppression and domination for this

reason the United States is taking steps

to better screen foreign technology and

investments and to protect our data and

our security we urge every nation

president to do the same freedom and

democracy must be constantly guarded and

protected both abroad and from within we

must always be skeptical of those who

want conformity and control even in free

nations we see alarming signs and new

challenges to Liberty a small number of

social media platforms are acquiring

immense power over what we can see and

over what we are allowed to say a

permanent political class is openly

disdainful dismissive and defiant of the

will of the people

a faceless bureaucracy operates in

secret and weakens democratic rule media

and academic institutions push flat-out

assaults on our history's traditions and

values in the United States my

administration has made clear to social

media companies that we will uphold the

right of free speech a free society

cannot allow social media giants to

silence the voices of the people and a

free people must never ever be enlisted

in the cause of silencing coercing

cancelling or blacklisting their own

neighbors as we defend American values

we affirm the right of all people to

live in dignity for this reason my

administration is working with other

nations to stop criminalizing of

homosexuality and we stand in solidarity

with LGBTQ people who live in countries

that punish jail or execute individuals

based upon sexual orientation

we are also championing the role of

women in our societies nations that

empower women are much wealthier safer

and much more relatively stable is

therefore vital not only to a nation's

prosperity but also is vital to its

national security to pursue women's

economic development guided by these

principles my administration launched

the women's global development and

prosperity initiatives the W GDP is the

first-ever government-wide approach to

women's economic empowerment working to

ensure that women all over the planet

have the legal right to own and inherit

property work in the same industries as

men travel freely and access credit and

institutions yesterday I was also

pleased to host leaders for a discussion

about an iron Clair American commitment

protecting religious leaders and also

protecting religious freedom this

fundamental right is under a growing

threat around the world hard to believe

but 80% of the world's population lives

in countries where religious liberty is

in significant danger or even completely

outlawed Americans will never fire or

tire in our effort to defend and promote

freedom of worship and religion we want

and support religious liberty for all

Americans will also never tire of

defending innocent life we are aware

that many United Nations projects have

attempted to assert a global right to

taxpayer-funded abortion on demand right

up until the moment of delivery global

bureaucrats have absolutely no business

attacking the sovereignty of nations

that wish to protect innocent life like

many nations here today we in America

believe that every child born and unborn

is a sacred gift from God there is no

circumstance under which the United

States will allow international enters

to trample on the rights of our citizens

including the right to self-defense that

is why this year I announced that we

will never ratify the UN arms

a treaty which would threaten the

liberties of law-abiding American

citizens the United States will always

uphold our constitutional right to keep

and bear arms we will always uphold our

Second Amendment the core rights and

values America defends today were

inscribed in America's founding

documents our nation's founders

understood that there will always be

those who believe they are entitled to

wield power and control over others

journey advances under many names and

many theories but it always comes down

to the desire for domination it protects

not the interests of many but the

privilege of few our founders gave us a

system designed to restrain this

dangerous impulse they chose to entrust

American power to those most invested in

the fate of our nation a proud and

fiercely independent people the true

good of the nation can only be pursued

by those who love it by citizens who are

rooted in its history who are nourished

by its culture committed to its values

attached to its people and who know that

its future is theirs to build or theirs

to lose Patriots see a nation and its

destiny in ways no one else can

liberty is only preserved sovereignty is

only secured democracy is only sustained

greatness is only realized by the will

and devotion of Patriots in their spirit

is found the strength to resist

oppression the inspiration to forge

legacy

the goodwill to seek friendship and the

bravery to reach for peace love of our

nation's makes the world better for all

nations so to all the leaders here today

join us in the most fulfilling mission a

person could have the most profound

contribution anyone can make lift up

your nations cherish your culture honor

your histories

treasure your citizens make your country

strong and prosperous and righteous

honor the dignity of your people and

nothing will be outside of your reach

when our nations are greater the future

will be brighter our people will be

happier and our partnerships will be

stronger with God's help together we

will cast off the enemies of Liberty and

overcome the oppressors of dignity we

will set new standards of living and

reached new heights of human achievement

we will rediscover ultros unravel old

mysteries and make thrilling new

breakthroughs and we will find more

beautiful friendship and more harmony

among nations than ever before my fellow

leaders the path to peace and progress

and freedom and justice and a better

world for all humanity begins at home

thank you god bless you god bless the

nations of the world and god bless

america

thank you very much
