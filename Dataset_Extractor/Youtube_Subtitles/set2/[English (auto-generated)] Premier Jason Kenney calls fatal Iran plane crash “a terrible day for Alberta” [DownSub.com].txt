today on behalf of the government of

Alberta I join in expressing our most

profound condolences to the to all of

those whose lives were lost to their

family members and their loved ones and

in particular to the University of

Alberta community and the Alberta

Persian community it's a small but

dynamic and well-educated highly

successful community many of whom came

to Canada to do Advanced Studies and

have succeeded in our professions I've

had the privilege of attending a number

of functions with the her Iranian

Heritage Society of Edmonton earlier

today I placed a phone call to its

current president Araiza Alka Bari to

express the condolences of the

government of Alberta I've also called

dr. David Turpin at the University of

Alberta I've reached out to federal

Foreign Affairs Minister Shaun pang

we're hoping to set up a call later

today so that I can express the support

of the government of Alberta for efforts

by Canada to get to the bottom of the

disaster in Tehran earlier today

obviously we are very hopeful that the

Iranian authorities will cooperate with

Canada Ukraine and international

authorities to have a full and

independent inquiry into the causes of

the crash of the United of the Ukrainian

International Airlines flight seven five

two it is essential that we have full

cooperation and transparency to know

what the causes were once again let me

say a special word of solidarity for

members of the Canadian Persian

community here in Alberta this is a

small community numbering at most a few

thousand people it is close-knit and

this is a devastating day I'm sure that

virtually every member of the Alberta

Persian community and has it was close

to or knew somebody affected by the

flight crash today this

it's been any consideration because I

have been considering that and certainly

we would reach out to the family there's

families of the loved ones to see if

they if there would be a desire for to

work with the government of Alberta for

a larger public memorial we have

instructed that all government of

Alberta buildings lower their flags to

half mass during this period of mourning

and I've indicated to mr. al kobbari of

the Iranian heritage society that

mminton that we are willing to support

the community in any way that we

practically can as they come to terms

with this other as they mourn this and

to provide support to the families I

have been considering that and certainly

we would reach out to the family of the

families of the loved ones to see if

they if there would be a desire for to

work with the government of Alberta for

a larger public memorial we have

instructed that all government of

Alberta buildings lower their flags to

half mast during this period of mourning

and I've indicated to mr. al kobbari of

the Iranian Heritage Society of Edmonton

that we are willing to support the

community in any way that we practically

can as they come to terms with this oath

as they mourn this and to provide

support to the families but in eternity

to that that we'll be able to get the

answers that we need from

the state of diplomatic it's happening

right now right well obviously it's a

very tense situation there and we all

know that this happened in the context

of military hostilities and so regret

you know to be opted to state the

obvious the the Iranian regime is not

known for transparency and it is in the

midst of a regional conflict I hope that

they will not withstanding those facts

before coming particularly mindful of

the number of foreign nationals

particularly Canadians who reward the

flight so I I trust the Government of

Canada will make very strong

representations to to Iran about the

year the importance of transparency in

the post crash investigation
