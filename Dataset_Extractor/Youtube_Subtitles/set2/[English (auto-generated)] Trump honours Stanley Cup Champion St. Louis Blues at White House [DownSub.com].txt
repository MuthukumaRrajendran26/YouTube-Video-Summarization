thanks Anne Missouri governor Mike

parson Mike great job an attorney

General Eric Schmidt Eric and many other

and I introduced him a little bit before

but the NHL commissioner Gary Bettman

I've known him so long I refuse to say

how long it's a lot of years right

a lot of years a lot of success - way to

go Gary

way to go it's an honor to have you so

what we were alluding to before is in

2019 when the year started you were true

underdogs midway through the season the

Blues were ranked last in the NHL I

can't believe that fellas but don't

worry it gets better

you only had 15 wins you had eighteen

losses and four ties on January 6th

fresh off another really bad loss a hard

one it was close but it was bad a few of

the Blues players it's still a loss

right the losses are no good no matter

what bye what does it matter if you lose

some close Tom or it's a losses a loss

right yeah I think so at least you have

a little hope when they're close right

but they gathered at a bar in

Philadelphia where they heard the 1982

hit Gloria that's where you were that's

why we were playing that song for those

of you that don't know what's happened

here Gloria the next day you shut out

the Flyers who were hot and Laurie

became your new wind song it was a wind

song that's why we played it so now

everybody gets it otherwise the fake

news would be criticizing me they say

what kind of a song you're playing this

song what what is that look at that guy

look at that mouth and that guy come

here man

do you think he's taking a few hits

do you think he's stopped you think I

could take him in a fight I don't know

[Applause]

Wow how do I look

no hockey yeah that's great

over the next few weeks the Blues

notched 11 straight wins the longest

winning streak in team history and soon

earned a place in the playoffs in the

first round you took on the Winnipeg

Jets moments away from overtime in game

five the Blues left wing Jaden Schwarz

scored the winning goal in the last 15

seconds of regulation and everybody else

just took a deep breath and said that

was close was Jason Jason Jacob and they

say he's a great golfer but well I

wouldn't be able to score if it wasn't

for my partner passing me the puck where

are you Tyler golf partner two

undefeated if you want to take us on

some time fantastic Thank You Jade the

next game st. Louis clinched the series

after Jaden scored all through junior

pretty good all three of the Blues goals

and Jaden your persistence made you the

blues leader in the play of goal scoring

that's a great job after winning two

more series the Blues were off to the

legendary Stanley Cup Finals which

everybody watches everybody loves very

special was a matchup for the ages with

the series tied at 3-3 the Blues headed

to Boston for the final showdown against

a great team watching from the bleachers

was your biggest fan 11 year old Laila

Anderson who was here with us today

where's Laila Laila stand up come on up

here Laila

come on okay good job

so you all know Leila Leila is a bigger

celebrity than our two senators they

just hope that she's not gonna be

running against them someday but it's a

really an extraordinary story of a very

heroic young woman throughout the season

Laila was bravely battling an extremely

rare life-threatening immune disease

called h LH blues players visitor to the

hospital constantly and they hosted a

bone marrow registry drive to help her

get life-saving treatment Leila's mother

Heather said who's here

these boys are what keeps her going

they're just incredible incredible young

men thank you very much for being here

very very nice Leila received a bone

marrow transplant in January and was

strong enough to cheer the team on to

victory in the final game Leila your

exceptional courage and frankly the fact

that you brought the team some luck

which is important right we all need a

little of that but we just want to thank

you you inspired the Blues all season

and today you continued to inspire all

Americans we all know your story right

now see all of those people back there

see they look so friendly they're not

they're tougher than these guys okay but

I'll bank on these guys

so congratulations darling you take care

of yourself okay so the Stanley Cup

final was an extraordinary finish to a

miraculous season so you think of that

and that's what we were referring to

they started off so bad so bad that even

the Commission was telling me it wasn't

looking too good for this team right but

they they set records when the puck

dropped the Blues did not strike right

away you only knew it took one shot on

goal until the final minutes of the

first period then Stanley Cup MVP what

happened to Jaden with all the gauze you

I think Jaden should be the MVP not

Monika where's Ryan Ryan O'Reily come

here that's pretty good say a couple of

words

thanks Ryan that's enough well couldn't

throw these guys behind me and we're a

great team and it was a heck of run and

you're not Irish

[Laughter]

great cone rack Ryan O'Reilly I scored

the first goal of the game it became the

first player since Wayne Gretzky great

guy really fantastic guy in 1985 to

score four consecutive Cup final games

he scored in all of them Ryan

congratulations on winning the Conn

Smythe Trophy as the first period came

to a close team captain Alex Petra

Angelo where is he come on you don't

even get that for sport no no no no this

is a bigger deal than the sports this is

pretty cool yeah pretty good group of

guys back here big golfers big golfers I

know you like that well thanks for

having us we appreciate job thank you

Alex Alex rushed forward and found that

the back of the net was his taking a two

nothing lead but Boston didn't let up

tough team I know the owner - how's he

doing okay good man right not so happy

unfortunately but he's - my friend but

he wasn't so happy the Bruins took 33

shots on net during the game and the

Blues rookie goaltender that's pretty

good

Jordan Binnington Wiz Jordan good I got

a fight coming

he stopped 32 of 33 so why didn't you

stop the other one Jordan you could have

made the game a lot easy come on yeah

first off you know that's my bad I guess

could add a shutout there but you know

we went all that way so we had to finish

the job and you did it was a great game

and yeah we're after we're here thanks

so have you always had good reflexes I

guess so yeah if you didn't it wouldn't

be here I don't think it'd be here right

that's great job Jordan thank you very

much

32 of 33 I guess that's good

commissioner that's pretty good right I

think so Jordan your outstanding 97

percent say percentage he'll Boston to a

single goal that's pretty good huh after

52 years the Blues finally and

triumphantly raised the Stanley Cup

that's amazing 52 years and you did it

in seven Camaro and the st. Louis Blues

amazing comeback reminds us to never

give up never lose faith never ever quit

just keep forging ahead you never know

just keep forging ahead but this team is

really exemplary starting a season so

badly where they were in last place and

people had written them off and I think

your fans are so loyal frankly they

don't stop coming Roy do they I don't

think so Josh they came anyway but they

probably sort of gave up they started

some of them but it's incredible think

of that so they had a record streak and

then all of a sudden they're in it and

then they win and they keep winning when

you work hard support each other believe

in yourself and give everything you've

got

victory is always within reach to the

st. Louis Blues congratulations again on

your unforgettable season that was

really a tremendous final incredible and

the thrilling Stanley Cup win and it's

now my honor to invite up the chairman
