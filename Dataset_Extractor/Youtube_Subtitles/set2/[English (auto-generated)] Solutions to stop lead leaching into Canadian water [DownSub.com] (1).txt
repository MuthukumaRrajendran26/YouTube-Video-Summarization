we begin with our ongoing investigation

into led in drinking water in some

Canadian cities and towns tonight we're

looking at how you can protect yourself

the investigation by global news in our

media partners found hundreds of

thousands of Canadians may be exposed to

high lead levels at home and in schools

and daycares you won't know if your

water is unsafe until it's tested

something you can do yourself if lead is

present you can buy filters to remove it

to fully solve the problem ageing lead

pipes need to be removed and replaced

but a patchwork of municipal regulations

means there's no uniform solution for

homeowners

Heather York's West looks at how some

cities are now tackling the problem hi

Monica

when Monica Behr agreed to let

journalists test her homes water for

lead she was stunned by what they found

at 19 parts per billion bears water was

almost four times what Health Canada

considers safe we immediately started

taking certain measures I actually did

some more research online along with

using a filter Bayer paid $8,000 to have

her lead pipes replaced there's a

international consensus now you have to

take the lead out so the first action is

to take the lead pipes and the lead

components out of the houses but pipes

are generally a light gray in color and

easily scratch but it's not enough for

homeowners to replace their own pipes if

the water is coming from lead service

lines owned by cities and this is where

that replacement projects become tricky

cities like Calgary for example will

only replace public pipes if homeowners

agree to replace their own two if they

won't let pipes remain but cities like

Saskatoon and Montreal on the other hand

are giving homeowners no choice so now

we're kind of switching gear and we will

be doing all the alder work sending the

bill to house owners buy them by after

that and they will have up to 15 years

to pay us back

the lead part is just this little Katy

Gibbs has led pipes in her Ottawa home

as well she's looked into replacing them

but the cost was too high it's a huge

huge job like it's not just like

replacing a pipe but it's it's like

tearing

your whole driveway instead Gibbs has

often to filter her water a less

expensive option and in some

municipalities like Montreal and Toronto

the city provides a filter for free

cities can also lower that levels by

protecting lead pipes from corrosion the

city of Toronto has added orthophosphate

to its water since 2014

what auto phosphate does is it provides

a lining on pipes that are that have led

and prevent further leaching of lead

into the water but it takes a little

time to build up in 2008 the average

water sample from a Toronto home

serviced by underground led pipes was

measuring more than double national

safety guidelines of five parts per

billion

a decade later average measurements have

fallen from nearly 12 parts per billion

to just over 1 but experts like Michelle

Prevot warn corrosion control is not a

permanent solution we know now as long

as there's let there we will not be able

to control it and we have to take it up

with her waters LED levels now well

below Health Canada guidelines

Monica bare says she's glad her LED

pipes are gone is peace of mind that was

worth the cost
