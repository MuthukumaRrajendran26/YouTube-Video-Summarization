with protesters on one side of the

footbridge and a police truck on the

other a volley of Molotov cocktails are

thrown at one armored vehicle engulfing

it in flames its retreat is a small

victory for demonstrators we're using

Hong Kong's Polytechnic University as

their base demonstrators have resorted

to rudimentary weapons like homemade

slingshots and bow and arrows on the

ground a police official was struck in

the leg by one arrow prompting a threat

from law enforcement to use increased

force we will have no choice under the

circumstance but to use real bullets in

self-defense

says this Police Superintendent and it

wouldn't be the first time nearly a week

ago a 21 year old protester was shot at

nearly point-blank range Sunday a local

activist tweeted a photo of what appears

to be a police officer holding an

automatic weapon a sign of escalation

according to this human rights advocate

that bodies of young people have been

found at the bottom of tall buildings

and all these are just you know signs

that the Hong Kong Police are prepared

to severely crackdown on the civil

society a spokesperson from Global

Affairs Canada says the Canadian

government is concerned by the recent

violence in Hong Kong adding the right

to peaceful assembly is a fundamental

freedom these demonstrations started

nearly six months ago as a protest

against mainland China's proposed

extradition law which many saw as

infringement on Hong Kong's autonomy

under the one country two systems'

principle the super power eventually

relented but protesters feel they're now

fighting against what they see as

China's attempt to re-establish its grip

on the territory it's why some are

calling on Western countries to do more

including the sanctioning of key

officials responsible for the violation

of human rights in Hong Kong in order to

prevent a second Tiananmen Massacre

from happening there and that is a very

real possibility with police threatening

to use real bullets on protesters my
