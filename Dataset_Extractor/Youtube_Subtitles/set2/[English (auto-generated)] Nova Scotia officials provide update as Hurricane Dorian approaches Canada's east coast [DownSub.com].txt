good afternoon everybody my name is

inspector dawn Moser representing health

nitrogen please i want to thank you all

for coming today and this critical

public safety message one who makes sure

that everybody sort of leaves here today

understanding and appreciating that's a

health action Regional Police and very

well-prepared I've been through work ups

through this week and have the very

solid preparedness model and that in no

small part working very closely in in

partnership with with the RCMP all of

the HR and business units and

specifically e mo we want to ensure that

we all speak with the United voice and

underpin the safety aspects related to

to this event encourage the public and

can't be kept me anymore direct on this

to ensure to hear following a local

direction is so authorities that that if

there is barricaded road closures

there's any restricted areas it sections

four-way stops becomes a four-way stop

that you're following the rules

and that you're placing yourself in the

best position possible so our role is

the policing agency will very much

continue on in the aftermath of

Hurricane Dorian

Public Safety is their first priority so

it's it's critical actually that's an

folks take no chances hunker down listen

to your messaging be prepared keep

yourself safe keep your staff and family

say so thank you very much

good afternoon everyone I'm going to

echo my colleagues messaging and saying

that safety is the primary concern for

the Nova Scotia RCMP for the public and

for our employees as the provincial

police we have worked with communities

and organizations from across the

province and we are continually

monitoring the storm as it progresses

and any potential impacts that it's

going to have again our excellent

relationships with our public safety

partners with our communities has

enabled us to put plans in place and

coordinate the planning for this storm

over the past week we do have several

contingency plans already in place to

ensure we can maintain appropriate

levels of service and respond to

situations as needed for the duration of

the storm and for after as well

communication is going to continue to be

critical to make sure that we can make

situational changes and adjustments to

our service delivery is necessary we

have called in additional resources to

our operational communication center and

we have additional resources at the

ready if need be so again we would like

to stress to the public safety is the

primary concern hair stay off the roads

listen to the public officials and their

instructions and would like to thank our

colleagues for the part their support

and participation in the planning of

this event

I'll add the Canadian Red Cross voice to

the preparedness message and that people

should be paying attention to all of the

alerts and notifications from emergency

officials we are opening shelters as we

speak in Halifax at the Canada Game

Center the st. Margaret Centre and the

Dartmouth East Community Center

volunteers across Nova Scotia and the

rest of Atlantic Canada are on standby

to respond and we will support

communities that are impacted by this

disaster we've been working closely with

our partners within Nova Scotia and

certainly HRM and other municipalities

across the province to prepare for this

storm good afternoon everybody my name

is Erika Fleck on behalf of HRM I feel

that we are completely prepared as much

as we can be for this storm we have

front loaders as much as we can in the

lines of supplies and our readiness and

we've been working on this for days with

all of our partners here in the room and

then across so the cooperation that

we've had this past week in preparing

has been phenomenal and we've taken our

lessons learned from Hurricane Juan and

all the other events realized what went

wrong and what we could have improved on

and those were the first things that we

fixed to get ready for durian so I feel

that we're in a very good place with

regards to citizen safety I can't stress

that enough just like everyone else here

is done this morning we are urging

citizens to make sure that they are you

know they have everything at home

squared away we've been stressing all

week in our public service announcements

about securing their belongings outside

taking down those patio umbrellas their

furniture kids toys outside and then

we've been getting complaints today and

notifications about lumber material left

unattended construction sites unsecured

so those are a big concern right now

we've been working with our policing

partners all morning trying to identify

companies and reaching out to them so I

would urge people to continue to call in

to us through 3-1-1 and other means you

know let people know and police have

been engaged but I would also you know

put a push out there to the to the

public that you know if you see these

things these these are big concerns

right now it's the items across the

municipality again those large lumber

parts ladders that are unsecured that

really what the hurricane-force winds

that we are

affecting that could be extremely

dangerous we also as a Red Cross

representative said we have asked the

province earlier in the week to open

those shelters for us and we are urging

the citizens in the communities right

along the coastal properties of HRM to

look at if you have nowhere else to go

with family or friends then please self

evacuate you know yourself where you

live again those tides are expected to

come in 10 to 12 meters which is 50 feet

that's a lot of water coming on your

property and we want people to remain

safe to remain safe pardon me we're also

asking the downtown business court to

close early

so we've contacted a lot of them the

message is getting out there we're

asking them to close early no later than

5:00 p.m. this evening so then not only

the staff can get home safely but we do

not want the citizens of Halifax roaming

downtown you know the water's coming in

we all learned our lessons during

Hurricane Juan and we really want people

to remain safe thank you so we do have

time for questions so what I'd like you

to do is as you're asking your question

please identify who you're asking you to

and they'll come in and and make sure

they're answering your question at the

microphone so that everyone can hear

that is correct so at this time I mean

again the residents know themselves they

know their property so we would

recommend that they self evacuate if

they have nowhere else to go but we are

really concerned like I said with the

with the waves coming up in the storm

surge that we are expecting the good

news about this storm although I said 10

to 12 meter waves we it is coming in at

low tide and should that shift at all

and it comes in at high tide then we can

expect you know much bigger and

worsening conditions along the coast so

that is our biggest concern with the

people that live out that way is we urge

you you know your property and how close

you are to the water and if you do not

feel it is safe then please move

yourself to somewhere where it is safe

on the inland

this time we're gonna defer any further

questions to our communications

department at nova scotia power

we're fully staffed at the shelters with

volunteers for the next 24 to 48 72

hours and we can house dozens and dozens

of people we've got all our cost

blankets and and supplies in place now

at all three locations we've got more in

our warehouse in Dartmouth and Turo as

well if we need to move more we're

prepared at the moment for 60 at each

location with pre position supplies to

move in to either vista shelters if

maybe they officially opened at noon so

i don't know we were on our way down

here and i don't know if anything open

it anyone had showed up by then i did

hear from our call center in saint john

new brunswick just before i came down

and and they said it has been quiet so

far

yeah so we know we needed to be better

prepared for municipal staff in order to

respond to the needs of the citizens so

that was our biggest focus very early on

is to make sure as a municipality that

all of our business units were ready

we've been exercising hurricane

scenarios ironically enough that were

supposed to hit on the 7th of September

and so we've made you know huge strides

working collectively across all business

units making sure that all of our

generators have been currently tested

all our fuel capacities are topped up

that we know what you know our entire

inventory of emergency supplies are we

front loaded as much as we can for

emergency water we know that we're going

to have power outages and where we were

concerned one of the lessons from

hurricane Juan is that we couldn't get

water quick enough to residents with

that what residents that are on wells

the so we know when they lose power that

they will not have running water

so we've already pre positioned a large

quantity of water in strategic locations

throughout the municipality so that we

can respond very early to the needs of

the citizens and that there will be no

waiting period yes

[Music]

we do we have just under a thousand

volunteers that are that we have that we

know of that we use quite frequently

between ground search and rescue teams

are joint emergency management teams

that are all on standby right now and

they put on the ready for the past 24

hours and they are prepared to help us

in any way shape or form we know that

we're gonna have to open comfort centers

in the days to come which is a municipal

resource that we have and we will be

doing that in the days to come in the

areas that do need them the most

we do have at-risk populations and so

we've already reached out to those so

nursing homes they have their own

emergency plans we've touched base with

them special care facilities we're in

constant contact with them and you know

other places like that but we have a

very good Emergency Management Network

that we utilize quite frequently and

especially in with this storm and we

have constant communications back and

forth

so I mean without going door-to-door we

know the population base as a whole we

when we've drawn the circle around it in

the Peggy's Cove you know Aereo that way

it's about 700 in the Eastern Passage if

you took the entire Eastern Passage you

know the whole coast along there it's

10,000 and then on the eastern shore

we're looking at about 3,000 people a

story 3,000 oh yeah yes not yet no well

we are just trying to be more proactive

we don't will you rather be proactive at

this point than reactive so that's why

we've been working together all morning

going out to those police have been

contacting them and we've had great

success so far that the contractors are

actually sending in crews to clean up

their sites we could do that if we if we

enacted a state of local emergency then

we could do mandatory evacuations but

we're not there at this point

sorry at this time we're deferring

questions to our communications

department at nova scotia power so i

will be providing a contact number for

the media line for nova scotia power

unfortunately CEO Karen Hutt is at the

at the novice kosha power center so she

will be available via phone I will

provide that number so the biggest thing

is what we call a flying object debris

so people who have unsecured things in

their home you know I saw a basketball

and that's still there on my way to work

this morning you know when I moved

personally you know stuff is gonna blow

pretty quick so flower pots like I said

umbrellas patio furniture kids toys left

out you know I have a video of in a

country I was in once and you know those

hobby horses on a stick and I saw one of

those fly through a window and all that

was left was the horse head sticking out

on the other side it was like an imp a

l'heure so I mean you know people that

need to understand in category category

one force wins those objects can become

very dangerous so again you know I

stress the the loose debris that's

laying around the construction materials

a ladder things that are going to go

flying pretty quickly and 140 150

kilometer hour winds

so we that's why we made the call early

and we put out those public service

announcements in the past 48 hours so

that people would have time to plan and

we really feel that because we did that

early and that's again lessons learned

from Hurricane Juan and other storms

that businesses like the mall shut down

and they made that notification

yesterday so we really feel that because

we had that ode early that businesses

have been planning and that's why we're

urging again the downtown core to shut

early so that people can get home there

are of course taxis and we would hope

that people would be off the road to be

home safe with their families

so what is your specific question like

we know the storm surge is coming on the

water so we actually we're having a

teleconference later on today to confirm

that we're looking for very specific

data for HRM and I don't have the answer

right now but we can follow up on that

but we know right now like I said it's

coming in our last notification was that

because the storm is coming in at low

tide that we were lucky that it was

going to be a 10 to 12 meter waves which

is 50 feet so we just need to reconfirm

that track and look at the storm surge

again before we send out any further

PSAs so the bridges will close to

high-sided vehicles at 80 kilometres an

hour and they will shut down completely

over a hundred so again people can

anticipate that both bridges will be

closed at some point today tonight thank

you all for coming over the next few

hours next few days will continues in

this locations to provide media update

the province will be sending out

bulletins throughout the day as needed

so it will be a regular I believe you've

all gotten the first one again we'll be

using this location there is a contact

number on the provincial bulletin that

we sent out so feel free to call our

media center we're upstairs

if you need anything from us thank you

Oh
