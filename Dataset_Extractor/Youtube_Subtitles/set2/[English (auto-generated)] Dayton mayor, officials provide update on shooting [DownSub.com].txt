Brown and then you guys ready

hello this is Anne Anne Whaley mayor of

Dayton Ohio I think this is our fourth

press conference of the day and I've

seen some of you at every single one of

them so appreciate your diligence and

getting the word out and getting the

correct information now too from your

news outlets when it introduced who's

with me

this afternoon city manager Shelly

Dickstein a US senator sherrod Brown

u.s. senator Rob Portman deputy chief

Matt Carper state representative Phil

Plummer and former County Sheriff and

Congressman Mike Turner so I just want

to take a moment to talk about the

outpouring of support we've seen across

the country today at a moment I think

I've had over 70 mayors and from across

the country reach out particularly of

been upheld have been Buddy Dyer of

Orlando who had to work with his

community through the polls night club

Mayor Bill Peduto of Pittsburgh

obviously with the Tree of Life

synagogue

mayor Cranley of Cincinnati has been

helpful and mayor Jayne caster who's the

new mayor of Tampa who is a former

police chief honestly I have to say that

unfortunately because we have so many of

these incidences there is a bevy of

mayors that are able to give great

advice and feedback I think that's quite

frankly a little sad if you think about

it that they've learned so much because

all of their communities have gone

through these terrible mass shootings

that today at two o'clock I was very

appreciative that senators Brown senator

Portman and congressman Turner as well

as US attorney Ben glass man the FBI and

ATF came together for a briefing with

Chief Beale and Chief Carper we then

walked the scene of the of the site in

the Oregon district so the senators and

congressmen could get a good sense of

exactly what happened on the ground and

I want to say how much I appreciate

their support and their calls and what

can I do questions during this day it's

meant a lot to me personally and I know

it's been a lot to the citizens of

Dayton with that I'd like to invite

senator share

Brown to come forward and say a few

words Thank You mayor um this is

obviously a terribly difficult time for

this community and I so appreciate

especially police and fire and the

rescue operations how quickly the police

department police officers on the scene

so courageously stood up and and did the

right thing and saved literally

potentially hundreds of lives with the

amount of ammunition the shooter had and

how quickly they responded in how and

what a short period of time from the

first shot to the last shot so it really

does tell me a lot about local public

servants police and fire and rescue

operations we had the mayor tells us 20

I believe 2020 first responders from the

region came in addition to the six or

seven from the city of Dayton that

arrived all within 20 minutes to save

lives so that's what that's what local

communities do which come together like

this the mayor took us all to walk

through the Oregon district it's the

it's in many ways the the the center of

Dayton in terms of evenings and small

businesses every single business in that

area just about is locally owned and

with the vibrancy of local ownership and

what that means and they're all coming

together as they will tonight the vigil

but for the next many days the way the

Dayton came together after the tornado

and after him in dealing with the KKK

rally a few weeks ago my first talk with

the mayor today the first thing she told

me other than expressing the the grief

and the heartache of this community was

how how she had gotten literally dozens

of texts emails in phone calls from

mayor's around the country almost all of

whom have had something like this happen

in their communities and so our first

our first response I'll speak for myself

counties in my first response of course

is sadness and hearts and pin prayers in

thoughts for families and the community

overall including police and fire and

how they respond to this in the

weeks ahead from the trauma that they've

seen as public servants my next thought

was anger at our country in society in

our Congress for not doing anything

about this the House Representatives

passed a bill to do background checks

overwhelmingly bipartisan ly I'm I've

called on Senator McConnell to bring the

Senate back into session we can pass

that in one afternoon background checks

the president United States could sign

it that day

there's just no reason we shouldn't be

doing that so we certainly pray for the

victims and care about the victims but

Congress needs to do something our state

legislature again woefully inadequate in

dealing with gun violence also needs to

react and respond in the right way so

that these incidents just don't happen

week after week after week after week in

our country I'd like to inter invite

senator Portman to come forward to say a

few words that Senator Brown came from

Cleveland Sandra Portman came from

Cincinnati and just completely amazed by

people coming here to get here as soon

as possible

the Miami Valley is in mourning today

after the tragedy of last night's

shooting we did walk down to the Oregon

district and we saw what has been a

thriving commercial section of the city

and and so lots of great small

businesses we also saw workers in hazmat

suits

these were ms personnel who were having

to clean the blood off the sidewalk from

the tragedy of last night shocking

shocking unspeakable tragic we also seen

this community respond as they will for

the victims for the mothers and fathers

and sons and daughters who were struck

down last night and those who were

injured we've seen it here in this

community just since May with the KKK

rally we've seen it as this community

came together after the devastating

hurricanes which you know is still an

ongoing project but I've talked to the

mayor a lot about this and mayor Willie

knows that I'm impressed with what I've

seen is how this community comes

together and responds and we saw it last

night with these brave police officers

who in the face of danger ran straight

in straight into it you'll learn more

about this at 4 o'clock and all I can

say is because we're not at liberty to

talk about it and I think it's

appropriate that law enforcement provide

the perspective that you need on this

but this courage was extraordinary and

saved lives probably hundreds of lives

given the situation

there is also an effort going on in the

community that I hope everybody will

support which is through the date and

Community Foundation and it's called the

Oregon district tragedy fund it's a fund

that's been set up to help the victims

again this community comes together I'll

be making a contribution to it I'm sure

everyone will behind me and I know this

movie is going to come together and help

these victims those who are injured the

families of those who lost lives so this

is this is a tragedy that requires that

kind of response my colleague senator

Brown has talked about legislation we

should also of course as we figure out

what happened here learn lessons from it

just as we need to learn lessons from

others and are there more things that

can be done I'm sure there are but I

will say there's something deeper going

on here

and if you look at the suicide rates if

you look at the addiction rates this

communities got a good job and

responding to it but it's been at Ground

Zero in terms of the opioid crisis as

well if you look at the mental health

crisis in our country today there aren't

enough laws and in fact no law can

correct some of the more fundamental

cultural problems we face today as a

country and the shooting last night is

an indication of that so I look forward

to working together with my colleagues

to try to respond the most effective way

possible but we also have looked deep

into our hearts and figure out how could

someone point a gun at someone who he

had never seen or known and pull the

trigger thank you

next I appreciate the Senators donation

to the fund that the Dayton foundation

has put together I know that our

community comes together and I know that

this will be no different

as the other episodes we've had in the

past few months next I'd like to invite

congressman Turner to come forward to

say a few words appreciate him calling

me this morning and appreciate him being

here as well

congressman Turner I want to thank the

mayor for her leadership on this day of

sadness for our community this is a

strong community and appreciate the

mayor working diligently to pull

everyone together also I want to thank

and congratulate the the mayor and the

police chief on the police presence that

was in the Oregon district last night it

was extraordinary that they were able to

respond so quickly as a result of the

police's actions my daughter and

hundreds others who were down in the

oregon district last night are alive and

and are safe today I also want to thank

the first responders and the the police

and fire who came to the scene and

responded unbelievably for our community

this is an unbelievable amount of evil

that we cannot comprehend I appreciate

the mayor pulling us together for a

briefing today on the investigation

that's ongoing we'll learn more about

this particular case but senator Brown

is absolutely corrected as sort of

deportment as we look across the country

and we see this we need a national

conversation as to how we come together

on a bipartisan basis to address this

legislation culturally as a country I

think the mayor for pulling us together

and for her diligent work to try to find

answers for the community and also for

the work last night that kept so many

safe

next a state representative we used to

call him Sheriff Phil Plummer I wanted

to say a few words thanks mayor and

again thank you for your leadership here

we've had some rough times in a city of

Dayton but you've really you know you

met the challenge and you've led the

city so thank you for your hard work in

your efforts here so let the citizens

know you have a great Police Department

a great fire department here you know I

went toward the crime scene with

everybody behind me here and I was

hoping as my last crime scene I toured

but we're back in action but walking

away from a crime scene you know I could

stick my chest out and I'm very proud of

our first responders they they answered

the call you know they ran towards a gun

fire you even you're up against weapons

like that it's tough on those guys and

they made the call and they took care of

business so thank them when you see him

you know we can't give him enough

rewards because they saved a lot of

people last night Fire Department you

guys did a great job in our County

dispatch center they get overwhelmed

with you know mass situations like this

so they did a tremendous job also so

guys let's not this lets us keep us down

like I said we had a rough year but we

always bounce back we're a resilient

community we're in the game we're in the

fight and we need to figure this out so

let me ask you guys this I'm not gonna

get into policy discussions but we the

people make the call we don't work for

special interest groups we work for the

people so let's sit down and let's

figure out a solution to this you know

its mental health its guns there's a lot

of variables here but we got to figure

this out so guys thanks for covering

this and let's stay strong Dayton we're

in the game here thank you

okay.i Deputy Chief Carper will come

forward to give any new information he

may have I think it'll be pretty brief

since we will have such a detailed

briefing at four o'clock yeah Thank You

Marion thank you for everyone's patience

we do have a comprehensive look at this

coming up here at four o'clock the only

thing I will add right now we do have a

a lost-and-found that's can be

established at the Safety Building

downtown 335 West 3rd Street that's the

city of Dayton Police Department

headquarters beginning at 10 o'clock

tomorrow morning there were a lot of

items that were left in the organ

district so if you could spread the word

to the public if any items were left

they can come and retrieve those

beginning tomorrow morning thank you all

right questions

are you asking me well I will answer

than anyone else can answer though the

word I used for Dayton is it has grit

and I think that that is a word that

describes what is this community has

been through with for the past 50 years

the grit of the changing economy the

grit when stuff tough things happen they

come together there's resilience and

grit but I think that that is what makes

us so strong and continues to make us

resilient and so I'm proud I think that

that describes Dayton and its people in

a way that I'm very very proud of

any comment you know we need to do

what's right

you know civilians walking around by the

armor we call that clues so you know why

doesn't something that body armor you

know somebody is not acting right and

they have high-powered weapons reach out

to them I mean we all know when

somebody's having problems we have to be

a community and support people let's

start doing what's right you know you

watch some of the news conferences from

the shooters neighborhood and they kind

of said the guy had some problems but we

fail to step up and do what's right and

address those problems you know the guy

made he need somebody to help him out

give him a hand up so you know something

doesn't seem right make a call call the

police that's what we're here for cost

yeah we have professionals here

counselors you know if it if it didn't

right just reach out to us the former

sheriff said that sort of questioned

civilians whirring body armor like that

wearing those vests ballistic vests and

I say the same about civilians buying

assault weapons we we try and experiment

this country from the mid 90s to the mid

next decade for about ten years of a ban

on assault weapons and it didn't didn't

get every assault weapon off the street

but it did make a difference and there

are probably hundreds if not thousands

of people alive today it might not have

been alive if we hadn't passed if we

hadn't had a law prohibiting the

purchase of assault weapons and those

weapons don't follow they're not weapons

for hunting we don't question people

having a condo hunt we don't question

people having a gun to protect

themselves but civilians carrying

assault weapons and it just again speaks

to the courage of the police department

with pistols or other weapons but

nothing like taking on a guy with an

assault weapon and why do we put our

police in that situation to where where

civilians carry these weapons of war and

it's it's an unfair match by by any

stretch

well as I said earlier I think it

requires a comprehensive approach

because the tragedies you're talking

about each is different and we don't

know all the facts here yet but what we

do know which I've seen in public

reports so I can I can say this he shot

his sister we know that in a short

period of time and you'll find out the

exact period of time at four o'clock I

won't tell you but I'll just tell you in

that short period of time they were

there was a burst and I've seen public

reporting on that as to how many shots

were fired if that's true that magazine

of course would be illegal so there's a

law so do I need more laws yeah we

probably do and we did just pass no

plain last year 2018 to tighten the

background checks and I think there's a

consensus now that we need background

checks to make sure the wrong people

don't have access to weapons you'll

learn more at four o'clock about whether

he would have been caught up in that

background check or not but my point is

it's not just about laws it's about

something deeper and mental health was

recent was mentioned earlier we have a

crisis in this country there's no

question about it you know people have

talked about the depths of despair and

they talk about the suicide rates they

talk about the addiction rates and they

talk about the mental health issues that

are causing some of these so this is a

broader discussion that needs to be had

and I you know I hope but when we get

back we will have that discussion and

we'll have it at the state level we'll

have it at every level but we also have

to have it in our communities and in our

homes and in our hearts and former

sheriff now representative Plummer

talked about that you know in almost

every one of these cases there is as you

look back on it some indication of a

mental health problem in some cases

actually there have been investigations

of individuals that unfortunately did

not result in that person

you know being treated the way he or she

should have been I you know parkland is

an example that we don't know in this

case yet enough but again from public

reporting and what former sheriff now

representative just told us there were

indications apparently so how do we how

do we in terms of prevention how do we

actually identify those individuals get

them the help they need which is mental

health treatment which is sometimes with

these red flag laws and other things to

literally keep them in a situation where

they can't harm others sometimes that

means incarcerated so there are there

are needs for us to look at this and on

a broader basis what Senator Portman was

saying this is very difficult of

legislative issue that's why I think we

need a national conversation the

legislation that was passed in the house

that's currently pending it in the

Senate would not have affected this

situation senator Portman pointed out

that the in in Ohio also the magazine

that was used is already illegal there

there there has to be though a

legislative broader conversation where

we can find where we can have have an

impact I think what the sheriff is

saying is also incredibly important and

if there's a neighbor or a friend who

who you believe poses a risk take that

first step the if it's unthinkable for

us how how quickly our own families

become a so at risk and this is why this

is so important for us to pick up the

phone say there's a problem I say that

there there's an individual who appears

to not only be a threat but perhaps have

weapons or caches to the extent that

that they have nefarious intent I think

that the the former sheriff that's the

episode of has a great call to the

community that if you see something say

something

okay we're gonna we're gonna take like

one more question yes

yeah we'll present that at 4 o'clock and

I think we're actually getting ready for

the four o'clock briefing so rather than

put you off to four o'clock maybe we

should put it off to four o'clock and so

we can present what we have and that'll

answer a lot of questions and I just

want to thank the senators and

congressmen for coming to this evening

and the site this afternoon and

appreciate and I'll see you guys before

I'm just grabbing my mic sorry

you
