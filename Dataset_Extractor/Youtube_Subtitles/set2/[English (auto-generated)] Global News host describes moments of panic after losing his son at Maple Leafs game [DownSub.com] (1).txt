well with all adventures ahead at fairs

festivals and sports games big crowds of

course can be a scary situation for

those with children especially young

ones who like to wander off all right

but there are ways you can keep your

children close and of course safe the

most important parenting expert Alison

chafer joins us now with some of our

tips good morning Alison always great to

see you good morning

so the background the catalyst for this

was my recent experience at a Leafs game

and myself got getting separated from my

son and it was the simplest reason why

because he thought I was somebody else

this man was wearing the same shirt and

shoes as you and just assumed but

actually walked out of the stadium and

then Tilda he saw the guy's face it was

like he was really locked out look it

was a terrifying moment there's no

question about that but it was a

reminder to have a plan and we had a

plan and we executed it thank goodness

but during those moments of panic did

you forget about a plan no but you don't

know what's gonna happen like you don't

know you're just trying to find them I

might I every parent has a story of this

you know and I did too and you really do

think the worst immediately of course

and you gotta know that if we're adults

and we're that panicked what's it like

to be a child that how old's your son

he's nine years old yeah my daughter was

three so you know we probably all had a

story so I mean the first thing is to

start early right too early what so even

at three I could have talked to my

daughter about just general safety tips

and what I mean by that is even just

going to the grocery store you need to

be able to see mommy I need to be able

to see you if you go to the park you

need to stay with me I always need to

know where you are those are small

safety tips but we these are skills that

sort of escalate and compound into

something that's more complicated as

they get older so like I have three kids

12 nine and now four I haven't had the

conversation with youngsters you do

everything with the first not maybe the

last how much information do you tell

them as to why that's necessary because

don't you find sometimes it's like in

one ear out the other so many rules in

the house so do what do you say why less

rules that's that's part of why they a

fog out yeah when you just say this is

for safety good enough if t I think if

someone might pluck you out and yeah I

don't think we need to tell

little kids about that I think what we

want them to do is to have a feeling

that life is safe okay so next thing is

so we get lost if we get lost and you

can't see mommy or I can't see you what

are we gonna do about this even a

three-year-old you can say you need to

go to a helper okay so people are our

friends think of Mister Rogers right

people are nice people are helpers but

the best helpers are the ones who work

where you are so look for somebody in a

uniform look for somebody who's behind

the till because those people actually

have access to being able to call

security and make an announcement over

the mall or over the sports people

they've got way more resources to

actually reconnect you to your parents

so start saying who's a helper can you

identify a helper that's right that lady

works at the checkout it's a game you

play well yeah actually it's absolutely

themselves okay and again chances are if

you get separated your child is gonna

end up crying and look a little bit

panicked and most people are gonna come

up and say can I help you what's wrong

have you lost your parents most people

are good and kind hearted I know that's

not where our minds go but the truth is

resources and people are gonna be there

to help you get reunited with your child

for older kids so once I get older if

they could actually remember I mean at

nine we would hope that he remembered

your phone number and he did and that

was the key remembering and going

through it and reminding them this is my

phone number this is mommy's phone

number tell me what it is really on cue

and that was the most important thing

right we have ours to a song so I go

there a song and they know it and so

they love it forget it everything that's

on real I mean look I sing it cuz I

don't wanna give up my phone number on

TV but yeah they memorize the song well

let's find something else for her to

sing yeah remember because we want to

get through these if kids can't remember

the phone number write it on a piece of

paper stick it in their pocket say you

know what we've always got your phone

number you can always reach and kids are

always on phone and tech but that's like

not a weird thing that's got a

frightening thing for them pull it out

and another thing is just to teach them

certain rules are non-negotiable again

we're talking about safety no you know

what if we want to go to this we need to

hold hands cuz not all kids like to hold

hands I'm sorry no if you want to go to

the washroom you got to come with mommy

another even if though your boy we got

to be together you gotta come to the

girls washroom the last one quick meetup

spot yes let them know if we get

separated by meeting at this pole we're

meeting at this garbage bin identified

as checkout yep so real quick I've wrote

an article it's on global news dossier

check it's also on my Twitter page Thank

You Alyson as all clothes
