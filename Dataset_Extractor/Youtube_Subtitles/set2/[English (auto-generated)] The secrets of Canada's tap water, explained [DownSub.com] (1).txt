it's a public health crisis of massive

proportions you've probably heard about

the water crisis in Flint Michigan it's

possible every single person living in

Flint may have been exposed to lead

through the city's contaminated water

supply the state knew about it and did

nothing the water supply in Flint

Michigan has sparked outrage across the

country in Canada people are also

unknowingly consuming dangerous amounts

of lead from their drinking water in

some cities lead levels were found to be

comparable to those of Flint at the

height of its water crisis we're

probably talking about hundreds of

thousands of people in the population of

Canada that right now every time they

open their taps there's there's a good

chance that they're getting a little bit

of lead coming out of that pipe

Canadians are not being informed on when

lead levels are high not only in their

homes but in their schools and daycares

that's Mike and Megan they've been part

of this huge year-long investigation

that has involved around a hundred and

thirty University students and

journalists who have all been

investigating lead contaminated water in

Canada I think people are completely in

the dark let has been mined for

thousands of years it was used in

ancient Rome to make water pipes because

the metal is flexible highly corrosion

resistant and cheap lead pipes continued

to be used around the world for

centuries and eventually lead was added

to other common products like gasoline

and paint it wasn't until the mid 20th

century that people started to notice

that it was making everyone really sick

lead exposure and children has been

linked to behavioral problems and a loss

of IQ in adults it can cause high blood

pressure heart disease kidney disease

and reduced fertility ongoing exposure

to even low levels of lead can be toxic

I would say up until the 1970s a lot of

our major cities were still using lead

pipes and putting them into the ground

in the 1970s we started banning lead

which is why there has been a steady

decline in lead blood levels since lead

is one that I think a lot of people

thought was a solved problem but it's

not

there are two ways lead is getting into

people's drinking water the first is

that old lead pipes are aging water is

naturally corrosive and causes pipes to

break down over time allowing lead to

seep into people's water they were

largely used not as part of the city's

main distribution network but rather the

portion of the lines that connect the

water mains to the properties you might

live in an old home and you may have

replaced your pipes but it doesn't mean

that you're free and in the clear unless

the city's replace their portion of the

lead service line - you know one of the

people we interviewed said just imagine

drinking your water with a 30-foot lead

straw the second way is through acidic

source water which is any water that has

a pH level below 7 it can cause lead to

leach into the water from either pipes

containing lead or lead soldering lead

is measured in parts per billion Health

Canada's guideline for acceptable lead

levels in drinking water is 5 parts per

billion

but both Health Canada and the World

Health Organization agreed that there is

no safe level of lead in the way some

cities are testing for lead is

problematic - in some places when

officials are testing for lead they do

what's called a flush test where you let

taps run for five minutes before

gathering a water sample that's not

actually how you drink the water so it

might not be an accurate description of

what your lead levels are gonna look

like when you are taking that first

glass of water in the morning it's a

test designed to identify whether

there's a problem in the city's water

but it's not gonna capture what we need

to know for Public Health

even based on flush tests lead levels in

Montreal still reached an average

comparable to levels in Flint when

similar testing was done there in Prince

Rupert British Columbia and three cities

in Saskatchewan the investigation found

that average lead levels exceeded Health

Canada's guideline of five parts per

billion you know in Montreal like people

who are getting tested by the city they

were told because of the testing method

used that they had a low level or an

acceptable level and then we went back

and tested

with different methods that are that are

recommended by Health Canada and we

found much higher level so I think it's

a it's an issue about transparency

versus secrecy there's no real federal

oversight on lead levels in water Health

Canada has set its limit

but then leaves it up to the provinces

to enforce them and that's why we're

having discrepancies in different cities

across the country where there's one

quality in this city versus another

quality in another city and only Ontario

makes data on lead levels public nothing

currently requires provinces to share

testing data with residents and often

they don't everybody has the right to

know exactly what's in their drinking

water especially if it is deemed unsafe

one of the things that cities are doing

right now is adding something called

ortho phosphate to their drinking water

essentially it's an anti corrosive and

it coats pipes over time so if you do

have lead pipes it's kind of mitigating

any issue that you might have with your

drinking water which means that more

lead service lines aren't being replaced

because ortho phosphate is actually

doing its job in some cases cities are

offering free filters whether it's a

water water pitcher with a with a

special filter for lead or whether it's

a filter you can add on to your tap the

ultimate solution all the experts have

told us you have to replace the lead

pipes but ripping pipes out of the

ground is expensive and in most places

officials wouldn't even know where to

start there's no record of how many lead

pipes there are or where they are in any

given city it is costly it's gonna cost

homeowners that do this thousands of

dollars that they have to shell out of

their own pocket to replace their own

side of the service line and the same

for the city the city of Montreal just

announced that its total cost its

estimate for replacing its side of lead

service lines is now in the neighborhood

of half a billion dollars we were spoken

to a lot of experts for this story and

some of them are calling this a public

health crisis it's going to continue to

have long-term effects on Canadians and

I think people need to be held

accountable for what's actually

happening to people
