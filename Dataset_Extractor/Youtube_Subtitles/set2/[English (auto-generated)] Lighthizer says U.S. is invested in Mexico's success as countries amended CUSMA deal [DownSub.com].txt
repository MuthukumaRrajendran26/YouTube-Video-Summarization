well thank you very much let me say

first of all it's so honored to be here

with you mr. president this is the first

time that I've met you I bring the best

wishes of the President of the United

States to you personally but to all of

Mexico on a personal note we have

followed your career I find it to be

extraordinary everyone in our

administration is rooting for you and

before I get to my remarks I would say

one of the unspoken there one thought

about parts of this is that this

negotiation which is so important to our

region began in one administration and

was completed in another I think that's

a tribute to Mexico's government to your

system of government and to the Mexican

people I think it's also a testament to

you because in the middle of this

negotiation you were you were running

for election you took the high road the

road that was best for North America and

for Mexico

you never got involved in politics with

respect to this it was a very impressive

thing for all of us to watch and when

you were president-elect you you you

selected my good friend hey SUSE oughtta

you didn't select him because he was my

good friend but he was my good friend

and you said you come down here and

integrate in an ongoing negotiation

involving 1.4 trillion dollars and

outcome and I think the fact that you

did that is a it's a historic thing and

says an enormous about you no matter

about you mr. president so I just

sitting here thinking about how

important this is and what you

personally did at those three or four

times is amazing and I just wanted to

note

so it's a pleasure

obviously for me to be here this has

been a a two-year journey you know that

the United States and President Trump

viewed the old NAFTA as being a flawed

agreement it clearly was an agreement

that needed to be to be upgraded in very

important ways when you think of the

gadgets and the phones and the things

that we have none of which existed

Linda's went into effect and also over a

period of time every agreement gets

outmoded things happen that you don't

expect in the United States and the

president viewed it as a very unbalanced

agreement I think I don't want to dwell

on that but that's how we got here in

the first place but the president also

thought that having a strong North

American market was extremely important

to the United States it was the key to

having our workers our manufacturing

workers our farmers and our ranchers

succeed and prosper so he instructed all

of us in the administration he put me in

charge and then he put Jared in charge

of me

so there would be uh no misunderstanding

and I have I have the greatest team some

smart a small part of which you're here

my deputy CJ Mahoney and John Mele who's

our our professional chief negotiator

and and James Sinclair is my my chief of

staff and we spent hours and hours and

hours as Chrystia said we went up and we

went down we even fought if you can

imagine as hard hard to believe as that

may be

and the result I think is the best trade

agreement in history I think it's going

to do the most for manufacturing in this

region it's going to do the most for

farmers in this region it it's it's

digital trade and e-commerce provisions

are the gold standard there are none

better in the world and together

Chrystia my dear friend and and hey Zuzu

all of our teams did this and it's

something that's going to make North

erricka richer it's gonna make America

richer it's gonna make Canada richer and

it's gonna make Mexico richer the last

thing I would like to say is this we in

the United States have a stake in Mexico

being richer it's important for us that

Mexico succeed and I think this

agreement is going to make that more

likely I think the United States has a

partnership with both Canada and Mexico

which is unparalleled and it really is

our objective to have all of us be

better off this agreement is a is the

first truly bipartisan agreement in our

own our own parochial system the

president of the United States worked on

that the speaker worked on it

innumerable Democrats and Republicans

worked on it the labor unions were

involved business was involved in the

United States and it's nothing short of

a miracle that we have all come together

I think that's a testament to how good

the agreement is but perhaps more

importantly it's a testament to how long

it will last and how people will be

coming to North America and how vibrant

and economy this will be for all of us

so I've already spoken too long probably

I want to say again so that I am so

proud to be here and honored to be here

with the President of Mexico who is this

historic figure and I want to give my

best wishes again from the President on

States who is a truly historic figure

also

[Applause]
