good afternoon and thank you all so much

for taking a little time today to chat a

little bit about what happened last

night the reporting of the results and

circumstances surrounding the 2020 Iowa

Democratic Party caucuses were

unacceptable as chair of the party I

apologize deeply

for this last night we were faced with

multiple reporting challenges and

decided out of an abundance of caution

to protect the integrity of the Iowa

caucuses and their results by taking the

necessary steps to review and confirm

the data a thorough transparent an

independent examination of what occurred

yesterday will follow but let me be

clear my number one priority has been on

ensuring the accuracy and integrity of

the results and we have been working all

night to be in the best position to

report results in here in just a couple

of minutes we will be reporting 62% of

precincts from all 99 counties the

bottom line is that we hit a stumbling

block on the back end of the reporting

of the data but the one thing I want you

to know we know this data is accurate

and we also have a paper trail and

documentation that will that have been

able to use to provide information to

help verify the results this is personal

to me I'm a lifelong Iowa I have

caucused

for 20 years and I know how important it

is for to our party to our states and to

everyone from our neighbors to new

voters to be able to come together all

across the state we want Iowans to be

confident in the results and in the

process and we are going to take the

time that we need to make sure that we

do just that

so no folks are going to want to be

seeing the results as they come in

but I'm happy to take a couple of quick

questions before that happens we have

been working day and night to make sure

that these results are accurate the one

thing I will say is that the underlying

data the raw data is secure

it was always secure this was a coding

error in in one of the pieces on the

back end but the raw data the data that

has come in is secure and I can assure

islands of that the fact is is that this

is a conversation that happens every

four years there's no doubt that that

conversation will take place again but

right now my focus is making sure that

we get these results out we are going to

continue to do that and we will have the

results out as soon as we can job well

we're gonna take the time we need to get

these results done we're now that we

have the first batch that's going to be

coming out here in a couple of minutes

we're gonna continue to go through our

processes verifying everything but the

thing to remember here folks is that we

have a paper trail we have always said

all along that throughout this process

that we have backups to this system that

we have redundancies built-in and one of

the ways that we do that is through the

paper trail now the fact is is that as

we started doing this last night it took

longer than we expected and so but the

my paramount concern is making sure that

these results are accurate and reflect

what happened last night in caucuses

across the state we're gonna do just

that and that's we're gonna take the

time we need to do

we have one I have no knowledge of the

Department of Homeland Security making

that offer to us I will say that we have

worked with cybersecurity experts a

nationally renowned cybersecurity

experts to test this app and to do

testing and security checks on this app

so we have we took the steps we felt was

necessary but we found a coding error

last night once we discovered some

irregularities as the results started to

come back yeah what's that no there

weren't and that's why and that is why

the that's why what happened last night

is simply unacceptable and so again

we're going to have a thorough and

independent review of exactly what

happened last night

we still right now we're in the process

of making sure that we get these results

out and that's what we're gonna stay

focused on yeah we have said all along

that we were going to make these

caucuses the most transparent possible

this year we're reporting out more data

than we ever have reported before and in

addition to that we have paper trails

that we've never had before and so we're

gonna take the time we need to verify

these results but these results are

being based off what happened in the

precincts last night

when I ran for chair I made a commitment

to see the caucus process through that

is what I am working on that is what I

will continue to work on and whatever

happens after that was to be determined

anyways thank you all folks the results

are coming in we will see you later
