you all very much we're gonna spend a

lot of time with Australia today today's

are are a very special day for the

United States because we're honoring a

great ally and a great friend thank you

thank you would you like to say

something it's tremendous honor for

Australians for George and I to be here

with the president of mrs. Trump it's a

very gracious invitation but it's it's

an invitation that recognizes not just

you know the great relationship the

president I have been able to afford so

early but this goes back a long way this

relationship is the president often says

we've been a lot of battles and those

battles of course is what's happened in

the fields of conflict but we're

battling continuously for a prosperous

and a free world and we've never lost

and we've been great and we're going to

keep doing great because we had a kennel

this this partnership together and it's

a partnership where we both carry our

own weight as I said outside we look to

America but we we don't leave it to

America

what he was saying that we both would

like to see prosperous around we'd like

to see the people run well assertive

people right across the world to be able

to benefit from prosperous economies

doing well that's what we want this is

why Australian United States have always

worked so closely together is because

that's what we want for our own people

that's what we want for everyone and and

we've been speaking a lot about this

subject there two of us where I think we

have very similar views on the subject

it's a partisan whistle blow

shouldn't even have information I've had

conversations with many leaders that

always appropriate I think Scott can

tell you that always appropriate at the

highest level always appropriate and

anything I do I fight for this country I

fight so strongly for this country

it's just another political hack job it

doesn't matter what I discuss but I will

say this somebody ought to look into Joe

Biden's statement cuz it was disgraceful

where he talked about billions of

dollars that he's not giving to a

certain country unless a certain

prosecutor's taken off the case

so somebody ought to look into that and

you wouldn't because he's a Democrat and

the fake news doesn't look into things

like that it's a disgrace but I had a I

had a great conversation with numerous

people I don't even know exactly who

you're talking about but I had a great

conversation with numerous people

numerous leaders and I always look for

the conversation that's going to help

the United States the most that's very

important

I don't know the identity of the

whistleblower I just hear it say

partners in person meaning it comes out

from another party but I don't have any

idea but I can say that it was a totally

appropriate conversation it was actually

a beautiful conversation and this is no

different than you know the press is at

a very bad week with justice Cavanaugh

and all of those ridiculous charges and

all of the mistakes made at the New York

Times and other places you've had a very

bad week and this will be better than

all of them this is another one so keep

so keep so keep playing it up because

you're gonna look really bad when it

falls you know I guess I'm about I guess

I'm about 22 and oh and I'll keep it

that way I don't want to talk about any

conversation other than to say other

than to say great conversation totally

appropriate conversation couldn't have

been better and keep asking questions

and build it up as big as possible so

you can have a bigger downfall well

we're talking about China all the time

and Scott has very strong opinions on

China and I think I'd let him maybe

express those opinions maybe you do it

right now you're not gonna get a better

audience in this we have a comprehensive

strategic partnership with China we work

well with China but as we've spoken many

times we need to ensure that as

countries develop and realize their

potential well they they come on to a

whole new level and that means there

can't be special rules around that and

we have a great relationship with China

China's growth has been great for

Australia but we need to make sure that

we all compete on the same playing field

and and this is something that the

United States and Australia have been

very consistent on that we need to move

into this this new world where economies

of are changing China is a big economy

not as big as the United States but it's

a big economy and that means we've all

got to get on the same page with how the

rules work and that's what we're working

to achieve

I will say this we're making a lot of

progress with China they're having a

very bad year worst year in 57 years the

tariffs are coming in to us we're taking

in billions and billions of dollars of

tariffs they're devaluing their currency

which means the tariffs are not costing

us probably anything but certainly not

very much they're also adding a lot of

money into their economy they're pouring

money into their economy but we'll take

it in many billions of dollars at some

point in the not-too-distant future

it'll be over a hundred billion dollars

we've never taken in a hundred cents

from China was always the other way

around with that they've lost over three

million jobs their supply chain is

crashing and they have a lot of problems

and I can tell you they want to make a

deal that I can tell you they want to

make a deal so we'll see what happens

always prepared there's never been a

country more prepared there's never been

a country more prepared look I spent I

spent one-and-a-half trillion dollars

that we're spending another seven

hundred and thirty eight billion dollars

now but I've spent one and a half

trillion dollars rebuilding our military

we have the finest ships to find us

planes to find us everything and

actually Scott and Australia they

purchased a lot of great stuff from the

United States some of the best military

equipment that you have we have the

greatest missiles in the world rockets

in the world jet fighters in the world

planes in the world ships and we have

under construction a number of the most

powerful submarines ever built and

they're getting very close to completion

we have the largest ship in the world

right now the President Gerald Ford the

aircraft carets the largest ship ever

built and just flew over it yesterday

actually it's massive and beautiful we

have the greatest and I have to say this

when I got here Scott was a different

world it was a different world we were

very depleted and I actually saw one of

the related networks today saying how

strongly and good and how well we've

done with Isis I defeat

the Caliphate when I came the Caliphate

was all over the place I defeated the

Caliphate Isis and now we have thousands

of prisoners of war Isis fighters and

our prisoners of war and we're asking

the countries from which they came Scott

from Europe we're asking them to take

back these prisoners of war and they can

try them do what they want so far

they've refused and at some point I'm

gonna have to say I'm sorry but you

either take them back oh we're gonna let

him go with your border but they came

out from Germany they came out from

France we captured them we did everyone

a big favor we've taken over the

caliphate 100% if you remember I was

thinking about getting out when it was

at ninety six ninety seven percent but

they were all over the place and we did

it we did it in record time it was a

total Caliphate victory and now I want

the countries to take back the captured

Isis fighters and if they don't take

them back we're gonna probably put them

at the border and then they'll have to

capture them again because the United

States is not going to have thousands

and thousands of people that we've

captured stationed at Guantanamo Bay

held captive at Guantanamo Bay for the

next 50 years

and are spending billions and billions

of dollars we've done Europe a

tremendous favor they mostly come out of

Europe and we've done them a tremendous

favor and the United States is not going

to pay the cost of thousands and

thousands of Isis fighter prisoners in

Guantanamo Bay or someplace else we

won't do it so they have to make their

decision otherwise we're releasing them

at the border go ahead next

your national security team on everyone

today and what do you expect to hear oh

yeah I have a great new person you know

Robert O'Brien a lot of people wanted

Robert very badly he was I look I had

1012 people that I thought were

fantastic for the job

I think Robert end of Australia he's a

great friend of Australia

Scott was telling me he was very happy

with the choice Robert is going to be

outstanding he just picked a deputy who

was in the administration you all know

you know who the deputy is I just have

to announce that separately but he's

fantastic and essentially he's already

on the job but you know he did a

tremendous job as hostage negotiator we

are we have a tremendous record nobody

comes close to our record with hostages

but also with Secretary of Defense

Secretary of State who were discussing

with everybody and you know the early

move today was the Central Bank of Iran

okay it's always possible we haven't

discussed that we'll be discussing that

later but we haven't discussed that yet

I'm not gonna get into that right now

China's paying 30% on two hundred and

fifty billion dollars that starts in

another couple of weeks as you know

President Xi called through his top

people and they have a 70th anniversary

very important day for them and it

happens to be October 1st which is the

exact date of the increase in the tariff

and they asked us out of respect would I

delay the tariff a little bit I said how

about if I move it forward let me move

it forward a little bit because they

didn't want it to fall on the same day

it's exactly October 1st so I said let

me move it up a couple of weeks they

said no no no could you so out of

respect for President Xi who I do have

great respect for I moved it back two

weeks but right now it's 25% it goes up

to 30% on October 15th no I have it it's

it's I just tell you it is everybody's

rather they laugh at it and it's another

it's another media disaster and the

media has lost so much credibility in

this country our media has become the

laughingstock of the world when you look

at what they did to justice Cavanaugh

and so many other things last week I

think this is one of the worst weeks in

the history of the fake news media you

have been wrong on so many things and

this one will be I wouldn't say it will

top the list because I think you can't

do worse than some of the stories you

missed over the last week or two but the

media of our country is left at all over

the world now you're a joke okay what

else

which conversation will figure it out

you're supposed to be the media figure

it out it was which conversation I

really don't know I don't know what I

know about spice so we're doing a great

program we have vice president pence is

very much involved and we have a

tremendous space program if you look at

our facilities they were virtually

closed up there was crab grass growing

on the runways and now they're vital and

you know where we're doing we're doing

we're going to Mars we're stopping at

the moon the moon is actually a

launching pad that's why we're stopping

at the moon I said hey we've already

done the moon that's not so exciting

they said no sir it's a launching pad

for Mars so we'll be doing the moon but

we'll really be doing Mars and we'll be

we're making tremendous progress in

addition rich people like to send up

rocket ships

so between Bezos and Elon Musk and

others we're leasing them our launch

facilities which you can't get there are

no launch facilities like this this is

big stuff so we'll leap in in Texas and

Florida releasing them our facilities so

they can send up whatever they want to

send up where it's okay with us and

they've actually done very well they've

said they've had great success but rich

people in this country I don't know

about your country but they like

building rocket ships and sending them

up and it's okay with us

say it well I'll let it I think Scott

and I would rather take a pass though I

don't know what do you like to do I

think I think I'm not sure but I know

I'm pretty well I think he and I will

take a pass but there are a lot of

people that want to go up and I have

great respect for the astronauts it's a

that's an incredible I say it again

yeah well Australia's mineral industry

is massive it's far far bigger than that

I mean very few very few countries have

anything approaching what Australia has

in terms of mineral wealth and you've

really taken advantage of it and you've

done it in a very environmentally

sensitive way I know that's very

important to you it's very important to

Scott we talk about it a lot because

that business can get out of control a

little bit from the standpoint of

environment and you have really

approached it in an environmentally

sensitive way Cole isn't as an example

you're the leader of safety in coal

digging and we've actually studied it

because we're doing a lot of coal and

you have very little you almost have no

you know used to have a thing black lung

disease and in Australia you almost

don't have it anymore you've got all of

the dust down and you know they're very

they become wet mines basically but it's

very technologically advanced industry

craft right all that resources industry

are from the robotics that's involved in

the production and all the way through

but that critical mental space these are

the things were going to be talking

about because Australia has a wonderful

partnership with United States not just

militarily and not just strategically

but also economically and and that's

gonna be the big part of this

conversation we have today and

environmentally I have to say and

environmentally if the things that

they've done

environmentally we're digging digging is

a you know when you talk minerals it's

about digging and what you've been able

to do with environment with the

environment having to do with taking

minerals out of the ground including and

you know I would say even especially

because you're leading on coal I will

tell you I sent a whole crew over it

because your record is so good in terms

of illnesses from digging better than

anybody in the world so we're going

catch you on that okay Oh we'll talk

about that over dinner tonight I'm sure

he has another turn forever here in

Washington I understand but no we've

have talked about whether if he's

scheduled and mrs. Trump of it's where

they take in the Presidents Cup later in

the year which is going to be a great

time was a tremendous tournament the

president knows a lot more about golf

than I do and he certainly swings a club

way better than I do but he's got a busy

year coming up next year he's going to

do great there and but if he has the

opportunity if mr. Trump has the

opportunity it's it's going to be a

great spectacle down Australia this year

interestingly the the PGA Tour invited

me to go and I would love to do it we'll

have to see what the schedule is but but

I would love to do it's a very exciting

tournament nothing more exciting and

having it at in Australia where you have

so many great golfers Gregg Dorman is a

friend of mine and a great friend of

yours I know and I think he's going to

be here tonight yeah he's the first lady

has done an incredible job tonight we're

gonna have it for either the first time

we're certainly one of the few times in

the Rose Garden and it's going to be I

watched yesterday the rehearsal and she

was out there and it's going to be

incredible tonight's going to be a

beautiful night and the only thing that

can dampen it would be rain and we're

not expecting any rain but if it if it

rains we head over to the stateroom and

we'll be just fine but we're really

expecting I hope you're going to be able

to see it tonight for a little while

probably you will well we'll sort of

make sure that you do it's beautiful

well I always like a coalition sometimes

you find that people have made a lot of

money that did one in the coalition they

made a lot of money with Iran which is

you know when President Obama made that

deal not only was it a bad deal but the

United States didn't partake in a

business sense and other countries

Germany France Russia many other

countries made a lot of money with Iran

and we didn't make money with Iran which

that was just one of the many bad parts

about the deal everyone else is making

money and we're not so we'll see what

we'll see what happens look the United

States is in a class by itself we have

the most powerful military in the world

by far it's nobody close as you know

we've spent tremendous and hopefully and

we pray to God we never have to use it

but we've totally renovated and bought

new nuclear and the rest of our military

is all brand new the nuclear now is at a

level that it's never been before and I

can only tell you because I know I know

the problems of nuclear and other

damages that I know what happens and I

want to tell you we all hope in Scott

homes we all pray that we never have to

use nuclear but there's nobody that has

anywhere close to what we have well

Unger is going to be very exciting and

we look forward to it we'll be there

you'll be there yeah be there and for

you it's a much longer trip it is a pity

but we we look forward to it we have a

big message for Unga we have a big

message and I very much have we went

back to New York in a long time I see

that our part-time mayor will be now

going back to New York so they'd be able

to work a little bit harder but he

dropped out of the presidential race a

little while ago too bad he had

tremendous potential he only had one

real asset you know it was high other

than that he had nothing going okay what

else

well I think the United States has taken

a very measured and calibrated approach

to date and the thing about our

partnership is we we always listened to

whatever requests are made and Australia

always considers them and in our

national interests and we have good

conversations about these things but the

thing is both of us we never get ahead

of ourselves on these things we just you

know you take this one step at a time

and we keep talking to each other that's

what we've always done wherever we'll

work together and we're going to keep

doing that we've got such an open line

of communication I appreciate the fact

the president I talk about these things

even when we're not together and we're

gonna keep doing that and we'll just

take these things one step at a time you

know the easiest thing for me to do and

maybe it's even a natural instinct maybe

I have to hold myself back I remember

during the debates and when I was

running against Hillary and the

Democrats and the media I view them all

the same I view that partnership very

much the same but when I was running

everybody said all he's gonna get into

war he's gonna get into war he's going

to blow everybody up he's going to get

into war well the easiest thing I could

do in fact I could do it while you're

here which they go ahead and fellas go

do it and that would be a very bad day

for Iran that's the easiest thing I

could do it so easy and for all of those

that say oh they should do it it shows

weakness such as actually in my opinion

it shows strength because the easiest

thing I could do okay go ahead knock out

15 different major things in a run I

could do that and all set to go it's all

set to go but I'm not looking to do that

if I can I think I've changed a lot of

minds people are very surprised that and

many people are extremely happy many

people are thrilled and many people are

saying oh I wish you'd hit the hell out

of that well let's see what happens but

it will take place in one minute I could

do it right here in front of you and

that would be it and then you'd have a

nice big story to report

and

I think it shows far more strength to do

it the way we're doing it and again

whether it's next week or two weeks or

three which doesn't make any difference

whether it's now or in three weeks

doesn't make any difference but I think

the strong persons approach and the the

thing that does show strength would be

showing a little bit of restraint much

easier to do it the other way it's much

easier and Iran knows if they misbehave

they're on borrowed time they're not

doing well I'd like to see them do great

I'd love to see them do great but

they're not doing well they're doing

very poorly they're doing far worse than

they've ever done before they're having

riots in their streets they're having a

lot of problems in Iran right now they

could solve it very quickly but the

easiest thing for me to do is say okay

let's go let's just do it very easy for

me to do but it is interesting because

when I was campaigning everybody here

thought that I was going to be like it

would be one day but what I have done is

I've defeated Isis I've rebuilt our

military to a level that it's never been

before spent a lot of money the budgets

are not so hard to fix for me but when

you're spending one-and-a-half trillion

so far now another 738 million billion

on the military but think of it one and

a half trillion dollars and we have the

greatest in the world but I think we

strange is a good thing I think it's a

good thing we were thinking about having

a meeting I didn't like the idea that

they couldn't produce a ceasefire

I wasn't in favor of that I said no they

can't produce a ceasefire why are we

bothering and they thought that it was a

sign of strength to kill 12 people wound

others badly wound some others and one

of those 12 people was a young man young

soldier from Puerto Rico from our

country and when I heard that I said I

don't want to deal with them anymore we

have hit in Afghanistan we have hit the

Taliban harder than they've ever been

in the entire 19 years of war they've

been hit harder it's come back to me

through absolutely impeccable sources

that they're saying Wow we made a

mistake with this guy we made a big MIDI

made a mistake

I was totally willing to have a meeting

I'll meet with anybody

I think meetings are good I think

weddings are good there's no such thing

as oh gee we shouldn't I really believe

meetings are good worse that happens

does it work out that's okay

even then you get to know your

opposition don't forget I'm looking at

them like they're looking at me you get

to know your opposition you can see if

they're real sometimes you develop a

relationship like we do but sometimes

you develop and many times you won't but

you get to know your opposition I think

the best thing that happened to this

country is the fact that at least for

three years the fact that I have a very

good relationship with Kim jong-il and I

think that's a positive his country is

tremendous potential he knows that but

our country has been playing around for

50 years and getting nothing and we have

a relationship there's never been a

relationship with them we'll see what

happens it might work out it might not

work out I'm not saying it will but in

the meantime he hasn't been testing any

nuclear you've had no nuclear test since

since for a long time and he has been

doing some short-range missiles but so

does every other country do short-range

missiles every country is doing them

they're pretty standard fair but no I

will tell you that we've never had a

country so strong we're just a couple of

points away from a new stock market

all-time high and I think we've done it

over a hundred and twelve times as a

certain number whatever it may be I

don't want to be specific because if I

give you the wrong number we'll have

breaking news it'll be on every news

paper that I said I said 112 and it was

actually 111 and it'll be breaking news

they'll give me a Pinocchio but let me

just say let me just say the country has

never been in this position we have the

strongest military we've ever had and

now we've rebuilt it after this seven

hundred and thirty eight billion dollars

we really have a bill that we have a

rebuilt military it's a great thing and

some of our friends are doing the same

thing I can tell you Australia's

military is unbelievable I saw the order

that they put in for some of our most of

stated equipment and I said that's

really great would you do and they've

really upped it and I want to

congratulate you I mean you have really

done a job when you're military after 2

percent of GDP next year so right in the

middle of a two hundred billion dollar

upgrade biggest increase in our defence

as a share of GDP since the second world

war

well you know that's a question I

haven't heard in a long time

I'll leave that for you to determine

well obviously China is a threat to the

world in a sense because they're

building a military faster than anybody

and frankly they're using us money

presidents before me have allowed China

to take out five hundred billion dollars

a year and it's really more than that

they've allowed China to steal our

intellectual property and property

rights and I'm not doing that

and we actually very close to having a

deal you know we were very close we had

intellectual property all of the tough

things were negotiated and then at the

last moment Scott they said we cannot

agree to this I said that's all right

we're charging you 25% tariffs and then

it's going up and it'll continue to go

up and frankly we're making so many

hundreds of the numbers that were taking

in to our treasury and you see it

because sometimes you'll see look at the

good reports look at the great reports

that came out two days ago on retailing

on consumers or numbers that nobody

believes well I think a lot of it we're

taking hundreds of millions potentially

over a short period of time hundreds of

billions of dollars worth of money is

coming in from China that never came in

before so China wants to make a deal I

think we want to make a deal and we'll

see what happens but I view China in

many different ways but right now I'm

thinking about trade but you know trade

equals military because if we allow

China to

take 500 billion dollars out of the hide

of the United States that money goes

into military and other things I was

hoping I wouldn't be asked that question

had to be you that asks you had asked me

that question right Justin I'm surprised

and I was more surprised when I saw the

number of times and you know I've always

had a good relationship with Justin I

just don't know what to tell you it's I

was surprised by it actually I would say

a man of titanium you know titanium is

much tougher than steel he's a man of

titanium believe me I have to deal with

this guy he's not easy you might think

he's a nice guy okay he's a man of real

real strength and a great guy and his

wife is lovely and I want to thank you

and I want to thank Melania for the work

and I hope you're gonna be able to see

cuz Melania has she's worked very hard

for Australia and you've done a

fantastical and it'll be so different

and we look up to the skies and we're

just gonna hope that it's not gonna rain

and if it is that's okay too cuz that'll

work out also it always works out thank

you all very much

there is nothing it's nothing there's

nothing it's great honor to be here

little Ben dishonor the baby thank you

very much everybody
