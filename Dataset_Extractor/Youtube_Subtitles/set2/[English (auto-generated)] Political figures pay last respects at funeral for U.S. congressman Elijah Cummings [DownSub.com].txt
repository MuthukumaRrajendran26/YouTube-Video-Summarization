few politicians command an audience like

this in life or in death but congressman

Elijah Cummings towered over Washington

on this day he received a remarkable

tribute for his remarkable service to

country well we get the story we don't

know if we can believe anymore we should

hear him come on we're better than that

in every sense Cummings was a powerful

voice a Civil Rights icon and a

remarkable orator a man who could reach

across the partisan divide to make

friends on all sides he pushed back

against the abuse of power he was

unwavering in his defense of our

democracy he had little tolerance for

those who put party ahead of country or

partisanship above truth even as his own

health failed Cummings continued leading

the investigations into President Trump

when the attacks turned nasty and when

Trump took aim at Cummings hometown of

Baltimore the congressman refused to

relent and invited the President to

visit the city he continued his work

until his death last week but

congressman chairman Cummings did was

not easy and it got infinitely more

difficult in the last months of his life

when he sustained personal attacks and

attacks on his beloved city perhaps

that's what made Cummings uniquely

suited to this era he conveyed a

seriousness and a gravity that rose

beyond the usual bickering traits that

former President Barack Obama noted set

him apart from the other powerful men

and women who walked the halls of power

we're supposed to introduce them as

honorable but Elijah Cummings was

honorable before he was elected office

there's a difference his remarkable life

set a high bar inspiring those who would

follow him to do better for their

country Jackson Prost Co Global News
