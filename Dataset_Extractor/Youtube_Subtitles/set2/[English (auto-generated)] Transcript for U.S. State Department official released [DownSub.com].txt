President Trump may have more pressing

concerns the timeline of the impeachment

inquiry has speeded up it could be over

now by Christmas Democrats are moving

ahead at a rapid pace public hearings

will start next week and so will a

battle for public opinion our Washington

bureau chief Jackson prosecco joins me

Jackson today testimony from another

witness was revealed tell us about that

yet on a short time ago the transcripts

of the closed-door testimony of a top

State Department official were released

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State

George Kent told the inquiry he

documented his concerns about Trump's

pressure on Ukraine noting he felt there

was quote an effort to initiate

politically motivated prosecutions that

were injurious to the rule of law this

came after President trumps requests

that Ukraine open investigations into

Joe Biden Kent's testimony corroborates

that of nearly a dozen other witnesses

and the original whistleblower complaint

and Donna it really goes to the heart of

the whole impeachment inquiry so that

was a closed-door transcript the public

hearings start next week and then the

whole country can watch all this unfold

and tonight we're learning Jackson more

about how the President himself tried to

clear his own name yeah that's right the

Washington Post reports that Trump

pressured his own Attorney General

William bar to hold a press conference

and announced that the president had

done nothing criminal in his dealings

with Ukraine Barr apparently refused

which is unusual because he's been so

loyal to Trump so far but the request

also suggests the President may not

fully understand the gravity of the

impeachment process

remember that articles of impeachment

are actually decided upon by Congress

and the president can still be impeached

for acts that do not rise to the level

of criminality but are simply a breach

of his or her duties in office
