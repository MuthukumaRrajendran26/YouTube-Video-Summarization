now it's up to us to decide whether the

United States is still a nation where no

one is above the law or whether America

is allowed to become a land run by those

who act more like kings or queens as if

the law doesn't apply to them you know

it's no secret the President Trump has a

penchant for cozying up to notorious

dictators

he's complimented Vladimir Putin

congratulated Rodrigo Duterte lauded

president rwan fell in love with Kim

jong-un I can go on and on and on and

maybe the president is jealous

that they can do whatever they want

these dictators are the antithesis of

what America stands for and every day we

let President Trump

act like the law doesn't apply to him we

meet we move a little closer to them

unfortunately this entire process was

tarnished further by the speed with

which my Democratic colleagues on the

judiciary and intelligence committees

have rushed to deliver their

predetermined judgment to impeach the

president for something anything whether

there are stones left unturned or

whether there is any proof at all

there's no way this can or should be

viewed as legitimate certainly not by

Republicans whose minority rights have

been trampled on every step on the way

and certainly not by the American people

observing this disastrous political show

scene-by-scene we have requested several

documents and testimony for members of

this administration and what is the

president is administration done the

response

nothing just I think it's important for

people understand this for the record

requests for documents from the State

Department ignored requests for

documents from the Department of Defense

ignored requests for documents from the

vice president ignored requests for

documents from Giuliani associate level

partners ignored requests from documents

from Giuliani associated Igor fruit

crewmen ignored requests from document

from the White House ignored requests

from documents from rudy giuliani the

president's lawyer ignored requests from

testimony of former national security

advisor john bolton

ignored requests from the testimony of

White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney

ignored and you know here's a list of

all the requests that been made the red

marks are basically to demonstrate

non-compliance that if they have been

ignored I think this is what you call

obstruction plain and simple and in fact

the only people that have complied with

their requests have been patriotic

public servants many of them defying

instructions that they not complied when

you're the tyranny of a clock in a

calendar and nothing else matters it's

like what's going to happen here in the

holidays is you're getting close to that

day and you're supposed to give that

gift nothing else matters you just got

to go get in it's the last minute if you

don't have anything mr. I bet you've

done this you go out and you just buy

the first thing you get and this is what

was happening the clock was running out

so they found a phone call they didn't

like they didn't like this

administration they didn't like what the

president did they tried to make up

claims of it there was pressure and all

these other things that they've so

outlined in the report but at the end of

the day it's simply last minute

Christmas shopping they ran and found

something they said we can do it but no

crimes none in their articles abuse of

power in which any member can make up

anything they want to in caller an abuse

of power we all know what they teach you

in law school which is if the facts are

against you you pound the law the laws

are against you you pound the facts if

the law and the facts are against you

you talk about process and you pound the

table and I'm afraid I've seen a little

bit of that in the performance of our

colleagues here and I don't blame them

because they're dealing with the hand

that they were dealt we have 17

fact witnesses and all of their

depositions and all their testimony was

published all part of the report

everybody everybody can find it and all

of their testimony is essentially

unrefuted and uncontradicted it tells

one story which is the President of the

United States conducted a shakedown of a

foreign power in my view we've

established the Intelligence Committee

process was substantially flawed and

procedurally defective that's my view I

underlined Judiciary Committee failed to

create an evidentiary record sufficient

to justify moving forward on on articles

but you basically relied on the

Intelligence Committee

and where the president was

unrepresentative that violated rules of

the house in my view and the entire

circus has been politically motivated

from the very beginning on the

obstruction of Congress charge it's

uncommon for the executive is it

uncommon for the NISS to both of you

uncommon for the executive branch to

push back against requests for

information from Congress well no it is

not uncommon for the executive branch to

push back on the production of this or

that document or the timing of a

particular visit what was absolutely

breathtaking in its unprecedented and

radical nature was this president's

determination to shut down all discovery

they did not produce a single document

to us mr. Kaul that was subpoenaed in

this process and the president

essentially ordered everyone in the

executive branch not to cooperate with

us and yes excuse me I don't know but I

think that's a dramatic escalation in

kind and in degree over anything that's

ever been seen before and that includes

Richard Nixon who I think tried to tried

to block seven or eight particular

requests like the Watergate tapes and

that in itself became part of the case

against him for abuse of power but you

know President Trump makes Richard Nixon

look like a little leaguer when it comes

to obstruction mr. Kile the same thing

do you think it's unusual for an

administration to push back against

congressional subpoenas and no it's

called if it's pretty common you believe

it's a high crime or misdemeanor to

assert privileges in response to

congressional requests for subpoenas not

it is and again I won't go back and just

give a little bit of history since we've

had history lessons here from it's

rather even our own committee this year

what's been really interesting is is

it's been a total you know just walk

toward impeachment the whole time but

what was interesting in our committee is

we would send subpoenas or we would you

know again we sent out letters and stuff

and we never followed up home but also

one of the interesting things about our

committee was is we never engaged for

the most part where the agencies for

documents but what I thought was really

interesting was mr. Schiff in the

Intelligence Committee while we were

still struggling during Moeller and some

other times mr. Schiff actually

negotiated with the Department of

Justice and

got documents released at our committee

couldn't the House Foreign Affairs

Committee eliot engel who is one of the

quadrature Minh but one of the more

effective and my first women from across

the aisle had engaged all year with an

administration on ways to get documents

it's a matter of how you go about it and

to say that this is just unheard of it's

just not right well please you would

concede that there are other episodes of

corruption in the business career of

Donald Trump and in the political career

now that are not part of it all part of

this process and so I mean I don't know

if look there are patterns of conduct

and behavior that have been noticed one

of them is extremely relevant to this

investigation that's what took place in

2016

that's when Donald Trump essentially

invited in Russia the whole world heard

him say it invited Russia to come into

our election he welcomed their

interference the special counsel of the

Department of Justice found more than a

hundred contacts between the Trump

campaign and Russian nationals there and

then when it began to happen the

president moved to obstruct the

investigation and that's in the Muller

report which we talked about today all

of those episodes of corruption so there

is a pattern of evidence and I don't

know look when when Bill Clinton got

impeached for what he did you could

certainly find Republicans who had been

calling for his impeachment for several

years for other stuff there were

conspiracy theories about him going on

for years

that doesn't necessarily discredit what

happened in the impeachment of Bill

Clinton you've got to take it on its own

terms that's why we're trying to get

back to the facts of what took place

here with the Ukraine shakedown I think

you're mistaking my intent

I was not citing comments that she'd

made in the past to put you as a never

Trump er whose sole purpose was to to

reverse a a legitimate American election

that was not my intent my intent was to

mention you as someone who's a

thoughtful legal mind who had other

legal concerns going back for years and

when folks say Rob what do you mean this

process is rushed we've done it ill over

just under ninety days isn't that long

enough well no that's faster than any

other process that's faster than it

we've got a response from the Justice

Department when we asked for our fast

and fury

documents but but what it isn't is a

complete process I think by your own

testimony here that there's more that we

could have done that we didn't do

President himself said when asked in

public what would he have the Ukrainians

do he basically said the same thing

just like his chief of staff admitted it

this stuff is happening in plain sight

let's stop playing pretend we've got a

very heavy decision to make about what

to do with the president who enlists and

recruits foreign governments to get

involved in our elections is that what

democracies can be like for the rest of

the 21st century is that what it's gonna

be like for our children and our

grandchildren and our

great-grandchildren we've got to decide

that you know dr. Fiona Hill in her

testimony said Russia can't beat us

militarily Russia you can't beat us

economically but they've got a strategy

that involves the Internet in an

intervention in elections around the

world she said she thinks of Russia is

the world's largest super PAC right and

are we going to be allowing the

president United States to be working

with Vladimir Putin's super PAC for the

tyrants and the despot and the people

who are trying to interfere with the

growth in the spread of democracy around

the world I hope not

ones I'm just trying to find out what if

anything you would consider impeach Abul

because we haven't seen that yet I mean

you you won't even concede what was

precedent from the Nixon situation and

here we have a situation I'm asking if

the facts were to show that the

president withheld foreign aid to

another country in order to get a

personal political favor not for matters

of national security would that be

impeachable and you don't seem able to

answer that question I seem very capable

and I'm just not gonna follow your path

on what you wanted me to lead because if

this same line just got out you and I

both have to vote on words on paper and

words on paper tomorrow is this case

it's not the hypothetical bit because I

don't believe you've made this case and

that's why I'm pushing back on it and

we'll continue very politely to push

back on this I'm just not going to go

down this road because you've not made

ucation you can convince yourself with

all due respect mr. Desmond

our house is not the finder of fact the

trial is for the Senate right here we're

talking about whether there's enough

evidence to make out the case and I

believe it is agree there's not
