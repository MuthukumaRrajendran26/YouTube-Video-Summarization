we have president Amy Hoskins grilling

Republican senator Joni Ernst at a town

hall meeting where is the line when are

you guys going to say enough Haskins

asking what many Republican voters are

wondering while Senate Republicans

decide US President Donald Trump finally

crossed the line when he asked Ukraine's

president to investigate political rival

Joe Biden Ernst dodging the question but

supporting the whistleblower who

reported the phone call between the two

leaders whistleblowers should be

protected laws need to be enforced if

the house votes to impeach the president

the case against him then goes to the

Senate for a trial and vote the Senate

is now made about 53 Republicans 47

Democrats but they need a two-thirds

majority vote to remove the president

from office and so we may see several

potentially leave but it will require a

significant impact statement to move 20

Senate Republicans to convict

Republicans keep avoiding answering the

question on whether they'd convict and

remove President Trump from office but

the party is showing some splintering

including senators Mitt Romney Ben Sasse

and Susan Collins Collins saying the

president never should have asked China

to also investigate Biden I thought the

president made a big mistake by asking

China to get involved in investigating a

political opponent even the president's

former national security adviser is

criticizing his old boss do you think it

is appropriate for the President of the

United States to solicit foreign

interference in our political process of

course no no it's absolutely not a new

Fox News poll now shows 51 percent of

Americans want president Trump impeached

and removed from office uphold a

president quickly dismissed but some

believe is making him nervous well he

certainly isn't acting like a person

who's calm so he clearly looks like he's

fighting fighting fighting hard but

Democrats hopes of getting President

Trump out of the White House could

backfire if the Senate holds an

impeachment trial that could end up

exonerating president Trump giving his

base more fuel to reelect him in 2020
