recession worries rattle Wall Street

concern about the prospects for a

recession is the American economy

growing for more than a decade now

suddenly at risk of stalling even

tipping into recession the R word is

being thrown around once again in the US

as markets reacted to President Donald

Trump's trade war with China it sent a

jolt of anxiety to investors and is

ringing bells for economists looking for

signs of a looming recession so what are

these indicators let's start with what's

known as a yield curve it's a term used

in the bond market to reflect what

usually happens when you make higher

returns or yield higher returns on

longer-term investments and make less on

short term investments what has people

worried the opposite is happening

two-year investments for example are

yielding a higher return than a ten-year

investment that's known as an inverted

yield curve historically the u.s. curve

has inverted about a year before each

recession in the past 50 years but some

economists warn it's not foolproof

especially in Canada because you need to

look at the bigger picture I don't give

the yield curve very much consideration

at all it's pretty fall it's one

statistic and I don't think it's

terribly important you know whether the

long term or short term bonds are

hurting more that's just the

fluctuations at the market I don't think

it's a precursor to the sky falling I

really don't the labor market is another

important indicator the Canadian

unemployment rate currently sits at a

low five point seven percent which is

still higher than the record low US

unemployment rate of three point seven

percent these employment levels don't

seem to be pointing towards a recession

one of the most effective ways to gauge

whether the economy is expanding or

contracting is to evaluate the country's

gross domestic product or GDP when the

GDP contracts instead of expanding it

causes businesses to slow expansion

perhaps one of the most significant

recession indicators present in the

market today is the possibility of a

trade war between the US and China and

the general political unrest in Europe

which brings us to one of the biggest

fears of a recession fear its

and what economists call self-fulfilling

prophecies it's fascinating

at this time because why are you seeing

that fear it did because of employment

statistics no interest rate statistics

no inflation statistics no manufacturing

no no no no they're all it's all because

of sort of this this supposed war

between Donald Trump and the rest of the

world that people are going wait a

minute if he's so busy waging Wars

that's going to slow down the economy if

that's going to slow down the economy I

better start saving people start saving

people start not spending and then all

of a sudden you get recessive tendencies

while experts still aren't unanimous on

whether a recession is coming they do

agree the best way to prepare is by

building up savings and paying off

outstanding credit card debt
