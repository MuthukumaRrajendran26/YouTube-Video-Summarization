global national with Donna freezin

good evening and thanks for joining us

there is relief on the way if you have

been laid off or can't work because of

Kovan 19:00 we have some important

details tonight about the federal

legislation passed in Parliament

overnight it's called the Canada

emergency response benefit and it will

inject billions into the economy that

includes $2,000 per month for the next

four months for workers affected by

kovat 19 this virus has killed business

and this emergency aid package totaling

107 billion dollars is designed to help

individuals and businesses by delivering

direct support and tax deferrals we are

working in order to make sure that we

have the capacity to protect Canadians

to get ourselves through this and to

come out of this challenge this is we

expect a very challenging time but a

temporary time to come out of this

challenge with our economy intact we

know many Canadians need the money now

with rent and bills to pay but the

checks aren't going out tomorrow Mike

look at aura has more on what the

government is saying about the timeline

help is on the way the government is

trying to reassure Canadians who have

already missed a paycheck because of the

kovat 19 outbreak releasing the details

of the aid package and exactly who it

will help whether you're full-time

contract or self-employed this new

benefit will be there for you if you're

sick or quarantined looking after

someone's sick or at home taking care of

your kids it's there for you the

candidate emergency response benefit

also applies to people who have yet to

be laid off but aren't getting any

income because of this crisis it covers

a lot of people who need money now and

that's the biggest problem

now the government online portal to

apply for these benefits is scheduled to

be up and running by April 6th and the

prime minister has promised money in

your pockets within ten days of applying

for it meaning financial help is still

three weeks away but questioned about

that delay in a special Senate session

Finance Minister Bill Morneau explained

they're doing the best they can there

art

ways to get money in Canadians hands

that is in fact the challenge that we're

facing in this particular situation 1.1

million Canadians have filed for

employment insurance since last week and

that number is expected to grow the

prime minister says 1,300 civil servants

have been brought in to help process all

those claims and to prevent more claims

business groups say the government could

have used companies to funnel the money

to Canadians and avoid more layoffs we

can avoid that by executing

expeditiously with a greater sense of

urgency and working collaboratively

together with business so that we can

keep these employees on a payroll and

not have to have them go through an

arduous AI process if at all possible

the finance minister admits the systems

that will deliver these government

services we're not built for the type of

stress and strain they are about to

endure and that's why the government

feels it was so important for Parliament

to sit through the night so Canadians

can get the benefits as soon as possible

Donna Michael cutter in Ottawa thank you

here's how many people are diagnosed

with kovat 19 in Canada right now there

are more than 3,300 confirmed cases

across the country more than 30 people

have died and the spread of the virus is

accelerating so far today at least 610

new cases have been reported Ontario had

its biggest daily jump yet 100 new cases

and that brings the total number in that

province to 688 17 of those people are

in intensive care in Newfoundland and

Labrador the number of cases nearly

doubled today 67 people now have tested

positive 44 of them have been linked to

a funeral home in Saint John's

it's believed someone with koban 19 went

to the funeral home last week exposing

others to the virus people across

Newfoundland and Labrador being urged to

stay home the safe thing for you to do

now is assume that there's Co vyd around

you and to stay home and stay apart but

stay connected

a Canadian member of parliament has

kovat 19 kemal Cara is the first MP to

test positive she is a two-term Liberal

MP from Brampton West Ontario and a

registered nurse she

we did she's experiencing symptoms but

is in good spirits as our chief

political correspondent David akin

reports what's concerning is who she's

been in contact with over the last two

weeks it was March 11th when Brampton

West MP Camille Cara met the executive

director of the United Nations World

Food Program David Beasley at a

Parliament Hill reception then eight

days later on March 19th

Beasley said he had tested positive for

kovat 19 and had been in quarantine for

five days that meant Beasley would have

been in self quarantine on March 14th

three days after the reception in Ottawa

but on March 17th Kara announced that as

a registered nurse she was volunteering

to be on the frontline to fight the

virus in Brampton it's not known if Kara

did any frontline nursing work then or

after Beasley announced his positive

test and she did not respond to

inquiries from Global News Beasley also

met with as many as 50 MPs during his

official visit to Canada some of those

MPs have been in self isolation ever

since though Kara is the only MP so far

to have been confirmed positive for

kovat 19 and all of this of course

underlines the risk politicians face and

the risk politicians represent because

of course politics is a social business

and it like so many other businesses is

now undergoing rapid change Donna all

right David akin in Ottawa thank you

efforts are still underway to bring home

Canadians who are stranded overseas

flights are starting to arrive from Peru

and Ukraine today more flights are in

the works from several other countries

in Latin America North Africa and Europe

priority is being given to places where

there are no or limited flight options

and where there is a critical mass of

Canadians trying to get out many will be

coming from places that have outbreaks

of kovat 19 like Spain and there are

still regularly scheduled flights coming

into Canada from all over the United

States today the government toughened

its approach to all those returning

travelers it is now mandatory under the

quarantine act to stay home and self

isolate for 14 days so there is perfect

clarity around the need to isolate when

Canadians come back from a

whether it's from the USA or other

international destinations we are

implementing the quarantine act so there

is no confusion about the need to do so

whether you are symptomatic or not

returning travelers with symptoms are

warned not to take public transportation

and not to self isolate where there are

vulnerable people when they land we're

told contact information will be taken

from symptomatic passengers and others

plus some random checks will be

performed but other than that it's not

clear how the quarantine act will be

enforced might relay reports Canadians

returning from abroad expected extensive

testing for kovat 19 symptoms upon

landing when we heard Prime Minister

Trudeau speak we were almost thinking

they're gonna have like thermal imaging

to see if you have a fever or they're

gonna take your temperature or something

at the airports but none of that there

was nothing over the past week Canadians

have been given this single information

sheet a number of travelers interviewed

by global news report the same things

few masks fewer questions and almost no

social distancing well you know what it

is it's a flying petri dish and the

airports are breeding for very fertile

breeding ground for Kovac 19 : McCaskill

and her family went into isolation but

not everyone is heated the advice of

health officials so now the federal

government says it will use the

quarantine act to force travelers to

isolate the penalties for contravening

the order include a million dollar fine

and three years in jail I think all of

us are going to be and feel safer with

mandatory quarantine for anyone entering

Canada but how will the quarantine act

be enforced and will Canadians respected

we've spoken to several travelers who

say they do anything to return to Canada

including masking any symptoms they may

have over a million people were screened

for fevers and airports during the SARS

crisis with no positive tests and Canada

Border Services is investigating how a

72 year old woman with kovat symptoms

was able to fly undetected into Toronto

last weekend only to die hours later

well at this stage with crisis

and everybody wanting to get home we

cannot rely on that honor system I hate

to say it we're human and humans

sometimes need motivation to do the

right thing

microlight global news toronto we know

no one is immune to this virus not even

a prince the heir to the British throne

Prince Charles has tested positive one

of more than 9,000 cases in the UK he's

71 years old he's said to be doing well

the worry is not just about him but only

other people he's interacted with

recently including his mother the Queen

crystal commencing reports this is the

Prince of Wales avoiding handshakes

during one of his most recent public

appearances it was very shocking news

that Prince Charles tested positive for

he's probably one of the most

high-profile people in the world who's

now got the virus but the good news is

that he's supposed to have fairly minor

symptoms his wife Camilla tested

negative the couple is now in isolation

in Scotland it's not known where Prince

Charles picked up the virus but he's

been at many events including one

earlier this month with Prince Albert of

Monaco who tested positive on the 12th

the 12th is also the last time Prince

Charles saw his mother the Queen is in

good health

according to Buckingham Palace as is her

98 year old husband Prince Philip

Windsor Castle in lockdown and they're

just being served by a very small staff

of clothes they eat only about something

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson did

not see the Queen for their regular

meeting they spoke over the telephone a

lockdown is in place in the UK in an

effort to save lives more than 400 here

have already died of the virus crystal

de Manson Global News London

India is taking a tough approach to

enforcing the lockdown in that country

which is in place for 21 days police are

out in force wearing masks and

physically punishing those who are

breaking the rules and going out

roadblocks are in place in all 1.3

billion people except essential workers

have been told to stay home only about

600 people have tested

in India but it's expected that number

will spike and hospitals were soon be

overwhelmed fears kovat 19 could

penetrate prisons coming up the drastic

plan to prevent inmates from getting

infected

police are patrolling the streets of New

York City the epicenter of the outbreak

in the United States

anyone who has recently been to that

city is being asked to self quarantine

for two weeks and in Washington

lawmakers passed a two trillion dollar

emergency relief bill it is the biggest

in American history and it did give the

markets a boost the TSX closed up 568

points today ending the day at over

13,000 the Dow Jones climbed 495 points

to close at just over 21,000 New York

state's governor though says that bill

doesn't give his state nearly enough

money to deal with the crisis

Jackson prosecco reports in New York

State the situation grows worse by the

day the number of confirmed cases is

more than 30,000 and rising New York

City morgues are reportedly nearing

capacity ventilators ventilators

ventilators we need 30,000 medical

workers are already reusing masks and

conserving the supplies they have mouths

of stress in neighboring New Jersey

doctors at one Hospital say the ten

ventilators they have simply won't be

enough the only good news restrictive

social distancing measures may be

working the rate of hospitalization has

slowed slightly New York City is now

preparing to close some of its busiest

roads to make more room for pedestrians

to space themselves out as anyone

leaving the city is asked to self

quarantine for two weeks we mandated the

isolation of all individuals that fly to

Florida from the New York City area

similar outbreaks are growing in

communities across the u.s. Louisiana

has seen its numbers surge help is on

the way in Washington urgency has led to

a rare show of unity as lawmakers reach

a deal on a two trillion dollar relief

package one that will include direct

payments to Americans and bailouts for

businesses big and small this is not

even a stimulus package it is emergency

relief

late today the president tweeted that

quote the media is the dominant force in

trying to keep him to get him to keep

the country closed in the interests of

damaging his prospects at reelection

Donna that's obviously not true it's

state and local officials who are

listening to public health guidance and

those public health officials say half

if not more of the cases they're seeing

of confirmed coronavirus right now are

in young people under the age of 50 yeah

that is deeply worrying Jackson Prosecco

in Washington thank you there are

warnings tonight of a potential disaster

across the American prison system

because of kovat 19 there are already a

number of positive cases among inmates

and staff and overcrowded conditions are

fueling the spread of the virus several

states have already started to release

thousands of inmates hit when they're

down still ahead how can Alberta's

energy sector survive this before this

pandemic Alberta's energy sector was

already under the weather hit by falling

oil prices and a lack of pipeline

capacity today Canada's finance minister

said financial help is coming for the

oil and gas industry I'm not talking

about weeks I'm talking about hours

potentially days that we can ensure that

there's credit facilities for especially

the small and medium sized firms in that

sector right now the fate of multiple

projects in Alberta is uncertain as

Heather Eurex west reports Alberta's

premier says the economic hit will be

massive Chris might'n has been through

downturns in the energy sector before

the bust of 2015 almost cost him

everything barely back on his feet last

week he was laid off once again I was

notified by phone from my my direct

report that we won't be returning

because of the coal be thinking

collectively companies like Husky

Synovus and Canadian natural resources

have cut billions in spending following

a collapse in oil prices

unlike the industry has ever seen

previous crashes have been serious for

the oil and gas industry but what we're

seeing here is unprecedented we just

don't know what's going to be happening

in the mid-80s Alberta's economy went

into recession when the price of West

Texas Intermediate hovered just above 11

dollars a barrel or about $24 in today's

terms 30 years later in 2015 global oil

prices tanked again tens of thousands of

jobs were lost when prices for a barrel

of Western Canada select fell to around

$16 a barrel at one point last week that

same barrel cost a little more than $5

it's like the same price is a cup of

coffee it's it's it's incredible while

kovat 19 has sent global demand for oil

off a cliff a spat between Saudi

Arabia's OPEC and Russia has also led to

the market being over supplied Alberta's

premier warns these record low prices

could get worse Citibank is projecting

that Brent oil could be trading on

average as low as $5 in the second

quarter of this year which would

probably mean that we would be paying

people to take Alberta oil off our hands

the federal government says help is

coming details of a 15 billion dollar

aid package are expected to be released

this week while the Alberta government

has enlisted the help of former Prime

Minister Stephen Harper to help them

navigate these uncharted waters

Chris Myton hopes people like him are

not forgotten as an independent

contractor he isn't even eligible for AI

just the financial support being a

contractor is tough Heather York's West

Global News Calgary Hannah's coronavirus

survive a hot shower next experts answer

your questions

we've been trying to ease some of the

uncertainty and the confusion you may

have and probably have about this

pandemic many of you have submitted

questions through our website and our

Jeff sample has been putting together

some of those questions to the experts

take a look and a listen across the

country

Canada's normally bustling streets are

silent Canadians heeding the call to

stay indoors like Paula Anderson from

Grand Prairie we had come back from a

family holiday in Mexico and gone into

self-isolation

the end of that period is just coming up

this week

now is not the time to go and visit your

other family members you know we

understand there has to be some kind of

essential things to know going to get

groceries sometimes people have to go to

certain types of doctor appointments but

you know if you're going to go outside

what we recommend is that you go outside

but you keep yourself away at least two

meters for everybody else others are in

salt isolation because they developed

symptoms consistent with kovat 19 like

hillary from hamilton there are some

scattered reports of a virus being

detected by molecular testing on people

who are several days past 14 days

several days passed to discharge from

the hospital and were deemed to be

recovered one study found that once

infected patients develop symptoms

they're contagious for about eight days

besides social distancing a lot of

viewers are asking how to make sure they

don't bring the virus home and are

wondering if it might help to turn up

thank you

this is Roger in Chilliwack DC I know

one common question a lot of people have

is temperature as far as personal

hygiene and grooming taking hot showers

and so on what is the best way to make

sure that you're doing your part to to

be able to sanitize surfaces and

yourself

other viewers are asking about killing

the virus with hot water laundry even a

hot tub the SARS coronavirus can be

killed by temperatures of 56 degrees

Celsius but when this corona VAR as

higher humidity and temperature seem to

inhibit it on surfaces but water at any

temperature should do the trick if you

just add soap if your soap and water

it's all you have in your house use that

metal work soap water and social

distancing our best weapons against an

invisible threat Geoff sample Global

consult with experts and try to answer
