first off anyone who enters political

life these days knows that your behavior

in the past is now just as relevant as

your behavior in the present with the

advent of social media and Justin

Trudeau is now learning this the hard

way many people mostly his opponents

admittedly are questioning the

truthfulness of his sunny ways

multiculturalism and tolerance that he

preaches due to the revelations last

night that show at least two pictures

and a video of him wearing brown and

black face many people are willing to

sort of shrug this off as ghosts of his

youth but others say this is an example

of what he's really like deep down

inside now we spoke to marketing expert

Tony Chapman on global news morning he's

the CEO of Tony Chapman impressions

about what Trudeau might have to do to

regain any trust that he might have lost

after last night's revelations today is

about resetting the election he's got to

get in front of a lot of special

interest groups he's got to get in front

of a lot of minorities he's got to take

a lot of punches and he's got to come

grace and say you know I I haven't been

consistent I haven't been honest on this

stuff and I can do better now you might

have noticed we're in the middle of

celebrations square in Mississauga and

that's essentially what we've been doing

all day global news has been going

around the 905 getting reaction from 905

voters because this is a battleground

region or a collection of regions in the

upcoming election these votes are really

going to matter in determining who the

next Prime Minister will be
