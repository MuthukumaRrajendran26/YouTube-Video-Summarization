he traveled here from Orillia are you

satisfied with what you heard today from

Boeing CEO we didn't necessarily come

here to get any satisfaction or any

closure or any new information we came

because we wanted to be here to see mr.

mellenburg while he testifies so we

great to get some different answers but

that will come just being here was what

was important for us to connect with the

other families as well right Stace all

that as a team I was going to ask you

that how important is it to meet the

other families exceptional Department

important almost everywhere we go and

went to Ethiopia last week everybody's

trying to say oh we're here center

anyone else here in Ethiopia can we meet

up you know and and and the same we were

we've met some new people this week and

we've seen some people we haven't seen

in a while since the last time we've

been in Washington and since we've been

to Ethiopia as well other than our

families nobody else can really feel

what we feel

so when we're together we can share

stories we don't have to feel it's

inappropriate to talk about it's not an

appropriate to cry or to be angry

because we all share those feelings it

brings comfort

to see these people that I have just

recently met over the last few weeks

um it's important for us to stay

together and study together we haven't

been intimate friends but we are

intimate friends at the same time what

is it you'd like boeing's the CEO to

understand about what you've lost and

who you've lost

I think he needs to understand that I

think the biggest tragedy for me and I

found a part a little bit in there was

just realizing over and over again that

this was preventable

you know this crash was preventable

there was warning signs you know at

least as far back as 2016 there was

things that could have been changed or

stopped and it didn't happen and that

and we're not sure why it didn't happen

you know when we left the room we stayed

that before the jaddo report and the

NTSB and you know it's reiterated over

and over and over again that there are

things that people knew for myself it's

just evident that it's profit over

safety as Jones said you know since 2016

they have had some indication that there

are problems and they evaluated the

problem to be at a low risk that the

percentages didn't require any

additional safety measures so I expect

that to change

I expect that the EM Cass

what I expect is someone in to fly the

plane without em cos that's what I would

like to see because nobody has expressed

to me if the M casts as a system means

it's a handling maneuver and handling

system or a safety system to prevent

stall so if it is a version of a 737 of

a previous type and the M cast isn't

there then they should build the flight

plane without it so it'd be we need to

know what it's worth

will you be among the families that are

being with mr. mellenburg yes yes and

ask what do you plan to say to him what

he planned his hell him about your

daughter I don't know yet we when we go

to these meetings not like the hearings

but other meetings we share a story

sometimes it's a little bit different

our story I like to share the fact that

my daughter was 24 years old and she was

joyful and fun loving and courageous and

she had no fear of flying and she had to

fly to do some of the things that she

needed to do she had to fly to go to

Nairobi to the UN conference and be a

youth delegate and she had to fly from

East Coast to West Coast for a job or

back and forth through school and

it's a real tragedy tragedy that you

know we should have had some pair of

flying in question it yeah I know we

have jointly decided that there are

specific questions that we're gonna ask

but I have to revisit those just to be

accurate well we I mean we didn't get an

answer today about some the lines of

authority for certification it was

repeated over and over it was asked over

and over again but there seems to be

some resistance and you know

relinquishing their authority to certify

to the FAA that's what I heard today and

it was never never a direct answer

senators kept asking over and over again

so that line of authority is important

and the MCATs what's the fix we did we

he discussed a few fixes today but

ultimately I think he said it was a

handling system which brings on a whole

different thing as Roland said well what

a handling system has taken the plane

down so reference it at safety at one

point so it's kind of interchangeable

depending on the situation
