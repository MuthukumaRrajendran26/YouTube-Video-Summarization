five two nine one sir who's the man in

the sketch that's the that's the

composite of the male that was located

with the vehicle while near the vehicle

pardon me what else can you tell us

about this individual do you believe

that the two missing teens are connected

to him did they know each other at this

time we don't know and that's why we're

reaching out to the public for

assistance we don't know if there is

even a connection between them how did

this man die I don't know

nineteen-year-old meant something

nefarious that there was foul play

involved any clues in their trouble at

this time it's just a missing person

investigation that we're trying to

follow up on all leads we're asking for

the public to try and help us out

if they've seen anybody or if they know

anything since since they'd been

reported missing no there's been no

report from the families I don't know

I'm sorry

and you confirmed that's not a suspect

no photo that's the photo of the

deceased founder of the truck that's

that's true yes

so not near the truck several two

kilometers away from it yeah but we

don't know if they're linked to the

truck or even the young men at all and

this time no I'm sorry any it's possible

it's possible it we have to complex and

dynamic ongoing investigations that are

happening in northern BC and where they

have major crime working on both files

at this time that's all I know

do you believe that the person who

killed Fowler and Di's could have killed

this man I don't know I'm sorry how come

I just don't have that information up

until today our Soompi had been really

downplaying any sort of link any sort of

you know serial killer theories now you

are walking that back you are changing

your tone on that how come

information that was given to us on

Friday we just know more about both of

the incidents since Friday and when

initially reported that an iteration

wasn't yet available

sergeant sorry

sorry sergeant show you it will speak to

the DS Fowler homicide investigation I'm

I'm speaking solely to the missing

people outside of DS Lake so right now

we're using all conventional techniques

including air services police dog

services and search-and-rescue to look

for the missing men is there any

indication that possibly the missing

teens are somehow connected to the

deaths of Fowler and DS are you

suggesting that they're the suspects

potentially I don't know I don't have

that information the investigate it's

possible that they are linked but that's

all I have I'm sorry are you looking at

them though can you say as suspects or

as potential victims at this point I'm

we're looking at them as missing persons

and we're looking to speak with them on

their missing person investigation

that's all so there's no reasons of

interest at this point or at this point

I wouldn't even put them in as that is

there any indication that the teens met

with any sort of foul play they're

missing we don't have any indication

where they are and we don't have any any

further information on the web sorry

about 30 of mine I don't have any other

information other than the last time

they were seen was at that general store

in Indies like I don't know well they

they had headed up to Whitehorse to look

for work but they were last seen in

Dee's Lake on Thursday I don't know if

they're fancy that's another reason that

we're looking for them for further

information if things have changed we

would like to know that information also

there are some parallels here in terms

of I mean it's been a couple of days at

this point you have not been able to

identify that a cease in this case we

understood that Lucas Fowler channa dese

were also not able to be identified

according to their family because of the

nature of their injuries can you

elaborate at all in the the nature of

death and the nature of the injuries

here why are we not getting

identification on the victim in this

case until days after the fact I don't

have that information I'm sorry

elaborate on how he may have been killed

I don't have that fish all i know is

that he was found deceased near nearby

this vehicle that was on fire

with respect to Sarah your question what

why is it taking we don't know who he is

and that's why we're seeking the

public's assistance in helping us to

identify the mannequins composit that

was found two kilometres south but why

can't why can't you give us an

indication of how he died you've got

you've got three people dead within the

course of a week the public is wondering

what is going on they're not getting

answers from the RCMP I think they're

getting their their information from

media from overseas they're putting out

more stuff than what you're giving us

you so why can't you give us an idea of

whether or not there is a linkage are we

talking about a potential serial killer

people in these communities have a right

to know I'll give you an update with

respect to the DS Fowler investigation

so at that point I think some of the

questions that you're asking

may be answered with respect to the

nature of a person's death you know

these are fluid complex dynamic

investigations and we need to be able to

number one verify the information that

we have and then also confirm that the

information is accurate information is

coming in on a momentary basis so we're

getting all kinds of new information and

we need to determine first that the

information is accurate before we're

able or in a position to share that

information externally but it's been you

he was found Friday correct correct

okay Saturday Sunday with now Monday you

can't tell us whether this was a

homicide yet not even we're not even

asking about a weapon we're asking if

it's a homicide or not at this point the

investigation is ongoing

that's all we're in a position to say we

can tell you that we're looking to

identify this man and that if you have

information about this man we're us

you're asked to call police so we're

just going to transition now I'm going

to change a few of the the items on the

board purple man so will remain and if

you have further questions for him I

will provide an update with respect to

the DS Fowler investigation I'm just

going to change a few things here

thanks for your patience

okay good afternoon ladies and gentlemen

thank you so much again for joining us

my name is sergeant Janelle short and

I'm a media relations officer with the

BC RCMP I'm here today to give you an

update with respect to the investigation

into the deaths of Lukas Fowler and

China DS which occurred in northern

British Columbia last last week the

investigation into the double homicide

of 23 year old Lukas Fowler and 24

year-old China DS continues to progress

investigators from the North District

and BC RCMP major crime units are

continuing their efforts we can now

confirm that China and Lucas were the

victims of gun violence and that their

van a 1986 blue Chevrolet van with

Alberta plates was owned by locus Fowler

and was being used by the couple to

explore northern British Columbia

investigators are working through a

number of tips and tasks including

speaking with individuals who so saw or

spoke to the couple analyzing forensic

and digital evidence along with

reviewing hours of CCTV and dashcam

video footage the number and types of

specialized services and units and

investigators continues to fluctuate

based on investigative need today we're

asking for the public's assistance in

identifying a man whom investigators

wish to speak with the man seen in this

composite sketch was seen speaking to

Lucas on the evening of July 14th 2019

on highway 97 he is described as

Caucasian with darker skin and dark hair

he's shorter than Lucas who stood 6 foot

3 and has a possible beard or glasses

the man may be associated to an older

model Jeep Grand Cherokee sorry

Jeep Cherokee with a black stripe on the

hood and black light or bull bar with

small lights with covers he was believed

to have been traveling south

in addition to the composite sketch on

our website we will be releasing video

footage taken at a gas station in fort

nelson on July 13th 2019 that video

surveillance footage shows the couple

arriving in Lucas's van at approximately

7:30 p.m. and departing the gas station

at 7:47 p.m. all those materials will be

available on our website following this

media availability the Fowler family

have arrived from British Columbia and

have been meeting with the police over

the course of the last few days the DS

family continue to receive regular

updates with respect to the

investigation and currently have no

plans to visit British Columbia the BC

coroner's service is continuing their

investigation into these deaths and will

not be providing further updates at this

time the Fowler family has graciously

agreed to be here this afternoon and

Chief Inspector Stephen Fowler will join

us following the media availability to

provide some brief contents comments

police are again appealing to the public

to come forward and speak with

investigators about any interactions or

conversations that you had with China or

Lucas about observations regarding their

van we've also seen on social and

mainstream media many accounts from

people who have information for

investigators and it is imperative prior

to sharing that information with anybody

else that you speak to our

investigations so you can give us that

information firsthand and your first

account if you have information in

relation to the man seen in this

composit sketch and can help us identify

him or information information relating

to China or Lucas death or their van

you're asked to call the major crime tip

line at one eight seven seven five four

three four eight two two or locally

seven seven eight two nine zero five two

nine one we have two major

investigations

within the northern BC we are mindful

that this is an area of seasonal

tourists and travelers and campers from

abroad as well as motorists and

businesses moving from BC Alberta and

the Northwest Territories the Yukon and

Alaska we are asking those who have may

have been in the area during the times

we've listed and may have information or

seen anything or have dashcam video -

please call our tipline with respect to

public safety we share the concerns that

are raised

given the tragic and unusual nature of

these two investigations that we have

underway we would like to stress the

importance of heightened vigilance an

awareness for anybody traveling in and

around the area we encourage people to

camp in known or established areas and

locations in addition general safety

precautions continue to prevail

make sure your families aware and have a

plan make sure your family is aware of

what your plan is establish check-in

times and provide updates stick to those

update times if your chance plans change

please ensure your family and contacts

are aware thank you I want to be clear

this man is not a suspect he is a person

with whom investigators wish to speak

and are interested in speaking to with

respect to the the vehicle he was last

believed to be associated with is a

older model Jeep Cherokee with a black

stripe on the hood so similar to a

racing stripe that would go from the

lights up to the windshield a black

light or bull bar with small lights

which were covered he was believed to

have been traveling southbound now we

recognize that this man may not benefit

he the investigators are interested in

speaking to him so if this is you or you

know this who this is we ask you to

please call our tipline

so that investigators can contact you

you know what I don't have that detail

if I can get it to you David I will we

had heard from a witness that on the

Sunday night there was an individual who

was seen with mr. Fowler and Miss DS and

there seemed to be some sort of hid

exchange going on is is this the same

person that was talking to Lucas you

believe so the information that we have

is that there was a man who was seen

speaking to Lucas Fowler and that is the

individual that you see in this

composite sketch here with regards to

the heated exchange that's not the

information that I have there was a

conversation my understanding is and

that that's why investigators are

looking to speak with this individual

who may have information did the witness

provide though any and the one who gave

this this sketch give any indication of

what they may have heard as far as what

the tone was of that conversation what

was happening at the time it's my

understanding that there were no words

that the witness could speak to you that

they witness it as they were driving by

and then provided the composite sketch

can you elaborate any more on a

potential motive for the double homicide

here I mean you referenced how

concerning it is to the public can you

definitively rule out the public is not

at risk from this you know potentially

you also can't rule out that it is

potentially a serial killer at this

point can you say were these two

targeted was it a crime of opportunity

motive sexual assault robbery can you

give the public any sort of information

in that regard yeah I mean Sarah I

recognize that those are questions that

you really want to have answers to and

those are questions we're looking for

the answers to as well we are absolutely

looking for anybody who has information

with respect to that and certainly you

know as the investigations as you know

investigations are fluid and dynamic and

we have information coming in we're

certainly looking for the answers to

that those questions that you're asking

as well

we we we can't say definitively they are

we certainly are open to those

possibilities and our investigators are

speaking to each other sharing

information and certainly looking at the

possibility of that they may be linked

understandably that this isn't you know

it's unusual to have two major

investigations undergoing of this nature

in northern BC at the same time and so

we recognize that there is a possibility

of that base could be linked how

concerning is that just I mean from the

perspective of the RCMP this is

obviously has international media

attention on it

this is very rare that we would see

something like this a potential serial

killer on the loose and a very remote

part of the province how concerning is

that to you as an RCMP member seeing

something like this well I mean I I

recognize that there are concerns with

respect to people's safety and I want to

ensure that people are aware that we're

doing everything that we can in order to

ensure that we can advance this

investigation to the best of our

abilities and find the person or persons

responsible you know we're reassuring

the public that to taste safe to proper

safety precautions and ensure that you

have a plan and I mean I recognize that

there are concerns and we're doing the

best that we can and we have resources

that are able to to surge and support

those investigations and have surged in

and in in support in the investigations

was miss DS sexually assaulted you know

I don't have any information relating to

that

well I don't have specific statistics

relating to that I can tell you that in

my time here it is unusual I mean we we

have seen homicides but generally

speaking not of this nature at this

point there's no indications that any

previous or ongoing investigations

relating to highway 16 are related to

these investigations in northern British

Columbia at this point do you believe

the suspect might still be in the

province have you engaged authorities in

the Yukon in Alaska

I mean we're sharing information with

everybody and that I mean the

investigation is ongoing and active and

that would be part of any just like here

today we're sharing information with the

public because we want to get

information so certainly we are sharing

with policing partners nationally

internationally across provincial have

we been in touch though with policing

partners in the Yukon and and in Alaska

certainly we're sharing just as we would

in any investigation that would be part

of our investigative protocols in order

to share information so that if somebody

has information that can help us support

our investigation that they get in touch

so just last question here

yeah I mean certainly in I mean at this

point we're looking for anybody that has

dashcam video we recognize that that is

you know one of the advantages of now

technology that a lot of people have

dashcam video or may have been out and

taking nature shots and seeing this very

identifiable 1986 blue van or have

information relating to China and and

mr. Fowler in other regards so I mean

yes there are there are some some

difficulties that being said you know we

are the RCMP and we have the ability to

bring resources in specialized resources

in and and standalone in an operational

capacity should that be required but

certainly we recognize that you know we

are still asking for for people if you

have not already spoken to police you

have dashcam video or you have

information relating to their

disappearance to police call our tipline

are you operating on the theory that cam

and briar are alive or dead absolutely

we're hopeful that they are alive and

anybody with information in relation to

that investigation is also asked to call

our tipline

I don't believe that that it that we're

entertaining that as a as a possibility

at this point we are certainly

investigating them as missing persons

and we're hopeful that they are going to

get in contact with us when they see

this news information and this broadcast

going out but I don't believe that that

is something that we're looking at at

this point we are investigating them as

missing persons at this point so the

father is Chief Inspector Stephen Fowler

is here and I want to allow him an

opportunity to come in and say a few

words and have an opportunity to see you

and speak with you so don't want to

delay that much more I will be available

after if you have questions please feel

free to email me so chief inspector good

afternoon

as you know I may be an experienced

police officer but today I'm standing

here is the father of the murder victim

we are just distraught this is really

torn two families apart our son Lucas

was having the time of his life

traveling the world he met a beautiful

young lady and they teamed up they're a

great pair and they fell in love

we were overjoyed for Lucas he came to

Canada and he planned a trip in a van

with China we'd been talking about it

we'd been discussing his trip and he

communicated with us

as they were leaving what happened after

that

time will tell I guess we are hopeful of

a positive outcome and obviously we're

appealing along with the RM CP for

anyone to contact who may have any

information whatsoever however little

please contact the police I'll take

questions there are some difficulties

with the dates because of the time

differences between Australia and Canada

but we were in contact within hours of

him leaving on this trip

look Lucas was was just a fun-loving guy

who you know had a goal to travel the

world he he saved up all his money

whilst he was working in Sydney he set

out on an adventure with a mate along

that tour he met China and they became

an inseparable pair you know it's it's a

love story that's ended tragically it

really is it's the worst ever love story

because we now have two young people who

had everything ahead of them tragically

murdered mr. Fowler you've brought some

colleagues with you to BC wondering if

you can just speak to the capacity that

they are here with you and your family

and and how they are taking part in the

investigation if at all I'm very

grateful to the Commissioner of New

South Wales Police the police and the

Australian government have bent over

backwards for my family and I they have

provided me with support and part of

that support that was offered was the

services of two of our detectives to act

as liaison between the family and the RM

CP

we've got no specific plans in place at

this stage we're taking it a day at a

time it's extremely difficult for all of

us and we just hope to be able to take a

breath and as I say we work in

communication because of where he was we

were using services available at the

time but within hours of him leaving I

know there's been a lot of speculation

but look as an experienced police

officer I know how these investigations

go my family I are more than satisfied

with the resources of the RM CP that

they're putting into this and I can tell

you I am more than confident in the

commitment of all the officers who are

working on this case mr. Fowler maybe if

you feel comfortable speaking to it you

kind of addressed it when you first got

to the podium but you're used to doing

what we are seeing Sargent doing in New

South Wales how surreal is it for you to

be sort of on the other side of of this

tragic situation here in Canada look at

it as the police officer you you work

with families all the time and you get a

feel for the lay of the land as you as

you see but nothing prepares me nothing

prepares my family for what we are going

through now

I'm not going to be drawn into anything

in relation to the investigations that

are taking place by the RNC Pete
