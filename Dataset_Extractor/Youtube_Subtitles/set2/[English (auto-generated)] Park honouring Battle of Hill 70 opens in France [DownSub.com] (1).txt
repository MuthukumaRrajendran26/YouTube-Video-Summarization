in August 1917 more than 1,800 Canadian

soldiers died at Hill 70 thousands more

were injured troops seized and held the

strategic hill above the town of laws

the Canadian Corps led for the first

time by a Canadian Lefton in General

Arthur Currie and now 102 years after

the battle an impressive memorial site

near Hill 70 to honor the sacrifice of

those soldiers

of course these regimens and the

families never forgot

Ron Lucas's grandfather James died here

but his body was never found this is an

emotional day when Lucas first visited

the site nine years ago it was just a

field I always come here to see the

progress and to see it complete it today

is just I can't put it into words john

cowan is part of the team that spent a

decade making it happen it's one thing

to have an idea but gosh it's not all

that often that it works on this kind of

scale Cowen says public awareness of

nearby Vimy Ridge is partly due to the

impressive memorial at that battle site

the people who built the Vimy memorial

in the 30s between the wars never

imagined in a million years that hill 70

which was viewed as at least equal to

Vimy would be forgotten the obelisk at

Hill 70 is now surrounded by landscaped

hills and walkways six of the paths

representing the Canadian soldiers who

were awarded the Victoria Cross among

them company sergeant major Robert Hill

Hana it's hard to believe that a hundred

and two years after my father was here

that we're standing here in the same

same site Bob Hannah's family now

honoring Roberts bravery with each

footstep yeah it's really important for

us all to be here and experience this

together as a family this park now a

place for Canadians to pay their

respects

ensuring Hill 70 will never again be

Canada's forgotten battle Redman Shannon
