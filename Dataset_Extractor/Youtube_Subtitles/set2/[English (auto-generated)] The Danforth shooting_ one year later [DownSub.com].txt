it was a beautiful Sunday night it was a

summer evening we had no reason to

suspect that anything would happen

[Music]

sometimes it's like a bad night dream

[Applause]

[Music]

as the blood filled my lungs like it was

getting harder and harder to breathe

[Music]

Sam was out with some friends it was a

birthday party for her friend and they

had decided to go out for ice cream on

the Danforth and they were just standing

around chatting enjoying the evening

when this all unfolded we got a call

from a stranger

using Samantha's phone to tell us that

there had been a shooting and that she

was explaining to us that her daughter

was involved but we didn't realize at

the time was that Samantha had been shot

at basically at point-blank range had

fallen she had her back to the shooter

so she didn't actually see until she

reacted to being shot and then quickly

went down so she didn't wasn't sure what

happened to her friends and as it turned

out unfortunately one of the her friends

was killed who is Rhys Fallon

[Music]

we were just having a coffee with three

of my friend in here enjoying the good

Sunday nights and then suddenly we heard

the firecrackers first we thought that

these are the firecrackers but it was a

gunshot unfortunately

G of my friends they just try to run

away and just jump on them and hide

myself behind a stone bench that I sit

and then the shooter he just stopped for

a few seconds to change his magazine at

that point I just stand up and try to

understand what's going on at that point

I came face to face with respond

she was just shot by from her arm and

she asked help from me and call 9-1-1

he stopped the shooting again what of us

and at that point mother of my friend he

just came back and grabbed me and we

started to run away while we are talking

with Rhys

she has been hit by three times from her

back I guess at that point Ivan also hit

the bullet is just glazed my back when

we turned back to the scene I saw the

risk falling was lying down beside the

tree and there was a bunch of people

trying to help her they were doing the

CPR and trying to stop in her bleeding

but our four unfortunately they weren't

successful there was a bunch of people

on the floor they were bleeding the

police officers the fire departments and

emergency departments they were trying

to help them he was saying qaul you're

all gonna die you old

[Music]

I was on the patio with Jerry and a good

friend of ours celebrating her birthday

and we had ordered like quite an array

of different Italian foods we were I

think you know two-thirds of the way

through our meal when I heard gunshots

shortly thereafter the a staff person

came out and said that there was a

shooter out and and that we should all

come inside for safety and I could I was

in complete disbelief a woman had had

entered saying that there was an injured

party outside Jerry said he wanted to go

out and and help this person and I I

said that I would go with him so we we

walked out and I only took one or two

steps outside when I saw a man just

standing across the street there was a

bright red flash and I heard a gunshot

I heard wood just screams and then I

ducked I had just enough time to kind of

to turn when I was I was hit in the

chest mid chest and I collapsed

immediately in the doorway of the

restaurant I heard someone say that

Daniel was shot and then that's why I

got up and just I I just went into this

like survivor mode and went to help

Daniel

I could sense that I didn't have like a

feeling in my legs it was like a

numbness and I was bleeding profusely

from my like gunshot wound
