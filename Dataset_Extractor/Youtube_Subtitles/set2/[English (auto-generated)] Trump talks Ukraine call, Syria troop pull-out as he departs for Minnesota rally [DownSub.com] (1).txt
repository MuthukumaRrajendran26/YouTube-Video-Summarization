I think it's very unfair to heads of

countries when they think every time

they make a conversation I have a

conversation with the President of the

United States it's going to be on you

know all over the world I think that's

very unfair but in the case in the case

of what we're talking about we released

a perfect conversation the president of

Ukraine just confirmed that and that

should be case over I will say this Adam

Schiff took that conversation before he

saw it and fabricated a conversation to

me that's criminal what he did is

criminal

[Music]

I just don't think you're running a

country I just don't think that you can

have all of these people testifying

about every conversation you've had in

this case we have a transcript and I've

given it almost immediately

it's called transparency nobody's been

more transparent than me so you have a

transcript and in this case you also

have the president of Ukraine confirming

that absolutely it was a perfect

conversation but the Democrats have

committed crimes because they made up

the conversation the whistleblower was

wrong no I don't think people should be

allowed you have to run a country I

don't think you should be allowed to do

say it

[Music]

I can

you're talking about in UK they're in

the process of being spoken to we're

working on that I did have a

conversation yesterday with Boris

Johnson a good one and we're talking

about diplomatic community it's a very

interesting situation we are trying to

work something out so we're gonna work

we're gonna try and work something out I

think we'll be able to

[Music]

how many people can they talk to we had

a simple conversation everybody knows

what the conversation was because I gave

it immediately when I heard about it the

whistleblower who seems to be a Democrat

that's involved with a lot of people

gave a false interpretation of the

conversation because we have the

conversation the president of Ukraine

just said just now that the conversation

was absolutely perfect no problem it was

a very good conversation so I don't know

why they'd be calling Rick Perry I don't

know why they'd be calling all these

people it's a very bad situation for our

country who's reported

well I hope not again I don't know how

he knows these people what okay well

then they're clients I mean unities got

a lot of clients so I just don't know I

haven't spoken to Rudy about it I don't

know I will say this from what I heard I

just heard about this they said we have

nothing to do with it we're totally we

have nothing to do with it was i watch

China has to do whatever they want if

they want to look into something they

can look into it if they don't want to

look into it they don't have to frankly

as far as I'm concerned if China wants

to look into something I think that's

great and if they don't want to I think

that's great too

that's up to China yeah

[Music]

well Chet trey gowdy is a terrific guy I

think there's a problem with he can't

start for another couple of months

because of lobbying rules and

regulations so you'll have to ask about

that I just heard trey gowdy can't start

till sometime after January because of

the lobbying rules and regulations so I

don't know so we'll have to see perhaps

the last one I hope I hope the last one

up to three I hope it's going to be the

last one look we have no soldiers in

Syria

we've won we beat Isis and we beat them

badly and decisively we have no soldiers

the last thing I want to do is bring

thousands and thousands of soldiers in

and defeat everybody again we've already

done that so what we have is really two

choices you have the choice of bringing

in the military and defeating everybody

again or you have the choice of

financially doing some very strong

things for Turkey so that they take it a

little bit easy on really competition

that is I don't think it's being fairly

treated in many ways okay we have a very

good relationship with Kurds or we can

mediate I hope we can mediate John I

hope we can media

turkey knows where I stand and the last

thing what okay very simple

we had a big victory we left the area I

don't think the American people want to

see us go back in with our military go

back into that area again we won we left

the area I don't think we want to go

back in let's see what happens we are

going to possibly do something very very

tough with respect to sanctions and

other financial things

I think we can win it's been a long time

since a Republican won we have a 20,000

seat auditorium you know we have the

essentially Madison Square Garden and

it's sold out over 80,000 people

requested tickets it'll be totally sold

out I don't know who's going but it'll

be totally sold out if you're not going

to be there I'm going to miss you but

they have a line now that's many blocks

long it's amazing we have we have a line

right now in in Minnesota that's many

blocks long I think I can win Minnesota

I think Omar is helping us win in

Minnesota and other place I'll see you

all I'll see you in Minnesota I'll see

you in Minnesota
