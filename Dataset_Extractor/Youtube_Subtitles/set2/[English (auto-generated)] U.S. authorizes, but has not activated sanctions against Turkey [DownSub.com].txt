hello everybody so I just met with

President Trump and he is authorized and

will be signing a new executive order

giving the Treasury Department in

consultation with himself and secretary

Pompeo very significant new sanctions

authorities that can be targeted at any

person associated with the government of

Turkey any portion of the government

this will be both primary sanctions and

secondary sanctions that will be

applicable the president is concerned

about the ongoing military offensive and

potential targeting of civilians

civilian infrastructure ethnic or

religious minorities and also the

president wants to make very clear it is

imperative that turkey not allow even a

single Isis fighter to escape again I

want to emphasize at this point we are

not activating the sanctions but as the

president has said he will provide very

significant authorities based upon the

continuing efforts so he will be signing

this they will be active we will be

working in consultation with the

Department of Defense and Department of

State to monitoring this very quickly we

are putting financial institutions on

notice that they should be careful and

that there could be sanctions again

there are no sanctions at this time but

this will be the broadest executive

authorities delegated to us

and can you tell us when would you put

it through sanctions and what would it

actually actually okay well on no I

don't think he thinks his actions are

what led to this it is a complicated

situation is a situation that we're all

concerned about and the humanitarian

situation and there are very clear

discussions that will be going on

between the Department of Defense and

the State Department I just got off the

phone with the finance minister and we

will be communicating specifics that

we're not going to tell I want to make

sure everybody knew in advance I wasn't

talking about China because I didn't

when I think I was calling his specific

China meeting we have had productive two

days of discussions ambassador light

Houser and myself with the Vice Premier

and others we will be meeting with the

president shortly we will be updating

the president on those he'll then be

meeting with the Vice Premier I wouldn't

be surprised if like usual he decides to

invite a few of you in but I'm not going

to make any other comments in advance of

us meeting with the president the stock

market is very optimistic about what it

sees over at the US two years TRS office

are they right to be optimistic

stock markets always right

again I'm not I'm not going to make any

more comments I've said we've had

productive two days of discussions we'll

be making more announcements after we

meet with the president

yes so far Turkey has not been dissuaded

by anything this administration has done

or the president has said what makes you

confident that the announcement that you

just made is going to change turkeys why

I don't know I don't agree with your

premise I'm not going to comment on

specific confidential discussions that

have been going on on different levels

so I don't think that's a good premise

but again these are very powerful

sanctions we hope we don't have to use

them but we can shut down the Turkish

economy if we need to these sanctions

help these US allies who say they have

been abandoned again it's a complicated

military situation that is ongoing there

are discussions I think the president

has had very specific discussions as I

said the Department of Defense we have

expectations this is a way of making

sure that we protect the manatorian

issues and the other people on the

ground I'm not aware of anything that's

changed but again I'm not confirming

that I just haven't heard anything one

way or another with lawmakers like

Lindsey Graham senator Van Hollen who

has been really very critical of the

pullout of US troops from Syria

secretary Pompeo has been speaking to

them daily I've been speaking to the

secretary multiple times a day I think

the message to Congress is I know that

people were contemplating sanctions were

on top of sanctions the president will

use them when necessary

thank you everybody

you

you
