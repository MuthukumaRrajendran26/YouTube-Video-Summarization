welcome to our special presentation on

western alienation here on global news

now over the next half hour we're gonna

look at the issues that have led to

where we are today the players involved

and the way forward but to go forward we

should look to the Past and get an idea

of the representation Alberta and

Saskatchewan have sent to Ottawa since

joining Confederation now over the

course of the first 50 years in Canada

for the two provinces results were mixed

but a turning point came in 1958 that

was when John Diefenbaker 's Progressive

Conservatives took all but one seat in

the two provinces was a victory built

largely on a road to resources policy

that stoked northern and western

interests since that election

conservative parties have dominated

winning almost 95 percent of the seats

contested between the two provinces and

of course in 2019 not one seat went to

the Liberals and just one to a party

other than the Conservatives but even

since 1958 there's been a sense of well

constant malaise and sometimes vigorous

protests when it comes to how the West

is viewed the Federation till cynics

poked with a political scientist to

learn more about the ins and outs of the

movement idea of Western alienation has

flared up different points during our

history

what makes this flare-up different than

in the past I think what's really

different about this flare-up is that it

coincides with this existential moment

for the oil industry in the oil and gas

industry here in Alberta that is facing

an extraordinarily uncertain future

because of concerns about climate change

and that means that we have both the

traditional Western alienation layered

on with fear about economic dislocation

and and changed to the source of

prosperity for the province the goal of

political movements

I would assume would be to impact change

and when we look back on this issue both

historically and I guess now currently

can we point to anything that tells us

okay this is going to make a difference

I

in legislation or how we are heard as a

province in Ottawa one of the ways that

Western alienation has had an enormous

effect on Canadian politics has been as

a driver of change in the party system

and so we've seen it both the sort of

left populist the progressives the CCF

which then become the NDP come out of

the West and they change Canadian

politics in all kinds of ways by the

same token we think can think back to

the Reform Party that broke apart the

Progressive Conservative Party's

coalition and changed the Canadian party

system really profoundly so you know

there are certainly policy dimensions

that come with that but the the

fundamental driver is changing the shape

of political competition and you know

when we look across the history of

Canada really that has been the biggest

impact in my view of these periodic

uprisings of Western alienation

indigenous rights First Nations rights

play a role in here and I feel like we

don't often hear a lot about that how

would you say indigenous rights play a

role in this issue well I think you know

if we look at the Western separatism

movement I mean specifically it really

is a movement led by and and for the

most part followed by white men there is

very little consideration of indigenous

rights and I think even a lack of

appreciation of the historical and legal

relationship between indigenous

communities and the Canadian crown not

just the Canadian government but the

crown and so when you talk about

breaking up Canada what you're doing is

talking about breaking up the

relationship between indigenous

communities that have signed treaties

with the crown and that is something

that anyone who's talking about taking

the West or parts of the West out of

Confederation needs to take into account

and take very seriously one of the hot

points in the relationship between

Alberta and Canada came in 2001 when six

prominent Albertans sent premier Ralph

Klein what is now known

as the firewall letter now some of those

demands have been recycled into what's

called the fair deal panel examining

Alberta's place in the Federation here's

Adam McVicker nine proposals all aimed

at giving Alberta a fair deal in

Confederation while experts say many of

the ideas are possible they will come at

a cost

take establishing an Alberta pension

plan no other province has ever

attempted to pull out of the CPP and it

has upsides and downsides

so Alberta withdrawing might have some

short-term gains for us and might have

some short-term costs for contributors

elsewhere but who knows what the future

holds and it would be riskier for

Alberta to have its own pension plan

collecting our own income taxes could

also be a costly endeavor to mess

tomates establishing a separate Revenue

Agency would cost five hundred million

dollars per year to duplicate

administrative agencies meanwhile

Alberta's contract with the RCMP expires

in 2032 it cost the province two hundred

and thirty five million dollars every

year and rolling out a new police force

would take a decade that will add to

what the province is paying now but the

benefits aren't solely about costs does

it achieve an on cost benefit in terms

of being able to deploy people more

quickly respond to crime initiatives

like real crime more effectively while

the costs may be high to achieve these

proposals one of the original signers of

the firewall letter says the benefits

shouldn't be measured in cost alone I

think the costs are real and those of us

who are promoting these ideas should not

pretend that those costs aren't there

but we should recognize that the costs

are in the government the benefits go to

the population of Alberta our report on

the panel's findings will be released in

March giving Albertans a better idea of

just how costly a fair deal may be

adamak vicar global news coming up

economic issues have dominated this

debate for a long time what are they and

how do they translate today we'll have

that next

there's no communications you're great

now between the west and the east and

until you solve that and have them

working together like adults

you'll never get fair share of

everything and just after the October

election if those polled Canadians on

divisions within the country and 59%

agreed we are more divided as a country

than ever

39% disagreed with that statement and in

our region the number was massively

higher 79% in Alberta and 77% in

Saskatchewan believe there is a problem

on the questions of whether we would be

better off as a separate country and

getting its fair share our two provinces

are in relative lockstep with each other

and joining us with more on the poll and

its findings is Kyle Bray and senior

vice president of hips sews and he joins

us now from Vancouver so what's what's

your first take on this well you covered

it Canadians are grumpy they see a

country that's divided I mean you

certainly mentioned the numbers in

Alberta and Saskatchewan which are much

higher than everywhere else but it's not

just their Canadians across the country

can see what's going on it's a majority

in every region of the country who think

that the country is more divided than

ever so Kyle the sentiments of

separation is clearly stronger here in

Alberta but right across the country

especially in Quebec those numbers do

not bear out no they don't this is talk

about Western alienation and that issue

it's really Alberta and Saskatchewan

that are speaking up right now 33

percent you know looking at the idea of

separation in Alberta 27 percent in in

Saskatchewan for comparison Quebec which

is always the highest number is only at

26 percent now so lower than both of

those two prairie provinces and the

numbers are in the you know near the ten

percent range in the rest of the country

so really it's about Alberta and

Saskatchewan and their particular issues

today appreciate it thank you Kyle while

perhaps the biggest flashpoint issue in

this entire debate centers on

equalization now many Western

politicians have pointed out that the

formula hurts western provinces

especially Alberta Fletcher Kent takes a

look at

the complicated issue and how it's being

used well equalization is about numbers

lots of them but the equalization debate

well that involves a lot more emotion

why does the federal government want to

take our tax dollars and redistribute

them but not allow us to develop the

wealth which pays for those bills and

this is an environment that is very very

different than it has been just even a

few years ago and most certainly ten

years ago now Mel Macmillan studies

Equalization and notes there is a lot of

rhetoric involved here I think many many

politicians find it advantageous to

confuse the issue now in simplest terms

the program takes money from federal

taxes and distributes it to the

so-called have-nots provinces that need

help paying for services like health

care and education now the calculation

is based in part on how much revenue a

province would receive if it adopted the

average national tax rate and by that

math Alberta is not poor we have the

highest average income 30% higher than

the national average

Elbert also has just 11% of the

population but people and businesses in

the province contribute 14% of the total

federal tax revenue also we're young so

we don't draw as much from CPP or from

old age security as such Albertans send

about 20 billion dollars per year more

to Ottawa than comes back through all

transfers now many politicians tend to

seize on that number but McMillan says

that's not all about equalization it

also includes other transfers and the

rhetoric and confusion is often about

playing the victim

I think it is potentially dangerous or

at least confusing and I think people

are better able to make decisions if

they understand the facts now McMillan

doesn't think the formula is perfect

historically Alberta governments have

relied on oil royalties to help pay for

services and much of that revenue has

disappeared in equalization well it

doesn't do very well handling such big

and sudden changes on the other hand

Alberta chooses lower taxes and the

argument could be made that why should

the rest of the country subsidize those

choices for example if Quebec chose to

lower its taxes Albertans would likely

be outraged if Ottawa sent more money

East to compensate so the answers well

they're not exactly clear but this is an

important debate but Macmillan says it

ought to be just about the numbers and

the details and less about being a

political tool that seizes on feelings

of victimization and alienation so what

would this type of special presentation

be without a robust discussion on the

issues facing us for that we've brought

in our provincial affairs reporter Tom

Vernon to lead that discussion with some

guests who have a wealth of opinions Tom

yeah that's right thanks so much Linda

and Gord I'm joined by Ryan Jefferson's

firm 630 shed in Edmonton and Daniel

Smith's from Global News radio in

Calgary now you guys you guys have your

ear to the ground you hear from

listeners every day on these types of

issues Equalization it's a very

complicated topic has it been weaponized

by Prairie premiers no I mean of course

it has and then it's it's smart strategy

from Prairie premiers that are looking

to get the best deal they can for their

jurisdictions I mean that's essentially

their job description isn't it so it's

no surprise that Jason Kenney as a

tactical politician as an understanding

of the potential and I think Fletcher's

piece touched on something and that's

the fact that most Canadians whether we

admit it or not are quite confused about

how equalization actually works and

that's perfect

for politicians yeah what's your sense

Daniel well it didn't always used to be

this way I spoke with Tom Flanagan who

was one of the original offer authors on

that firewall letter and he said they

didn't include equalization in that

letter because it wasn't a flashpoint at

the time I think this is something to

understand about Albertans as long as

they feel the formulas fair as long as

they feel that they genuinely are

helping out other provinces who can't

pay their own way who are know don't

have the same revenues there isn't going

to be this flashpoint but I can I can

point to the exact moment where it

became an issue became an issue when

Francois Francois Nago was was bragging

about the fact that his province had yet

another surplus and was going to be able

to pay down debt and then said but we

don't want to have a pipeline going

through our province we don't want

Alberta's dirty oil and then the very

next day it turned out there was extra

money in the equalization fund and a

Finance Minister Bill Morneau gave him a

billion dollars it was because of those

things being connected that that people

said wait a minute you don't want us to

be able to continue with our economy

growing it generating this revenue but

you want the revenue and that's when it

became a flashpoint I think it was

weaponized

by a Quebec premier not by the western

premiers well I'm curious so you talked

about you know developing our economy

here do you think economic anxiety is

out here in the West add to the anger

with this formula oh absolutely it does

I mean I think if we were able to do

well if we felt like we were able to

build pipelines get our economy back

going I can tell you I think the issue

of equalization would would fade almost

to nothing one thing that stillness does

need to be addressed though and even

josey see when he was finance minister

addressed this is this fiscal

stabilization formula it's designed to

to to hurt Alberta because it has a cap

on it Jason kenny's talked about this if

it didn't have a cap on it we would be

getting seven hundred million dollars

from that fund and we didn't get that so

I think that regardless of what your

political leanings are if you've got

both the NDP and the Conservatives

saying that that part of the formula is

not fair and it's not fair okay one

thing we have to keep in mind Tom though

to be real and I'm certainly not going

to defend Quebec premiers position on

pipelines or anything else Danielle

that's for sure but in so many ways as

Quebec brags about having a surplus and

paying down debt and for that matter

offering affordable day care and

everything else Alberta brags about no

sales tax and it is undeniable that if

Alberta taxed its residents the same as

almost every other province tax there's

we'd be running a surplus and this would

be less of a conversation there would be

no deficit and that's something we

conveniently ignore because we've

convinced ourselves that it's

unpalatable the idea of a consumption

tax in Alberta yeah a lot to talk about

on western alienation we'll be back with

Ryan and Danielle in a few minutes we'll

go back to you Linda and Gordon thanks

guys so not everyone is high on the idea

of fuelling an east-west divide we're

gonna go to Lethbridge and find out how

they're talking about the idea of

western alienation next well we

definitely need some more attention from

the federal government absolutely feds

got to get involved in some of these

pipeline issues and definitely someone's

got to make a stand there are pockets of

our province that have weathered the

economic downturn better than others and

are not necessarily hot on the idea of

western alienation now one of those is

the left bridge region an area where

agriculture not oil and gas is among the

key economic drivers thought Ralston has

more

mr. micawber out to or just us Leighton

Kolk has been in the cattle business for

more than 30 years he now runs his

family farm north of Lethbridge

he says business these days is okay but

not without challenges and understands

why there's frustration among many

Albertans as the province tries to claw

out of a downturn it's been a producing

province and we love all our consumers

wherever they are but we still need to

have the ability to do business Colt

feels there is a disconnect between

what's important to Primary Industries

like farming and Ottawa but doesn't

believe breaking up the country is the

answer recognizing the value of each

player each province each government is

a much better approach agriculture is

among the industries that have helped

shield parts of southern Alberta from

the energy downturn political

sociologist Trevor Harrison believes

those conditions have helped quell

separatist sentiments in this part of

the province some way or another we have

to diversify the economy southern

Alberta has done that to some extent the

rest the province has to do that as well

back on the farm this longtime cattle

producer hopes inter provincial fences

can be mended with everyone getting an

equal say it's like a relationship if

there's one person always willing to

take and not willing to give at some

point that relationship falls apart

Tom Ralston Global News now in Brad Wall

stepped down as premier of Saskatchewan

in 2018 he helped form the buffalo

projects a self-described group of

concerned citizens in Alberta and

Saskatchewan Buffalo's members are

Federalists not separatists they want

Premier's Scott Moe and Jason Kenney

to continue pushing for a new deal for

the West the buffalo project is a

behind-the-scenes effort and it's not

known how many members there are or how

much money has been raised

critics liken it to an american-style

political action committee there's lots

of people making noise up there I don't

see a lot of people focused on really

important solutions for the long term

vision of this country and so that means

we have to stay a little quieter to do

that I think we're fine doing that

the name Buffalo project comes from a

proposal in the early 1900s

that would have made Alberta and

Saskatchewan a single province for more

on the Buffalo project and what it does

and what its goals are you can head to

our website global news CA / western

alienation the red-hot debate in all of

this what about separation is it a

viable option that's after the break so

we've talked about the issues of

alienation and what can be done to

cooperate on both the federal and

provincial level but there's also the

issue of separation and a hard core

group of supporters who want to make a

go of it on our own

here's silvana Ben allege with that I've

never felt this frustrated and angry in

my life it's been a tough couple of

years for Armond la santé he had to

shutter the business he spent years

building due to the economic downturn

with creditors calling and bills piling

up it cost him his marriage the 50 year

old admits he's had some pretty dark

moments I was upstairs in my bedroom and

I was you know I had you know I had a I

had a gun in my mouth and I was ready to

do what I had to do or what I felt at

that time I had to do because I just I

couldn't handle the pressure any longer

Asante feels federal government policies

are responsible for crushing economic

growth in the West and he's not alone

the wex it or western exit movement to

separate from Canada has exploded since

the federal election the group has more

than 270,000 members on its Facebook

page hundreds of people showed up at

recent rallies in the province saying

the West wants out wex it has even

applied for federal political party

status we want people to hear to have a

high quality of life and it's only

through self-determination which can

only come through separation that we're

going to achieve it and we will achieve

it but any talk of Western separation

would need the support of First Nations

which have treaties with the crown one

Saskatchewan chief says separation is

not going to happen for decades we have

not had our voice word we have been

somewhat alienated from from discussions

and whatnot welcome to our life you

don't see us crying and complaining and

wanting to separate from the rest of

Canada burl Asante there's only one way

forward for West

in Canada as for anyone who thinks works

it is a bluff oh they think we're joking

out here this is no joke

Silvana pedelec global news now let's go

to our panel for some final thoughts tom

vernon is in Edmonton Tom yeah that's

right so back with Ryan Jesperson and

Danielle Smith so obviously right after

the election the legs of Facebook page

in that movement saw a lot of action

online

I assume you're hearing Ryan a lot of it

on your radio show and on your text line

as well yeah I mean a little bit I mean

I just want to correct that that one

fellow there at the end of the news

story saying that this is not a joke

this is most definitely a joke but

what's not a joke is the fact that many

albertans are feeling alienated and

that's something that needs to be taken

seriously but what powerful commentary

there from an indigenous voice saying

welcome to our world it doesn't solve

any problem and it creates about a

thousand of them to try to leave Canada

I will say this if somebody hates

Alberta's relationship with Canada so

much that they want to just walk out

there's nothing stopping anybody from

leaving Tom Danielle is it dangerous to

ignore this sentiment though do these

conversations have to be had I think

Jason Kenny's got the middle road but

his fair deal really is a solution that

I think brings albertans together just

asserting more autonomy for Alberta and

taking charge of those areas that have

been left to federal jurisdiction the

reason it's the middle way though is

because the wax udders understand you

can't separate if you can't collect your

own income taxes if you don't have your

own pension system if you don't have

your own immigration program if you

don't have your own policing so I think

that the wax udders see the fair deal as

a means to an end and so it's it's very

likely that a lot of those policies are

going to be implemented from Jason just

because he wants to find that

middle-of-the-road but I there's no

question in my mind I think works it's

going to put a full slate of candidates

up in Alberta in the next provincial and

probably also at the federal level and

they might even win a seat or two so

that fair deal panel the work is June

yellow I will bet you dinner right now

that not a single not a single wax

Center will get elected I'll bet you

dinner

just like the People's Party of Canada

was getting elected just like the

freedom party was getting elected they

can't get a seat not a chance I think it

depends on how much success Jason has if

he doesn't if Premier Kenny does not

manage to make some inroads on those on

those fronts I think you'll probably see

it escalate but it may also bring the

temperature down if he is able to do a

couple of things that

move the agenda along alright we got to

dinner bet alright well there we go

well we'll keep up to date on that's on

the radio listeners on 6:30 chat and

global news radio in Calgary that work

on the fair deal panel is just getting

underway we'll hear more on that in the

spring lots to talk about on this topic

for sure

Gord Linda absolutely thank you talking

well we want to thank you for tuning

into our special presentation this

evening

and we hope that it has shed some light

on the debates that surround our region

and our place here in Canada and of

course you can get more info and

in-depth coverage of all the stories you

saw here tonight at global news CA /
