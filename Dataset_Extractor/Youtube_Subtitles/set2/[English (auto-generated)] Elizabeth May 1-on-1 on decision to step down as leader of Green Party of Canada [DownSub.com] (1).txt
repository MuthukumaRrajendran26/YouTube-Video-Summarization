Green Party leader Elizabeth May has

decided it's time to give up leadership

of the party she built though she

intends to carry on as an MP and

Elizabeth May joins me now from Ottawa

hi there thanks for joining us well

thank you Don I haven't seen you since

the leadership debates but here we are

now you've been leader of the party for

thirteen years it's a long time you were

the lone MP for a long time you built

the party was it a hard decision to give

up the leadership not at all not really

and I wouldn't claim building the party

I mean I'm the ninth leader of the party

but as it happens I've been leader for

one-third of the lifetime of a party

that we've had in Canada for 36 years so

everyone who's been a leader has

contributed to build I think it's time

and really time to encourage other

greens to step forward for leadership

i I've had this this notion that

sometimes the media thinks that the

party is just me it was a great way of

proving how much bent bench strength we

have we had so many great candidates

across Canada in this last election and

we've achieved historic success so it's

a perfect time can you really take a

back seat to a party that you've been

such a part of absolutely my job is

working in Parliament with my wonderful

caucus colleagues Paul Manley from

Nanaimo ladies myths and Jenica a twin

from Fredericton as a team of three

we'll be very focused on trying to get

climate action in this minority

Parliament trying to get pharmacare the

United Nations Declaration on the Rights

of Indigenous Peoples we have a we have

a very serious agenda in Parliament the

work of building the party capitalizing

on the momentum from this election

campaign that goes right now to interim

leader Joanne Roberts and by October 4th

2020 in Charlottetown Prince Edward

Island we will elect the leader to take

us into the next election cycle where

I'm confident we will achieve even

larger successes and I'm excited about

it honestly I have no doubt in my mind

this is the right time and the right

decision miss may what do you think the

next leader needs to do to

take the party further I don't think

it's really so much about what the

leader has to do is building on the

momentum I think there is excitement

politically around a leadership race

when I ran for leader of the party in

the course of running for leadership we

doubled the membership well I want to do

that again I mean back then it was a

much smaller number so we want to go

bigger have more Canadians engaged and

feeling that you play a role in the

Green Party Green Party membership

actually determines our policies and our

positions we're a grassroots party

nothing invites people to participate as

much as the leadership race and I know

we're going to have some terrific

candidates people with whom I will be so

proud to serve in Parliament as someone

working alongside of my caucus

colleagues including a new leader will

you be reaching out to certain people

like recruiting asking some people to

consider taking on the leadership I've

been doing that for some time and now's

the time for me to step back from that

because I want to be absolutely certain

of total neutrality in the election

campaign a lot of people will look to me

for hints of who I want to have be the

next leader I think it's very important

that and the Council of the Green Party

and the Shadow Cabinet we all talked

about it this weekend it's important

that I'm absolutely neutral so there

there are a lot of greens who know I've

asked them in the past and I'm hoping

that they're going to run it will be an

exciting exciting leadership race with

inspiring dedicated greens offering to

be of service as I have been for for the

13 years when I had the honor of serving

as leader but no hands on who you think

should take over somebody perfect we

will have there's nobody perfect

anywhere in this world but we all do our

best a dedicated strong green who's

capable of inspiring others and who

understands that the issues that are

facing us are critical we can't afford

political parties who are that are only

interested in perpetuating their own

power while forgetting why they wanted

power in the first place and I'm sad to

say that all the other parties in this

country

are dominated but that kind of sports

analogy of my team versus your team and

all that really matters is winning

greens will always be there to say what

matters on principle and that we will

never put trying to achieve power for us

above working for the benefit of

Canadians and acting on principle you've

said in the past that you are the only

federal leader who grasped the gravity

of the climate emergency do you think

you've advanced the policy discussion

and the other parties in a way that's

meaningful in which political leader

right now gives you the most hope I'm

sad to say that well I wish I could say

that that my efforts had led to a

greater understanding of climate science

I think my efforts and the efforts of

Greens across Canada have led the

Liberals the NDP and the Conservatives

to a greater understanding of climate

politics in other words they understand

they have to say they care about climate

to get votes I'm very disappointed in

judgment saying announcing that his

terms for supporting the Liberals don't

even include a mention of climate change

and I think a lot of the people who

voted knew Democrat will be disappointed

I think they should get in touch with

mr. Singh right now and tell them they

expected more this is a minority

Parliament we have to see a commitment

to real climate action we have to see

leadership that will step up and say you

can't build the Trans Mountain pipeline

and keep to the Paris target we have to

see and I help a lot of people who voted

liberal will be contacting Justin

Trudeau and their local liberal and

saying we will not forgive you if you go

into the next climate negotiations which

by the way start in December in Madrid

with the same target it Stephen Harper

put in place it more you know more than

four years ago it is a weak target

Canada must do better these are things

that I wish we had accomplished in the

election campaign on I kept hoping that

one of the other parties would scoop us

by having a climate target consistent

with science we remain the only party

that has a target that is consistent

with the scientific warnings that if we

don't act now in the very near term

within a number of years it will be too

late so I'm glad it's a minority

Parliament that we go back to the polls

before we cross that line towards a

point of no return we we really do need

leadership and we need to work across

party lines to achieve the the enormous

economic opportunities that exist in

transitioning away from fossil fuels

you're scheduled to meet with Prime

Minister Trudeau next week what do you

intend to tell him particularly about

climate change well I will beg him once

again to pull the target that's been

tabled with the United Nations since

Stephen Harper put it in place and bring

in a target that is consistent with the

advice of science we are at a point

where the global negotiations are at a

critical point we have to live up to the

Paris agreement Canada's current target

is roughly half of what sought the

scientists in the Intergovernmental

Panel on Climate Change tell us we need

to do so when people talk about will

Justin Trudeau and the Liberals achieve

the Paris target tragically most

journalists who ask that question make

the mistake of thinking our current

target is the Paris target it's not it's

about half of what we need to do so I

will press him once again to go to the

next climate negotiations in Madrid cop

25 with Canada no longer wearing the

badge of weakest climate policy of

industrialized countries but actually

step up and do what needs to be done

what's next for you

now that you're no longer leader you're

going to run in the next election right

and and possibly become speaker well

first of all we have a lot of work to do

in Parliament between now and whenever

we go back to the polls I've identified

in a letter that I sent to Prime

Minister Trudeau last week with copies

to all the other party leaders to say

look the Greens will never vote

confidence in a government that fails to

have a target that achievers achieves

what needs to be done on climate to meet

the Paris agreement that's our bottom

line but we will cooperate in other

areas where we find common ground

such as for pharmacare pushing for the

for the United Nations declaration on

the rights of indigenous peoples there

are many things that we could do

together

and Paul Manley at Jenica at one and I

are committed to making progress for

Canadians in this Parliament so there's

a lot of work ahead both for my

constituency my constituents and Canada

as the parliamentary leader of the

Greens in Ottawa at the same time what's

next for me is yes I plan to run again

in the next election campaign I love

being the Member of Parliament for

Saanich Gulf Islands it's such an honour

my constituents are such engaged active

citizens concerned that we stopped the

transplant and pipeline concerned what's

going to happen to the southern resident

killer whales are wild salmon

we have pressing issues including

finding a family doctor in affordable

housing I want to work hard on all those

issues now and into the next election

and I will ask my constituents what they

think about the idea of me running for

speaker it's it's not a job you can get

without your parliamentary colleagues

voting for you

I can't possibly consider it now because

I am committed to working with Paul

Manley in Jenica at 1:00 and making sure

they have the confidence that as

relatively new MPs in the case of Jenica

a brand new MP we don't miss a beat in

terms of understanding parliamentary

procedure making our voices heard making

a difference and I understand they're

right I need to sit with them and be

part of that three-person caucus that

makes a difference in Parliament but who

knows after the next election if if I am

reelected I would consider seriously

running for speaker because I would love

to see Parliament work more respectfully

I think it would advance all the issues

I care about to have a parliament where

we discussed issues instead of just

hearing people yell at each other and I

think grown-ups in the room will always

help get better government all right

Elizabeth may Green Party MP thank you

thank you
