this country is in real trouble he began

making his doubts known a few weeks ago

I had my reservations about the people

running and the way they're campaigning

and the the promises they're making that

they can't fulfill Michael Bloomberg now

seems to think he's the only person who

can take on Donald Trump in 2020 after

previously ruling out a run for the

Democratic presidential nomination this

is a very serious public servant I don't

think any Democrat would question his

credentials as a public servant I think

what Democrats will question is his

judgment entering the race at this point

Joe Biden's faltering candidacy has

Bloomberg worried if he enters the race

the billionaire will try to position

himself as a moderate electable voice in

a party that's moving further to the

left candidates like Elizabeth Warren

and Bernie Sanders are polling well

billionaires and the wealthy not paying

their fair share of taxes both have

promised to take on the ultra-wealthy

Warren's wealth tax proposal would cost

a man like Bloomberg about three billion

of his more than 50 billion dollar net

worth

and say they're gonna buy this election

if Bloomberg wins the nomination the

former Republican turned Democrat would

find himself running against a Democrat

turned Republican president who seems to

relish the thought he will not do very

well and if he did I'd be happy

there is nobody I'd rather run against

than little Michael
