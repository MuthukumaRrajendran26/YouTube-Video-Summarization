environment wink I can sell in the

situation up here for viewers this is

mr. pipeline and this is mr. pipeline -

and mr. Trudeau I'm not so sure but I'm

Jack meat sing I will never force a

pipeline on Quebec that is clear current

plan put forward by mr. Trudeau was to

give huge exemptions polluters large

companies that have a special agreement

with government taxpayers and Canadian

workers have to pay a hundred percent of

their carbon tax there are no taxes in

my plan places a massive exemption

biggest emitters you will not anything

you want to win anything was my plan

Canadians will see what happens we'll

invest for indigenous people mr. Schurr

we'll start with no singer we'll start

with you here we go again and I wore my

orange turban again about anyways yes

that's a very serious question did you

see what I've seen yes mr. Trudeau he

talks a lot of he talks a good games

publicly about the decisions he makes

privately are the problem when it comes

to indigenous communities if there was a

willingness to do something right away

it could be done it's as simple as that

if the decision was to fund indigenous

kids the same way as other Canadian kids

that could be done it shouldn't have to

go to court I would respect communities

it's a matter of dignity if you start

with that recognition it could solve so

many problems equal funding thank you is

the starting point or head Mr Shearer

thank you

many Canadians wrote to us with their

concern about the fact that about 50

migrants cross that rock some road at

the Canadian border every day is that a

problem for you

it's a problem because we are now in a

world where there are 70 or 75 million

displaced persons we recognize that we

have a responsibility to make sure that

these people go through our entire

immigration system and that's what we're

doing we've made the necessary

investments and there's no a free pass

to get through the border whether people

arrive in a regular or in a regular way

at the border they have to go through a

security check and they have to go

through every step of our immigration

system is may climate change is an issue

for the entire planet not just for

Canada yet in the next ten years China

intends to open six new coal plants

every month how can we ensure that

Canadians will not be obliterated by the

actions of other countries rich

industrialized countries increase in

greenhouse gases it's impossible for us

to play a role worldwide in UN

negotiations key to this problem is that

conservative and liberal governments

have chosen to neglect indigenous

communities they had the opportunity to

do something if they wanted to when they

have a chance to do something for the

oil patch they jump on the chance to buy

all supplies a huge cost if you're gonna

do something do it alongside First

Nations do not impose a top-down they

have the right to be part of two people

mr. Trudeau this is very recent last 30

you appealed a judgement that ordered

the government to pay $40,000 to

indigenous children that were given to

child protection were you not supposed

to be the champion of reconciliation

and we are and we continue to champion

reconciliation we agree with the court

that we absolutely have to compensate

those children and we're going to do

that we're going to work with them to

establish the right level of

compensation but we have made concrete

investments over the last four years we

were able to get rid of 87 long-term

boil water advisories after ten years

where mr. Harper did nothing we've

created as new schools we have made new

investments in partnership with

indigenous peoples but we understand

that we need to continue to move forward

there's still a lot to do but Chief

Pelle berry bellegarde of the Assembly

of First Nations has recognized that no

government has more done more for

indigenous peoples than we have lawyers

for your government the result overturn

our trying to overturn the ruling with

the court that we must compensate these

children why do you appeal the decision

because the timeline of doing it by

December doesn't work with the elections

that were in right now we are going to

compensate those children but it's going

to take a bit of time to do it the right

way

I've always been clear I do not want to

intervene what I do want to do the twos

your duty calls is always concepted

fight against division against

discrimination I know a lot of people

face discrimination in their lives it's

wholly unacceptable I want people to get

to know me and Quebec and all across the

country I speak to people I say yes I

wear a turban but I'm in favor of the

right to abortion

in favor of fighting climate change sure

I wear a turban but we share the same

values it's all about values if you want

to protect society you need to reinforce

women's rights their right to choose

that's how you create a fairer society

and that's what I'm willing to do have

always been very clear as well

we will not intervene at this stage

because this is a question an issue

where Quebecers are challenging this

unfair law of this laws that they find

unfair before the courts it would be

irresponsible for a federal government

to close the door to ever intervening at

a future stage when freedoms and

fundamental rights are at issue we need

to be there to protect francophones

outside of quebec we need to be there to

fight for the rights of women for the

rights of the LGBTQ community and for

the rights of religious minorities I

will always defend the rights of

everyone and we'll see when we come to

the next stages he would get involved

and mr. Singh said the very opposite to

what he said in English just a few days

ago I will Danny but stick by my word

this is a Quebec area of jurisdiction

secularism in Quebec the way things are

now it's a Quebec area of jurisdiction

we have to honor that we can't step in

and ride roughshod over Quebec's areas

its jurisdiction we're not going to

intervene like mr. Trudeau has indicated

will and we're not going to him and hold

on true to sing sing sing you said at a

press conference after your last last

debate that you would intervene at the

Supreme Court stage can you give us more

details

I simply repeated a faster Trudeau said

and I repeated it what I said clearly

was that I do not want to intervene I

don't want to what I do want to do is to

win over the hearts of people that's

what I've always said that's what I want

to do because I know that the politics

of division is not good for society

I'm harmful clear the

is a possibility that the federal

government might need to intervene but

it's not guaranteed mr. birnley because

we are going to let's at the court case

follow its course but I think Canadians

expect that a federal government be

there to defend for example francophone

communities if for example a

conservative majority government under

Doug Ford wanted to attack francophones

in Ontario they expect the federal

government to be there to defend them I

don't know what the people of Quebec

would do if that were to be the case for

Quebecers the notion of secularism it's

a progressive values that comes from the

quite revolution it's welcoming it's a

protects it's fair it's fair for men and

women it's not something that is

restrictive in the heart and mind of

Quebecers

I appreciate it some say that it's up to

Quebec to decide now mr. Singh you're

not saying the same thing in English and

in French and when we're talking about

secularism mr. Trudeau speaks about

Brunswick and their right to more ship

Becker's need to know that it will elect

people who are in favor of secularism

the people who would lose before the

Supreme Court would they feel that this

is an institutional lack of respect some

might ask themselves that question I'm

convinced that is not the legal

government's intention that it's not a

sovereign since I'm the only person who

has been clear on the matter we will not

intervene we didn't only say we don't

want to we said we won't that was my

position at the very beginning it's my

position today and it will be my

position after the election what is

clear so that mr. Blahous priority is to

try and stir up sovereign ISM once again

he will work with the Parti québécois

the second the elections are over to try

and lead to a new referendum that's his

priority and that's clear open debate

now I'm going to ask you a question and

then that's up to you to respond it's in

a crisis situation that you can measure

the judgment and transparency of a

leader you've always

forgiving some candidates or let them go

Barisan candidates so from now on can

you tell us that there will be zero

tolerance for any candidate or MP who

would make any racist comments mr.

Boucher first understand why this

question is asked tonight any of the

candidate had refused to apologize

explicitly they were not be a candidate

of this look tonight because I can state

I'm I'm sure that the fact that I was

that I wrote in newspapers that was on

key before I know that everybody looked

into that would a fine-tooth comb it's

the same for my colleagues on stage

tonight what is essential for me in an

election campaign is that people choose

for whom they'll vote based on the

values they put forth and we will work

for Quebec for examples of people what

we had to forgive you and mr. Trudeau Mr

Shearer as well I can say is that there

is one candidate did not meet our policy

that is a Cal a candidate who breached

ethics guidelines twice who lied about

many things in their life and that is

the Liberal Party no candidate Richard

our ologies are important but intentions

and values and concrete measures that

are taken are important as well and we

will always judge on values and actions

taken by everyone it's a part of the

election and a choice before people are

people

representing their values we'll be there

to defend them and people know that for

four years I have been defending them

and we will continue to move forward

defending those values together mistake

is that they take ownership

thereafter we just need to ensure that

they share Canadian values of tolerance

acceptance freedom our party has been

founded personal responsibility and

freedom to live by those that's a

question of authenticity if a person

apologizes but doesn't commit to change

in the future there's no strong

commitment to do things differently so

in that case it would be I know but if a

person says their story and commits to

change if they share our values they can

stay in our party our value is to work

for people not for the wealthy our value

is to defend human rights we want to

advance social justice and fight the

climate crisis we can do this together

and that's exactly the type of

candidates and team we have and we need

a number of people who've asked me why

run for a party in an election in our

democracy because there are always

things that are embarrassing but to me

it's an issue of the level of their

comments we have zero tolerance for

racism anti-semitism sexism we have zero

tolerance that's clear we have to think

about this because in the last few weeks

in this election we have spent an awful

lot of time on a small politics not to

try to find a way to work together to

fight the climate emergency and I my

last breath I will try to stop the

climate II to work together we need to

make the right choice we need to move

forward to fight against climate change

and we will continue to move forward

thank you mr. Schurr mr. blush a and mo

conclusion this the choice for this

election is clear four more years of

hoax more expensive lives or a

conservative government that will make

life more affordable for everyone will

be in the House Commons we will vote in

favor when it's good for Quebec against

what is not good for conviction thank

you ladies and gentlemen thank you
