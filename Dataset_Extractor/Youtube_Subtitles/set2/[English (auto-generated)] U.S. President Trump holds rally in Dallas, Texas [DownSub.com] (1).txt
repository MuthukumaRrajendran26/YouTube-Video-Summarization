thank you very much hello Dallas it's

great to be with you tonight

thank you

and I am thrilled to be here deep in the

heart of Texas where we just opened a

beautiful new louis vuitton plant

when I'm with the freedom-loving

Patriots of the Lone Star State I love

it there has never been a better time to

be a proud Texan and there's never a

better better time to be a proud

American that never had so I came from a

small town Alvarado Texas where we

celebrated the incredible revival of

American manufacturing and we opened up

some beautiful places I'll tell you this

place is doing great and created in a

very short period of time an extra 1,000

jobs for Texas

since my election we've created 775

thousand new jobs of course you state

including 70,000 Texas manufacturing

jobs they said those jobs had

disappeared didn't they huh hey man

our country is once again living by two

simple rules by American and hire

American the economy is booming our

people are prospering our country is

thriving and our nation is stronger than

ever before but the more America

achieves the more hateful and enraged

these crazy Democrats become

crazy they're crazy they're crazy at

stake in this fight is their survival of

American democracy itself don't kid

yourself that's what they want they are

destroying this country but we will

never let it happen not even twice for

three straight years Radical Democrats

have been trying to overthrow the

results of a great great election maybe

maybe the greatest election in the

history of our country

and they want to oppose an extreme

agenda they cannot pass it and they

cannot win it at the ballot box they're

not going to win they're not even they

won't come close in 2020 they know it

they know they're not gonna win it they

say let's see what's another idea what's

another idea how do we win this election

you know I really don't believe anymore

that they love our country I don't

believe

[Applause]

crazy Nancy thank you long that crazy

Nancy she is crazy

[Music]

[Applause]

and shifty chef how about this guy how

about this

he makes up my conversation which was

perfect he makes up my conversation he

sees what I said it doesn't play well

because it was perfect

so he made up a totally false

conversation with the Ukrainian

president

[Applause]

and we caught him cold everybody knew it

anyway

see we did one thing you always have to

do the unexpected they never thought I'd

release the conversation with the

Ukrainian person

I want to get him before Congress and I

want to see what he has to say you know

they say he has immunity why would you

have immunity for outright fraud why do

you have immunity why he's a fraud

we're fighting a campaign against

leftist socialist and globalist who want

to return to reckless Wars open borders

rampant crime and totally disastrous one

way trade deals with changing that went

around very quickly they believe America

is the world's piggy bank and that your

tax dollars should subsidize the economy

military and defense of every other

nation in the world but our own it's not

happening in it our political opposition

made its fortune selling out our nation

and its citizens and you know that's

what's been happening and that's why

2016 was so important and that's why

2020 I can never say it's more important

but you know it's like the roots of a

tree you plant the baby tree it's got a

catch get that extra time we'll have

more tax cuts we'll have even I'll tell

you what we have rebuilt our military

what we've done has never been done

before

the do-nothing Democrats have betrayed

our country and that great betrayal is

over we are finally again and we've been

doing it now for almost three years can

you believe we've been doing this thing

I've been a politician for three years I

can't believe that I never thought I'd

be called the politician I don't like it

but it is what it is

but we're finally again putting America

first

the Radical Democrats want to destroy

America as we know it they want to

indoctrinate our children and teach them

that America is a sinful wicked nation

you see that happening all the time and

I know it from personal experience what

they want to teach your kids not good

they come home mummy daddy this is what

I learned and you're going no no don't

tell me

let's get them into another school fast

they want to disarm law-abiding citizens

they want to take your guns away

and they want to install far-left judges

to shred our constitution it's not

happening

they want to tear down symbols of faith

and drive Christians and religious

believers from the public square they

want to silence your voices on social

media and they want the government to

censor muzzle and shut down conservative

voices you know that

[Applause]

if they didn't hate our country they

wouldn't be doing this to our country

they wouldn't be doing it because they

know better they know better as an

example we're building a great wall

along the southern border

and it's going up rapidly going up

and you know five years ago almost every

one of them wanted a wall until I came

along and I said we're gonna build a

great walkers they could never get it

done and then they stopped the funding

they made it almost impossible few

people would have been able to do what

we did but we got it from here and we

got it from there and we got it from all

over the place and we're building that

sucker right now and it's having a

tremendous effect always not easy

highest level everything we said it

would be it's moving rapidly although

the fake news back there they don't want

to talk about it

they don't want to talk about

look at all those cameras you believe it

look at all those red lights don't worry

I won't say anything bad about your

network because a lot of times I get

ready to do a number on these phony

networks and you know you see those red

lights go off fall fall fall they don't

want their viewers to see it but that's

ok I'm not going to say it tonight I'm

going to say your legitimate media I

don't actually be there but you look at

that but look at all those covers you

know that's like the Academy Awards used

to be because before it fell you know

why it failed

you know why it failed because they came

after us that's why you

it failed because they had stupid people

saying horrible things about us stupid

stupid people they are stupid people and

their ratings have dropped like a rocket

I love seeing it I'm telling you love it

but no matter how hard they try they

will fail because the people of Texas

and the people of America will never

surrender our freedom to those people

right there

we will stand strong for family faith

God and for country last week a very

dumb Democrat candidate for president

that's the end of him in this state

pledged to revoke the tax-exempt status

of many churches and religious charities

and by the way that was after a few

weeks ago he said excuse me we're going

to take your guns away that doesn't work

well

[Applause]

and I called him right remember the

flailing arms nobody noticed it I

noticed it the flail er your memory was

flailing all over the place I said why

is this guy hot john cornyn is going to

win so easily just like ted cruz one

who's gonna win no matter what happens

but john cornyn is not talking about

bado anymore because Vado

in a few short weeks got rid of guns and

got rid of religion those are not two

good things in Texas to get rid of and I

will never allow the federal government

to be used to punish Americans for their

religious beliefs

and I will never allow the IRS to be

used as a political weapon except in the

case of myself where they use it against

me the radical left tolerates no dissent

it permits no opposition it accepts no

compromise these people are crazy and it

has absolutely no respect for the will

of the American people first it was the

Russia hoax

then it was this smeary which continues

that disgraceful disgusting smearing of

a fine man

justice Cavanaugh

[Applause]

and now they continue the outrageous

impeachment witch-hunt with nothing with

nothing they come after me but what

they're really doing is they're coming

after the Republican Party and what

they're really really doing is they're

coming after and fighting you and we

never lose

I'm fighting for everyone who believes

in the values traditions and principles

that have made our nation the greatest

in the history of the world and I have

to say this we are far greater now than

ever before you go back for years

you go back 7 6 8 even you go back into

another administration you go back 10

and 12 years where were you compared to

where you are right now so we must hold

the democrats accountable for their lies

and their corruption they are corrupt

people and we must show and vote and we

have to go out and we have to win this

election coming up it's going to be a

landslide err we have to make it advance

today's do-nothing Democrats they don't

do anything where's the US MCA everybody

wants it the Democrats even wanted and

crazy Nancy won't let anybody vote on it

she's nuts

today's Democrats believe anyone who

opposes them must be crushed it's not

just like let's win you know I have to

say this the Republicans said I'm not

sure I like this because my life hasn't

been this way but the Republicans play a

much softer game they really do when all

of our stars that we have great stars

when they went to our Speaker of the

House at the time and they asked for

subpoenas oh let's take it easy let's do

it okay I mean I get that too she hands

him out like it's cookies here sip it I

heard a commentator who happens to be

standing right there the other day

doesn't like us at all but but said I've

never seen anyone hand out so many

subpoenas

I have people getting subpoenas I never

heard of my said who are those people

never saw anything like it it's a

disgrace what they're doing to our

country and we became because of what

they do not the Republicans and not what

we've done because what they've done and

what they see when people come to my

office which is now the Oval Office

which is your office to

presidents prime ministers kings queens

I hate to say it sometimes dictators

they just don't like to go by that title

they say sir congratulations sir and

what you've done congratulations on what

you've done

it's incredible your economy is the

greatest on earth and let me tell you if

my crooked opponent would have won the

election right now China would be by far

the number one nation from an economic

standpoint in the world we've gone up

trillions of dollars they've gone down

trillions of dollars and we are so far

number one so far that they'll never

catch us if we are smart right here

but the do-nothing Democrats believe

anyone who opposes them has to be

crushed they no one just beat them they

don't want to just beat him these are

sick people they want to crush these

people the anger the hatred and that any

lie or crime or corruption is justified

so shift gets up and makes up my

statement he makes it up a hundred

percent and then he said he didn't speak

to the whistleblower no we didn't see

the whistleblower and what about the

whistleblower the whistleblower got it

all wrong

who's the whistleblower who's the

whistleblower who is the whistleblower

we have to know is the whistleblower is

spy and who is the IG that did this all

he had to do is look at the tape or look

at the what they wrote down the

transcribed version of the phone call

compare that to the whistleblowers

account and you see it had nothing to do

with it so why does the IG allow a thing

like this to happen to our country why

why get a lot of bad people out there

but one by one we're advancing one by

one

just look at the terrible foreign

corruption of the Biden's

I hate to talk about him you know why I

don't think the guys got a chance sleepy

Joe I don't think he's got it

I don't see it I don't know I've got

these great brilliant senators over here

I have all these congressmen over here

fellas I don't think he has a chance I'd

like him to I'd like him to you know I

thought Pocahontas was gone left in

embers you got to give her credit those

embers they kept going going going now

it looks like she's doing better but I

don't think Joe has a chance but did you

see the other night where CNN in a

totally unsubstantiated statement the

president said this about you who is so

sorry he said that his son walked out

with a billion and a half dollars from

China these were not the same Chinese

people I just dealt with I will tell you

that but Joe Biden was in charge of

Ukraine policy while his son with

absolutely no energy experience just got

thrown out of the Navy like a dog was

paid massive sums of money by a

Ukrainian energy company you know that's

called it's called a pay off folks

he didn't know energy at all do nothing

about energy they hired him paying him

massive amounts of money much more than

the 50,000 a month you heard about

that's a lot that's a lot but much more

Joe Biden made them go out and fire the

prosecutor on tape but they don't want

to show the tape I had to put it up on a

social media site they don't want to

show the tape where he was bragging

they're not going to get this money

unless they get rid and boo they got rid

of the prosecutor he was investigating

the son and the sons company get rid of

them now that's what you call quid pro

quo while these charges are totally

unsubstantiated these are the fake news

errs out there and then Biden flew think

of it he goes into a tough place we just

made such a great deal with China I

think just think of this my guy said if

we could get 20 billion in agricultural

product that would be good the most

China ever did was 16 billion for our

farmers okay we're just talking about

the farmers we did banking we did

everything but we're talking about them

the most they ever did was 20 billion of

product from our farmers or great

farmers or patriot farmers or farmers

that never left us even though they were

being targeted by China they never left

me

so they wanted 20 angina agreed and I

said nope no good I want 50 billion not

20 billion 50 so my guys say sir we have

a problem sir our farmers cannot produce

that much it's true I said tell them to

go out and get bigger tractors right

John Deere case batter pillow

all-american only American tractors we

only buy American truck go out II get

bigger so now China's agree to they've

already started buying hopefully the

agreement gets signed sometime prior to

a big summit that we have with President

Xi and others in Chile that's in about

four weeks but think of this they said

sir they can't produce fifty billion

dollars I said I want the farmers to

tell me remember the story about winning

we're gonna win so much we're going to

the White House we're gonna tell the

president sir we just can't stand

winning the state of Texas John Cornyn

and Ted Cruz they're gonna come into my

over sir we just just can't stand this

winning in Texas anymore it's too much

we can't handle it well that's what I

want from the farmers I want the farmers

to say I want the farmers to say sir we

just can't produce that much product we

can't do it sir and I'm gonna say yes

you can and they're gonna say no we

can't I'm gonna say yes you can and

they're going to go out and they're

going to take in 50 billion from China

as opposed to 20 that's what's gonna

happen

that's what's gonna happen but they were

great they stuck with us through thick

and thin now it's really working out for

a lot of different groups and in the

meantime we've taken in tens of billions

of dollars of tariffs and China's eat

and of course because they devalued

their currency and they put money out

tens of billions of dollars it's cost us

nothing billions and billions and

billions and you know what I did for the

farmer during the lean times I gave them

16 billion last year and 12 billion the

year before 28 billion dollars all

together came out of the tariffs that I

had a lot of money left over and nobody

complained

and you know our farmers didn't want

that money our farmers didn't want a

true story everybody comes from money

countries come for everybody wants money

right they all want our money the farmer

said sir we don't want this bunnies to

subsidy we don't want it I said no it's

not a subsidy being targeted unfairly

they said no search the subsidy this is

true I had 35 farmers in the Oval Office

incredible people they didn't want it

they said sir just give us a level

playing field so now I gave them a feel

that's more than level it's level like

this nice and easy nice and easy

but the farmers I call him the great

Patriots the farmers they I never lost

them they always said you know yeah I'm

in trouble I got a problem but this

should have been done many many years

ago by other presidents and other

leaders and we lose for many years five

hundred billion dollars a year with

China and many other countries we lose

billions

Willa's with everybody but that's all

changing now but we lose 500 billion not

million five hundred millions a lot

right we lose five hundred billion and

you know what it's a disgrace that that

was allowed to go on for 25 years it was

a disgrace disgrace but now we're taking

in billions of dollars they've had the

worst year they've had in 27 years and

we're having the best year we've ever

had so that's

so Biden flew with Hunter on Air Force

two they flew to China hunter walked out

of the plane at a quick meeting walked

away with one and a half billion dollars

and these characters back there said oh

that's okay there's no problem

can you imagine if Don or Eric trump or

Ivanka Trump who's here someplace right

here

and by the way our great first lady is

home watching this she said this is the

most exciting thing I've seen in a long

time

a great first lady doing a great job

she's doing a great job we're doing a

great job the whole country now is doing

a great job so Biden takes a billion

five and he goes on and allows China to

rip us off remember he said a year ago

no no China's good they've done nothing

wrong they're wonderful people they are

wonderful people

I don't blame China by the way I blame

our leaders for allowing this horrible

you know what and pillage you see our

word you know what and pillage you know

what word I'm talking about right I

don't want to use it because they'll say

it's a horrible word that trophy is so

the Biden's got rich while America got

robbed tonight we forcefully condemned

the blatant corruption of the Democrat

Party and nobody ever pays the price

with the Democrats they're so

deep-seated they never paid the price

they never paid but maybe he soon that

will start you know we've had a lot of

we've had a lot of Obama people and

Clinton people and some to be honest

with you we've had some pretty bad

Republicans down deep that didn't

exactly love us but slowly they're

getting out they have all sorts of

protections but so he says get rid of

them yeah we're trying get rid of them

but they're partnering the whole thing

is to fake news media that's the problem

[Applause]

because the Democrats and the fake news

media it's a partnership remember that

and you see it all the time and I've

never seen it to this extent you know

when I won in the primaries and then I

won the election I was treated horribly

by the media horribly and then when I

won the election we had the greatest

night one of the highest-rated nights in

the history of television all over the

world

and I won and I said oh the great thing

I said to Ivanka I said to the first

lady I said to anybody that would listen

I said listen this is so great finally

finally we all of us were going to be

respected by the media and you know what

happened they got worse that worse now

than they ever have been they're crooked

as hell they're worse now than they've

ever been

they're crooked

the only message these radicals and they

are radical lefties will understand is a

crushing defeat on November 3rd 2020

save that

with your help we will win back the

house we will keep the Senate and we

will keep the White House in numbers

like they haven't seen in a long long

time

joining us tonight are many terrific

Republican leaders and they are terrific

and frankly if they're not I'm not going

to introduce them okay but we have some

great leaders and you have great leaders

in Texas great leader and they love

Texas so a friend of mine a guy that a

lot of people weren't so sure we had

this unbelievable relationship in fact

when Ted Cruz held a rally in Washington

he said could you come to my rally and

everybody thought these people thought

that was strange they said to me well

when is the fighting between these two

cos we really like each other

when does the fighting gonna start right

Ted they said when was the fighting

gonna start and I said don't worry it'll

start and when it does it's going to be

vicious and it was vicious and now we

love each other again

he's great Ted Cruz

and he had a great victory against a man

that spent almost a hundred million

dollars it's a lot of money spent almost

a hundred million but there was a great

victory thank you to another man who's

currently running against somebody

I kept thinking maybe bado will jump in

because he's at zero right now we hope

he's going to jump in

remember no religion and no guns I think

that's not good oh and I think he's like

pretty lighter on oil production too but

a man and John I have no idea who you're

running against but nobody's going to be

able to beat John Cornyn

co-chairman Tommy Hicks a real friend of

ours Thank You Tommy and our great

campaign manager the most sophisticated

man with a computer you've ever seen and

remembered they used to say with Hillary

her campaign is so sophisticated then

after she lost they said Trump's

campaign were so sophisticated and

remember she spent like six times more

of this stuff that we did you know in

the old days my father taught me if you

can spend less that's a good thing not a

bad thing right my father said if you

can spend less so we spent much less

than Hillary crooked Hillary crooked

where are those emails Hillary they may

incredible job Wilbur Ross Thank You

man boy he hit me during their campaign

and I said that guy is ruthless and when

it was sort of over there was nobody

more gracious and I called him

I made him Secretary of Energy he's done

a phenomenal job

and Rick Perry couldn't have done a

better job

and he's going to be leaving at the end

of the year and probably coming back

here whatever he does it's going to be

successful but he spent three years with

us I don't want to thank you Rick what a

job you have done thank you a lot of job

he's done he was also a great governor

of Texas that you know in everything we

do we're fighting for the faithful

citizens of this country this includes

putting a stop to the catastrophic era

of endless wars endless wars they don't

stop they don't stop they go on forever

we become policemen we end up becoming

police we're policing these countries

that's not what it's about

we've spent eight trillion dollars in

the Middle East thousands of American

soldiers have lost their lives tens of

thousands more have been severely

wounded and in all fairness the other

side has lost millions of people

millions millions of people think of it

these wars brought mass chaos

instability destruction and death today

we choose a different path we had

tremendous success today I don't know if

you've seen

what we've built in the last three years

we built the strongest military by far

when I and I told the story I was

embarrassed to tell it but now I'll tell

when I first got in a general told me we

could have had a conflict with someone

said sir we don't have ammunition and I

said I never want to hear a president I

just never want to hear somebody have

that statement made to them again as

president of the United States we don't

have ammunition think of how bad now we

have so much ammunition we don't know

what to do with it

and as you all know I guess you've been

watching today I sent vice-president

pence and Secretary of State Pompeo to

lead an American delegation to meet with

President Erdogan of Turkey they got

there today and it did work

without spilling a drop of American

blood not one drop of American blood

we've all agreed on a pause or a

ceasefire in the border region of Syria

and it was unconventional what I did I

said they're gonna have to fight a

little while sometimes you have to let

them fight a little while then people

find out how tough the fighting is these

guys know right up here these guys do

right sometimes you have to let him

fight it's like two kids in a lot you

gotta let him fight and then you pull

him apart but it was unconventional but

they fought for a few days and it was

pretty vicious and the Kurds who are

friends and took he's our friend

but they fought it was tougher I mean it

was nasty and you couldn't make a deal

for 15 think of it for 15 years 20 years

they couldn't make a deal the Kurds

didn't want to move turkey didn't want

to budge and Turkey was having a lot of

bad things happen from this region and

all fairness to Turkey they were having

a lot of bad but they didn't want now

all of a sudden they fight then it's not

fun having bullets going all over the

place

and we went there and we said we want to

pause and the Kurds have been terrific

they're going to move back a little bit

we're going to keep Isis all nice and

locked up okay we're going to find more

and turkeys all set and President

Erdogan was great and we're going to

take the worst sanctions and tariffs and

everything that I put on the country we

put the worst the word I mean I don't

think they could have economically

survived but that doesn't matter

president Erdogan was a gentleman he

understood it but without a little tough

love you know what tough love is right

without a little tough love they would

have never made this deal

President Obama lost a million people in

the area a million people a million

people

so now we're doing during a five-day

period we're gonna see if we can get it

all finalized and I think it will be I

think it will be so turkeys going to be

happy the Kurds are going to be happy

Isis is going to be unhappy

we'll deal with whoever we have to deal

with but we'll get it done and it's a

great tribute to a lot of very talented

people and thank you to vice president

pence and thank you to Mike Pompeo good

job good job and they're traveling back

to our country by night they're

traveling back and they'll be back soon

and we'll have a big conference on it

but it was a terrific thing and we've

taken care of a lot of religious

persecution we ended that in a lot of

things are in that agreement that nobody

ever thought possible so we have to

fundamentally change our approach to

homeland security as an example in that

example nobody would have ever done that

you have to be a little bit different to

do it that way I took a lot of heat even

from some of our congressmen even from

some of our senators but now they're all

happy and I'm happy with them I'm happy

with them

[Music]

now I don't know what about the

Democrats the Democrats will say oh what

a terrible anything we do the Democrats

were criticized if I said like on the

China deal we get Beijing for $1 they

would say what a terrible deal it just

doesn't work with them you know the wall

we spent so much time with them on the

wall and I realized about two weeks ago

all I had to do was say we will never

build the wall and they would have come

through and they said we demand that you

build it it would have been so much

easier right would have been so much

easier Ted would have been so much ease

American combat troops should not be at

the center of ancient sectarian

conflicts all over the world bring our

soldiers back home bring our soldiers

back home

the same people pushing us to fight

endless wars overseas want us to open up

orders to mass migration from these

war-torn and terror afflicted regions

their policies would import terrorism

right onto our shores with American

issued visas oh isn't that wonderful

and by the way the Democrats want open

borders they want everybody to flow in

they want those caravans to flow in the

caravan and they wouldn't get rid of the

loopholes but you know what Mexico has

been great Mexico today had 27,000

soldiers on our border and we've stopped

this horrible migration of people and

many of them are bad people you know

when countries send them up they're not

sending their finest okay use your heads

they're not sending their finest you got

to see some of the people but now we

send them back and by the way Isis

fantastic they've taken out thousands

and thousands of ms-13 killers

they've taken thousands of killers and

brought Amba

and now we've made deals with Guatemala

and Honduras and El Salvador and Mexico

but we've made deals now where we can

bring back their 45,000 people waiting

in Mexico but it's going to be very

tough for these people ever to get back

when did you ever hear that used to have

no people waiting in Mexico they just

fled our borders are getting strong when

the wall is complete they'll be as

strong as any borders anywhere in the

world my administration believes in a

simple principle the best way to keep

foreign terrorists out of America is to

deny them just deny them admission in

the first place it's really pretty

simple and that is why I've imposed and

we had passed and we won at the United

States Supreme Court a travel ban on

some of the world's most dangerous

countries and places

but if Democrats seize power they would

throw the floodgates wide open wide open

we would have people coming into our

country look at what's going on in

California in the people of California

don't want it they say come into

California we'll give you free health

care free edge account

well I wouldn't I may even move to

California if they they keep going now

but all it does is it brings everybody

in what's wrong with these people

we're rebuilding our military stronger

than ever before and we are not going to

deplete it again on stupid senseless

Angelis wars

we've invested more than two and a half

trillion dollars restoring our armed

forces and all of it was built in the

USA and that includes approving the

construction of almost 200 f-35 fighters

stealth stealth and many of them are

built right here right here you know

that right in Fort Worth

as we restore our security

we're also restoring our prosperity

America is winning again and America is

respected again and by the way I have to

say this so outside they have close to

30,000 people and I wonder if I could

ask the fire marshal fill up this little

area let them in to be so nice you know

they have a certain max we broke the

record tonight

good place

last month unemployment reached its

lowest level in 51 years seven million

Americans have been lifted off food

stamps since the election what a great

1.3 million children have been lifted

out of poverty think of that and African

American Hispanic American and Asian

American unemployment rates have reached

the lowest levels in history

our great Hispanic American population

has reached a poverty level which is a

all-time low in US history and after

years of stagnation wages for Hispanic

Americans are rising fast up nearly 8

percent since my election and everybody

in the fake news would have said that's

absolutely impossible

[Applause]

medium income think of this median

income for Hispanic Americans has

surpassed $50,000 a year for the first

time ever with Republicans in Congress

we passed the largest package of tax

cuts and reform by far in American

history by the way the Democrats want to

raise your taxes you know I don't mean a

little bit

I don't mean a little bit I mean like

double them up triple them up and it

still won't pay for the nonsense they

were we eliminated a record number of

regulations and we ended the war or the

thing called American energy which is

very good for Texas since my election

natural gas production in Texas has

increased 35% and oil production has

increased by 60% six owned and the

United States is now the number one

producer of oil and natural gas anywhere

in the world yet every major Democrat

running for president wants to abolish

all production of oil and natural gas I

think they want to go to windmills

windmills you know darling I want to

watch Trump speak to that we can't

darling the wind isn't blowing they

won't windows in other words they want

to annihilate your Texas economy can you

imagine no more oils I wanna - so here

we have a few people right no guns no

religion no oil no natural gas Abraham

Lincoln could not win Texas under those

circumstances

couldn't do it

we can do it Louie Abraham Lincoln

Honest Abe couldn't do it Louis

remember I used to say I can be more

presidential look

emotion I can be more presidential than

any president in history except for

Honest Abe Lincoln when he's wearing the

Hat that's sad that's tough that's a

tough one to be no it's much easier

being presidential is easy all you have

to do is act like a stiff look

[Applause]

ladies and gentlemen of Texas it is a

great honor to be with you this evening

and the media would love it and

everybody would be out of here so fast

you wouldn't have come in in the first

place when you get right down to but

Democrats will never get that chance

because Texas will never give it to them

Texas is

remember the last election they said

these phonies in the back they said

Texas is in play

they said Utah's in play too and I came

here we had rallies like this thousands

of people outside they couldn't get in

and I said why is Texas in play they say

take because it's phoning it's

suppression

they try and get your hopes down there

suppress this is just like fake news but

they said Texas

they said Texas is in play ladies and

gentlemen Texas is in play this is

Sierra and Texas is in play

President Trump and I had guys on from

Texas and they're wearing cowboy hats

Sid and a lot of guy to go I don't know

about you but I know something about

Texas and Donald Trump is not going to

lose Texas I can tell you that and Texas

has got it we had a lot of God's it big

tough guys there on television I don't

know and what you're talking about Texas

is not in play and then that great

November we had that great great night

and the polls closed at 7 o'clock and

usually they have to take hours and you

know sometimes at least even if it's big

they take a half an hour

the Texas polls have closed and you know

usually if it's Klaus it takes hours and

if it's not even just like so close it

takes a long time so they go ladies in

general suppose have closed in the state

of Texas Donald Trump has won the same

right

Donald

the polls have closed in Utah remember

the guy with a shaved head he was going

to be my competition even Hillary beat

him now he's on these talk shows

knocking the hell out of me all the time

now even Hillary beat this guy in Utah

right Hillary came in second I came in

first by a lot but that was another one

too close to call

except ladies and gentlemen Utah the

polls have closed Donald Trump has won

the state of Utah Jesus did the same

thing and we won by we won by a lot and

we won Florida and we won South Carolina

and we won Georgia and we won North

Carolina and we want Pennsylvania we won

a lot remember these phony people there

is no way to get to 270

you had to get that this so I kept going

to Maine I love Maine but Maine - you

get one it's cut in half Maine - you get

one I went there four or five times

because I get they got me up the phonies

they got me up to 269 couldn't get to

270 so I went there I won by the way I

won Maine - I got one but I went there

and I went there a lot that's the

beautiful thing about the electoral

college you go everywhere

you don't just spend in three and you

know winning the popular vote would be

much easier I'd rather have that I'd go

to four states and relax I went to 21

states

I used to be a believer in the other but

I went I think winning it's like your

track star you're working out for the

hundred yard dash or the mile it's a

different form of training it's a

different form but we did great they

said he cannot get to 270 and they were

right we got to 306

after decades of economic surrender I

have taken historic action to confront

China's rampant trading abuses and we've

made great progress and our relationship

with China is fantastic and great things

are happening you watch they get it now

they get it and a lot of good things are

happening we're replacing NAFTA with

disastrous I mean it's been to me

probably I used to call it the worst

trade deal in history I think the world

trade has been WTO what a real beauty

World Trade Organization that's a real

beauty they consider China a developing

nation and because you're a developing

nation Ted right they consider China to

be a developing nation and because

they're developing they get tremendous

and we wrote him letters we don't

consider them to be a developing nation

we don't consider India to be a

developed because they're ripping us off

and we didn't win any cases at the WTO

and now we just won seven and a half

billion dollars of countries that were

taken advantage

and we've won a lot of cases lately we

didn't win anything for years

practically now we've won a lot of cases

you know why because they know I'll

leave if they don't treat us fairly they

know it and then the piggy bank is gone

where they all robbed from we're

replacing the NAFTA disaster and we have

to get this crazy Nancy Pelosi to put

this thing up for a vote we have to get

it and the u.s. MCA is a giant victory

for Texas farmers ranchers manufacturers

workers and oil the Democrats should

pass it overwhelmingly they will but

Nancy has to put it up for a vote

do-nothing Democrats they do nothing no

where is the Democrat betrayal of our

nation more dramatic than on immigration

in recent debates

did you see these debates you believe

what I'm competing with I don't know

when I had to compete with Ted Cruz that

was brutal you know he's he was the

national debate champion story I've

never told I never did that before right

I ran for office all of a sudden I'm

supposed to be debating tomorrow night I

said who are these people the hell I

don't know all of them I know a lot of

them I contributed to a lot of them they

used to treat me very nice when I

contributed to him not so nice when I

was their opponent too changed a lot but

I said let me see I want to see who are

these people I'm going to a debate I

never debated my whole life has been a

debate but I never debated like with the

podium and this and that so I said who

are they and we had 17 people plus me we

had 18 it was actually not 72 was 18

remember Gilmore nobody remembers him

but we have 18 people I said who are

these people are they any good at

debating and I hired a debate coach and

he lasted for about 10 minutes I said

this guy knows less than I do he didn't

know anything he didn't know anything

strong he said never ever interrupt

while they're speaking I said okay coach

put me in coach and after a couple of

those statements I mean I mean you can't

be Ted Cruz if you don't interrupt him

it's impossible but my first stroke so I

see let me see the cards let me see the

whole thing I want to see it I need help

I'm gonna be debating in front of

millions of people and everyone's saying

do you think Trump's gonna be able to

debate professionally I said let me see

these cards in all of them you know he

was president of his class one guy one

guy was a good debater in college he was

this he was okay but they give me the

first card Tetris and it says national

debate champion from Princeton

is that right and then national debate

champion from Harvard I said to my wife

first lady potentially I said my

potential first lady I got a problem I

said some of these guys are okay they

were only president of the class almost

all of them ran for president Atlas I

never did I like playing baseball better

but I said I said Melania and I called

Ivanka I called my kids I said I got a

problem Ted Cruz was the national debate

he was the number one guy in college he

was the number one guy in law school

how do L do I beat a guy that's that

good at debating but we came out okay

Ted and Ted Ted was tough smart as hell

on top tough

good man but it is sir the first card I

looked at seriously was Ted Cruz and he

was he was literally I mean national

debate was the best in all of college

and in law school and he's a talented

guy in recent debates you see these

people up there they're not Ted Cruz

believe me hey Ted you should turn

Democrat you would win the nectar over

now he says

I don't think so every single Democrat

candidate for president raised their

hand in favor of giving free health care

to all illegal aliens

they want to give more to illegal aliens

and they give to American citizens you

say that as president I will never allow

the Democrats to take away your

healthcare dollars and give them to

people that are in our country illegally

in fact I just signed an executive

action to protect American health care

benefits for all American citizens among

those hardest hit by illegal immigration

are millions of legal immigrants right

here in Texas including millions of

patriotic hard-working Mexican Americans

who play by the rules pay their taxes

follow our laws and strengthen our

communities

whether you are a first generation or

tenth generation and every American

citizen and you do you've been treated

so badly but you're not being treated

badly anymore you know we got rid of the

individual mandate from crazy Obamacare

every American citizen deserves a

government that defends your jobs your

safety your family your borders and is

always loyal to you for a change we're

loyal to you my administration has

reduced illegal border crossings by over

60 percent since May and that's with no

help from the Democrats they won't close

up the loopholes they won't close the

loophole so we could do it in 15 minutes

and we're building the wall and we're

doing all of these things but the

Democrats won't close up the loopholes

you know what the loopholes are right

how about

catch and release you catch them you say

hello darling how are you could you

please give us your name and phone

number that have a phone could you give

us your address they don't want to have

an address that's in Honduras could you

please give us your address and your

name they can't I said that's okay we

catch and we release and they go into

our country and then we are getting them

out of the country and you know what

some are very good people some are

unbelievably dangerous and bad people

and we're focusing on the bed and

they're getting the hell out of our

country okay

while we're fighting for shared

priorities the American people the

Democrat Party has never been farther

outside of the mainstream

they've gone nuts every Democrat running

for president is pushing a health care

agenda that would utterly eviscerate

Medicare my administration will always

protect Medicare for our beloved seniors

and we will always protect patients with

pre-existing conditions our ambitious

campaign to reduce the price of

prescription drugs has produced the

largest decline in drug prices in over

51 years people don't talk about it

the press will not talk about it we have

news conferences we tell them this they

will not put it in the press you have no

idea how dishonest the media is you have

no idea

[Applause]

virtually every top Democrat also now

supports late term abortion ripping

babies straight from the mother's womb

right up until the moment

[Applause]

and that crackpot governor from Virginia

execute the baby after birth you saw

that way after

you remember that one from last year

that's why I've asked Congress to

prohibit extreme late term abortion

because Republicans believe that every

child is a sacred gift from God

Democrats are now the party of crazy

politicians high taxes high crime open

borders late term abortion socialism and

blatant corruption they're corrupt like

Schiff is corrupt he's corrupt the

Republican Party is the party of the

American worker the American family and

it's the party of the American dream

it's also the party of Honest Abe

Lincoln we forget that got a we got to

use that more often don't get they get

an honesty I liked Honest Abe we've

confirmed

it's just honest title thank you explain

that to them you're right we've

confirmed 152 federal judges to apply

the law as written including two Supreme

Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett

Kavanaugh

you know when I got into office they say

the most important thing a president can

do I actually think it's defense but

they say is the appointment of federal

judges so what I got in always when you

get in there a nun how many do you have

I have none none so I got to say how

many federal judges do I have sir you

have 142 federal judges as they you

don't understand the question

that's impossible that would mean that

President Obama didn't appoint a hundred

and forty two judges you get none or

you're doing a bad job as president

because you're representing a different

philosophy very different so I came I

said no no no check it again then they

said 138 then they came back actually

sir the number is 142 we were right the

first time

142 judges within two months we will

have John and Ted and all of these great

congressmen we will have passed 180 to

federal judges

and then they say Obama wasn't such a

wonderful president how your wonderful

president how are you a wonderful

president when the most important thing

you can do you hand it over to the

Republicans a hundred and forty-two how

is that going I mean how is that good if

I were a Democrat I wouldn't be too

happy about that number and we'll have a

record number of judges by the time our

term is over in 16 years maybe 20 I'm

only

I'm only kidding because every time I do

that they say see he's assuming control

we have this crazy guy on television and

he goes you know he's talking to a guest

he goes you know he's going to win don't

you if you know he's going to win I mean

we've done a good job he should be happy

but he said our military our schools our

this everything he says you know he's

going to win and the guest goes won't

know what we're gonna fight we're gonna

fight no no he's going to win and you

know he's never leaving you know that

don't you

he's never he's never leaving he's never

going to leave and I thought this wacko

was kidding you know as a comedian I

thought he was kidding he's serious he

really believes that we passed for the

veterans VA choice and VA accountability

on behalf of those grateful they've been

trying to pass it for almost 50 years

they couldn't get it done but those guys

right there and me we got it done and to

protect America's security I went

through the United States from the

horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal

I recognize Israel's true capital and

opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem

and we also recognized Israeli

sovereignty over the Golan Heights for

years you watched as your politicians

apologize for America you've seen it

many times oh I'm so sorry now you have

a president who's standing up for

America and standing up for your great

state of Texas

you must never forget the 2020 election

is about one thing and it's coming up

fast it's about you it's about you one

thing about you I'm doing this view you

know we had on 2016 I really believe it

was maybe the greatest election I guess

George Washington was good but that was

easy and by the way he did even better

percentage was in judges that I did he

had 100 percent but we could have 50

percent that's not bad and I had many

more than he had so I guess you got to

give George Washington what do you think

Ted you got to give him something I'd

say yeah Honest Abe that was a pretty

good election right it's in they say are

stopped Andrew Jackson but Andrew

Jackson was a good election but we had

among the greatest elections of all time

but we have to now cement that election

to get a cement it and once we do it's

going to be very hard to take this

beautiful experiment apart

because it's all about your family it's

all about your future and it's all about

the future fate of our great country

so aboard with your help we will lift

millions of more citizens from

welfare-to-work dependence to

independence and poverty to prosperity

together we will elect a Republican

Congress to create a safe modern fair

and lawful system of immigrants

and by the way thank you Robert Jeffress

for being here wherever you may be in

this massive wherever you are Robert

where is he he got up he started saying

he may not be the greatest person I said

this is like four years ago I see this

guy what a mouthpiece this guy and he's

a man of God and he said he may not be

the greatest he may not be the most

perfect Christian he may not know the

Bible as well as some of us but he's a

leader and I love Donald Trump I said

who is that guy I love that guy Robert

Jeffery

he's a great guy got a big big group of

people on Sunday morning Stu I can tell

you we will enact trade deals that

result in more products proudly stamped

with those beautiful words that

beautiful phrase I love it made in the

USA we will achieve new breakthroughs in

science and medicine finding new cures

for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS

epidemic in America in less than 10

years were doing that who would have

believed we could do that we're doing

that and the previous administration

spent no money on that and we're

spending less but think of that who

would have thought that we're gonna end

within 10 years the AIDS epidemic in our

country who would have thought we've

advanced that we will defend privacy

free speech free assembly religious

liberty and the right to keep and bear

arms

above all we will never stop fighting

for the values that unite people all

across our land and throughout the great

state of Texas this is a great start

we support protect and defend the

Constitution of the United States we

stand with the incredible heroes of law

enforcement thank you we believe in the

dignity of work and the sanctity of life

we believe that faith and family not

government and bureaucracy are the true

bedrock of our society we believe in the

Creed's of self-reliance personal

responsibility and American independence

we believe that children should be

taught to love our country honor our

history and always respect our great

American flag

loyal citizens like you helped build

this country and together we are taking

back this country our country we love

our country we're returning power to you

the American people that's what we've

done from Dallas to El Paso from Houston

to Austin from the Red River to the Rio

Grande this state was settled by some of

the toughest men and strongest women

ever to walk on the face of the earth

Texas this is the state where William

Travis James Bowie and Davy Crockett

made their last stand at the Alamo

this is the state where a small band of

patriots at the Battle of Gonzales armed

with a single cannon stared down a

foreign army and declared come and take

it

and Texas is the state where generations

of farmers ranchers pioneers and oil

workers built a life and a home with

their own two beautiful hands they

didn't have a lot of money they didn't

have a lot of luxury but they all had

one thing in common

they loved their families they loved

their country and they loved their God

these courageous Texas patriots did not

shed their blood sweat and tears so that

we could sit at home while others tried

to erase their legacy demolish our

liberty and destroy our proud American

heritage we will never ever allow that

to happen

with your help your devotion and your

drive we are going to keep on working we

are going to keep on fighting and we are

going to keep on winning winning winning

we are one move one people one family

and one glorious nation under God and

together we will make America wealthy

again we will make America proud again

we will make America strong again we

will make America safe again and we will

make America great again thank you Texas

[Applause]
