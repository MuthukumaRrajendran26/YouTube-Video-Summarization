we begin with two disturbing cases

playing out in northern BC one involves

a young tourist couple found dead on a

remote stretch of highway the other two

teenagers gone missing their vehicle lit

on fire

and a body found nearby police say

complex investigations are underway but

it's possible the two cases are

connected they're appealing to the

public for information and they're

urging people in the region to be safe

we would like to stress the importance

of heightened vigilance and awareness

for anybody traveling in and around the

area we encourage people to camp in

known or established areas and locations

in addition general safety precautions

continue to prevail make sure your

family's aware and have a plan

make sure your family's aware of what

your plan is let's begin with a

double-murder of Australian Lukas Fowler

and his American girlfriend China DS

at a gas station on Sunday July 14th

hours later their bodies were found on B

C's Alaska Highway Road crews who were

among the first on scene confirmed to

global news they saw a third man with a

couple before they died and there were

concerns then that something was wrong

Gobbo B C's natty a Stewart is in Fort

Nelson tonight with the latest Nadia

Robyn it's unclear if the couple was

targeted or victims of an unfortunate

circumstance the road crew worker who

was immediately called to hold a scene

says what he saw there kept him up at

night for days Trevor Pierre says he got

the call that a young couple had been

found dead he remembered seeing the blue

Chevy van the couple was driving parked

on the highway the night before but he

was not prepared for what he saw when he

walked around to the back of the vehicle

the guys

this area was exposed and there is a

little wound there I couldn't tell what

kind of wound and the young lady

they're both mean facing north the young

lady can see her face cuz her hair was

back and he not that you can see blood

it had papa stand right here says he did

his best not to contaminate the crime

scene

Pierre held the scene for four hours

waiting for RCMP to arrive my boss had

said that there was three speaking there

there's only two but there was another

vehicle

she'd spotted another vehicle and she

did that to the same people the question

now is who is that third individual

these unanswered questions have people

feeling unsettled here back to you Robin

Nadia Stewart NBC the father of Lucas

Fowler is a police inspector in

Australia he travelled to BC after

learning of his son's death it's a love

story that's ended tragically

it really is it's the worst ever love

story because we now have two young

people who had everything ahead of them

tragically murdered

the investigation is still in its early

stages but police say it's possible it

may be connected to another crime about

470 kilometers away that's where police

found a truck on fire last Friday they

believe it belonged to two teenagers who

are now missing they haven't been heard

from in several days adding to the

mystery police say they found the body

of a male about two kilometres from

where the truck was burned police have

confirmed the body does not belong to

either of the teens
