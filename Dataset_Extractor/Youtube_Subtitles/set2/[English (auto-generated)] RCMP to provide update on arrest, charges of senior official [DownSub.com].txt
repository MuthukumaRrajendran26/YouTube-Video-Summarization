today RCMP Commissioner we're lucky

we'll be providing a short update it's a

good thing I said that on the matter

related to the ongoing investigation

arrests and charges against Cameron

orders

Avila comiXology Brenda lucky fella in

Costa Mesa zoo

sonar Kotaku that has that somebody's

accusation optical camera of this our

spokespersons there are simply

Commissioner Brenda lucky as well as

Deputy Commissioner Mike GM officer in

charge of federal policing operations

like a meself see Brenda lucky Ellis at

Mike gem FC responsibilities of the

police video have we'll have a brief

question and answer period after here

and then we'll go to those who dialed in

national security under the Criminal

Code and the security of Information Act

the news of his arrest has shaken many

people throughout the RCMP particularly

in federal policing as well as the

broader domestic and international

security and intelligence communities

who worked with mr. Ortiz in 2018 the

RCMP was supporting an FBI investigation

and through the course of this file

the RCMP uncovered possible internal

corruption we took immediate action and

launched an investigation into the

alleged activities our focus has been to

eligibly pursue this investigation which

led to the arrest by virtue of the

position he held mr. Ortiz had access to

information the Canadian intelligence

community possessed he also had access

to intelligence originating from our

partners both domestically and

internationally this level of access is

appropriate given the position he held

as men

and we are assessing the impacts of the

alleged activities as more information

becomes available we are aware of the

potential risk to operations of our

partner agencies in Canada and abroad

and we are working in partnership to

ensure mitigating strategies are in

place once the RCMP became aware of the

alleged activities we worked with

partners to take immediate steps to

safeguard the information together we

are working to assess the level of

active operations if any in the last

week cooperation and support amongst the

security and intelligence community as

well as our law enforcement partners has

been absolutely remarkable we thank them

for their ongoing support support we

recognize that these allegations if

proven true are extremely unsettling

Canadian that our priority continues to

be the integrity of our investigations

and the safety and security of the

public we serve before taking some of

your questions I want to emphasize that

the alleged actions of mr. ortus are by

no means reflective of the important

work carried out by employees of the

RCMP regardless of rank or category of

employee on a daily basis as

commissioner of the RCMP I am mandated

with the safety and security of

Canadians and I would not be able to

achieve this mandate without the support

and dedication of all we employ Thank

Nicole who's that CP who don't under the

questions now she could identify

yourself use the mics in the aisles and

keep yourselves to one question thank

you

High Commissioner Mercedes Stevenson

Global News wondering if you'd move the

mic just slightly closer to you thank

you so we can get your audio a little

bit clearer that you mentioned that in

this particular case the RCMP is

acknowledging that Mister I think it's

ortus so you heard it pronounced both

ways clarify that don't be great that he

in fact did have access to Allied

intelligence and I have multiple sources

telling me allies are extremely

concerned about this have any allied

countries or organizations temporarily

suspended limited or restriction

restricted intelligence sharing with the

RCMP and with Canada at this point

restrictions from the RCMP are

restrictions from allies in terms of

when the investigation started can give

me a sense of the resources that were

put into this when you first became

aware that there was somebody inside the

RCMP you had compromised information

take it very seriously and there's

multiple haven't used in this

investigation it's a big investigation

so we put all hands on deck can you give

me a ballpark on what's the maximum it

des fluctuated throughout the

investigation from when we started when

we were apprised of the information

there's needs the information there's a

group of investigators and it just grew

from there for the different

investigative techniques that we were

required to get us to the arrest of mr.

Ortiz a dozen two dozen six dozen um

Katherine Toni CBC I think a lot of

Canadians a big question on their mind

is why there's been some recording that

suggest that he had a debt problem can

you talk at all of it a bit about motive

in this case and encryption also seems

to be a huge part of this case is the

fact that he was using encrypted

services as that stalled your

investigation at all given the depth of

this investigation it's taken us several

months to get to this point and I

understand a case is ongoing but

obviously another big question is who he

was talking to can you talk a bit about

any sense of who the foreign entity or

terrorist organization yes again given

that it's a sensitive investigation we

can't share that information

Mackenzie gray CTV News can you rule out

that mr. auratus acted alone or is there

any continuing investigation to

determine if he had any health within

the RCMP or any other national security

agencies at this point we have no

indication of additional people but

obviously there'll be a lot of people

that

witnesses continuing the investigations

at this point it seems like mr. auratus

had a substantial amount of high-level

information can you talk about the kind

of information that he was able to

obtain no sorry at this point in

investigation very sensitive

Globe and Mail

I have a question about another line of

inquiry it's about the allot of inquiry

into the S&C lavell an affair I wanted

to ask you does the force want the

government to waive a full cabinet

confidentiality for all witnesses so

they can continue this examination of

the matter and whether there was a

destruction of justice well today we're

here for the mister or Ted

investigation so I don't want to comment

very much but we do take all

investigations very seriously and

investigate to the fullest I'm please

correct me if I'm wrong but both you

work with mr. Ortiz what were your

impressions of him I have actually never

met mr. Ortiz being new to the role

since June I've looked into him a couple

times but other than casual discussion

that's about it Jim Brown scale The

Canadian Press can you tell us a little

bit more commissioner about the FBI

investigation and how the RCMP became

aware of this concern well in

cooperation with the FBI we were working

on an investigation in 2018 during that

investigation we came across certain

documents that led us to believe that

there might be some internal corruption

at that point we got the want to say

sensitive and international

investigations unit to work on the case

working through all of the possible

leads in that investigation

which led us to the arrest of mr.

artists last Thursday and of course

we're led to believe that the phantom

secured company was at the heart of this

and that's the investigation the FBI

probe we're talking about that the RCMP

was also involved in yeah I can't

comment it's we aren't the lead in that

investigation so I'm unable to comment

on that you've talked about bringing

more civilians into the force to make it

more modern more flexible does this

incident give you any pause about plans

for that absolutely not it's not about

the category of employee

it's about persons decision-making or or

lack of and somebody it's an act that it

doesn't matter the category of employee

every employee in the RCMP is

value-added to our organization and a

valued employee so no not at all

value Lucas you're designing actually

sir it was a fortuitous over please

press star one the other question upon

that question the first question is from

Daniel LeBlanc Global Mail muscle along

oh please go ahead hello I'd like to

know so this you know the leak or the

presence of a mole early goes back to

2018 can you give us a sense as to

whether or not what happened internally

to make sure that information classified

information from Canada and its allies

was more secure or does that the

mitigation measure only start after you

fight you identified the possibility

that mr. Ortiz was responsible earlier

this year

our mitigation measures are are dynamic

so we're always looking at improving the

way we deal with the integrity of secure

information we go to our partner

agencies as well for best practices at

the time when the documents were

discovered it was we had no information

specifically as to if it led back to the

RCMP or if it got through some other

source so it took some time to look

through the all the go through the

investigation to get to the point of the

arrest of mr. Ortiz it gives a bit of a

sense that the Allies our understanding

of the situation they're fairly they you

know is aren't they angry isn't there

kind of something more going on than

just people are caught understand that

you know there are issues I you know get

a sense that you know our lights are not

that concerned whereas you know the

breadth of the leak and the person the

access he had it was a sense that this

is very worrying situation for CSIS for

CSC but also for international allies

well I would definitely imagine that

there is concern amongst our five eyes

community as well as within Canada but

it's so early to tell what the breadth

and depth of this investigation for

right now there's great support from

those communities both in Canada and

abroad and of course we're concerned as

well but we until we know what we're

dealing with specifically our risk

assessment is fluid and the measure

severity of such an event is fluid as

well and could change depending on what

we find has the investigation furthers

next question on the line Mitsy thank

you for the question and if I understand

your question our partner agencies might

lose trust in the DRC MP there is always

that possibility but I am confident that

the measures that we have in place will

mitigate those such risks as well as any

risk to further events and secondly if

you know when your investigation into

the potential damage might be concluded

that I have no idea

no I we can't put a timeline to that

right now as we were going through some

of the material that were seized so it

would be a B I can't commit that

timeline to that but having said that we

are keeping our key partners involved in

discussions by weekly manner to reassure

them of the progress and our Forks are

diligently working on get to the end of

this great thank you do we have another

question on line

operator no other questions on the line

yes we do have a question from Paul

Piero from wall street during moment

will apart please go ahead sorry we

can't hear the question hello hello

ahead let's see if every learned in 2018

through document what kind of documents

with this copy of an email was the memo

given the sensitivity of this

investigation

unfortunately I can't share the type of

documents discovered can you document in

collaboration working with the FBI on

another investigation the documents are

discovered from a laptop sorry the audio

is bad we couldn't hear that last

question was it from a laptop again I'm

not at liberty to share that information

sorry maybe I could kill Mr Bryan case

go ahead thank you very much

I guess we can take one more question

from the room Kathryn again and there

was a seems to be a break between 2015

and 2018 on the charge sheet and the new

sorties goes there any security check in

in between those two any individual in

our organization with top-secret

clearance gets recertified every five

years and mr. ortus was had a valid

security clearance no

all right thank you very much this

concludes our news conference just go

clean let's go faster fast thank you

very much thank you for your respectful

questions Thank You Missy the conference
