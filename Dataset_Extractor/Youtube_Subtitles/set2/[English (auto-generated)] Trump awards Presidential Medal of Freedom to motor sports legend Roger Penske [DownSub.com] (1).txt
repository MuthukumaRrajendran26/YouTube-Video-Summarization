well thank you very much a very special

day today I'm delighted to present our

nation's highest civilian honor to a

giant of American industry

entrepreneurship and auto racing

the legendary Roger Penske Roger I want

to congratulate you on receiving the

Presidential Medal of Freedom with us

today is vice president Mike Pence and

many terrific members of my cabinet

thank you all for being here appreciate

it

they're all fans of Rogers and most

importantly with us is Katherine and

you've been married for a couple of

years do you want to give the number I

know what the number is but I'm refused

to give it 46 years that's pretty

amazing and you look at the the

conditioning and you're doing something

right both of you right and it's been a

beautiful marriage I know that for a

long time

Roger was born in Shaker Heights Ohio in

1937 the son of a successful businessman

Roger learned the value of hard work at

a very young age and at the age of 14 he

attended his first Indianapolis 500 at

15 he bought his first car with money

saved from his newspaper route as a

teenager Roger spent his free time

taking apart engines and repairing the

old wrecks

he obviously learned right from the

start he knew what he was doing in 1955

he attended Lehigh University where he

studied Business Administration and

started racing in the Sports Car Club of

America

Roger quickly demonstrated exceptional

talent for racing cars over the next few

years he was named sports car driver of

the Year by Sports Illustrated and North

American driver of the Year by the New

York Times and the LA Times he also

became the only person to win the SCC

A's president cup three times an

astonishing feat rarely equaled if

55 victories in the top racing series of

his time

Roger ended his career as a driver in

1965 you know I didn't know you were

that great a driver I knew you were

really great at other things like

winning the Indy 500 but I had no idea

he was that good a driver see what do I

know right that's pretty amazing

actually but he ended his career as a

driver in 1965 to run a Chevrolet

dealership in Philadelphia he rapidly

succeeded in the auto business and

returned to the racing world in 1966

with the creation of Team Penske who

would have thought what that would have

meant who would have known what was

going to happen

the new team exemplified professionalism

dedication and discipline in everything

it did Penske quickly became known for

immaculately clean cars of great colors

I might add the colors are incredible

scrubbed wheels waxed garage floors and

excellence on the asphalt the team

earned the reputation of Penske perfect

and soon built an unrivaled brand in the

world of racing Team Penske drivers form

a roster of racing legends from Mark

Donohue who delivered Team Penske its

first Indianapolis 500 win to Al Unser

and Rick Mears who were tied for the

most Indy 500 victories in history there

was Danny Sullivan and his unbelievable

1985 spin and win Rusty Wallace who made

Team Penske presidents known in NASCAR

and the iconic three-time Indy 500

winner Helio Castroneves I recently

hosted Team Penske --zz newest champions

Joey Logano and psy me Simon

pizanno who is a terrific guy they were

here just recently I guess that was for

us for a big moment because we're going

to tell you that story at the White

House after their victories in the 2018

NASCAR Cup Series and the 2019

Indianapolis 500 but Roger was here just

before his 18th Indy win and he was here

being

for what he's done with NASCAR and the

Cup Series and I just looked at him I

said how many times have you won the

Indianapolis 500 cuz I know how hard it

is it's very hard Japan Germany all of

these countries Italy they all spend

hundreds of millions of dollars a year

trying to win I said how many times have

you won he said 17 I said you got to be

kidding 17 I know was a lot but 17 and I

said that's great I shook his hand that

was the end of it he was been a friend

of mine for a long time by the way we go

a long way back I refused to say how far

I read Roger but we go a long way back

but I should see 117 times that's great

and that was he and then about two

months later I had the television on

it's the Indianapolis 500 and Simon is

doing good but then he's in 2nd and 1st

and back and forth and it ends up he

wins by about two inches and it was an

incredible race and with an incredible

driver in a beautiful car and it's Roger

Penske won so I said wait a minute he's

told me 17 times and now this is the

18th time and I called him at the track

and I was watching him on television he

takes the phone out he's talking to me I

said you think you can get these

operators in the White House or

unbelievable John they're like

unbelievable I said you think you can

get Roger Penske he won the Indianapolis

500 about two seconds ago

and Edwin he said no problem sir he had

him on the phone like thirty seconds

later and I'm watching him the cars

pulling in and I congratulated Roger and

I thought to myself it's an incredible

achievement because I know how hard are

the countries not just people but

countries they can't win it they spent

hundreds of millions of dollars new

technology new engines one engine's fast

but it breaks down one engine slow but

it's reliable this guy keeps winning so

to do that was incredible

so I said I think we have to give him

the Presidential Medal its greatest

medal there is except for as you know

the Congressional Medal of Honor and

they were on a par once for military

ones for civilian but I just thought it

was an incredible thing I just leave him

he's up to 17 and now I turn on again

and he's what

and I know what it takes to win and to

win in that league because it is very

very tough that's in addition to all of

the NASCAR victories his head so all of

these exceptional racers were part of a

team of professionals that never stopped

working to achieve perfection and it's

really that every member of Team Penske

would admit they could not have done it

without the man that they call very

affectionately the captain he's the

captain no detail is too small or effort

too great for Roger in his relentless

pursuit and he is relentless I can tell

you that of the competitive edge in 1993

he started building an engine he would

later describe as a rocket he worked

with a small team of engineers for

months in total secrecy didn't want to

talk to anybody wouldn't let anybody out

lucky he didn't work at the White House

head of leaks he would have had leaked

that engine would have been built long

before you said what happened not only

the White House wall of Washington he

decided not to do it in Washington that

was a good move the incredible pushrod

engine still existing or not they push

work no good they have better than that

now that was old stuff right the pushrod

engine he developed became known as the

beast and delivered over 150 horsepower

more than the competition Team Penske

roared to victory at the 1994

Indianapolis 500 leading 193 out of 200

laps credible in total Team Penske has

won nearly 550 major races 35 national

championships two Daytona 500s 18

Indianapolis 500s I think that's just an

incredible achievement 18 Indianapolis

500s and secured over 600 pole positions

in other words he knows what he's doing

incredibly Team Penske won more than one

out of every three Indy 500

championships in which he competed so

every third year he'd went essentially

it's not even conceivable when you see

all of the tremendous talent money rich

people

rich men rich countries with a lot of

talent they can't beat him for nearly

five decades it has dominated the

greatest spectacle in racing and in

recent years has become a growing force

in NASCAR where I really got to realize

how many times he's won not only NASCAR

but Indy Rogers been inducted into the

Motorsports Hall of Fame NASCAR Hall of

Fame and automotive Hall of Fame he's

built a team and a legacy that will

endure forever I mean frankly there'll

be nobody will ever be able to challenge

this I don't care what they do how good

they are there are some things you can't

do and it will endure forever in the

history of racing and of the history of

sports I think Roger is also one of the

most successful businessmen in America

he started with a single dealership and

today runs an automobile and automotive

empire that employs 64,000 people at

over 3,600 locations with annual

revenues of over 30 billion dollars

that's fantastic I still think 18

Indianapolis 500 s is more incredible

but that's ok it's ok but that's really

incredible what you've done in business

he's rescued countless struggling

business ventures I remember when he did

it like Detroit Diesel Division of

General Motors he bought that one for a

song I remember huh which was something

with a lot of potential but they didn't

know what they were doing he didn't say

that I did where he increased the

company's heavy-duty engine market share

from 3% to 30% very quickly Roger is a

dedicated philanthropist who has worked

tirelessly to get the Motor City back on

its feet

he's chaired the downtown Detroit

partnership and the host committee for

the 2006 Superbowl when the city needed

emergency vehicles Roger organized

business and business leaders and they

really did a fantastic job they

purchased 100 police cruisers and 23

ambulances he helped save the Detroit

Institute of Arts with a 10 million

dollar donation and created the Roger

Penske Detroit fund to support the

city's home

population Roger from racing to business

to philanthropy you have moved from one

great victory to another you're very

unique person I know you for a long time

you're a very unique person and truly a

great champion and truly a winner no

matter what you do it turns to gold you

are a legend and the speedway and your

legend and business and your name is

revered everywhere the checkered flag

flies and beyond that so I will now ask

the military aid as soon as Roger is

going to say a couple of words in all

ask the military aid to forward step

forward and present the Presidential

Medal of Freedom to a legend in so many

ways and a great friend of mine mr.

Roger Penske thank you Thank You mr.

president it's a wonderful honor to

receive this award it's amazing to be

here today and thank you

vice president pence you know for you

being here in your busy schedule you

know it's amazing you know many years

ago my mother and father invested in me

and told me the love and the passion of

our great country and to think that I'm

standing here today in the Oval Office

with the president the vice president

all you're here today and especially my

family to receive this wonderful award

just hard to believe that that would

happen as we all know people make a team

and people make power and I think the

great thing that I've had the

opportunity to use to surround me with

talented individuals in my business and

we built Penske Corporation over many

years and to see the success it's really

due to our people Motorsports has been

the common thread through our business

for many years in fact it helped us

build our brand think about 18

Indianapolis 500s and also the many

championships but guess what that was

the power of the team

the 64,000 people that work for us on a

worldwide basis in Phi

conten are five continents and nine

countries these are the people that I

need to thank today because they hadn't

done their work I wouldn't be here today

so we think about things that we've been

able to do and supporting the

communities where we work and where we

live in 2006 I was a Superbowl chairman

in Detroit Super Bowl 40 an aperitif or

me as an individual but get the public

and private sector together to start

developing a plan for the Renaissance of

the city of Detroit when you think of

that today it's called almost a model

City thirteen years later when you think

about Detroit it is the automotive

capital of the world as we go forward

together as a nation the innovation and

technology will come out of Detroit will

be amazing thinking about my family and

thinking about support my wife Kathy to

hear today of 46 years has been my

support really my support staff for so

many years she's walked this long river

for me and along this walk for many

years and I want to thank her personally

for the love and support of my family

that's here today our thirteen

grandchildren her love and passion has

been so special and to think that I'm

here today with my five children their

spouses my brother and his wife is

amazing and to me this is a very very

special time I really want to thank the

president for this prestigious honor

receiving the Presidential Medal of

Freedom really is something special and

to me it means more than any business

success or motorsport trophy I also want

to thank the men and women in our armed

forces they're the real heroes and the

backbone of our country I want to thank

them vice president pence mr. president
