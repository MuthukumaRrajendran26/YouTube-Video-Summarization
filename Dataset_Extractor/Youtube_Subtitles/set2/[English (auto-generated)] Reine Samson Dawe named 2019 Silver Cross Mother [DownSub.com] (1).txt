the silver cross is a Medal of Honor

wrapped in deep sadness I think it is

important that Canadians remember what a

war costs the cost to ran Sampson da her

youngest child Matthew he was smart

funny

mischievous adventurous there was

nothing to stop him

Matthew like his three older brothers

signed up for a career in military

service the ties in this family run deep

their father Peter dog is a retired

leftenant Colonel because they were so

enthusiastic about it like I went along

with it and supported them in their

choices and I knew that they would do a

very good job of it Matthew watched two

of his brothers serve in Afghanistan and

come home then in 2007 it was his turn

he was 27 married with a young son

Global News happened to cover a part of

his deployment our platoon right now is

providing security on the flanks for

these guys as they're going through his

mother knew the risks I was very worried

but her role was to remain stoic and

supportive Matt wouldn't allow me to

express any fear or doubts and in fact

there they're all like that it's hard

enough on them you know they decided on

the profession and they will do whatever

they're asked to do because that's what

they signed for and we have to respect

that but that doesn't mean that when I'm

on my own I can have my little mini

breakdown on July 4th 2007 the vehicle

Matthew was in hit a 500-pound bomb

buried in the road he was killed

instantly along with five other Canadian

soldiers and an Afghan interpreter that

same day Matthew's son Lucas turned to

we've told so many things about his

there that I think he probably feels a

time that he knows him quite well

Samson doth still tries to give back to

the country that cost her family so much

she volunteers with a charity that

promotes education for women and girls

in Afghanistan it's one way to carry on

the mission of all the people who win

there every Remembrance Day they honor

him at the Cenotaph near the shore of

Lake Ontario looks good doesn't it the

place I always feel it's a good place to

come in near me she knows she's not

alone in her grief as silvercross mother

shall represent all mothers like her I

want to do so with dignity and and

thinking about them all you know sharing

their grief like I I have grief and I

certainly understand what they're going

through that's one of the things that I

miss the most about not hearing his

laughter anymore

but I remember it so clearly I can just

close my eyes and I can hear him laugh

and and I yeah I just know he's still

there and I'm sure I'll see him again
