child pulled on to where I was he said

when he was there he looked at him as

well and he didn't turn to look at me

and I heard the gunshots when we aim and

if we're in line to open a bank account

we saw people running and I grabbed him

by the handle because I okay so I

grabbed him and shots were fired so I

took him to the back room the bed and
