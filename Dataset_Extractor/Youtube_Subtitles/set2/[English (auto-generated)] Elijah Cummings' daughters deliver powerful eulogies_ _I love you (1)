I knew this day would come but I never

thought it would be so soon my dad and I

had a special bond one that spanned the

37 years of my life and the 37 years of

his life of public service our

connection was and remains one of heart

spirit and soul it is almost impossible

to put that connection into words but I

am deeply grateful for it and today I

just want to say thank you daddy

so I've written you a letter dad to

express my gratitude to you for a

lifetime of lessons memories and

blessings recently you said my

handwriting was getting too small so

like in recent times I would like to

read this note of thanks to you aloud

except today daddy all these people have

gathered to celebrate your life so it's

not just you and me I hope as always to

make you proud dear dad over the past

week Baltimore the nation and the world

have celebrated your life and your

contributions to our collective humanity

you were so many things to so many

people

you touched so many lives and that's

because yours was the one not only of

duty and service but one of compassion

and empathy you truly saw people and

they saw you no matter their a lot in

life no matter their politics no matter

anything that made them different from

you as you often said to me thank you

for just being you you were the gift and

I have much to be grateful for and while

you were congressman mr. chairman and a

seasoned political leader perhaps the

most important title you held in your

sixty-eight years of life on this earth

was dad first

thank you for loving me before I even

took my first breath in this world I

remember you telling me how when I was

born you were amazed that you could hold

me in the palm of your hand just one

hand this life my life in your hand you

and mom literally gave me life and we've

shared an unbreakable connectedness ever

since which is what makes today so

incredibly hard well right now the words

ring hollow in my heart where since last

Thursday I feel like a piece has been

forcefully torn out

it is this connection and this deep and

abiding love that endures even when I

can no longer feel your big bear hug or

give you a kiss on your forehead dad

thank you for teaching me the dual power

of my beauty and my brilliance

this might sound boastful but ever since

I was a little girl my dad always told

me I was beautiful that may sound basic

and like a no-brainer but dad wanted me

to understand and appreciate my

blackness

and truly feel that my rich brown skin

was just as beautiful as alabaster or

any shade of the rainbow

he insisted on buying me Brown dolls

that looked like me so that I could

truly appreciate myself and what made me

different from the width of my nose to

the fullness of my lips and to the

coarseness of my hair now his dad would

say often in speeches just a footnote

here I vividly remember being on the

playground in elementary school and a

classmate calling me ugly to which I

retorted well my daddy says I'm

beautiful I then proceeded to pull out

his business card for my little purse

filled literally with nothing else but

rocks and said you can call up my dad

and ask him so thank you Dad for also

teaching me to be bold to be confident

and to stand in my power to stand up

against bullies be it there over words

or covert actions you did not suffer

fools and you taught me not to either

thank you for teaching me discernment to

spot those with false motives or miles

away and to see the difference between

blind ambition and true purpose and

being called to a mission

thanks for teaching me what leadership

by example means by exhibiting it and

just to circle back on blackness and

brilliance daddy thank you for

encouraging and me to attend Howard

University your alma mater you once

quipped in a speech at Howard's Chapel

the year before I enrolled that no

matter where I decided to go to college

your tuition checks would be going to

Howard thank you for investing in my

education well before and through Howard

thank you for teaching me to persevere I

remember when we took the training

wheels off my bike when I was maybe six

or so and I went careening down the

steep sloped alleyway behind the house

and fell I remember crying to you and

telling you that I didn't want to ride

ever again and you told me that I could

do it and to wash off my scrapes little

legs and try again and I did thank you

for teaching me that I do know used to

ask me questions on the way to school

and lazily or maybe out of a lack of

confidence and the answer I just say I

don't know you tell me

Jennifer you Dino so tell me what do you

think you always cared what I thought

that never stopped from our first

conversations to our last thank you for

teaching me to strive for excellence and

all that I do thank you for instilling

me in me the idea that if I tried my

very best that is all I could ask of

myself thank you for giving me an

appreciation for the spoken and written

word I remember many a day either in

your law office on st. Paul Street or

your office in the State House in

Annapolis where I'd be tasked with

reading articles from the Baltimore Sun

and memorizing that I'm sorry

summarizing them on those summaries the

best score I could get was an e for

excellent and I always aim for those

that summary writing led to writing for

school newspapers in high school and

college and the career in communications

I have now it is no coincidence

it was preparation daddy thank you for

seeing me I saw you

thank you for nurturing me

I think I natured you in return thank

you for loving me unconditionally and

teaching me what love and leadership are

by your example I will miss your smile

your great big smile that could light up

a room I will miss your blooming voice

that would firmly sound

Jennifer what I knew I was in trouble I

will also miss the voice that was just

quiet and plain saying things like John

can you plug in my phone I will miss

calling you after seeing you on TV to

tell you what a great job you did and

maybe sharing a couple pieces of

constructive feedback for your

consideration because you always strive

to be better than the day before you

encouraged me to have a point of view

and a thoughtful critique I will miss

you calling me before dawn on my

birthday to seeing your very special

renditions of happy birthday complete

with a lot of riffs and soul but perhaps

not a steady tune I will miss our

exchanging Christmas presents and you

immediately trying on whatever sweater

or Under Armour tee or fleece was a part

of the gift I will miss opening presents

from you and you saying I saw it and it

just looked like you I will miss us

having brunch

just us two were you me and idea or you

me and mom and ordering dessert and you

eating more than half of it every time

it reminded me of us going to the harbor

and getting ice cream when I was a kid

secretly dad I started getting bubblegum

ice cream because I thought that finally

when you asked for just a bite I might

get the cone back intact

what I would give for just an afternoon

at the harbour with you you could have

all of that ice cream dad I will miss

the way could you squeeze so much

ketchup on to pretty much everything but

especially the fries that ended up soggy

with tomato and goodness at the bottom I

will miss your wise words I will miss

our brief conversations between meetings

and hearings and I will miss the longer

ones I will miss our month or so long of

recent Saturday night sleepovers when we

just hung out and discuss just about

everything in our lives sometimes we

just stay silent and watch the latest

20/20 murder-mystery I'd look over to

you just to see your face and catch you

catching a glimpse of mine that is love

enduring love we weren't just dad and

daughter we were confidants and friends

and daddy I will miss that the most

so on this day after so much has been

said in a week filled with celebrations

of your life to steal a phrase from you

I just stopped by today to tell you how

much I love you how much I thank you and

how much I will be indebted and forever

connected to you that does not change as

you've transitioned from this life to

the next our love and doors rest well

and rest easy daddy you deserve it

I know our conversations and connections

won't be in person anymore but they will

be just as they've always been filled

with heart spirit and soul I love you

dad

thank you

good morning everyone

he'll have to forgive me I'm reading off

of my phone I am a millennial after all

[Music]

so I want to thank everyone for being

here it means the world to my family to

know what our father brother uncle son

meant to his community and his

colleagues and the people he worked with

and I have to say to his staff can you

please stand up to my dad's staff if

you're here

[Music]

they deserve it

[Applause]

I just want to personally thank all of

you the way that you loved my father

makes us family forever and I'm so sorry

that you lost someone who was so much

more than a boss to you so I'm confident

that everyone in this room today knows

exactly the type of man my father was if

you didn't you wouldn't be here he was a

passionate leader a dependable friend an

unrelenting voice for change his passion

for his city his state and his country

was evident in his practices and his

policies many of his colleagues have

spoken over the past week and today

about what an honor and a privilege it

was to serve with him but my sister and

I were fortunate enough to hold the

highest honor which was being able to

call him dad and I would be remiss if I

didn't share a glimpse of what it was

like to be his daughter

my dad would text me sometimes at 3 a.m.

just to tell me he was proud of me or to

give me words of encouragement whenever

I call he'd always answer hey beautiful

and I could tell that he was happy to

hear from me and he was never hesitant

to give his opinion whether asked for or

not and was quick to remind me at any

given moment that I owed him some money

he wasn't a father known for patience

but rather for persistence when I was

getting ready to take my driving test

he made me parallel park what felt like

50 times in a row until I got it down to

a science and I could not do it wrong

and that was a very long day but I

passed my test on the first try

he always held me accountable and made

sure that if I said I was going to do

something that I did it and always

encouraged me to be more giving he

instilled in me the same principles that

my grandparents instilled in him

integrity service and humility I could

come to him with anything ask him for

anything even cardi B tickets he didn't

really know who she was but he went out

of his way even from his sickbed to make

sure that I could go see her he believed

in me believed in my dreams as if they

were already realities he was never

afraid to invest time knowledge wisdom

and money into anything that I aspired

to be he was genuinely invested and

committed to my happiness and well-being

at all times last year I gave him a card

for Father's Day

that said a parent's job is to see their

child the way God sees them and you do

that for me and I would encourage all

the parents here and watching to see

their children the way my dad saw me the

way God sees me without limitations not

bound by obstacles or circumstances and

with the power to determine my own

destiny

[Applause]

my dad not only encouraged me he

empowered me he equipped me with the

tools that have prepared me to stand

here with you today and he made it his

life's mission to ensure that every

child in the country was as equally

equipped we owe it to him I owe it to

him to not let his life's work go in

vain in him in his infamous first speech

on the House floor he recited his

favorite poem just a minute and as I

mulled over which words to save today I

heard a song playing on the radio that

embodied that same spirit in the words

of Eminem

the moment you own it you better never

let it go you only get one shot do not

miss your chance the opportunity comes

once in a lifetime

my father seized his moment and because

of it we are all gathered here today

and to all of you when the time comes I

hope that you seize yours as well thank

you I love you dad

[Applause]
