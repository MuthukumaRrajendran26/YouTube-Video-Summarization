Jesse Morton believes in the power of a

second chance this was him a decade ago

and this is Morton today I'm a former

jihadi extremist and now I worked to

combat hates polarization and extremism

after an abusive childhood Morton wound

up in prison where he was radicalized

eventually joining al-qaeda and becoming

one of the group's most prominent and

radical recruiters as we set forth a

template for online radicalization and

propaganda that took the message of

Osama bin Laden and we transitioned into

meaning into graphic design into

utilizing social media 2.0 he helped to

launch al-qaeda's online magazine which

inspired a similar example from the

so-called Islamic state but he's now

turning the page by launching these new

publications turning his power of

persuasion against extremist groups we

took that model back and we created a

anti-extremism inter version of those

magazines the online articles tell the

stories of d radicalized jihadis and

right-wing extremists like canadian brad

galloway the former leader of a violent

white separatist group for me was a half

ideology and and but it was more about

the sense of brotherhood our search for

identity after 13 years Galloway says

his family finally convinced him to

change wanting to find clarity and a

life away from negativity when I was

leaving there was no like firm resource

for four people to go to when when they

wanted to leave these movements the

magazines are part of a campaign to

change that they'll be posted on to

jihadist and far-right internet and

social media platforms and include links

to organizations that provide support

such as life after hate run by former

white supremacist Tony McAleer it's one

thing to call people out and that's

important but we also have to be

prepared to call people and to help

understand and they're the

behavior and their their beliefs is is

the key to healing and these former

members are now living examples helping

others to let go of their hate
