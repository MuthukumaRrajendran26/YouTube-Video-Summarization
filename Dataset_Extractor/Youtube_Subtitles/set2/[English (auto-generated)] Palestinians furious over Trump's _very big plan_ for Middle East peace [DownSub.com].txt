believing he can defy history President

Donald Trump revealed his plan to bring

peace to the Middle East all prior

administration's from President Lyndon

Johnson have tried and bitterly failed

but I was not elected to do small things

or shy away from big problems the eighty

page proposal strongly favors Israel it

was drafted by Trump's son-in-law Jared

Kushner and is already backed by Israeli

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu it

addresses the root cause of the conflict

the incident by insisting that the

Palestinians will finally have to

recognize Israel as the Jewish state the

plan would redraw the map creating a

Palestinian state with limited

sovereignty Israeli settlements in the

West Bank would remain Israel would also

keep control over Jerusalem's holy sites

under this vision Jerusalem will remain

Israel's undivided very important

undivided capital almost immediately

protests erupted in Jordan while

Palestinian leaders who were not at the

table branded the plan as a conspiracy

it just looks like Trump with all of his

strong support of Israel from the get-go

is yet one more time trying to do a

favor for his friends in Jerusalem and

Tel Aviv that's what it feels like to

most people previous American presidents

have tried to bring the two sides

together to negotiate that two ended in

failure Trump's plan was likely dead the

moment it was announced but it's already

being used as a road map by Netanyahu

who plans to move ahead to annex West

Bank settlements in the coming days
