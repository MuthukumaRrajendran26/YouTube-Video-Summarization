this is a nuclear power station a basic

explanation as to what happens inside

these stations involves the heating of

water to create steam that steam is then

spun inside large turbines which

generates electricity while these

nuclear power stations are essential to

our everyday lives they can also harm us

if they accidentally release radioactive

iodine into the air outside their plant

although it turned out to be a false

alarm the Ontario government sent out an

emergency alert of a possible issue at a

nuclear plant in Pickering Ontario

leading a lot of people to ask what can

be done if there's a real emergency if

there is a release of radioactive iodine

and a person gets that in their body

their thyroid would absorb the

radioactive iodine and it will be an

increased risk of cancer so what does

this mean for the people that live work

or study near a nuclear power station

the distance doesn't matter at all it's

all about the level of exposure so of

course being closest to the plant we

would expect that's where you'll have

the highest risk

that's where potassium iodide pills come

in in the event when radioactive iodide

is accidentally released into the air

outside the plant the whole point of the

potassium iodine pill is to make sure

the thyroid gets as much iodine as it

could possibly hold and then if any more

comes in and that would include

radioactive iodine your body will just

get rid of it but how effective are

these iodide pills and taking the

potassium iodine pills is very effective

ideas to have the iodine pills as an

initial protection but then get away

from the exposure and it's used in

hospitals all the time for treatment of

different thyroid issues and thyroid

cancers it's really well studied there's

not a risk that really comes with using

them Hargrave says you have to take

these pills every few hours until the

exposure risk has been eliminated she

also says that the iodide pills are

highly effective for people who've been

exposed to radioactive iodine but it

will not work for other types of

radiation that is released by a nuclear

power plant
