Iowa was supposed to set the tone for

the Democratic primary season candidates

had no choice but to move on to the next

stop without knowing who won technical

issues held up results the first batch

only began trickling out a short while

ago Pete booted edge is leading the

delegate count so far with 62% of

results reported followed closely by

Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren is in

third former Vice President Joe Biden

the national front-runner for much of

the campaign is trailing in fourth place

the results debacle has raised questions

about the caucus format and whether Iowa

is still relevant in the election race

our Washington bureau chief Jackson

Prosecco is in Des Moines where he's

been watching the caucus chaos unfold

Jackson well Robin the strong

performance of a couple of candidates

suggests that Democrats are nowhere

close to being ready to coalesce behind

a single candidate not surprising at

this early juncture but the bigger

priority for the party right now is

restoring faith in the integrity of the

election after last night's debacle as

the caucuses unfolded Bernie Sanders

Pete Buddha judge there was a little

sign of trouble

Iowans shuffled around gymnasiums and

living rooms to signal their support for

the Democratic candidate of their choice

especially this year you have someone

you're passionate about and some of you

think can beat Trump and hopefully those

who might know in 1600 precincts like

this one in West Des Moines it went off

without a hitch until it came time to

send the final results to Party

headquarters using a new smartphone app

it would not let me change that the

system crashed leading Democrats unable

to deliver statewide results or declare

a winner

months of hype in the first in the

nation state fizzled over the course of

one long night the candidates were left

scrambling to address supporters when

those results are announced I have a

good feeling we're gonna be doing very

very well the debacle killed off

candidates hopes for a rousing victory

speech it may have saved others from

embarrassment and Democrats have already

moved their campaigns to New Hampshire

the next primary state after a historic

night in Iowa which crowned at neither

winners nor losers

there is no system that is perfect and

we should be reevaluating even before

last night occurred and now for sure

Jackson president Trump delivers his

State of the Union address tonight that

surely takes away the attention from the

Democratic candidates as the Iowa

results trickle in

it really does Robin what it does is it

means that candidates like Budaj and

Sanders lost out potentially on their

breakout moment because they didn't get

to make a victory speech last night and

now all the attention is going to be

focused on Trump tonight and tomorrow it

with the impeachment inquiry meaning the

stakes in New Hampshire one week from

tonight are that much higher

Jaxson Prosecco in Iowa thanks Jackson
