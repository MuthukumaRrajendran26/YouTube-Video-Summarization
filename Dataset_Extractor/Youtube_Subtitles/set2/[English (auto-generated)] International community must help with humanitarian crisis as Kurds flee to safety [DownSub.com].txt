hello I'm Mercedes Stevenson and this is

the West block politics perspectives and

players abu bakr al baghdadi the world's

most wanted terrorist and the brutal

leader of isis died in his own hand

after being cornered by the u.s. special

forces on a raid in syria critical

intelligence for that raid was

reportedly provided by the Kurds who

fought at the sharp end of the spear

against Isis as Western Allies now many

however are fleeing for their lives

joining me now is Bayon Sami abdulrahman

the Kurdish regional government

representative to Washington DC welcome

to the show thank you very much miss

Robin I know you've been very busy in

these past couple of weeks on Capitol

Hill meeting with American lawmakers

what's your message been to them well

I've primarily focused on events in

Kurdistan region and Iraq but of course

also on what's happening in our

neighborhood in particular what we see

is the potential fallout of recent

developments in Syria there are many

issues that were concerned about

security issues and of course

humanitarian which I think sometimes is

lost in this conversation about what's

happening in Syria one of the big events

that's playing in a lot of people's

minds of course is the death of mr.

al-baghdadi one of the most wanted

terrorists in the world the leader of

Isis the Kurds have come out and said

that they had a key role in that

operation that they provided

intelligence in fact they may have had

an operative who collected mr.

Baghdadi's underwear to verify the DNA

test on him can you speak to the role

that the Kurdish forces played in terms

of working with the US Special Forces to

capture mr. Baghdadi and ultimately

resulting in his taking of his own life

well I have to be honest I don't know

the details because that's not my field

but certainly the Kurds have a close

working relationship with the United

States

Baghdadi and Isis have been great

enemies of the people of Kurdistan but

also people of Syria and Iraq as a whole

and the international

communities so it's in all of our

interest to cooperate obviously in that

part of the world we have very good

intelligence very good human

intelligence of course we rely on

technology like our advanced partners

who have that kind of technology but

really for us it's human technology it's

accurate it's on the ground and I have

to say it's very very brave so I'm very

proud of any role that the Kurds have

played in this and other operations and

I think the takedown of Baghdadi

symbolically is very important but it

still leaves Isis as an organization it

doesn't really meet the demands and the

need for justice for the from the

victims of Isis and especially I'm

thinking of the Yazidis and the

Christians who suffered genocide at the

hands of that terrible organization

president Trump has announced that he's

withdrawing American forces from Syria

of course the Turkish government has

launched incursions into Syria attacking

the Kurds in that area when you heard

the president make that announcement

what went through your mind well to be

honest we have heard president Trump's

say that before I believe he said it on

two maybe three occasions and so in some

ways it was expected that the US would

want to leave Syria and President Trump

had definitely expressed that desire

previously I think what took us back

what surprised us was the sudden way it

was announced it's understandable that

the US would want to leave Syria someday

and maybe Iraq and Afghanistan someday

too but we hope it will be done in an

orderly way not leaving others

vulnerable or exposed to negotiating in

a very weak position

so as I said I don't think there was a

surprise because President Trump had

certainly flagged this earlier but it

was perhaps the manner and the speed

with which it was done but anyway since

then President Trump has announced now

that some US forces will stay behind

largely to protect oil fields I think

that is significant we must protect oil

fields and other potential sources of

revenue from Isis and it's also

important that all of those Isis

prisoners and Isis camps if you like

still under lock and key

and they're in Kurdish held areas of

Syria there have been calls in Canada to

bring home Canadians who travel to Iraq

and to Syria to fight with Isis there's

been concerned that some of those camps

they were being in how that by the Kurds

have been disrupted by these Turkish

offensive operations what's the

situation on the ground right now in

terms of those Kurdish camps that were

holding Isis prisoners are they still

intact or all those prisoners now still

out on the loose my understanding is

that some prisoners did escape perhaps a

week or two ago now but otherwise

generally the camps and the prisons

under control but even before the

announcement by President Trump these

prisons these camps were a concern and

they remain a concern the numbers are

huge al whole camp holds thousands and

thousands of people the conditions

aren't very good it's really we've been

signaling this for a very long time

these really and there are camps like

that in Iraq too by the way there's no

real care and by care I don't mean a

luxury lifestyle what I mean is there

are children in these camps okay their

parents are Isis fighters and they

believe in the ideology

but why aren't we doing something about

the children otherwise in five years

time in ten years time these children

will be teenagers they will be adults

all they will have known is growing up

in a camp rampant with ideology that is

all about death and destruction and with

this will have happened while we we have

let them grow up in this atmosphere so

these camps whether they're in Syria

Iraq or elsewhere all of us collectively

the international community in

particular need to be much more mindful

that we're not producing future Isis

fighters whatever name they might call

themselves and so while these camps

excuse me in in Syria are under

protection now it doesn't really deal

with a bigger question that has always

existed don't just leave it to the

Iraqis and the Syrians or the Kurds to

just manage these camps this is the

responsibility of the international

community and I would include Canada and

I would include the UK and France and

Germany and and the United States and

that it's our collective responsibility

to deal with these camps and to ensure

we don't have future fighters who are

now growing up hip not be growing up

there so if you were able to speak to

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau today you

would ask the Canadian government to

bring the Canadians who fought for Isis

back to Canada I do believe it's the

responsibility of every country every

government to bring back its own

Nationals and put them on trial and that

would be my message to Prime Minister

Trudeau I understand that some countries

are concerned that perhaps they don't

have enough evidence to convict somebody

that perhaps the laws of certain

European and Western countries are such

that after 10 years or so those people

would be released well perhaps it's time

that you looked at your laws but you

can't just shirk your responsibilities

and dump these serious global problems

on those of us in the Middle East who

have to live with it day in doubt with

what's happened with the situation of

Turkey targeting the Kurds in Syria

the Kurdish forces worked very closely

with the Canadian special operations

forces in Iraq worked with many Western

militaries really at the front end of

the battle against Isis those countries

have been very muted in their response

to Turkey are you disappointed with the

international response including

Canada's response to the Turkish

government's actions well I understand

turkeys an important NATO ally for the

United States and other countries and

that has to be kept in consideration I

think what's really important is that

there are so many factors that need to

be taken into consideration the border

area is a heavily populated area

Qamishli

our mood many other cities along that

border are heavily populated so what's

going to happen to that population there

are currently two or three hundred

thousand Syrians from around that area

who have been internally displaced the

longer they are displaced the longer

they're not able to return to their

homes the more likely that they will

cross over and come to Iraqi Kurdistan

and we in Iraqi Kurdistan are already

taking care of 1 million displaced

Iraqis and Syrian refugees who fled in

2011 and 12 our population in Iraqi

Kurdistan is 5 million we're already

taking care of 1 million displaced

people and refugees we are not in a

position to receive another two or three

hundred thousand new refugees from Syria

where we can take them in but we can't

feed them we can't clothe them we have

no shelter for them and we are asking

the international community to be aware

of this let those displaced people

return home otherwise if they come over

to Iraqi Kurdistan we will urgently need

very urgent large-scale humanitarian

support and I hope Canada will play a

role in that don't leave us to carry the

burden alone please come and help us but

ideally they should really be allowed to

go home now

to their own homes and to stay there

over 11,000 Kurdish fighters died

fighting Isis is there a feeling in the

Kurdish community that there's a

betrayal here that the international

community is now looking the other way

after working so closely with them

11,000 Kurdish fighters died in Syria

and in Iraq 2000 pesh MERGA died and

thousands on both sides were injured so

certainly we have paid the price

fighting Isis with our blood the

international community of course has

been an important partner with equipping

training providing resources but nothing

plays replaces blood at the end of the

day we've given enormous sacrifice so I

think that partnership needs to be borne

in mind

definitely when President Trump first

announced the withdrawal there was a

sense of shock and bewilderment over

time we've seen that President Trump has

said some forces will stay behind the US

Congress has spoken out very very openly

very strongly there are various

resolutions and bills that are being

discussed and I think it's become clear

that this was a political decision but

it doesn't necessarily reflect what

other Ameri

Conte what will happen if you don't get

the access to the humanitarian

assistance or military assistance that

your people are asking for to be honest

I think the military relationship

between the United States and the SDF in

in Syria will continue that's how it

appears even though it's a very fluid

situation and it changes day by day with

us in Iraq in Iraqi Kurdistan we have a

very strong partnership with the United

States and both sides have reiterated

their commitment to that with regards to

the humanitarian fallout we're very

concerned that if hundreds of thousands

of Syrian Kurds cross over into Iraqi

Kurdistan that we will have a

humanitarian catastrophe on our hands

just because we don't have the

wherewithal to cope with another new

influx as I said we have 1 million that

we're already taking care of the

international community has drawn down

its assistance in Iraq by 50% over the

past year in Iraqi Kurdistan the 1

million that we're taking care of 70% of

the cost is borne by us we provide

health care education policing hygiene

whatever you need to provide to a

population we provided the international

community only provides 30 percent of

their needs and it's decreasing

day-by-day so we're not in a position to

be able to take care of the new children

and the new women and men who arrive and

these are people who arrive with their

own health conditions

some of them need kidney dialysis some

of them have cancer and they need

treatment for that or pregnant women I

mean these are people like you and me

they have health care needs they have

educational needs so who's going to take

care of that we don't get much help from

the federal government in Baghdad if any

the international community is reducing

its assistance so again we're being left

to put to bear the brunt of it and I

hope that the international community is

listening I hope Canada which has always

acted responsibly is listening and will

help us with this MS Abdulrahman thank

you so much for joining us you're

welcome thank you for allowing me the

opportunity to share our story with you

that's all the time we have for today

thanks for joining us for the West walk

i'm resetti Stevens

you
