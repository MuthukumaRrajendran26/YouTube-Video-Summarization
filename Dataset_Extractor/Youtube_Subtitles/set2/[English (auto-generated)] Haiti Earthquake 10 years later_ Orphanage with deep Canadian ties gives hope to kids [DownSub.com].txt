tomorrow will mark the tenure

anniversary of the powerful earthquake

that devastated Haiti it completely

crippled the Caribbean island and

compounded the already grim reality for

orphans and thousands more who find

themselves homeless or suffering the

loss of loved ones it's been a long road

for so many but tonight there is some

hope thanks to an organization with deep

Canadian ties Antony robot reports from

Haiti these children are orphans of the

2010 earthquake just a few of the tens

of thousands in this country left

without parents after the disaster kit

Lee arrived at this orphanage in

port-au-prince when she was 9 months old

she weighed just 9 pounds so far from no

finding that it didn't get done if it

wasn't for the orphanage she says I

would have died today she has found a

home and hope at the place which

promises both Emmanuelle is now 16 he

required emergency surgery on his head

after his house collapsed on top away

his mother died just a few weeks later

and we've had many many too have come

and we say you know what look at the

eyes and see how much they want to live

that's all they're asking Gladys Thomas

founded this orphanage and school 37

years ago she says it was her calling to

transform a life only God can do yes

let's do it

and this orphanage has a deep affection

for Canada it's largely funded through

generous donations from Canadians

and as many's a thousand children who've

come through these doors over the years

have been adopted by Canadian families

they're the lucky ones the earthquake

resulted in an estimated 20,000 children

becoming orphans there are about a

million in this country but only a

fraction of those end up in an orphanage

here at least there remains plenty of

hope that these orphan children will one

day find their forever home
