this is what the Chinese government

wants the world to see a rare glimpse

inside one of its secretive so-called

vocational training centers part of what

Beijing describes is a highly successful

de-radicalization program but newly

leaked documents confirm what witnesses

have been claiming for years this school

is actually a massive prison camp

Lincoln I can't even begin to describe

how abusive it was in the camp says this

former detainee we slept in a cell on

the floor and we're told that Islam is

an infectious disease the classified

Chinese government documents from 2017

reveal the inner workings of a vast

network of internment camps used to

detain and brainwash more than a million

Chinese Muslims the documents say

inmates can be held indefinitely and

earn credits for their ideological

transformation they describe the camp's

mass surveillance system to prevent

escapes including watchtowers and double

lock doors to help ensure strict secrecy

it's hard to deny what is happening now

it's going right to the top of the

Chinese government and it really is one

of the biggest Human Rights scandals of

the 21st century it's like a nightmare

it's like a horror movie

Julie is one of around 2,000 Weger

Muslims living in Canada but most of her

family remains in China she says she

hasn't been able to reach her sister

since last year

and she said oh you start worrying about

us that was the last conversation sorry

that was the last conversation and since

that and she wouldn't pick up anything I

can't contact with her at a press

conference China's ambassador to the UK

was asked to explain the leaked

documents don't listen to fake news

don't listen to fabrications for years

Beijing also denied these camps even

existed until faced with mounting

testimony and satellite images these

documents are the most damning evidence

yet a vivid description of what goes on

behind these walls in the government's

own words

for the world to see Jeff sample Global
