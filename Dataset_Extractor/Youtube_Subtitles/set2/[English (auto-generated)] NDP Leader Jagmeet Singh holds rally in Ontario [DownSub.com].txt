amazing candidates joining us today

I actually know that I've missed one

Alok Mukherjee for st. Paul's one hour

ago was nominated what a great team of

candidates what a great team of future

MPs who we can count on to stand up for

the Toronto Greater Toronto region Wow

it's wonderful to see so many familiar

faces yeah now as I was biking over here

I passed by some of the affordable

housing buildings units they're built by

a city councilor called Jack Layton

[Music]

I remember Jack's passion to fight for

people who have no homes and I remember

Jack's anger when he witnessed

indigenous families having to sleep in

shifts because their homes are just too

small and then I recall recently the

Parliamentary Budget Officer reporting

that Trudeau's future housing plan for

indigenous families is less than half

the funding provided over the previous

10 years yep that's right less than half

the funding over the last 10 years you

heard me less than the Harper years subs

[Applause]

substantially lower now not only are

those desperately needing housing are

going to get less support half of

Canadians indigenous children are

chronically living in poverty we saw the

storms we know there is a climate crisis

and we know there long waits and

emergency wards and that is the record

of the Trudeau liberals for year in

government

[Music]

now NDP leader Jack me sink gets it you

know why because they understand

hardship he experienced it himself

and when I saw him connecting with

people who are struggling while my

friends I see a lot of Jack Layton in

Jack meat sing

[Applause]

that is why Min Seok Lee is going to

take backs rondo stand for and pain gun

riding orange again now I remember how

my dad connected with everyday people

with people struggling to make ends meet

people like Victor who was struggling to

get around our city in his wheelchair

and was being ignored by most

politicians in our city I remember how

the death of a homeless man Eugene upper

on Spadina shook him to his core Jacque

taught us to never forget who you're

fighting for and who you're in it for

now I learned many lessons that I still

carry to this day and maybe the most

important lesson is not to listen to the

naysayers not to shy away from the tough

fight

[Applause]

and I have had I have had the

opportunity to work with Jack Mead and

watch him since he became leader of the

NDP and let me tell you jag meets him

saying has that same fighting spirit he

knows who he's working for not the

wealthy and well-connected they're

already well represented by other

parties he's in it for you and that's

why he will make a great Prime Minister

of Canada so my friends are you tired of

- those broken promises are you tired of

government that can find four billion

dollars to buy a pipeline and very

little money for building affordable

housing

are you tired of the same old parties

signing with the rich and powerful

elites so are you ready for someone who

is fighting for you in it for you so

please join me in welcoming to the stage

the next prime minister the first

racialized Prime Minister of Canada Jack

me sing

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

Wow

Wow look around you look at this room

this is amazing

thank you so much for being here today

thank you before I go any further I want

to acknowledge the traditional

territories that were gathered on I

think it's always important to take a

moment to do that so today we are

gathered on the traditional territories

of the Mississauga's of new credit the

Anishinaabe the Chippewa the Holden

nashoni and the when debt people's and

Toronto itself is covered by treaty 13

with the Mississauga's of credit of new

credit now when we acknowledge the lands

were gathered on it's not enough to just

acknowledge the lands and the people we

also have to acknowledge the in justices

that the first people of this land have

endured historically and ongoing and

commit collectively to remedy it so true

reconciliation is more than just words

it's about remedying that injustice

injustice like what the Human Rights

Tribunal just released a couple days ago

the fact that indigenous children were

found to be recklessly and deliberately

discriminated by the Canadian government

so we want to put an end to that to make

sure that never happens again and that's

why we knew Democrats are committed to

putting into law in Canada the United

Nations declaration on the rights of

indigenous people

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

so right now a lot of people are

thinking about their friends and family

in Atlantic Canada hurricane durian hit

and it devastated a lot of communities

hundreds and thousands of Canadians in

Atlantic Canada are without power and

they're in a really tough way so we want

to stand in solidarity with the people

our brothers and sisters make sure that

their safety is paramount send word to

your family and also acknowledge the

work of the first responders who we're

dealing with a really tough time right

now

I gotta give a really huge thank you to

Olivia and Mike it was beautiful to have

you onstage right now to hear your words

I'm honored I'm touched thank you for

continuing a powerful legacy thank you

so much

I'm pretty sure everyone in this room or

many people in this room have stories of

how Jack inspired them or mentored them

all of us in some ways are probably here

today because of the inspiration that

Jack led and the movement that he built

I remember when I first met Jack he took

me to this side I was running as a

candidate to become a member of

parliament in the 2011 election and we

were just finishing up the Casa de

Parade so he took me to this side and he

said to me you know a lot of people are

gonna tell you because we've never won

in in Brampton that it's not possible

that it can't be done people gonna tell

you that our dream of building a better

Canada where no one's left behind

they're gonna tell you it's impossible

that it can't be done

and he looked at me and the eyes he said

to me don't let them tell you it can't

be done

[Music]

and when he said that I could feel how

much he meant it and I believed it I

believed in that moment yes we can do

anything if we've come together we work

hard we can turn those naysayers around

and we can get it done so I have to say

it fills me with a lot of pride when I

think about the amazing country that we

live in it's a beautiful place

it's an incredible country when I think

about when I was a kid though I never

imagined that someone that looked like

me could ever run to be prime minister

but now but now kids come up to me and

say seeing you do this I feel like I can

do anything I can be anything that I

want that's pretty cool that's pretty

inspirational you know this is a country

where we believe in taking care of one

another we believe in taking care of

each other we're gonna run a campaign

built on that value we're gonna bring a

message that is hopeful that we can

build the country of our dreams a

country where everyone has a place to

call home

health health care when you need it

clean water to drink and clean air to

breathe

a good job and a bright future my

friends over the course of my life I've

had the opportunity to meet with

thousands of Canadians from across this

country to hear their stories their

hopes their hopes for themselves for

their kids and for the future from the

schoolyards growing up in st. John's

Newfoundland Labrador and Windsor -

representing Brampton and now the great

community of Burnaby everywhere I go I

meet people who are working hard they're

looking to be treated fairly and they

want to build a good life for themselves

these are the people the New Democratic

Party has always worked for these are

these are the people I'm in it for

but for too long in Ottawa the

government in Ottawa liberal and

conservative have been making life

easier for the rich and harder for

everyone else conservative and liberal

governments have made the richest

corporations pay less and less and it's

costing Canadians more and more new

that depletion bluefish impale a

gouvernment conservatory Libby hoe can

say down unless a sand stallion system

key profit or ich Aquila stone Bella has

don't when you now now what does this

mean for everyday people I get a little

glimpse of that that frustration and

that anxiety that people have right now

when I think about what I went through

with my family when we were struggling

with my father's addiction and job loss

at that time the uncertainty and the

fear and the worry the pressure to make

ends meet was all-consuming so trying to

figure out how to how to make men and

ends meet it's tough but I see that

everyday in families more and more

people are struggling to get by it's

tough for so many families those are the

people I'm in it for that's who we're in

it for that's who we're in it for

[Applause]

[Music]

you know we're in it for the young

person who is working two jobs for

minimum wage to try to pay off their

student loan that the government is

still charging interest rates on now she

doesn't get why the Liberal government

is sticking it to young people when they

just rode off in one year alone six

billion dollars in corporate loans we're

in it for the mom who just changed jobs

and lost your Medicare coverage her

health care coverage and as now racking

up credit card bills just to pay for the

medication that her kids need now she

doesn't get why she doesn't have any

coverage now when liberal governments

have promised it the time before and the

time before her and the time before

we're in for young people this young

generation of people who are taking to

the streets and telling us it's time to

wake up

to the climate urgency to the climate

crisis that's putting everything at risk

they don't they don't get why the

Trudeau government spends 4.5 billion

dollars on a pipeline and let the

biggest polluters off the hook

you know I'm in this for this 10 year

old kid that I met he's living with a

chronic illness born with it he's got to

take injections and medication and blood

work and he's okay with his illness but

he's just worried about how much his

medication costs his parents a

ten-year-old kid that feels like he's a

burden to his parents that's just wrong

but why does this kid feel like he's a

burden why are people feeling this way

well let's look at Trudeau's track

record to figure it out

liberals met with big pharma and

insurance companies 875 times and the

result is Canadians are paying some of

the highest prices for drugs in the

world now Trudeau's government also met

with the well-connected lobbyists of the

big telecom industry they met with them

565 times

now as a result Canadians are paying

some of the highest prices in the world

for cell phone and Internet services and

on top of that this government is giving

50 million dollars in government

subsidies to Rogers Bell and Telus

and on top of that Trudeau and his

government had over 1500 meetings with

the oil and gas sectors so it should

come as no surprise then that why

liberals broke a promise to end the

billions of dollars of subsidies and why

they spend 4.5 billion dollars of your

money to buy a pipeline see the thing is

judo says the right words in public but

in meetings behind closed doors he's

ready to do anything that his corporate

buddies ask him to do my my friends four

years ago judo charmed us with some

pretty words and a lot of empty promises

and just like decades of past

governments mr. Trudeau has been caving

in to the demands of those at the very

top the richest corporations it's clear

Justin Trudeau is not who he pretended

to be and my friends and Russia is not

going to be any better the Conservatives

are not the answer Harper made the clamp

the plan to cut 30 billion dollars in

our healthcare services Trudeau put that

plan in action and mr. shears just gonna

keep that plan in place or maybe make it

worse mr. shear is gonna keep on cutting

cutting taxes for the very rich sure but

it's gonna cut health care and the

services that you and your family are

counting on that's exactly what Stephen

Harper did

that's what Doug Ford is doing right now

here in Ontario that's

[Applause]

I guess people don't like dog for it

very much here but that's what

conservatives always do they'll offer

you a little bit of money but you'll

pray the price with more expensive drug

coverage more expensive health care more

expensive homes and cell phone bills

more expensive child care more expensive

tuition and a never worsening climate

comes down to a very clear choice who

can you count on to fight for you

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

friends I love Canada I love this

country and I believe we can make it

even better this election New Democrats

are proudly offering something different

a new deal for people we can expand on

Medicare to cover prescription drugs for

all and then extend it to dental care

mental health and vision care

we can do it but only if we stand up to

the big lobbyists of the big pharma and

insurance companies we can build more

affordable housing starting with 500,000

new homes to ease the housing crisis we

can do it but only if we take on money

launderers and speculators we can

provide leaf relief for Canadians now

paying some of the highest prices in the

world for cell phones and Internet we

can do it but only if we stand up to the

large telecom companies and we and we

can act now to cut climate pollution and

create 300,000 more jobs in a clean

economy we can do it but only if we have

the determination to stand up to the big

polluters and end fossil fuel subsidies

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

now some are gonna say that this can't

be done that we can't afford it but my

friends we're gonna do something else

too something that the Liberals and the

Conservatives would never do we are

gonna ask the people at the very top to

pay a little more we are gonna end

offshore tax havens close the loopholes

we're going to close the loopholes and

we're gonna put a tax on people who have

net wealth of over 20 million dollars

[Applause]

now we all have different reasons for

why we go out a part of became a part of

this movement we think different people

that we're fighting for

the reasons why we want to make things

better there's lots of reasons that

we're coming together and I know it's

not easy it's tough to fight for a

better future

and I think about what my mom always

told me she told me you've got to have

chardikala now George Nicola is is

rising spirits but not just any sort of

rising spirits it's the courageous

optimism in the face of hopeless odds

when you dig deep and you keep on

pushing forward in a lot of ways and a

lot of ways that's the essence of what

it means to be new democrat fighting for

what's right despite how hard the odds

are

now now each of you has your own reason

for why you believe in the power of

working together and my friends we will

deliver for people but only for bold

only we have the courage to take on the

powerful interests at the very top
