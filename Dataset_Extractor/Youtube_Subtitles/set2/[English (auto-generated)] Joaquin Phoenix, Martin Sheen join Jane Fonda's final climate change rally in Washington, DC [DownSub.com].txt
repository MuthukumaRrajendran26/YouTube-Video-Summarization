the police have just arrived here we're

going to be here I want us all to open

our hearts for a moment for the people

in Australia who are living in an

inferno as a result of the climate

crisis people are who are losing their

homes who are fleeing their lands a land

that has recently lost to the fires what

is reported to be a billion animals our

hearts go out to them in the last few

days the specter of war has loomed again

the climate movement and the anti-war

movement must move as one and climate

the climate crisis makes our nation in

all nations less secure so I just wanted

to say that because if we are called

again to confront this administration

about the possibility of going to war we

all have to rally

we all have to rally together on behalf

of diplomacy and not war the meat and

dairy industry is the third leading

cause of climate change and I think

sometimes we wonder what can we do in

this in this fight against climate

change and there's something that you

can do today right now and tomorrow by

making a choice about what you consume

we are called to find something in our

lives worth fighting for something that

unites the will of the spirit with the

work of the flesh something that can

help us lift up this nation and all its

people to that place where the heart is

without fear

living in some person
