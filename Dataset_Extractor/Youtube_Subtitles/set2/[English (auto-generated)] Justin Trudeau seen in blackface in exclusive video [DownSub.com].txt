Global News has uncovered a third

instance of racially charged images of

Liberal leader Justin Trudeau let's

bring in our Ottawa bureau chief

Mercedes Stevenson she has broken the

story she joins us now from Vancouver

with the exclusive details good morning

good morning a video uncovered by Global

News which has been verified by the

liberal war room as in fact containing

images of Liberal leader Justin Trudeau

in blackface makeup the Liberals have

declined to tell us exactly when and

where this video was taken but you can

have a look it's pretty grainy we wanted

to be very sure that this was in fact

the liberal leader before we made the

video public they did confirm to us last

night that we are looking at Justin

Trudeau in this video you can see that

he has black face makeup on it's

covering his face neck his arms and

hands and you can see between the tears

and his jeans there that he also appears

to have the makeup down his legs as well

this as you mentioned is the third image

of him within about 12 hours that has

come out and initially broken by Time

magazine I can tell you the Global News

obtained this video and has been trying

to verify it for a couple of days we

approached the liberal war room with it

last night after that news broke from

Time magazine to ask if this was in fact

him obviously such a stunning video that

we wanted to be absolutely sure but they

do say yes this is Justin Trudeau in the

video they referred to his previous

apologies on wearing blackface makeup

and brown face makeup as being

inappropriate they've not issued an

additional apology for this video at

this time it's interesting because the

liberal leader was asked last night

whether he had ever appeared in brown or

black face before

after that time news story broke and

what he said was that he had done it

once before in high school this is not

the high school incident we have

verified this is a separate incident so

this is now a third time that the

liberal leader has been seen in

blackface or brown face and as you can

imagine this is extremely politically

charged given the history of blackface

and brown face makeup the race

stereotypes that it has been used to

perpetrate and certainly the liberal

leaders position on being progressive

and inclusive so we are waiting to hear

reaction of course today on the campaign

trail from all the parties but again

this is the third incidents that we have

seen and it is a separate incident than

the two that were reported previously

and one that the Liberal leader did not

reveal last night when he was asked

about this now Mar City is one incident

can be career-ending for any candidate

now we have three incidents is there any

estimate to the political damage to this

and how he could recover well that's a

great question and we'll have to say how

the campaign handles it and how this

rolls out and how people react but as

you say one incident is bad enough and

in the United States it certainly has

ended politicians careers Justin Trudeau

has a history of progressive policies

appointing people to cabinet where he's

demonstrated that he is trying to be

diverse what happens now the videos like

this come out you know with the the

incident in high school he was in high

school the incident here he is not in

high school and the other incident he

was a teacher so you're now looking at

three separate incidents that becomes

much harder to explain three separate

occasions than one and on this occasion

he does not appear to be in a play or at

a costume party it's hard to know what

he was doing here since the liberal

campaign has not shared that with us we

certainly are trying to get that

information we have information from the

source who shared the video but we are

waiting to verify that before we report

it you can see he appears to be outside

somewhere rural and previously in the

video you see people walking by in life

jackets like they've been in boats so

we're trying to find out exactly what

was happening here and why he was in

blackface although there really is no

politically acceptable answer for that

in 2019 so certainly going to be a

difficult day for the liberal leader now

that he has to explain not one incidents

but three that have become public
