we're moving on no understanding just

reiterate in the five minute rule mr.

moe I have several questions meaning of

which that you just answer will be kind

question here in a moment but I want to

lay some foundation so we'll go through

these fairly quickly I'll talk slowly

I'm said that I talk fast I will talk

slowly

thank you in your press conference you

stated any testimony from your office

would not go beyond our report we chose

these words carefully the work speaks

for itself I would not provide

information beyond that which is already

public in any appearance before Congress

do you stand by that statement yes this

is closed in special counsel's office in

May of 2019 have you conducted any

additional interviews or obtained any

new information in your role as Special

Counsel since the since the closing of

the office in May of 2019 have you don't

get any new interviews and any new

witnesses anything and you can't confirm

you're no longer special counsel correct

I have no longer special counsel at any

time with the investigation was your

investigation controlled or curtailed or

stopped or hindered no were you or your

team providing any questions members of

Congress or the majority ahead of your

hearing today

no your report states that your

investigative team included 19 lawyers

and approximately 40 FBI agents and

analysts infer counter so those numbers

accurate could you repeat that please 40

FBI agents 19 lawyers intelligence

analysts and forensic accountants so

those numbers accurate this was a report

generally yes is it also true that you

issued over 220 800 subpoenas executed

nearly 500 search warrants obtained more

than 230 orders for communication

records and 50 pen registers that wait a

little fast for me

okay in your report I made this very

simple you did a lot of work correct

yeah a lot of subpoenas a lot of pen

register subpoenas okay we'll walk this

really slow but now search warrants

that's all right a lot of search

warrants a lot of things so you're very

thorough you want your opinion very

thorough you listed this out in your

report correct yes thank you

is it true the evidence gathered during

your investigation given the questions

that you've just answered is it true the

evidence gathered during your

investigation did not establish that the

president was involved in the underlying

crime related to Russian election

interference as stated in volume 1 page

7 we found

insufficient evidence of the president's

called culpability so that will be yes

without that be yes yes thank you

isn't it true the evidence did not

establish the president or those close

to him were involved in the charge

Russian computer hacking or active

measure conspiracies or that the

president otherwise that unlawful

relationships with any Russian official

volume 2 page 76 correct a report so a

yes

is that any true your investigation did

not establish that members of the Trump

campaign conspired are coordinated with

Russian government in the election

interference activity volume 1 page 2

volume 1 page 173 thank you yes yes

thank you

although your report states collusion is

not so specific offense and you said

that this morning or a term of art and

federal criminal law of conspiracy is in

the colloquial context are collusion and

conspiracy essentially synonymous terms

you're gonna have to repeat that for me

collusion is not a specific offense or a

term of art in the federal criminal law

conspiracy is yes in the colloquial

context known public context collusion

collusion and conspiracy or essentially

synonymous terms correct no if no on

page 180 of Volume one of your report

you wrote as defined in legal

dictionaries collusion is largely

synonymous with conspiracy as that crime

is set forth in the general federal

conspiracy statute 18 USC 371 you said

at your May 29th press conference and

here today you choose your words

carefully are you sitting here today

testifying something different than what

your report states asking is if you can

give me the citation I can look at the

citation and evaluate whether it is okay

let me just be clarified you say did

that you would say within the report I

just stated your report back to you and

you said that collusion collusion and

conspiracy were not synonymous terms

that was your answer was no in that page

180 of volume 1 of your report it says

as defined in legal dictionaries

collusion

largely synonymous with conspiracy as

that crime is set forth in general

conspiracy statute 18 USC 371 now you

said you chose your words carefully are

you contradicting your report right now

not when I read it so you change your

answer to yes then no language I'm

reading your report sir it's a yes or no

answer

h1 80 page 180 volume 1 this is from

your report correct and I leave it with

the report so the report says yes they

are synonymous hopefully for finally out

of your own report we can put to bed the

collusion and conspiracy one last

question is we're going through did you

ever look into other countries

investigated in the Russians

interference into our election what

other countries investigated or found

knowledge that they had embarrassed our

election I'm not going to discuss other

matters that a good morning director if

you'll let me quickly summarize your

opening statement this morning you said

in volume 1 on the issue of conspiracy

the special counsel determined that the

investigation did not establish that

members of the Trump campaign conspired

or coordinated with the Russian

government its election interference

activities and then in volume 2 for

reasons that you explained the special

counsel did not make a determination on

whether there was an obstruction of

justice crime committed by the president

is that fair yes sir all right now in

explaining that Special Counsel did not

make what you called a traditional

prosecution or declination decision the

report on the bottom of page two of

volume 2 reads as follows the evidence

we obtained about the president's

actions and intent presents difficult

issues that prevent us from conclusively

determining that no criminal conduct

occurred accordingly while this report

does not conclude that the president

committed a crime it also does not

exonerate him now I read that correctly

yes all right now your report and today

you said at all times

the special counsel team operated under

was guided by and followed Justice

Department policies and principles so

which DOJ policy or principle sets forth

a legal standard that an investigated

person is not exonerated if their

innocence from criminal conduct is not

conclusively determined

can you repeat the last part of that

question yeah which DOJ policy or

principle set forth a legal standard

that an investigated person is not

exonerated if their innocence from

critical criminal conduct is not

conclusively determined where does that

language come from director where is the

DOJ policy that says that can you let me

make it easier go ahead

can you give me an example other than

Donald Trump where the Justice

Department determined that an

investigated person was not exonerated

because their innocence was not

conclusively determined I cannot but

this is unique okay well you can't

time is short I've got five minutes

let's just leave it it you can't find it

because I'll tell you why it doesn't

exist the special counsels job nowhere

does it say that you were to

conclusively determine Donald Trump's

innocence or that the special counsel

report should determine whether or not

to exonerate them it's not in any of the

documents it's not in your appointment

order it's not in the special counsel

regulations it's not in the OLC opinions

it's not in the justice manual and it's

not in the principles of federal

prosecution no where do those words

appear together because respectfully

respectfully director it was not the

special counsels job to conclusively

determine Donald Trump's innocence or to

exonerate him because the bedrock

principle of our justice system is a

presumption of innocence it exists for

everyone everyone is entitled to it

including sitting presidents and because

there is a presumption of innocence

prosecutors never ever need to

conclusively determine it now director

the special counsel applied this

inverted burden of proof that I can't

find and you said doesn't exist anywhere

in the department policies and you used

it to write a report and the very first

line of your report the very first line

of your report says and you as you read

this morning it authorizes the special

counsel to provide the Attorney General

with a confidential report explaining

the prosecution or declination decisions

reached by the special counsel that's

the very first word of your report right

that's correct

here's the problem director the special

counsel didn't do that

on volume one you did on volume 2 with

respect to potential obstruction of

justice the special counsel made neither

a prosecution decision or a declination

decision you made no decision you told

us this morning and in your report that

you made no determination so

respectfully director you didn't follow

the special counsel regulations it

clearly says write a confidential report

about decisions reached nowhere in here

does it say write a report about

decisions that weren't reached you wrote

a hundred and eighty pages a hundred and

eighty pages about decisions that

weren't reached about potential crimes

that weren't charged or decided and

respectfully respectfully by doing that

you managed to violate every principle

and the most sacred of traditions about

prosecutors not offering extra

prosecutorial analysis about potential

crimes that aren't charged so Americans

need to know this as they listen to the

Democrats and socialists on the other

side of the aisle as they do dramatic

readings from this report that volume

two of this report was not authorized

under the law to be written it was

written to a legal standard that does

not exist at the Justice Department and

it was written in violation of every DOJ

principle about extra prosecutorial

commentary I agree with the chairman

this morning when he said Donald Trump

is not above the law he's not but he

damn sure shouldn't be below the law

which is where volume two of this report

puts him now your report spends 14 pages

discussing the June 9th 2016 Trump Tower

meeting it would be fair to say would it

not that you spent significant resources

investigating that meeting I refer you

to the report okay and President Trump

wasn't at the meeting no thank you now

in stark contrast to the actions of the

Trump campaign we know that the Clinton

campaign did pay using GPS to gather

dirt on the Trump campaign from persons

associated with foreign governments but

your report doesn't mention a

about fusion GPS in it and you didn't

investigate fusion GPS as connections to

rustier so let me just ask you this can

you see that from neglecting to mention

glen simpson in fusion gps is

involvement with the clinton campaign to

focusing on a brief meeting at the trump

tower that produced nothing to ignoring

the Clinton campaigns own ties to fusion

GPS why some view your report is a

pretty one-sided attack on the president

all right and I would just note finally

that I guess it is by chance by

coincidence that the things left out of

the report tended to be favorable to the

president mr. Muller well first let me

ask unanimous consent mr. chairman to

submit this article robert mower

unmasked for the record without

objection

now mr. Muller who wrote the nine-minute

comments you read at your May 29th press

conference okay so that's what I thought

you didn't write it

a 2013 puff piece in The Washington Tony

in about Comey said basically when Comey

called you drop everything you were

doing it gave examples you having dinner

with your wife and daughter Comey calls

you drop everything and go

if the article quoted Comey is saying if

a train were coming down the track and I

quote at least Bob Moore will be

standing on the tracks with me yeah you

and James Comey have been good friends

or good friends for eight for many years

correct we were business associates we

both started off in the Justice

Department about you were good friends

you can work together and not be friends

but you were home we were friends we

were friends that's my question thank

you for getting to the answer

now before you were appointed as special

counsel had you talked to James Comey in

the preceding six months no when you

were appointed as special counsel was

president Trump's firing

Komi something you anticipated

investigating potentially obstruction to

just get into that

that's a internal deliberation to the

Justice Department actually it goes to

your credibility and maybe you've been

away from the courtroom for a while

credibility is always relevant it's

always material and that goes for you

too goes for you too
