Manitoba premier Brian Pallister sat

down with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

to lay out some concrete proposals to

strengthen national unity and so my my

advice would be let's get on with it

let's build the country and let's heal

some of these divisions that have been

created or pallister's plan first build

a national energy corridor that would

move clean hydro from Manitoba and

Quebec revisit a confusing and costly

environmental review process brought in

by the Liberals during the last

Parliament but one that was condemned in

the West knocked down interprovincial

trade barriers and finally convene a

first ministers summit on health care

yeah and don't don't use the divide and

conquer techniques in the past that's

just gonna make things worse

but while Pallister is trying to build

bridges to pull the federation together

Alberta premier Jason Kenney is pulling

his province away well we will be

consulting with Albertans on a whole

range of ideas about how we can get a

fair deal in the Federation I mentioned

that we make a net contribution in the

past five years of about twenty three

billion dollars per year more than we

send to Ottawa and then we get back in

services and benefits one idea Kenny is

floating pool Alberta out of the Canada

Pension Plan and set up its own Alberta

pension plan next door in Saskatchewan

premier Scott Mao is in a similarly foul

mood complaining about Western

alienation Pallister says he understands

their frustration their citizens are

failing at head-on you're talking about

a really significant job loss but

pallister's empathy with his Western

neighbors combined with a friendly

Manitoba approach to Ottawa is a signal

that he might be ready to be the bridge

between the federal government and some

angry premiers I think it's not

unreasonable to say that

Manitoba's played that role from what

our history that we were the Keystone

province after all so we join we join

east and west

now other premiers too want one-on-one

meetings with Trudeau but no word yet on

who will be next we do know though that

the Premier's are going to meet in

Toronto on December the second by

themselves without Trudeau and by then

those premiers will know who the key

players are in Trudeau's cabinet and

they hope there

have some sense of how Trudeau plans to

bring east and west together

Donna all right David akin in Ottawa

thank you
