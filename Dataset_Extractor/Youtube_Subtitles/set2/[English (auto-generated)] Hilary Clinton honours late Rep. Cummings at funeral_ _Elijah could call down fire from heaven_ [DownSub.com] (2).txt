this is the day the Lord has made let us

[Applause]

because this is the day for the

homegoing celebration of a great man a

moral leader and a friend to Bishop

Walter Scott Thomas and first lady of

the church Patricia Thomas and the new

psalmist Baptist Church thank you for

welcoming us all here to reflect on the

life and celebrate the service of Elijah

Cummings and to the Cummings family to

his political family the constituents

from the Maryland congressional 7th

district thank you for sharing him with

our country and the world and

[Applause]

[Music]

Thank You Maya as you have said so

beautifully you walked by Elijah's side

on this journey

thank you for your steadfastness your

resilience and your leadership

it is no coincidence is it that Elijah

Cummings shared a name with an Old

Testament prophet whose name and in

Hebrew the Lord is my god and who used

the power and the wisdom that God gave

him to uphold the moral law that all

people are subject to and because of all

people are equal

like the Prophet our Elijah could call

down fire from heaven

but he also prayed and worked for

healing he weathered storms and

earthquakes but never lost his faith

like that Old Testament prophet he stood

against corrupt leadership of King Ahab

and Queen Jezebel

and he looked out for the vulnerable

among us he lifted up the next

generation of leaders he even worked a

few miracles and he kept reminding us

life is no dress rehearsal the American

people want to live their lives without

fear of their leaders and as leaders we

have a responsibility to keep the

promises made when running for office to

make the lives of Americans better as

Elijah said while we're all on this

earth that's my message

our Elijah was a fierce champion for

truth justice and kindness in every part

of his life

[Applause]

his integrity and character his can-do

spirit made him a guiding light in the

Congress he pushed back against the

abuse of power he was unwavering in his

defense of our democracy he had little

tolerance for those who put party ahead

of country or partisanship above truth

[Applause]

but he could find common ground with

anyone willing to seek it with him and

he liked to remind all of us that you

can't get so caught up in who you are

fighting that you forget what you are

fighting for even his political

adversaries recognized that it wasn't

really about politics for our Elijah he

led from his soul he often said that our

children are a message to a future we

will never see I saw that firsthand when

I attended an event for the Elijah

Cummings youth program in Israel

a leadership program for young people in

his district and Elijah didn't just put

his name on the program and then forget

about it he interviewed every applicant

he was personally invested in their

success he wanted all of us to see our

young people as he memorably asked us to

do when he gave the eulogy at the

funeral for Freddie gray did you see him

by the time these young people came back

from Israel to Baltimore

they had celebrated Shabbat studied

Hebrew hiked up Masada they had seen and

been seen and made lifelong friends all

because Elijah Cummings knew from his

own experiences that it's one thing to

learn abstractly about the world but

another to experience it with people

different from yourself learning from

each other lifting each other up

you know Elijah often said his

philosophy was simple do something go

out and do something no matter how

daunting a problem seems no matter how

helpless you feel surely there is

something you can do I think that

remains his challenge to each of us as

he said even if it seems small there's

usually something you can do if you are

looking for it you can defend the truth

you can defend democracy you can lift up

others and toward the end of his life he

said I am begging the American people to

pay attention to what is going on

because if you want to have a democracy

intact for your children and your

children's children and generations yet

unborn

we have got to

this moment this is our watch our Elijah

knew because he was a man of faith and a

man of the church that life was fleeting

and precious and that's why he worked so

hard to make every moment of his life

count when we're dancing with the Angels

the question will be asked he said in

2019 what did we do to make sure we kept

our democracy intact

[Applause]

[Music]

I will end with the paraphrase of a poem

that Elijah recited in his very first

speech in the Congress he said that he

told himself this poem as many as 20

times a day I only have a minute 60

seconds in it forced upon me I did not

choose it but I know that I must use it

give a count if I abuse it suffer if I

lose it only a tiny little minute but

eternity is in it thank you

Elijah Cummings for your work your

service and the lessons you leave us god

bless you

[Applause]
