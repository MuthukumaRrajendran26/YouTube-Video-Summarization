James Glasgow good afternoon thank

everybody for coming today with me sir

Mike Kelly is what County State's

Attorney James Glasgow will County

Coroner Pat O'Neill on September 12 2009

teen at approximately 3:30 p.m. that

will County coroner's office has

received a phone call from an attorney

representing the family of dr. Ullrich

Klopfer who passed away on September 3rd

2019 the family attorney informed the

coroner's office that while the family

was going through the doctor's personal

property cleaning out the residence they

discovered what appeared to be fetal

remains and requested the assistance of

the will cottage coroner's office to

properly remove them - what County

coroner's office contacted both the Will

County Sheriff's Office and the Wolfe

County State's Attorney's Office

regarding the information conveyed by

the family's attorney

well County Sheriff detectives

crime-scene investigators and a will

County deputy coroner arrived at the

Klopfer residence located in

unincorporated Creek Township and met

with representatives of The Clapper

family and the family's attorney

personnel on scene were directed to an

area of the property in the attached

garage of the home where 2246 medically

preserved fetal remains were located

over 70 cardboard boxes of various sizes

contain these remains the remains

discovered were inside I'm sorry the

remains discovered were inside a small

sealed plastic bags was contained

formalin a chemical used to preserve

biological material the boxes that

contained the fetal remains were mixed

among other boxes containing personal

property of dr. Klopfer crime-scene

investigators with the vil County

Sheriff's Office documented a scene and

the remains were subsequently removed

from the property by the will conduct

coroner's office personnel with the Will

County Sheriff's Office searched the

entire property and found no evidence of

medical procedures occurring on the

property nor where

any other fetal remains discovered

during a search of the property dr.

Klapper performed abortions and three

clinics in the state of any art at three

clinics in the state of Indiana the

containers of fetal remains are dated

from 2000 to 2002 which coincides with

the period of time he maintained the

clinics in Indiana the cloud for family

has been cooperative cooperating fully

throughout this investigation and

there's still work that needs to be done

in this case the LA County Sheriff's

Office the Wolfe County coroner's office

and the Wolfe County State's Attorney's

Office have been in contact with

additional agencies both in and out of

the state of Illinois in regards to this

investigation all involved is excuse me

all involved agencies are still in the

early stages of attempting to bring this

case to a resolution we collectively

collectively asked that the media and

the public not pass judgment on the

kapre family who made the startling

discovery and who have been cooperating

fully throughout this entire process

that will conclude the port that port

this portion of the press conference

will now allow any questions we are

working with the Indiana attorney

general's office and arrangements are

being made to transfer the fetal remains

to their custody obviously he had three

clinics in Indiana and I think it

involves two different counties they'll

be County prosecutors and the Indiana

Attorney General I know the Indiana

legislature has weighed in on this also

and somebody told me that vice president

Pence is it's called them about this so

well again there's requirements for

record-keeping and that's one of the

issues that the Attorney General in

Indiana is initially addressing because

obviously these records were not handled

properly back at that time but as far as

you know other aspects of this is still

an open investigation we've concluded

what we can do here in Illinois the

sheriff's office and the coroner

panelled Neal have done a fantastic job

in handling this very delicate situation

and they did a yeoman's job in in you

know inventory all the information and

that again will be transferred to

Indiana in the very near future again

because it coincides with the time that

he would have been doing the abortions

in Indiana most of the evidence of

anything that occurred is there and we

will remain in contact with them and

that they you know he had mentioned

during one of his testimonies that he

had done an abortion on a ten-year-old

girl this is public information in

Illinois

and the uncle had raped the child and

they did the abortion and the parents

took her home and no one reported it no

we have no further information about

that other than that but I certainly

would like to learn more about that

again they they they did not know they

did not know but once they discovered it

they called coroner O'Neill and the

sheriff again there are privileged

aspects to this case that that borrows

from talking about that again again

there are privileged aspects that would

prevent us from talking about that again

we can't comment on their fetal remains

and I can't discuss the gestation of

them again as one after we make the

transfer to Indiana the Indiana Attorney

General is going to ask the public if

they want to inquire of their agency if

they're aware of anything that happened

during that time period that would

affect them then they would be able to

contact the Attorney General

where the remains are today I'm sorry

again that's that's privileged

information again this is still an open

investigation we will be cooperating

with Indian authorities the next step of

this would be you can make inquiries of

their agency as to what they feel they

can release or not release but with

regards to that privileged aspect of

this to break that privilege the

individual whose information is being

protected has to reach out and say they

want to waive it so again we we have no

evidence to indicate any criminal

activity at that house other than

potentially the existence of the

evidence that we found

[Music]

yes well Mike Mike if you want to say

it's nor are we held the house for a

couple days and then and then we

searched it we took about 50 about 50 of

our detectives and our personnel to go

through this residence because it's a

very very large residence and there were

hundreds and hundreds of boxes that we

had to go through to make sure there

were no more of these remains in that

residence so I could tell you that 31

years that I've been doing this job I've

never seen anything like this ever it is

it is a strange you know it's one of

those once-in-a-lifetime things it

doesn't sound it doesn't appear as if he

was trying to it's hard for us to

speculate on that simply because it was

from 17 to 19 years ago on what you know

and without being able to talk to him

obvious

because he's he's deceased it's kind of

tough for us to even speculate what his

motivation was to bring him there or not

you know that I would imagine that the

attorneys the Attorney General of

Indiana will probably do some more that

investigating ask and you know because

he had three clinics and obviously he

had other employees that worked in those

clinics so they got a lot I don't we

haven't looked into what it would cost

honestly Scott to determine to remove

all medical weights because that wasn't

our focus at that time right our focus

was to try to clear that house and make

sure that you know we didn't leave any

box unopened so to speak so I couldn't I

couldn't answer that question no we

didn't find any other type of medical

yes for me it you know we just imagine

your garage and you walk in and you're

you're storing whatever car parts

bottles of motor oil whatever you can

pass that's what the garage looked like

basically sealing the to floor almost

well yeah of course yeah so that's why

it was hard like I said it's it was just

like anybody else's garage well we're

hoping that soon we'll be turning them

over to the Indiana Attorney General

well there's still there's still a will

County again we as we've said it Cohen's

Sutton the fetal remains that we have

the dates coincide with when he was

operating his three clinics in Indiana

he was not operating any clinics in

Lowell County or in Illinois that we're

aware of we found no evidence on the

property than any of the abortions were

form their the fetal remains will be

transferred as I said to the Illinois

attorney general's office India I'm

sorry the Indiana attorney general's

office and they will take custody of

those and they will be preserving them

for evidentiary purposes at this point

and then you left inquiry

we're not commenting on what what

records we have or we don't have but

yeah but again we know that the time

period but I can't tell you how we know

that time period the condition that we

found the the it's clear that they're

older he's deceased

so not I'm sorry but and again you know

he he failed to follow Indiana law as to

the disposal of the fetal remains that

under their law he failed to file the

proper paperwork under their law those

are the two things they're gonna be

looking at initially obviously there's

he has facilities there that are still

there so that that will be part of the

continuing investigation and then as I

said there is a privilege that attaches

to these fetal remains and you're all

aware of the HIPAA laws correct and so

we're we're restrained from telling you

any detailed information about that

however if a victim comes forward and

wants to inquire of their own

information they can waive that

privilege well I use the word victim in

general terms but if someone who did

have an abortion performed upon them

they could come forward and contact the

Indiana attorney general's office and

they've made that offer that can be done

well you know I don't want to speculate

certainly because of the age that we're

talking here there's statutes of

limitations that apply also and they're

different in Indiana than they are here

so that's all got to be looked at and

sorted out

the only crime potentially that could

come of this is if we had a 13 year old

child who had an abortion of the person

that impregnated that that child would

be guilty of statutory rape potentially

so but that's you know again because of

the age of these remains I don't know

that that will be possible under Indiana

law or not but that's part of the

further inquiry that it's going to be

had Indiana I believe I don't want

specular well it's been gradually

modified to the point where I don't

believe we have any statute of

limitations now but these that wouldn't

apply to these old issues again we have

no we have no evidence we have we've

concluded our investigation and find

that we need to know make no further

criminal inquiry here and that's why the

people would to be in the best position

to do that will be Indiana and we will

remain available as I mentioned if they

get information about the ten-year-old

girl and it's within the statute of

limitations certainly we would be

available for the most part yes so we

very rarely ever get calls or exercise

jurisdiction over these types of cases

as a sheriff indicated and the state's

attorney indicated probably one of the

most unusual cases and our careers we

have over over 60 years of experience

here at the podium when when I

receive the telephone call obviously it

was quite surprising to say the least we

did however as a result of information

that's been released about this

particular case received various

telephone calls from individuals

cemetery associations the Catholic

Church offering free burials for for the

fetal remains now in the event that

Illinois were to hang on to or exercise

jurisdiction over this particular case

we probably would have used one of those

avenues but as the state's attorney

indicated it appears as though the

Indiana Attorney General is going to

exercise jurisdiction so the final

disposition will be up to up to their

Department all's I can say at this point

is appear as though as dr. Klapper died

of natural causes in Illinois we very

rarely well we never exercise

jurisdiction as far as the coroner or

medical examiner's offices are concerned

so whatever form a disposition neither

the hospital or the clinic provides is

up to them

and I'm not exactly sure what that

answers we haven't heard anything from

you in the general's office as of just

yet we know what they were doing some

stuff today but they have a cop these

remains sort of haphazardly thrown into

these boxes or were they sort

I mean can you give us a little bit

better sense of what what you found

there was individual packaging on every

single one what are the chances he could

have packaged well again we don't know

how many employees he had we don't know

you know how he operated his clinics so

there's no way that we could answer that

you're not what I said we've concluded

that there's nothing more in Illinois

that we can that's why are we gonna work

with hand in hand with the Indiana

attorney general's office probably the

Indiana State Police the to prosecutors

two or three prosecutors in the counties

there that are going to be looking into

this and if they need our assistance in

any way we'll be available if they

uncover anything that occurred in

Illinois and it's in our County we will

handle it if it's not in our County will

work with the prosecutor in the county

that that it is applicable to so a

representative from the Indiana attorney

general's office has been here the last

two days working with our whole

Detective Division

so we're I mean yeah I said that in Will

County pretty much we've but we're still

investigating because we're assisting

the Indiana attorney general's office in

any police agencies they may get

involved on their end so we're still

working it but there were no no

procedures at all done on their remains

they can be determined the DNA was there

enough material again we can't comment

on that based on the privilege aspect as

I said if if the individuals contact the

Indiana Attorney General then that that

can be followed up on

again that would be up to them and have

that be up to the Indiana Attorney

General but they've indicated they're

looking for people to call their office

your confirmation of the years where

these samples came from is that more

paperwork driven were more medically

scientifically examined okay we it's

both well yes again the examination of

what we found the totality of what we

found corroborates the 2000 to 2002 well

again if mr. clapper did something wrong

it's irrelevant at this point because he

can't be prosecuted what we're looking

for is to find out work with the Indiana

authorities to find out if there's more

and then also work with them if victims

come forward that want to participate in

the criminal justice system and and some

of them look even though the clinics are

in Indiana some of these people could

have lived in Illinois at the time and

so we have a connection so but obviously

if if the crime is committed in Indiana

they would be the appropriate

prosecuting authority but we probably

could assist them so we remain open to

that

yeah again I'm we can't talk about that

specific thank you very much thank you
