the Washington Syrian TV showed what it

said were Turkish military strikes hours

after the u.s. abandoned its closest

ally in the fight against Isis

withdrawing troops from northern Syria

leading local Kurdish fighters on their

own against the Turkish military

operation I'm not siding with anybody

we've been in Syria for many years you

know Syria was supposed to be a short

term hit just a very short term hit and

we were supposed to be in and out that

was many many years ago there are fears

of a slaughter turkey considers the

Kurdish fighters to be terrorists

Kurdish forces feel they've been stabbed

in the back by the US after years

working with the Americans fighting the

so-called Islamic state today the Kurds

are holding thousands of Isis fighters

many of them foreign in their custody

it's terrible and it's it's gonna have a

ripple effect throughout our entire

global structure of alliances this

summer Trump said he convinced Turkish

president air tawan to stay out of Syria

they were lined up to go out and wipe

out the people that we just defeated the

Isis Caliphate with and I said you can't

do that you can't do it late Sunday

after a phone call between Trump and air

Dewan things changed and Trump gave in

to Turkey's demands we were a buffer and

we were preventing the worst from

happening sometimes International

Affairs avoiding a catastrophe is a

success and that's where we were at this

moment in Syria and now it's likely

heading in the wrong direction

members of trumps own party blasted the

president for abandoning a key ally the

Kurds nobody else would to fight Isis if

we abandoned them good luck getting

anybody to help America in the future

will radical Islam sensing the blowback

Trump seemed to walk back his own policy

pronouncement tweeting if Turkey does

anything that I in my great and

unmatched wisdom consider to be

off-limits I will totally destroy and

obliterate the economy of Turkey they

could suffer the wrath of a extremely

decimated economy but it's hard to tell

if that threat carries any weight after

Trump seemingly gave Turkey permission

to take what it wants and after turkey

seems to have moved so quickly in
