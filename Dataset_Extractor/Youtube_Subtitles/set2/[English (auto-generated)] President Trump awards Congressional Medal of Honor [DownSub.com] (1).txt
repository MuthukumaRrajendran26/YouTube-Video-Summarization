Matt Williams grew up in the small town

of Boerne Texas very small town he met

Kate for the first time in elementary

school and college he planned to pursue

a career in law enforcement but after

9/11 Matt decided his place was on the

front lines of the war on terror he

wanted to be the best of the best he

worked so hard at it so after graduation

he enlisted in the army to become a

green beret Matt finished his Special

Forces training in August 2007 and

deployed to Afghanistan by October when

April 6 to 2008 he joined dozens of

American special forces and Afghan

commandos on a mission to take down a

terrorist leader in a remote mountain

village sounded simple not simple on

that cold spring morning the soldiers

arrived in helicopters and jumped 10

feet from their Chinooks into the rocky

and freezing terrain of shock valley

when the first Americans reached the

edge of the valley at the base of a

100-foot Mountain a handful of Special

Forces scouted ahead the lead group was

60 feet up the slope when roughly 200

insurgents savagely attacked and it was

a big surprise very unwelcome surprise I

might add the terrorists fill the valley

with a hail of bullets and explosions

Matt soon received word that the

soldiers on the mountain were pinned

down and suffering from mounting

casualties he organized the Afghan

infantry under his command and he led a

bold counter assault to stop the enemy

advance as machine gun fire rained down

from above madness fellow American

soldiers Scott Ford and Ronald Shara

charged up the mountain once they reach

their trapped comrades Matt realized

that said

all of them were to gravely wounded to

be quickly evacuated he ran down the

mountain to get support and then climbed

to back up with bullets spraying all

around not a good place to be again and

again Matt exchanged fire with the enemy

and rescued his fellow soldiers they

guided his injured team sergeant Scott

Ford down the mountain to safety when

Matt noticed two combatants moving

toward a group of the badly wounded he

immediately engaged the enemy fighters

and killed them both but Matt was not

done yet in order to rejoin the battle

on the mountain he and sergeant Seth

Howard scaled a sheer cliff completely

exposed to attack Matt quickly reengaged

the adversary and shielded the injured

from falling rubble as American

warplanes bombed insurgent positions

above and rocked the mountain from top

to bottom he then helped evacuate the

wounded down a very very steep cliff as

the terrorists continue to try to

overrun their position Matt raced back

into battle he fought for several more

hours valiantly protecting the wounded

and putting his own life in great peril

to save his comrades Matt's incredible

heroism helped ensure that not a single

American soldier died in the Battle of

shock valley his ground commander later

wrote I've never seen a troop so poised

focused and capable during a fight and

Matt is without question and without

reservation one of the bravest soldiers

and people I've ever met but Matt wants

all Americans to know that he was not

alone in his heroism that day joining us

really held a high ground superior

numbers and element of surprise had it

all going everything they're not

one major disadvantage they were facing

the toughest strongest and best trained

soldiers anywhere in the world we showed

that a few days ago these guys didn't
