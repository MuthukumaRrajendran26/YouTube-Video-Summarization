we don't often tell you stories about a

flight arriving safely but today in

Dallas Texas Southwest flight 12:20 was

not only on time it was half a century

in the making our Jackson prosecco was

enroute to Washington DC when he

witnessed an extraordinary moment it

started with an announcement over the PA

that silenced travelers and what

unfolded was so powerful we had to share

it with you

here's Jackson's account from gate 12

about honor sacrifice and the eternal

bond between a father and son this was

not just another arrival at Dallas Love

Field this was a homecoming 52 years in

the making I was inside the airport

waiting for my flight to Washington and

you're about to find out why we were all

gathered around the airport windows

taking pictures in silent awe as the

plane pulled up to a water cannon salute

we were told about the special passenger

who was coming home to Dallas Colonel

Roy Knight jr. an American airman who

was shot down in 1967 over Laos during

the Vietnam War missing in action ever

since

colonel nights remains were only

recently found and identified and

returned to American soil

today the colonel finished the long trip

home to Dallas now that alone makes the

story remarkable but here's where it

becomes incredible it was at this exact

airport 52 years ago that Colonel Knight

said farewell to his family including a

young son who would grow up to be a

pilot just like his dad so on this day

captain Brian Knight of Southwest

Airlines was the pilot of the plane that

brought his father home I had accepted

that that I would never see that you

know I would never see his you know

during my lifetime that he wouldn't come

home

captain night was just a five-year-old

boy when he saw his father off to war he

would have waved farewell at this

airport he probably would not have fully

understood where his father was going

means a whole lot to us that he's

finally coming back to to his country

and to his family 52 years later father

and son were reunited on that same

tarmac the rest of us were privileged

enough to watch it happen
