I was fired for being gay six words that

have sparked a fierce battle one that

could change the lives of LGBTQ 2 people

across the United States 3

discrimination cases are awaiting a

decision from the US Supreme Court to

involved men fired for being gay while

one is due to a transgender woman's

firing lawyers for all three argue their

civil rights were not protected at the

federal level there are no explicit

protections that specifically say sexual

orientation or gender identity in 1964

president lyndon b johnson signed the

historic Civil Rights Act into law

making it illegal to discriminate based

on a number of factors including race or

sex the question facing the courts now

can sexual orientation be decoupled from

sex a lot is at stake because what is

essentially arguing it's whether people

can be all of themselves all of the time

in their workplaces in the United States

roughly 11 million people identify as

LGBTQ - or roughly 4 and a half percent

of the population 21 states plus the

District of Columbia Puerto Rico and

Guam have legislation that bans

discrimination against them compare that

to Canada where all 13 provinces and

territories protect everyone equally in

Canada we have gender identity gender

expression explicit in our human rights

act and in our criminal code it's

vitally important for the protections of

everybody in our society but civil

liberties groups fear us rhetoric could

find its way north of the border many of

the attitudes that are exist in the u.s.

are crossing over into Canada and we're

seeing a shift in terms of acceptance a

decision isn't likely until mid 2020

meaning it could play into the upcoming

US elections no matter when it happens

focus will be on a right of center

justice Brett Kavanaugh has no judicial

record on gay rights and only asked one

question during hearings leaving him as

a possible swing vote if the majority of

the Supreme Court decides that LGBTQ two

members are not guaranteed workplace

protections millions could become more

vulnerable to discrimination

the phobia is wrong plain and simple

simply for being who they are and loving

who they love
