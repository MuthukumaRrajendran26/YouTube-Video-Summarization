this is Norway where electric vehicles

or EVs are everywhere in the first six

months of 2019 more than half of new

cars sold in the country were fully

electric tax incentives driving in bus

lanes and free parking are some of the

factors that helped and it has a goal of

scrapping all sales of fossil fueled

vehicles by 2025 but this isn't a global

trend Canadians are buying electric more

than ever before but they still only

make up 3.2 percent of the vehicles sold

in the u.s. fume free cars make up 1.9

percent of the new passenger vehicle

market and on a larger scale make up

less than 0.5 percent of the global

vehicle fleet so why is it taking so

long to make the switch especially given

that these type of vehicles go way back

like way back to the 1800s when the

first successful electric vehicle in the

US made its debut compared to gas and

steam powered cars they were easy to

drive and didn't emit smelly pollutants

by the turn of the century they

accounted for a third of all vehicles on

the road but somewhere along the ride

they hit a bump as roads got better and

cheaper oil was discovered electric cars

just couldn't gain traction even when

gas prices began to soar

[Music]

they also weren't exactly the most

sharp-looking car on the road and when

GM pulled the plug on its own sleek

futuristic eb1

it didn't seem like electric cars would

ever win the race at least not until a

certain Silicon Valley startup known as

Tesla came along with its zero emission

luxury cars and then in 2015 with its

relatively affordable model 3 which had

people lining up to put down a deposit

on a car they hadn't even seen yet it's

been a game-changer they have succeeded

in convincing everyone that battery

electric vehicles can have high

performance you know they can be sexy

everybody wants them that you

it's really been a complete shift in the

perception and life use and the model 3

is very successful despite the setbacks

they've had they've it's the number one

selling Evie in the world this this year

so far today it's difficult to even find

a Tesla owner who isn't incredibly

passionate about their ride

I had heard previous owners say that

there was no question and that they were

completely sold on the technology and

that registered but it only really

became clear to me once I got behind the

car and I drove it and the technology

far exceeded my expectation but Tesla's

still belong to the higher-end evie

owners which brings us back to why

consumers are still so hesitant to give

up gas there's still a lot of knowledge

gaps people don't realize they're gonna

save money which is a key factor they

don't know that it's convenient they

don't know the why it's environmentally

beneficial

that's Carrick Lehrman she spends a lot

of her time busting evey myths and can

often be found at the world's first

electric vehicle Discovery Center she

says the initial concern consumers have

is the price the challenge is people

look at that upfront sticker price

instead of looking at what we call the

total cost of ownership most TVs fall in

the 30,000 to $45,000 range but many

countries offer financial incentives to

help bring the cost down and then of

course the savings made on the fuel

costs electricity is about one-fifth the

cost of gas here in Ontario so for

example if you're spending on average

about twenty five hundred dollars a year

on gas fuel I'm spending about five

hundred dollars a year on electricity

for my vehicle less maintenance as well

no oil changes no transmission no

muffler which some argue is why some car

dealerships are reluctant to sell EVs in

the first place their business model

depends on the revenue from from the

regular maintenance that was gasoline

cars the dealerships are not doing a

great job of promoting them they're not

necessarily the the highest profit

margin product so they don't have a

strong incentive at this time but the

dealerships we spoke to point out that

customers usually do their homework and

know

kind of car they want even before they

walk through the door we still see a lot

of dealerships that aren't carrying them

I think you have to keep in mind that

the first couple of years that v's came

out there were only two or three makes

and models available in very few

dealerships but we know that's going to

change over the next three to five years

another main issue drivers have about

EVs is range anxiety in terms of

charging times and locations that

depends on the type of car you have the

type of charger and where you're going

most Eevee drivers plug in their car at

home and charge overnight but for those

long distance drives level three

chargers are slowly popping up along

highways around the world Canada has

close to 7,000 public charging stations

but according to a 2017 study by go

compare it still ranks among the worst

equipped countries for v's I mean from

where I said I think it's happening as

fast as could be expected just because

of the all the technology shifts that

have to happen the infrastructure the

training a lot of retooling of factories

and so on I mean it's not something that

happens overnight so how do these cars

actually run Wow you can't even tell no

a lot of people ask is it on ooh that

goes really fast really fast yeah I'm

already at 50 and I'm not even

yeah yeah yeah you don't feel guilty

because you're not burning any dad while

the car itself leaves a far smaller

carbon footprint Manufacturing most EVs

including the high powered batteries

actually produce a bigger carbon

footprint than manufacturing most gas

cars but many experts believe all roads

do lead to EVs

eventually it's estimated that by the

mid to late 2020s electric cars will

cost the same as internal combustion

competitors and eventually even cheaper

as the price of batteries go down that

combined with a number of Engineers

automakers and policy makers putting a

new focus on evey development 2040 is

when you can expect to see more of these

cars on the road by then 57% of all

passenger vehicle sales and over 30% of

the global passenger vehicle fleet will

likely be electric why do you like the

Tesla
