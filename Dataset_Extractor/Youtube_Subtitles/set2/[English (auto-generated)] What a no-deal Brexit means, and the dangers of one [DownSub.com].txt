Dover is one of the busiest ferry ports

in the world thousands of trucks roll

through here every day feeding clothing

and supplying Britain in most cases no

customs checks are needed so when an

Odile brexit this is where the rubber

hits the road

the British government was forced to

release its secret report detailing its

worst case scenario for an Odile brexit

in it it said at ports like this

crooks could be waiting more than two

days just to get through customs checks

and this old airfield 30 kilometers away

has been tested as a potential holding

location for thousands of trucks waiting

to leave the UK according to the report

these log jams could lead to shortages

of some fresh foods something major

supermarkets have already said could

happen but more concerning

there could be shortages of some

medicines 3/4 of all medical drugs in

the UK are shipped across the English

Channel and not all can be stockpiled

this doctor helped advise the government

on its No Deal plans some patients will

die some patients will be at risk of not

getting on the drug so you know if we

and that really troubles me as a doctor

other issues in the report include

gasoline shortages rising food prices

disruptions in international police data

sharing and protests draining police

resources and no deal could also mean

instant defaults tariffs after brexit

something that could affect Canadian

businesses trading with Britain and the

fate of the UK's only land border

remains up in the air - the UK will

never ever institute checks at the

border the government report contradicts

the prime minister saying an open border

between Northern Ireland and Ireland

would be unsustainable it's feared an

e-check said that frontier may reignite

tensions there after two decades of

relative peace is all of this scare

mongering we could find out after
