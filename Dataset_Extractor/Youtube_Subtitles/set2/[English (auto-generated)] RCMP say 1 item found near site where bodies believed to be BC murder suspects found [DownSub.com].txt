police say another item was discovered

in a secluded area along the Nelson

River close to where two bodies were

found on Wednesday six RCMP

search-and-rescue members could be seen

on a boat heading towards the site with

metal detectors and other investigative

equipment any trace or items belonging

to the two BC murder suspects can help

answer some crucial questions that

remain in this case after several hours

police then returned to where schmegle

ski and McLeod's torched rav4 was

spotted but didn't find anything they're

determining a motive may be tough you

know you want to be able to link people

to certain property can we link someone

to a crime can we find their trail you

know these people make movies that they

make leave notes something information

might come from somewheres from some

sorts they may have talked to someone

prior to them leaving like you say

there's still a lot of people we

probably need to speak to a lot of

pieces to put together that's when you

put it all up together so wait a minute

this this could be an idea

police believe the autopsies have been

completed and BC RCMP should have the

results next week though it's not clear

if the RCMP will make those autopsy

results public Joe Scarpelli Global News
