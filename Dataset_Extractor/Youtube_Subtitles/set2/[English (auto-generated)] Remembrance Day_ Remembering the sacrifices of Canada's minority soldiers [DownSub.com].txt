there is plenty of evidence of

immigrants and racialized Canadians

serving this country with honor and

distinction take Philip Kanawa born in

Ukraine he was awarded the Victoria

Cross during the first world war at a

time when ukrainian canadians were

considered enemy aliens and were forced

into internment camps Misumi matsui was

born in japan

he served Canada with distinction and

along with other Japanese Canadians in

the First World War then in 1942 he and

more than 22,000 others were also

declared enemy aliens and sent to

internment camps there are plenty of

others to Jeff's simple looks at how

many have sacrificed no matter their

background or skin color while Canadians

gathered to remember those who fought

for the country

George Chow came to honor his friends I

think my buddies got cut kill or in

France the ninety eight year old from

Victoria was a gunner in the Second

World War

part of an all-canadian crew that shot

down the first German plane on British

soil he also fought on d-day was one of

the first to get behind enemy lines

under heavy fire and later he helped to

liberate Holland from German occupation

Chou was just 18 when he signed up to

fight discrimination Chau carries

another distinction one of around six

hundred Chinese Canadians who

volunteered to fight some of his friends

tried but were refused at a time when

they weren't even allowed to become

citizens we will remember them but for

many years that contribution from ethnic

communities to the Canadian war effort

was forgotten they really didn't feel

like Canadian heroes they're welcoming

them home lindsay Rux family only

recently discovered that her great-uncle

was a member of the so-called black

battalion in the first world war

hundreds of black canadian volunteers

who fought to be allowed to fight

william nielsen halt the son of black

American slaves was one of the first

Canadians to be awarded the Victoria

Cross because I know this museum exhibit

honors the contribution from punjabi

troops

during the first world war it is

something that we in Canada are not

really exposed to either in the

classroom or within our heritage 74,000

South Asians were killed fighting

alongside Canadians in battles that

included Vimy Ridge and Passchendaele

they swept the story of the the Punjabi

contribution they swept it under the

carpet because it didn't suit the

politics of the time today around 10

percent of serving Canadian Armed Forces

personnel are from visible minority

communities young men and women

following in formidable footsteps Jeff
