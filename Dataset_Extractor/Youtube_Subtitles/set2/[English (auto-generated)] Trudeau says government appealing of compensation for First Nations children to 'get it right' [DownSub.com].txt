thank you giving me this opportunity to

make things extremely clear we agree

with the tribunals finding that there

must be compensation for those who were

harmed this is a principle that this

government has exist and fulfilled many

times in the past but it was on the

sixties scoop whether it was on forced

relocations or day schools or Inuit TV

we need to compensate those who've been

harmed but the question is how to do

that we need to have conversations with

partners need conversations with

communities with leaders to make sure

we're getting that compensation right

those are conversations that we cannot

have during a writ period government

can't be having those discussions

because we're in a Rick Perry

therefore we need time to be able to do

that and get it right because Canadians

expect us to get it right and indigenous

peoples expressed expect us to get it

right

the number one recommendation from the

truth of reconciliation committee

commission excuse me it hits to the core

of that number one to call to action and

you are seeing to be taking kids to

court instead of compensating them we we

agree that we need to compensate them we

absolutely agreed there needs to be

compensation the question on how to do

it requires conversations with partners

with communities with experts asking for

judicial review the decision by the

Human Rights Tribunal came down mere

days before the actual the actual Rick

got dropped and the Canadian Human

Rights Tribunal expects us to bring in a

plan of action by December that is

simply not practical not possible given

the electoral context we are in that is

why we need to have more time to be able

to have these conversations by you

beyond acceptable worth his words you

want to have conversations you by the

AFN now saying that we need to get this

compensation right we need to do this

the right way and Canadians know that

that is not something that Ottawa

decides it's something that we've

decided in partnership whether it was

the 60s scoop

whether it was the the forced agree

locations whether it was the day schools

whether it was the TV apology and

compensation

these are things that need to be done in

a respectful way with communities and in

an electoral period we simply do not

have time to do it we recognize the harm

that has been done and we fully accept

the need for compensation but Canadians

expect us to get it right

and indigenous peoples expect us to get

it right and that's exactly what
