America is stronger than ever before and

energy workers the United States is now

you know you have some of the greatest

energy and energy workers anywhere in

the world anywhere in the world the

United States is now the number one

producer of oil and natural gas anywhere

on planet Earth and we are supporting

law enforcement and we are supporting

our police

we're rebuilding our military and you

know where all this beautiful new

equipment has made the Rockets the Jets

the ships everything is made in America

don't we love and we're defeating

radical Islamic terrorists and you saw

last week the monstrous animal known as

al-baghdadi is dead

[Applause]

you know if somebody else did that

they'd be talking about it for months me

I got about a day out of it from these

people that's okay that's okay

that's okay look at how many there are

there you have a lot of people they have

a lot of people you know it is true I'll

say who the greatest hero was forget

about Trump I'm not it was we did a lot

of good work together everything the dog

was the great hero :

Conan he's coming to the White House

very soon I said bring him now there's a

series on a mission I said you got to be

kidding come on give a couple of days

rest please

but now Conan is coming to the Oval

Office very shortly so that's good but

our message to these bloodthirsty

savages is clear you don't stand a

chance against the righteous might of

the United States military

[Applause]

because America is winning again and

America is respected again but while we

are delivering safety and prosperity for

Americans the radical left Democrats are

trying to rip our nation apart

they want to eradicate the rule of law

punish religious believers silence you

online indoctrinate your children and

they're after your second amendment

don't ever forget it they're after your

second

and with the Republicans I can tell you

one thing nobody's going to hurt your

Second Amendment

nobody in their campaign to transform

America Democrats are becoming ly

increasingly totalitarian suppressing

dissent defaming the innocent

eliminating due process staging show

trials and trying to overthrow American

democracy

to impose their socialist agenda

make no mistake if the Democrats get

back in you will have a depression the

likes of which you've never seen before

and you are doing well how are you 401

k's doing by the way you wouldn't feel

it all angry if they went down in half

and then in another year half of that

that's what's going to happen first it

was the russia hoax then it was Muller

remember Muller with that hoax the

biggest lie ever foisted upon the

American people okay but everybody stuck

with us if anything would became more

popular maybe more popular I mean last

week Hillary Clinton crooked Hillary as

we affectionately call

so is there any place you would rather

be then at a trump rally on a beautiful

wonderful evening in Louisiana I don't

even know would you rather be at LSU

versus Alabama or a trump rally let's

take the truck route

[Applause]

but Democrats must be accountable for

their hoaxes and for their crimes

now corrupt politicians Nancy Pelosi and

shifty Adam Schiff

and the crooked media have launched the

deranged delusional destructive and

hyper partisan impeachment witch-hunt

now we go again except

a lot of things have happened because

you know I don't know if you saw it just

got off I'm coming off the plane and

they hand me look at this character okay

they just hand me the story ku has

started whistleblowers attorney said in

2017 you know when that was that was a

long time ago it's all a hoax

they say January 2017 a coup has started

and the impeachment will follow

ultimately Toula

it's all a hoax it's a scam and you know

who helps them these people right back

here the media

and then it said UPS the lights going to

go off the CNN light is going to go up

it said from the lawyer a sleazeball it

said I predict at CNN will play a key

role in at Weill Donald Trump not

finishing out his first tent can you

believe this this is all and this was

done a long time ago then he goes as one

Falls to more will take their place

referring to outgoing Trump

administration employees who by the way

have been put through hell by the

sleeves back there and by crooked

politicians

it just came out that's the

whistleblower you know the whistleblower

the one that came out with this oh the

Trump said this and Trump said that and

then when they heard my real phone call

the whistleblower disappeared shifty

shifty is a corrupt politician shift

didn't want to have the whistleblower

anymore because nobody thought I was

going to release the phone call but as

soon as I released the phone call and

you don't like doing that with a foreign

leader cuz you got to deal with foreign

leaders you don't want them to think

today I spoke to president Erdogan of

Turkey I don't know is he worried that

we're gonna release it all over the

world because somebody said something

that could have been a little bit wrong

you can't do that you can't do that now

in this case I had a perfect phonecall a

totally perfect phone call and and you

know anybody that can read you saw that

on Mark Levin but the whistleblower

before they knew I was going to release

he came out with a whistleblower you

know like he's some wonderful person

take a look at the whistleblower but the

whistleblower came out with this

horrible statement about this call so I

really had no choice I said immediately

talk about transparency I said release

it release it immediately and then the

whistleblower sort and shifty shift sort

is a total crook shift saw it

Pelosi saw it and they said we got a

problem we don't want to have anything

to do with the whistleblower anymore and

the whistleblower disappeared you know

who else disappeared the second

whistleblower and you know who else

disappeared the informer to the

whistleblower if there was such a person

which I doubt which I doubt

just came out just came out should

disgrace I'll tell you what it's so bad

these people are bad people and it's so

bad what they do to our country they

ripped the guts out of a country and

it's a shame and they shouldn't be

allowed to do it and people should stop

maybe go to the Supreme Court maybe but

they gotta stop it because we have a

country to run and these people in order

to do things are willing to do illegal

acts

- no legal act as far as I'm concerned

last week the Democrats voted to nullify

the ballots of tens of millions of

Americans disgracing themselves and

dishonouring their else now the good

news the Republicans were unanimous the

Republicans finally stood together they

stood together

[Applause]

because you know the Democrats are lousy

politicians lousy they have open borders

how do you like having an open border

with Mexico do you like

the Democrats want open borders they

want sanctuary cities you're not too big

into sanctuary cities with John bel

Edwards you will soon have a sanctuary

sitting in your mess

but the Democrats said think of it they

want open borders which means crime now

look at what's going on in Mexico and

I'll tell you what I have to thank the

Mexican government in one way 27,000

soldiers but they have other problems

these cartels are a tremendous problem

we're building and we are building that

wall that wall is going up and it's

going up there it's going our military

is now building the wall and it's going

up fast the Army Corps of Engineers and

it's going up and it's doing great it's

doing great she'd have been built years

ago that wall should have been built

many years ago never did they never

could figure it out but I figured it out

it wasn't easy I had a hundred percent

of the other party fighting me a hundred

percent you think that's easy and you

know we had a majority of a few people

very little very little we needed

Democrat votes but we had a hundred

percent of the people and I made one

mistake I should have said I don't want

the wall and the Democrats would have

absolutely existed that I built I

shoulda saw

you know five or six years ago they all

wanted the law it was only when I came

along and I said we got to build the

wall now you know you've wanted it but

you never had the vision or the talent

to get it built so we got to build it I

figured that all join and understad they

said no we don't want the wall anymore

they said no no we can have drone

technology course you got drones flying

all over the place that's great that's

great now we should have said we want to

never build a wall and they would have

insisted that it get built immediately

these are I call them now that do

nothing Democrats we have loopholes that

they could solve in 15 minutes we could

sit down loopholes catch-and-release

chain migration you know that's when you

come in and then everybody ever met in

the history of the world comes in with

you your mother your grandfather your

cousin your brother your aunt your uncle

any person that ever met you come on

into our country we had a man on the

West Side Highway I don't even call him

a man I call him an animal he ran over a

lot of people he turned right going up

very very fast speed we had this

beautiful Park in New York City and he

killed I think eight people they never

talked about the people that lost their

legs that lost their arms that are

permanently disfigured they never talked

about that they say eight people were

killed they don't talk about people

these are people that want to keep

themselves in shape and they're running

and they're running and they're all over

and then this maniac turns to the right

going at an unbelievable speed and he

kills people and he horribly injures

people and we can't let this happen we

can't let it happen

these unhinged extremists the Democrats

have been plotting to illegally overturn

the election that we want I didn't win

it we all want it together they came

from all over the place they came from

all over I mean you said isn't that

Republican and yet we're so far up but

I'll come to see you anyway even yeah

you could say you know focus on a couple

of the closer ones but we're gonna come

here anyway and because we do love it

but think of this 19 minutes after I

took the oath of office the horrible

disgusting Washington Post which is a

terrible paper it declared the campaign

this is 19 minutes I just think in the

office and an article comes out the

campaign to impeach President Trump has

begun oh that's nice thank you very much

see the reporter over

and then during the term sleepy Joe

Biden who's dumb as Iraq said you fire

the guy you get a billion dollars you

don't fire the guy you get nothing and

it's on tape

and the press refuses to print it you

talk quid pro quo

you fire the guy you got a billion you

don't fire you get enough they think of

that one okay that's called quid pro quo

not here that was said by Joe Biden to

get rid of the prosecutor in Ukraine who

is looking at his son who just got

thrown out of the Navy who was paid

millions and millions of dollars even

though he had absolutely no energy

experience in Louisiana in Louisiana you

wouldn't have hired him and your energy

companies they would have paid to keep

from the hell out okay

he had no

[Applause]

how old is your son how old is that

young man there how old are you how old

ya eight let me tell you he's eight he

knows energy better than Joe Biden son

[Applause]

then Biden flies to China he obviously

met with different people than i deal

with because we're doing well with china

but i'll tell you but he flies with his

father who was then vice president and

in ten minutes

he picks up 1.5 billion dollars for his

fund these are different Chinese people

that I've been working with excuse me I

called up one of the top guys on Wall

Street I said can you do that dope I've

been trying for years I can't do it he's

like the smartest guy on Wall Street now

the Democrats are covering up slow

sleepy Joe and they're trying to steal

your vote and silence your voice and I

don't even know cuz I'm looking at

Pocahontas she's thought can you imagine

no no Pocahontas is starting to emerge

from the ashes I thought she was gone we

hit her very hard six months ago I give

her credit she's emerging from the ashes

not a nice person

1024 Indian blood I have more than she

does and I have none I have none but I

have more than Shiva

[Applause]

I'd love to have some I just happened to

have none but I believe I have more than

she does

generations of American patriots

sacrificed everything they had to secure

this Republic and your sacred right to

vote we will not let the Democrats take

that incredible privilege away the

American people are fed up with Democrat

lies hoaxes smears slanders and scams

the Democrats shameful conduct has

created an angry majority and that's

what we are we're majority and we're

angry that we'll vote the do-nothing

Democrats out of office in 2020

especially we're going to take back the

house and we're gonna focus on like

those 36 Democrats in trip areas areas

that I won by a lot I didn't run in 2018

you know they keep forgetting I didn't

run I said go out a vote got a vote but

a lot of people said I'm not gonna vote

until Trump runs okay that's nice I love

those I love the people

but they see what we're doing but I

didn't run in 2018 but people forget we

picked up two seats in the Senate they

never want to talk about that we picked

up to see they never talked about it

I try to get him to talk about it and

because of that what we've done with

judges and different appointments but

with your help we are going to drain the

swamp and that's what we're doing

right now Louisiana can send the radical

left a message that they can never

ignore and don't forget in 2016 people

came from the mountains and the valleys

and the rivers and the oceans that came

from all of the Democrat said what the

hell is happening were these people

coming from

these were people that were great

Americans worked hard made a lot of

money much smarter you know they call

him the elite with the elite with the

elite I know this I know this speaking

for myself I went to better schools and

they did I went to I have nicer houses

and they do I have nicer apartments I

have nicer everything and their elite

but we're not it elite you people work

your asses off you're making a lot of

money you're smarter than that you're

smarter than they are and Tifa you ever

see an Tifa

you know that is that's the size of

their arm they come in with the black

calomel all got a big tough guys and

then they start hitting a single

reporter conservative reporter they

start battering them with it but when

the tough guys show up and Tifa says I

think we'll take a pass let's get out of

here now

you're smarter you're tougher you're

richer you got more going but a lot of

people that came out because they didn't

like what they were seeing they didn't

want to vote for the people that were

running for president he wanted vote for

Obama they didn't want to vote for the

people that were running for president

but when I ran something happened that

was amazing the lines were I'll tell you

what in some cases miles long and they

saw something they said what is going on

and you know what was going on probably

the greatest election in the history of

our country your election

I was just folks Minh I was a person

that was able to tell a message but I'm

representing you and now these people

illegally through corrupt people like

Adam Schiff that makes up what I said he

gets up in front of the United States

Congress and the American people and he

reads my statement but I didn't say it

he made it up and then we called him on

it because he never thought that I was

going to release the conversation

because you just don't do that but

Ukraine was great we called them up do

you mind if we released a conversation

no we don't why I said don't worry about

it just we're gonna release it Yuma

thank you very much and we released it

and we caught them in the middle of a

giant lie their scam their scammers

[Applause]

so you're gonna fire your liberal

Democrat governor I don't know how the

hell he ever got there how did it get

there this is Louisiana right this is

Lewis how did you get a liberal Democrat

to be your governor could you explain

that place now I actually know is a

convergence of a lot of different things

happened and congratulations and your

car insurance is the highest in the

world your taxes are horrible you're

rated number 50 in economic development

can you believe it with all that we're

doing you rated 50 out of 50 but we want

to send governor and I mean I know this

man for a long time he's an incredible

talent he's an incredible businessman he

doesn't need the money

he's a wonderful person he has the

backing of Ralph and I tell you what

Ralph is a winner you know Ralph

right he has the backing of Ralph I've

just spent a lot of time with Ralph

Abraham we came in together and Ralph

would have missed it and he's an

incredible man he's an incredible man

and he respects Eddie and Eddie respects

him a lot they had a hard-fought deal

but they respect each other and like

each other a lot and that's rare because

I'll tell you what if I'm going to get

somebody I don't know if I can ever like

I don't know but Ralph is a better man

than me it's a better man

[Applause]

and they're gonna put that all over

television tonight because they're gonna

say Ralph should run for president if

that's the case and that's okay

now he is he's a great man so any

respond he is not a career politician

he's a business leader highly highly

respected a man of faith and a lifelong

Louisiana patriot and many of you know

it he through his success and he will

cut your taxes and regulations he will

cut your car insurance in half

we have the highest car insurance in the

entire nation by far some people call it

auto insurance call or whatever the heck

you want you have the highest in the

country

he's going to cut it in half or more and

turn this state into a giant magnet for

great paying jobs that's what he wants

to do

[Applause]

Eddie is tough-on-crime strong on

borders and he'll work with ice and

Border Patrol to get violent criminals

off the streets we'll bring them back to

their country ideally or we'll put them

in jail where they belong

Eddie is pro energy pro-family pro-life

and pro and meant totally and he will

defend your values from the all-out

assault by the extreme left that's what

they are there to the extreme left

I call them AOC plus 3a Oh see that's a

real beauty you only have 11 years to

live folks 11 years because climate

change is just coming up on her sofa you

know it was 12 years but today I heard

one of these crazies say it's down to 11

and they arrest the Jane Fonda nothing

changes I remember 3040 years ago a

terrorist he always has the handcuffs on

oh man

she's waving to everybody with the

handcuffs I can't believe it they

remember that she went to Vietnam to

find out how nice they were they weren't

too nice to her by the way now they

arrested her today Jane Fonda nothing

changes to arrest every every 25 years

they arrest her

Eddie's opponent is a radical liberal

and you didn't know that track even says

good things about me but he'll never

vote for me you know why he says good

things about me because he thinks you

like me if he didn't otherwise said say

bad but here's the thing he'll say good

things in fact I said he must be a

Republican he sometimes says better

about me the most Republicans but here's

the problem

he'll never vote for us he'll never

support our Second Amendment the way we

need the support he's never going to

reduce your car insurance he's never

going to cut your taxes he's had a long

time he wasn't able to do it I got you a

big tax cut the biggest ever

I mean the Democrats they have this

crazy theory I don't know how it works I

don't think I could be a successful

Democrat you know one of their theories

we're gonna raise your taxes how does

that work I'm always saying we're gonna

get you a bigger we are we're gonna cut

your Texas book they're saying look what

do I know I've only been doing this for

three years but they say we're gonna

raise your taxes and I'm saying excuse

me does that work

that's what they say now I'm gonna cut

your taxes even further and you see what

it's done for our planet but you have a

radical liberal named John bel Edwards

Edward was an ardent supporter of

crooked Hillary Clinton and she is

crooked as hell John bel Edwards broke

his solemn promise to the people of

Louisiana when he rammed that's the only

word I could say rammed through the

largest tax hike in Louisiana history

does everybody remember though he gave

you the largest tax hike and then he

probably says I raise your taxes vote

for me no I'm saying this I lowered your

taxes I gave you the greatest tax

reduction in the history of our country

greater even than Ronald Reagan's

reduction many years

[Applause]

now maybe that doesn't work in modern

day politics but you know what I'm gonna

stick with it okay whether it does or

not I'm sick and you see what's happened

billions and billions and trillions of

dollars is coming back into the country

with a hottest economic force anywhere

in the world anywhere in the world and

taking in more with a lower rate we're

taking in much more money than we did

with a higher rate that's a pretty good

statement he violated your sacred trust

and can never be trusted again he raised

you taxes and he's done nothing about

your car insurance you know one of the

big things here's car insurance right

and I kept saying what are the things

because I want to pinpoint it and I kept

seeing car insurance that's very unusual

I've never heard that with the state

I've never thought of car insurance

right but here your car insurance is the

highest in the in the nation and it's

out of control and it's so easy to do

now Edwards is trying to demolish your

state's economy by shutting down

Louisiana energy on behalf of the crazy

radical far left

Edwards is totally owned by the liberal

trial lawyers who are causing his states

insurance rates and car insurance to

skyrocket through the roof perhaps most

disturbing Edwards has allowed illegal

aliens to steal millions of dollars in

health care from hardworking Louisiana

citizens he cares more about illegal

aliens than he cares about Louisiana

citizens I'll tell what I love our

military Eddie loves our military they

care more about illegal aliens than

taking care of our vets and taking care

of our military Edwards is dangerously

soft on crime you know that and

Louisiana has the highest murder rate I

hate to say this please turn off those

television cameras immediately I don't

want to say it but you have the highest

murder rate anywhere in the United

States I didn't know that I didn't want

to say it okay I'm sure they turned it

off because they're really listening to

them Edwards is backed by his fellow

open border extremists and pro-abortion

lobby Edwards is a complete disaster for

the state of Louisiana and you cannot

afford four more years of this far-left

travesty it is time to replace your

failed Governor John bel Edwards with

any risk phony who's going to do an

incredible job

[Applause]

so everybody needs to get out and vote

so tickled to be here with the president

that he actually came down to our

community and let's go Eddie thank you

fellas

two great guys they were with me right

at the beginning I said who are they

they said they're too big television

stars I said wow and then I started

watching a little bit a lot of wisdom

their Republican policies are lifting up

Americans from every background and

every walk of life America is an

economic powerhouse

again like never before actually like

never before we eliminated a record

number of job-killing regulations saving

an estimated $3,000 per household we

also passed the largest package of tax

cuts and reforms in American history

saving a typical family of four another

$2,000 and we're boldly adopting a

policy of American energy independence

we don't have to go to these faraway

places anymore

I was at the opening of the

$10,000,000,000 Cameron LNG export

facility in hackberry Louisiana

employing thousands and thousands of

Louisiana workers they couldn't get

their permits for years

I got him real fast feet I said how long

I said let's go get them that permit for

years and years they tried to get those

permits they couldn't get him I got him

very fast and we cut a rip in a couple

of months ago it was incredible I've

never seen a building like that one the

more pipes in that building than I've

ever seen before

meanwhile every top Democrat running for

president has pledged to abolish all

American production of oil and natural

gas shipping thousands of your state's

energy jobs overseas that's all they're

doing but Louisiana will not give them

that chance we are reversing decades of

disastrous trade policies Louisiana lost

one in four manufacturing jobs after the

twin disasters of NAFTA and China's

entrance into the World Trade

Organization past leaders did not care

one bit what happened to those Louisiana

communities because they were getting

rich by sacrificing your wealth to other

countries you remember we're talk about

it all the time but under this

administration the great betrayal is

over America is no longer for sale

thanks to my tariffs were taking in

billions and billions of dollars from a

country that never gave us ten cents

China can you imagine if we ever let the

radical Democrats take over negotiations

with China wouldn't be too good

let's get hunter to do it right let's

get on come on Arthur come on hunter

let's see how you do hunter China would

love it more than anything else they'd

love to be dealing with a different

president they actually do like me but

they don't like me what I'm doing

exactly to them they're having the worst

year they've had in 57 years but it's

not going to happen that way because we

can't let our country go back to the

days of being ransacked and plundered by

other nations we will not be taken

advantage of any longer before my

election our leaders used the great

American middle class as a piggy bank to

fund their delusional global projects

they decimated American Factory you know

this American manufacturing was broken

and decimated to promote they promoted

economic growth in foreign countries

they didn't promote economic growth in

our country they used our military to

defend immensely wealthy nations

subsidizing their welfare states with

your money and they poured precious

American blood and treasure into the

Middle East while our great cities fell

into disrepair eight trillion dollars

was spent in the Middle East and you

want to fix a highway they say well

that's pretty expensive right not

anymore but I was elected to be the

president of the United States not the

President of the world

[Applause]

after years of rebuilding other nations

we are finally rebuilding our nation and

we are finally putting America first

haven't heard that for a long time past

leaders transform faraway nations into

chaotic war zones then they demanded

that American citizens accept unlimited

migration from those terror afflicted

regions stamping their visas for travel

straight into your communities not

anymore

my administration implemented the travel

ban to block migration from some of the

world's most dangerous and deadly places

and we're keeping terrorists criminals

and violent extremists the hell out of

our country that's what we're doing or

no issue have Democrats more totally

betrayed you than immigration they threw

open and you saw it all through the

years they threw up in your borders to

drug dealers human traffickers and to

vicious ms-13 gang members and now we're

getting them out of the country by the

thousands

thanks to our tireless efforts to secure

our southern border illegal crossings

have now dropped 70% since May and when

you look at what's happening over there

there's a good reason for what we're

doing we are building that wall faster

than anyone thought it was possible to

build the Army Corps of Engineers

we're also confronting the deadly menace

of sanctuary cities which release

dangerous criminal aliens into your

neighborhoods school zones and city

streets Republicans believe our cities

should be sanctuaries for law-abiding

Americans not criminal aliens and

Republicans will always stand with the

heroes of Ice Border Patrol and law

enforcement in the last administration

vile slanders of our police went

unanswered and unchallenged now we are

once again condemning anti police bias

and giving our officers the respect that

say that they so rightly deserve

if you want to show your love and

support for American law enforcement and

just plain success of your state in your

country then vote early for any respond

II

Democrats are becoming more extreme by

the day the Democrats plan government

takeover of health care would demolish

your Medicare I will always protect

Medicare for our nation's seniors we

will always protect patients with

pre-existing conditions and we will also

protect patients with pre-existing

physicians Democrats want to take away

our doctors Republicans will strongly

defend your right to keep your doctor

you remember that with President Obama

you keep your doctor you keep your plan

28 times it was a lie our ambitious

campaign to reduce the price of

prescription drugs has produced the

largest decline in drug prices in over

50 years virtually every top Democrat

also now supports late term abortion

ripping baby straight from the mother's

womb right up until the vote right up

until the moment of birth that is why I

have asked Congress to prohibit extreme

late term abortion because Republicans

believe that every child is a sacred

gift from God

[Applause]

Democrats are now the party of high

taxes high crime open borders late term

abortion socialism and blatant

corruption the Republican Party is the

party of the American worker the

American family and the American Dream

it's also the party of the late great

Abraham Lincoln people together we have

confirmed already 158 incredible judges

to interpret the Constitution as written

including two great Supreme Court

justices Neel Gorsuch and Brett

Kavanaugh

[Applause]

our historic investment in rebuilding

the military has included more than 30

million dollars to bark scale do you

know where that is do you know where

that is

Barksdale where's Barksdale nice oh good

Barksdale Air Force Base right here in

Louisiana and forty million dollars to

naval Naval Air Station joint Reserve

Base in New Orleans I withdrew from the

horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal

I recognized Israel's true capital and

opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem

and we recognized Israeli sovereignty

over the Golan Heights after 52 years

four years you watched as your

politicians apologize for America now

you have a president who is standing up

for America and we are standing up for

the people of Louisiana

[Applause]

the next step to victory begins in this

state and it begins with you right now

with your support we will show the

corrupt Democrats and they are corrupt

do-nothing Democrats that the American

people are not backing down we need you

to get your friends get your family get

your neighbors and get out to vote early

for Eddie and if you don't vote early

I'll be back on Thursday to get you to

vote on Saturday ok with your help we

will lift millions more of our citizens

from welfare to work dependence through

Independence and poverty to prosperity

together we will elect a Republican

Congress we're going to be able to do

that we have to be able to do that to

create a fair safe sane and lawful

system of immigration and many other

things we will enact trade deals that

result in more products proudly stamped

with that beautiful phrase made in the

USA

[Applause]

we will achieve new breakthroughs in

science and medicine finding new cures

for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS

epidemic in America did you know that

within ten years I never knew we could

do it until recently and we put up the

money we'll have the AIDS epidemic ended

who would have thought we could have

done that we will chart a new era of

discovery in space and someday very soon

we will land an American astronaut on

the surface of Mars we will defend

privacy free speech free assembly

religious liberty and the right to keep

and bear arms above all we will never

stop fighting for the sacred values that

bind us together as one America we
