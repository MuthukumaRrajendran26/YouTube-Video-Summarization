and risk assessment generalist online

those who are dialing in as most of

previous days it's a star nine and you

will be putting line for questions those

watching online through Zoo you click

raise hand on the right hand side of you

of your screen and you will be able to

ask questions we will have an audio file

and transcript as always I hope you buy

now you know where to find those

reference I'll give you the floor to dr.

Petrus thank you thank you Tarek and let

me begin as always with the latest

numbers as of 6 a.m.

Geneva time this morning China has

reported seventy four thousand six

hundred seventy five cases of Kogut

nineteen to whu-oh including 2121 does

the data from China continue to show a

decline in new confirmed cases once

again we are encouraged by the strength

but this is no time for complacency

outside China there are no 1076

cases in 26 countries with a total of

seven deaths in the past 24 hours the

Islamic Republic of Iran has reported

five cases two of which have

this is the first report from Iran of

all cases outside China more than half

are among passengers on the dam and

Princess cruise ship the first

passengers have no disembarked providing

they have a negative test no symptoms

and no contact with a confirmed case in

the past 14 days the Japan has also

advised passengers to stay at home for a

further 14 days and monitor their

temperature and also Japan has set up a

hotline for passengers to call if they

have concerns Japan is in regular

contact with other countries through a

mechanism set up under the international

health regulations so those countries

can follow up with their nationals who

were passengers on the ship in addition

to monitoring the evolution of the

outbreak WHS main role is to work with

countries and partners to coordinate the

global response we're doing that in

several ways both internally and

externally as you know whu-oh led

international team of experts is now on

the ground in China working with their

Chinese counterparts to find answers to

some of the things we don't know

including the transmissibility of the

virus and the impact of the measures

that China has taken the team has been

brought together through the global

outbreak alert and response network and

includes experts in epidemiology biology

clinical management outbreak control and

public health from the following

institutions the National University of

Singapore the st. Petersburg Pasteur

Institute the National Institute of

infectious disease Japan the co national

umber

the College of Medicine Korea the

Nigerian Centre for Disease Control the

u.s. Center for business prevention and

control the US National Institute of

Health the Russian National Medical

Research Center office Paul fitzy

promote ology and infectious disease and

the Robert Koch Institute of Germany let

me describe some of the many other ways

WH er is coordinating the response as

you know global coordination is key in

fighting a dangerous enemy like this

corona virus we have convened the W

Health Security Council a daily meeting

of myself

our chief emergency doctor Mike Ryan the

regional directors and other senior

staff to review the evolution of the

outbreak and coordinate the response

yesterday we held the first of what will

be weekly briefings with diplomatic

missions here in Geneva to keep our

member states informed and we're holding

this daily news briefings to keep the

media informed yesterday we couldn't

have the press conference because we had

dedicated it to a briefing to the member

states I also hold weekly call with a

range of independent experts from around

the world representing all regions very

senior experts as a compliment to the

advice provided by the emergency

committee and two weeks ago i briefed

the UN secretary-general antonio

guterres and we all need to activate the

united nations crisis management team

led by dr. Mike Ryan today we're holding

a second call with un country

representatives to brief them on the

measures they can take at country level

ordinary the UN response because what

matters is the intervention or the

actions we take the country level and

that's why we we involve all of you and

Resident coordinators and WH

representatives at country level twice a

week we have a call with clinical

experts were treating patients with

Habeeb 19 including frontline workers in

China to share information about the

progression of disease and what works

and what doesn't in treatment we have

also set up an online platform where

clinicians can share anima an anonymizer

patient data so we can build a clearer

picture of the disease what we've seen

in that the earlier patients are tested

and treated the better they do we're

also looking forward to results from two

clinical trials of therapeutics

prioritized by the wor and the research

and development blueprint one combines

two drugs for HIV low P Nabeel and

little Nabil and the other is testing

antiviral called REM see where Ramsay

beer we expect proven results in three

weeks on this therapeutics drugs my

colleague my colleague John dance is

here to answer questions about the

clinical management of patients because

even if people are infected having a

better outcome saving their lives is is

really key and that's what we are also

investing on the therapeutics and

patient management

and I have written to 12 exact chief

executive man of manufacturers of

personal protective equipment to seek

their cooperation to ensure supply to

protect health workers and there is a

good signal positive signal from the

manufacturers this is as I always say

time for solidarity governments private

sector civil society and the whole world

should stand in unison today we had a

call with faith-based organizations of

another way of reaching communities with

messages to prevent infection we're

partnering with Africa CDC to coordinate

our efforts to prepare African countries

for the potential arrival of the virus

that's where we believe in Africa and

other continents where we have weaker

health systems and the virus could be a

serious danger and that's why we are

focusing continents and countries where

the health system is weaker you will get

sick of me saying that the window of

opportunity remains open for us to

contain this outbreak double a choice

doing everything we can to seize that

the window of opportunity and we urge

the international community to do the

same and as I said before let's not

squander the window of opportunity we

have the number of cases in the rest of

the world is very small compared to what

we have in China but that may not stay

the same for long the window of

opportunity we have now made closed so

we need to use the window of opportunity

we have now by hammering the outbreak in

any country thank you so much

thank you so much rather to Tetris

before we start taking questions to

remind those dialing in to press Start 9

to ask a question those who are joining

through the zoom online to take race

hand that we will start with the the

questions here in a room please anyway

[Music]

maybe on the cute people

would you like to say about the the

travel restriction as you know we are

monitoring the travel restriction

through a several channel the first one

is what is reported in media and we

verify it with remember States and the

HR the Member States report to ask the

travel measures that are taken and we

also look at the justification and come

back to them and we are also in contact

with Aikau ayat I providing us with the

information and with this all this

information overall as W Thunder HR to

verify anything information with the

countries and to report so far 330

country 3-0 countries reported to us

officially that they are taking some

kind of travel measures and we asked

them for justification and we publish

the defecation through the HR network to

all state party to take note of them and

to also have look to certification this

information is available and in this

context we are dealing with with any

information you have including the one

that you spoke about there was another

question about recovered thank you and I

actually don't have the exact number of

the discharged patients and looking at

Oliver to see if do you have that exact

number don't get back get back but I

could say we do know patients are being

discharged from the information we have

the largest study from the Chinese CDC

published that's about 80 81 percent had

mild disease we know that about 15

percent have been reported to have

severe disease and that largest cohort

and about 5% critically ill so we do

know that the patients are being

discharged and including those patients

outside of China as well being

discharged in good condition

and then thank you yes thank you very

much for the question there the number

of cases in South Korea reports today

are actually from several distinct

clusters which the Korean authorities

are following very closely so though the

number it seems quite high they are

mostly linked to known existing

outbreaks so that hasn't changed and it

doesn't signal a particular change in

the global epidemiology but it does

signal that the Korean authorities are

following up very closely very

vigorously on all the new cases and

those outbreaks that they've identified

and maybe adding to that the total

number of cases Korea has so far

reported is 104 and Korea reported 22

cases today

and with measures they can take which is

proportional to the public health risk

they have I think the number of cases

are really manageable and I hope South

Korea will do everything to contain this

outbreak but you know at this early

stage thank you for those following us

either through phone or watching us do

we have someone from Africa thank you

thank you for that question

so at this moment in time there is no

proven effective treatment for a Cove in

19 and Sui so that is clear at this

moment in time however there are ongoing

clinical trials being done in China at

this moment as well the two that we were

already discussed with the Partha are

testing the priority therapeutics that

was prioritized by the W R&D blueprints

and that includes lope innovator and

ritonavir as well as REM dis severe now

for chloroquine Isis they there is no

proof that that is that that is an

effective treatment at this time you

know we recommend that that therapeutics

be tested under you know ethically

approved clinical trials to show

efficacy and safety thank you

here the actions were understanding the

Japanese authority is to prevent or to

contain the outbreak on the ship first

because they were heavily detecting

cases and taking the positive cases to

the bailer to be treated in adequate

hospitals their objective is to contain

it within the ship not to prevent

introduction in the mainland I don't

know if it is your a question this is

why they were heavily following the

contact proceeding with analysis and

chicken symptoms to detect any case and

win the case is positive they were

taking me to the hospitals to be

properly treated

the main objective or their operation at

least from our understanding is to

contain the disease or the virus within

in within the ship

so then you follow the next steps they

are taking as I have suggested as I have

indicated earlier their objective is to

minimize the experts pointed out if not

take appropriate

to speak about the debt the debt

anyway the I think as I said the main

objective was to contain the disease and

they were practicing drastic measures of

infection prevention and control and

also isolation of the cases to avoid

close contact and to avoid the

opportunity of the transmission and now

they went to the second phase where they

are now allowing people who were small

to three criteria the first one is

having no symptoms the second one is

having a PCR or test laboratory test

negative and third that this person was

not in contact with the positive cases

for the last 14 days they were not

allowed to go and to to be self to self

isolated at home and to continue

follow-up in interpreting this is what

they are doing now only people who have

died we have the report that there - and

more than 80 years old

and with some underlying disease

conditions and considering the number of

cases which is more than 600 and

elsewhere so far the observation is

there is a fatality of 2% and this is

what we would really expect which is

very unfortunate though so having deaths

in you know from the number of people

who have been in in the ship considering

the fatality rate I think has to be

understood that wind over

the underlying conditions of the people

who were positive to

yes president chun qiang from china's

into television CCTV question photos

potatoes so from the early release the

background of the experts of the

international exporting to China and

have the communicative
