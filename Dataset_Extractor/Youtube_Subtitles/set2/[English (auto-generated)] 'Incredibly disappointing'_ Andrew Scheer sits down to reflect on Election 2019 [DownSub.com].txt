hello I'm Mercedes Stevenson and this is

the West block politics perspectives and

players Justin Trudeau has won a

minority government and conservative

leader Andrew Shearer is vowing to stay

on and fight him but what will he be

fighting for and will his party give

Andrew Shearer another shot in the next

election i sat down with the

Conservative leader late last week for a

post-election post mortem

here's that conversation Mr Shearer

thank you for joining us thanks very

much for having me the last time we sat

down and talked we were out on the west

coast you just released your platform it

was ten days out from the election and

you told us quote I'm actually very

pleased by our campaign you didn't win

what happened well we're going to find

out obviously we had higher expectations

we are I am disappointed in the results

I expected to do better there are some

reasons for optimism some some

improvements that we can point to to say

that there's some important steps have

been taken but we're going to conduct a

thorough review of the campaign all

aspects of it and and find out exactly

where it is we need to do better you ran

against Justin Trudeau a man who you

branded as a liar and as a hypocrite a

man who had a lot of unforced errors and

self-inflicted mistakes why do you think

you couldn't convince voters to cast

their ballot for you instead of her him

well it was always going to be a

difficult task to take a first-term

majority government

and win the next election and you'll

remember in 2015 all the analysts and

pundits were talking about how mr.

Trudeau would win at least two majority

governments and they were already

writing off 20 1981 2023 so there's some

reasons to be encouraged by the results

we got more votes more seats were the

only National Party to have have done

that and and we look at the fact that

Justin Trudeau has returned with the

weakest mandate in Cayden history as

reasons for encouragement and we

obviously have to do better and we're

going to take the time to review the

campaign all aspects of it and make sure

that we we address those things and

build on the the positives going forward

but you didn't get the seats where you

needed them you swept Alberta you swept

Saskatchewan but you struggled around

the GTA and the 905 the bloc took a lot

of the seats that you'd hope to get in

Quebec why do you think that your

message didn't resonate in those key

areas that you can't win a federal

election without I think you're right to

point to the the rise of the bloc and

the fact that Alberta and Saskatchewan

completely rejected the liberal message

as something to be very concerned about

we have a more divided country we have a

mr. Trudeau we'll have to find a way to

find some common ground to undo some of

that damage in terms of our own campaign

this is going to be exactly what we look

at we had a message of making life more

affordable of lowering taxes getting

back to balanced budgets over a

responsible period of time we are

encouraged by the fact that in Ontario

we close the gap in many seats it's not

good enough we wanted to do obviously

much better so we're gonna take the time

and say you know was it a it was a the

fact that our message didn't get out did

we not punch through all the noise that

was going on through the campaign was it

the the way we we presented the policies

was it some of the strategic decisions

that were made along the way we're gonna

look at everything we're gonna look at

all that and find out exactly what

prevented us from closing the deal we we

point out that the Liberals lost a

significant number of votes so the fact

that we were able to convince many many

Canadians that mr. Trudeau's policy had

failed candidates was one part of the

equation then I

part was convincing them to give us a

mandate to replace that's the part that

was missing that's the part they were

going to focus on do you think that was

a mistake not to campaign with Doug Ford

because he won a lot of the writings

that you lost and the Liberals talk as I

mentioned during the campaign premier

Ford made a decision to stay focused on

provincial politics and he has a lot of

work to do to clean up the Liberal mess

mess there and I can tell you that you

know we had great support from members

of our counterparts in the provincial

legislature at the end of the day we

have to take a look and see you know

what was part of the what was the aspect

of our campaign that didn't connect with

voters and that's exactly what we're

going to be looking at as we conduct

this a very thorough review but senior

members at the Ford team say that they

they weren't consulted that you didn't

engage them and you can love or hate

Ford nation but they know how to

mobilize votes and as a result you

didn't benefit they didn't benefit from

that ground game well as I can point out

too we had a lot of support from our

provincial counterparts and a lot of

people who had worked on both federal

and provincial campaigns who had helped

out provincially on the ground helping

helping us out

luck we there are a lot of areas that we

need to do better at and a lot of

regions that we need to better we were

very encouraged with the results in

Alberta Saskatchewan BC we made two

significant gains we have a foothold in

Atlantic Canada we were hoping for more

there so there's we have to find out

what that what was preventing us from

gaining more seats there but the fact of

the matter is we got hundreds of

thousands of more more votes this time

we did make gains in Ontario not enough

but there are some reasons to be

optimistic to to look at this as the

first step towards replacing the

Liberals in the next election there are

people in the party and in your own

caucus who say that you're interpreting

this is positive and that worries them

because they want to make sure that

you're aware that it didn't go well it

didn't go as well as they think it

should've and they believe that this is

a personal rejection of you as a leader

in the 905 and they questioned whether

someone who cannot win the GTA and did

not win the 905 can stay on as the

leader what would you say to them well

look there's no doubt that we are

disappointed I am just

points in these in these results there

are reasons to be encouraged but that's

not that's not saying that we're

satisfied with the election results it's

normal for our party especially our

party to do we have a strong democratic

tradition to hold leaders accountable I

hold myself accountable my colleagues

will hold me accountable I hold our

campaign team accountable and it's

healthy in our party to have people

asking these very tough questions it is

to be expected we didn't win the most

seats anytime our party doesn't win the

most seats we ask the tough questions

why not

was it a question of platform policies

was a question of messaging was it you

know tactical decisions that were made

we're gonna be looking at all of that to

find out what we need to do better next

time the things we did well we need to

do more of the things we did poorly we

need to fix and and and that's exactly

what I'm focused on doing we've already

started the work of putting in place to

review I've been reaching out to

candidates and new members of parliament

to do exactly that

are you confident that you can hold

caucus when they come back that they

will support you I'm very optimistic

that look we've all worked incredibly

hard together and I've made it a focus

of my leadership to bring people in to

to to consult broadly within caucus and

and I believe that that you know

remembering what we were facing in 2015

or knowing that many many people

completely wrote off the 2019 election

and perhaps even the 2023 election I

believe that I will show caucus exactly

the measures that we're taking the

seriousness with which I am taking this

results with a with a roadmap forward

and and an understanding the gains that

we have made as a building block as a

first step towards the next campaign the

party scheduled to hold its convention

in Toronto in April are you still

planning for that to go out it's

absolutely going to go ahead it's this

is something that is part of our party's

democratic tradition that the leader is

held accountable by the members by a

National Council by by our caucus and by

the people who our grassroots

organization so that is

that is something that will absolutely

proceed so that includes the leadership

review your supportive of that it's

automatic it's it's it's in our party

Constitution and and I wouldn't want it

any other way

that's essential to a party to our party

really does belong to our members and I

appreciate that on new level during this

campaign because when you go out to a

riding and you see an event put together

by grassroots volunteers who have taken

a day off work or who have you know

passed out on a family event to to hold

an event to make it an immense success

what you really do appreciate what our

members pour into this party and so the

fact that big important decisions like

this are in their hands I wouldn't want

it any other way that's a that's what

makes it our party so great so it will

be in their hands it'll be up to them

ultimately and I'll be making you know

I'll be you know telling them the steps

I've been I will take going forward and

and and a good you know acknowledging

the fact that we didn't win but also

providing a roadmap for the future have

you talked to mr. Harper since election

day yeah you know I I have and I've

reached out to many different

conservatives I don't go into you know

who all who I haven't haven't been

speaking with my priority is to talk to

candidates and and members who who ran

last campaigns I really do want to hear

from them and to congratulate people on

a job well done and also I'm you know to

talk to people who didn't win and find

out their thoughts their initial

thoughts and why that happened what

advice did mr. Harper I won't go to a

private conversation but like I'm taking

this very seriously

we had great people running for us in

every part of this country and many of

them were not elected and that's

disappointing to me and I want to make

sure that going forward we give we we

have a stronger campaign that that

connects with with voters all across the

country who made significant gains in

British Columbia you know swept Alberta

and Saskatchewan got some some seats

back in Atlantic Canada won some in

Winnipeg as well so there's added to our

seat total in Ontario we're their own

homee National Party that went up in

seats and what up in votes

so there are reasons to be oh the block

went up in secret only National Party

only National Party to to to go up in

seats and go up in votes that's

important it's not enough and I'm not

suggesting to our members that were

satisfied with the results but we I do

point to significant reasons to be

encouraged I want to talk about the

personal side because politics is

inherently personal you are out there is

the leader how did it feel on Monday

night when you saw those results and you

realize you do know it incredibly

disappointing you know if this is

something that I have been working with

a great team our caucus is amazing we

had great candidates we really did

attract stellar people and to to know

that we fell short is is difficult you

know to I reflecting a lot on some of

the the aspects of the campaign that

brought us to that result and that's

going to be the focus of our review but

I am encouraged you know winning the

most votes and and seeing our seat total

go up is encouraging and the fact that

there are a lot of building blocks there

that we can build on is also encouraging

but it is difficult it's it's always

difficult to fall short of goals that

we've set ourselves and but uh you know

there's no one more disappointed than me

and the results of the the campaign but

there's no one more eager to get it

right and to fix the issues that didn't

work this time when it comes to that

personal side and your personal beliefs

became a focus it became an attack line

for the Liberals for the NDP for the

greens do you believe that someone who

holds the kind of social conservative

values you do can win in Canada today

well look I've always been open with my

own personal beliefs on on various

issues and I think it was obviously the

Liberals were trying to divide Canadians

on these issues as they divided the

country they divided the country to the

extent where they Alberta and

Saskatchewan have completely rejected

their policies and we've seen the rise

the resurgence of the separatist block

kept a cloth so the Liberals are all

about dividing Canadians my message to

Canadians is that it not only is it is

it

acceptable it's a feature of Canada that

we live in a country where it's okay

you're you know it's part of being in

Canadians is to have the freedom of

thought of freedom of belief what's

important for me and what was important

for me during the campaign was to assure

Canadians that on social issues that

divide Canadians that divide

conservatives we're not going to reopen

old debates and we were not going to

further divided Canadians on those

issues so I do believe that Canada is a

place that respects people who hold

different points of view certainly our

party does or the only party that does

and I believe the Canadians want to live

in a country where you can have a

disagreement on an issue without calling

someone on Canadian as the Liberals did

would you reconsider marching in a gay

pride parade next year is that a

possibility

no I I've made it clear that I will

choose other ways to show my support for

the LGBT community I'll continue I want

marching parades but I will ensure that

our party is is inclusive and open and

that we fight for equality rights of all

Canadians and that we hold the

government to account for not doing more

for example to help people are

persecuted for their sexual orientation

coming to Canada so why the opposition

in particular - what is it about that

these are not comfortable it's there are

many different ways to show support to

the community and and and that's the

focal point there for me that's what I'm

focusing on there many people who

support the community that don't March

and I'm going to continue to fight for

LGBT Canadians just as we do for all

Canadians there are members your caucus

who told me that they think that the

conservatism that was presented in this

election is too narrow but it didn't

feel like a big tent that it didn't feel

inclusive what do you say to that

criticism well we ran a very positive

campaign with Big Ideas nation-building

ideas like the energy corridor that

would bring Western Canadian energy to

Eastern Canadian markets we ran on

fiscal responsibility we ran on

individual liberty and individual

freedom we had a strong foreign policy

as it relates to strengthening Canada's

relationship with our NATO allies and

with our partners in NORAD

we did this our platform was the product

of a lot of people having in

but we had very extensive consultations

within caucus every member of our team

was was invited and encouraged to

participate in it to put forward ideas

and I believe that that we had a great

cross-section of different aspects of

what conservatives believe in and you

know very proud of the platform

obviously we didn't find a way to

connect with enough Canadians to form

government and that's gonna be part of

our reviews to find out exactly what

happened there was it a mistake not to

be more aggressive on climate change

because it seems like that was a big

priority for a lot of voters well I

would point out that more Cannes voted

for our climate change plan and working

as voters as well that's partially

because of Alberta's escapa it's well

look we're all part of this country and

I would not discount the fact that I

would not discover the fact that because

people in Alberta and Saskatchewan

overwhelmingly support us that

diminishes their voice in any way and

when I point out the fact that the

carbon tax is ineffective the our plan

actually has tougher targets on on large

emitters than the liberal plan does we

don't we didn't grant a massive

exemption to large industrial emitters

and then pass a hundred percent of the

costs on to individuals and motorists so

we had an aggressive plan we do have an

aggressive plan for climate change it's

a serious plan and you know there is a

party there already is a party for those

who thinks there already is a party for

those who think that you can solve

problems with new taxes that's the

Liberal Party so we're not that carbon

tax is definitely still up there is a

party for all those who think that you

can solve problems with taxes that is a

liberal party I've never known a new tax

to solve a problem and so we're not

going to become the party you know I

don't believe that we should become the

party of calling for new taxes well

there are economists who say it's very

effective but let's focus on Alberta and

Saskatchewan exit this Western brexit is

it worthy the growing sentiment that's

out there and I'm from Alberta and I got

a lot of very upset texts on election

night from people out there who feel

that they're not included that they're

not represented that their voices aren't

at the table the politics they are very

volatile right now what do you say as a

national leader to people in Alberta and

Saskatchewan who feel that they don't

have a place in the Feder

well first of all I my message to people

in Alberta and Saskatchewan is I

completely understand what they're going

through

I live in Regina I've got friends and

neighbors who have been affected by the

downturn there's a lot of anxiety and a

lot of fear and and and they are

justified and having in those feelings

because they've seen entire communities

significantly affected by not just not

just a downturn and this is something I

take issue with with mr. Trudeau on you

know he he's trying to paint this as

some kind of global phenomenon that

there's somehow a global issue that's

affecting Alberta we've seen increases

in investments in the oil and gas sector

in other countries who do not kill

pipeline projects who do not insert

impose legislation designed to entirely

suffocate and and and kill off an entire

sector of our economy this is not

something that other countries are going

through all of us together this is

something that's happening in Canada in

our energy sector because of deliberate

decisions that this Liberal government

have taken and and we're gonna fight

we're gonna fight for them we're gonna

fight against those decisions we're

gonna do everything we can to force the

Liberals to change course on that we

believe in our energy sector we believe

it's better for Canadian oil and gas to

be developed and and shipped across the

country to Eastern Ko markets and around

the world I'd rather I'd rather

Canadians consume Canadian energy then

oil and gas bought by repressive regimes

and that's what the basis of my national

energy quarter was all about finding a

path forward to address environmental

concerns and indigenous concerns but at

the same time getting big projects built

again bring our country closer together

Justin Trudeau has divided us and I'm

going to work maybe give it everything I

have to bring our country closer

together do you agree with Premier Moses

ershon that it's time to take a look at

equalization but it's time for a new

deal because the current formula isn't

working I've always believed that

Western premiers were we're right to

have frustrations about the equalization

formula during the campaign I noted that

the Liberals had locked in the formula

for five years and

and and they did that without

consultation I've said that some of the

things that we can address in the early

days are the lag between real time

economic data and what equalization

payments actually turn out to be I

believe we can shorten that so that the

the the economic downturns can be

factored into those those calculations

much more quickly that would be more

responsive to the needs of provinces

like Alberta and Saskatchewan but I

absolutely understand where their

frustration is coming from you know we

have have a federal government that is

doing everything it can to to you know

Justin Trudeau said it himself he said

he was frustrated that he couldn't phase

out the energy sector too quickly we

know that's what he wants to do and he's

implementing the policies that do it and

Alberta and Saskatchewan are affected by

that well he did by trans mountain but

putting that aside just to take one last

look at Alberta and Saskatchewan before

we move on there are no MPs from either

of those province in the government so

how do you think Prime Minister Trudeau

should represent Alberta and

Saskatchewan do you think it's time to

put a senator in cabinet from one of

those provinces so there's a Western

voice you know he'll have to decide how

to proceed with that he's the one that

divided this country he basically ran

against Western Canada in this campaign

and as a result he doesn't have

representation from it so he'll have to

find a way for Ford and we'll be that

voice will be a voice for for Alberta

and Saskatchewan or certainly as we will

for all Keynes but you know it's um you

know II mentioned the transparent

pipeline you know the he didn't even

defend trans mountain in court he killed

Northern Gateway he decided to impose a

double standard on a west to east pipe

pipeline so you know Bill CC 69 the

carbon tax these are all decisions that

have chased away billions of dollars

worth of investment there are billions

of dollars around the world being

invested in big energy projects that

create jobs and opportunity it's not

happening in Canada it's not happening

in Canada because of deliberate

decisions that Justin Trudeau made

we don't know when Parliament's going to

come back yet but when it does is your

folk is going to be on trying to bring

down the Trudeau government or are there

certain areas that you're willing to

work with the Liberals on to pass

priorities well look it's really up to

mr. Trudeau as to his approach keynes

gave him the weakest mandate for a

government in canadian history so the

onus really does fall on him on seeking

out that common ground we've staked out

our priorities in our platform I do

believe I am very concerned that his

ethics in his corruption and we're gonna

do everything we can to to continue to

hold it a hold him accountable for that

you know at the end of the day if he's

willing to abandon some of the policies

that have caused so much economic

hardship in this country we'd like to

see that we'll wait and see what he

brings to the table we are respectful of

the decision that Keynes made and they

elected a minority government they

elected a part of Parliament with

several parties now that have official

status we'll be respectful of that but

we will use every tool at our disposal

to hold him to account and to and and to

point out the failures of his policies

so you're not looking for a snap

election is it we are respecting the

results of this election I think

Canadians when they vote for a

parliament like this they do expect all

parties to put Kaden's first and that's

what I'm going to do will put the needs

of Canadians first and and see what mr.

Trudeau brings to the table it's very

clear that there are many things we

disagree on that we're not going to

support we're not going to support

increases to the carbon tax we're not

going to support new legislation that

makes it even more difficult to get big

projects built again in this country so

we'll see what types of what type of

approach he has with purlins trans

mountain what we expect that we expect

to see that build we you know what a

terrible indictment on Justin Trudeau's

legacy that he created a situation where

the government had to buy a pipeline in

order to see it through it used to be

that private sector investors would make

sure that pipelines got built in this

country and he's failed to defend it in

court he you know what we've expected to

be built we would like to see it

you know sold as quickly as possible you

don't think it's good for the economy

it's not a good sign to investors around

the world that the government has to own

something in this country for it to

proceed so we'll see wait and see what

yes but we'd like to see some kind of an

action plan that he would bring forward

to show the steps that he's willing to

take to make sure it's built why don't

you hire the daisy group to do

opposition research on the People's

Party a Canada political parties as I

said first of all I'm not going to

comment on individual contracts that we

may or may not have had but I will point

out that it is all political parties do

research all political parties look at

you know what what other parties have

said what other candidates have said but

as you know the Liberal Party would did

a great deal of research on other

candidates as did the NDP I'm sure other

parties too did the same thing one last

question for you tone of the campaign

it's something we talked about when we

lost Matt it's something that Prime

Minister Trudeau addressed in his press

conference last week said he kind of

regretted the nastiness Catherine

McKenna came out said the same thing

do you regret some of the nastiness on

the campaign trail that the

Conservatives were responsible for like

we I woke up every morning promoting a

positive message about how our policies

were going to help Katie's well you put

lots of negative stuff people's -

including allegations about legalizing

hard drugs that weren't true we pointed

very seeing the GSB okay well we pointed

out comments that their candidates had

said we pointed out that liberal members

of parliament on the Health Committee

endorsed that very idea platform well

when when liberals try to to say the

things aren't in our platform they tried

to tell Keynes what's in that well here

we have specific quotes from people

running for the party we have the prime

minister himself Justin Trudeau saying

it wasn't going to do it at the moment

we know the NDP were calling for it and

we know the results the election they're

gonna have to find support from other

parties I think it's legitimate to say

this is a possibility this is something

that the Liberals are obviously have a

significant number of their MPs that are

contemplating as for the GST I pointed

out that in order to work with the NDP

if you combine their two platforms to

it would have added billions it will see

what happens billions of dollars new

spending taxes will have to go up to pay

for it I said in order to pay for some

of that they would have to raise the GST

or perhaps other taxes it could be

income taxes it could be corporate taxes

it could be cancelling other types of

tax credits for Keynes but there is no

doubt these deficits that they're

running have to be paid back

they had to be paid back with interest

at some point the government's gonna

have to find the money from somewhere

and the message to Canadians was we know

that they've raised taxes in the past

this is a election I believe it was

fought a lot about affordability and and

and what's left over at the end of the

month for many Canadians and I believe

it's legitimate to looking at what types

of things they might be raising mr.

Schurr I know it's not an easy thing to

sit down and do an interview like this

after you've lost so thank you for

taking the time to share with us and to

share with Canadians thank you very much
