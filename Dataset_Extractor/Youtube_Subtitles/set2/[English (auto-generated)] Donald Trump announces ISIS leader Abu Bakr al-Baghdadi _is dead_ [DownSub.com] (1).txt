last night the United States brought the

world's number-one terrorist leader to

justice Abu Bakar al-baghdadi

is dead he was the founder and leader of

Isis the most ruthless and violent

terror organization anywhere in the

world the United States has been

searching for Baghdadi

for many years capturing or killing

Baghdadi has been the top national

security priority of my administration

US Special Operations Forces executed a

dangerous and daring nighttime raid in

northwestern Syria and accomplished

their mission and grand style the u.s.

personnel were incredible I got to watch

much of it no personnel were lost in the

operation well a large number of

Baghdadi's fighters and companions were

killed with him he died after running

into a dead-end tunnel whimpering and

crying and screaming all the way the

compound had been cleared by this time

with people either surrendering or being

shot and killed eleven young children

were moved out of the house and are

uninjured the only ones remaining were

Baghdady in the tunnel and he had

dragged three of his young children with

him

they were led to certain death he

reached the end of the tunnel as our

dogs chased him down he ignited his vest

killing himself and the three children

his body was mutilated by the blast the

tunnel had caved in on it in addition

but test results gave sir

immediate and totally positive

identification it was him the thug who

tried so hard to intimidate others spent

his last moments in utter fear in total

panic and dread terrified of the

American forces bearing down on him we

were in the compound for approximately

two hours and after the mission was

accomplished we took highly sensitive

material and information from the raid

much having to do with Isis origins

future plans things that we very much

want Baghdadi's demise demonstrates

America's relentless pursuit of

terrorist leaders and our commitment to

the enduring and total defeat of Isis

and other terrorist organizations
