I'm almost tempted to ask you since you

know you can't lie to Congress when you

were compared to mr. Trump did you take

that as a compliment

no I don't answer there was a joke a

chairman and chief executive officer of

Facebook

this is mr. Zuckerberg first appearance

before this committee but I believe that

mr. Zuckerberg needs no introduction

Thank You chairwoman waters ranking

member McHenry and members of the

committee there are more than a billion

people around the world who don't have

access to a bank account but could

through mobile phones if the right

system existed and that includes more

than 14 million people right here in the

u.s. being shut out of the financial

system has real consequences for

people's lives and it's often the most

disadvantaged people who pay the highest

price I believe that this problem can be

solved and Libra can help I have a few

more things to say but for the richest

man in the world to come here and hide

behind the poorest people in the world

and say that's who you're really trying

to help you're trying to help those for

whom the dollar is not a good currency

drug dealers terrorists tax evaders last

hearing on Libre for example was a

moment when members of Congress on this

dais actually compared the technology

that technology of Libre to the

terrorist attacks of September 11th will

the gentleman yield

look I have my own face nice comment

even you the time belongs to the

gentleman from North Carolina thank you

for taking the bait don't forgot to

answer it but let's be clear you're

gonna be making powerful burglary tools

and letting your business partners

commit the burglary you are going with

all the power of Facebook to try to

create a new currency you're gonna call

it the Libre but you're the person

behind it that's why it's called I call

it the suck buck you are going to create

it and then say oh it's our business

partners your white paper says your

business partners are going to use your

tool to have anonymous accounts and then

you have the

all to come here and say you're gonna

follow all the know your customer how do

you know your customer with an anonymous

account you plan on doing no

fact-checking on political ads

chairwoman our our policy is that we do

not fact check politicians speech and

the reason for that is that we believe

that in a democracy it is important that

people can see for themselves what

politicians are saying you know Sri

cently that the official policy of

Facebook now allows politicians to pay

to spread disinformation could I run ads

targeting Republicans in primaries

saying that they voted for the green New

Deal would I be able to run

advertisements on Facebook targeting

Republicans in primaries saying that

they voted for the green New Deal

I mean if you're not fact-checking

political advertisements I'm just trying

to understand the bounds here I I don't

know the answer to that off the top of

my head I think so you don't know if

I'll be able to do that do you see a

potential problem here with a complete

lack of fact-checking on political

advertisements

well congresswoman I think lying is bad

and I think if you were to run an ad

that had a lie that would be bad you

won't take down lies or you will take

down lies so I think it's just a pretty

simple yes or no do you have you learned

that you should not lie congresswoman I

would disagree with the characterization

well I say you went to the European

regulators and you said that it will not

linked it will not that that it will be

impossible and yet 18 months later it

happened and you were fine for that

congressman so let's continue I hope

that you learned something about that

about not lying so let me ask you this

do you know what red lining is yes okay

then you should have known better and

maybe if you had real diversity or

inclusion on your team somebody in that

room

would have said what you were doing when

you looked at what you were doing in the

housing how you were redlining or using

zip codes and to eliminate people from

getting information I think we should

probably phrase it a little differently

that you work with civil rights work is

because as a result of the number of

lawsuits that you've had in double-a-c-p

do you know what percentage of

african-americans are on Facebook in

comparison to majority folks do you know

what the percentages are people using

the Facebook yes do you know what the

percentages are for african-americans I

don't because we don't collect the

racism

well the it it came out in a report and

in the Pew Research Center that was sent

to you so maybe you just don't read a

lot of things that deal with civil

rights or African Americans Libre that

the currency is in the wallet calibra

yes calibra oh oh it's like me having my

money in Wells Fargo Bank you could

think about it that way although we're

not a bank we're not applying for a bank

charter I've heerd the right analogy

that's the problem this is a mr.

Zuckerberg that's the problem that's

what we're facing here and this was the

same place where I ran into kind of

trying to understand what this thing is

that you all are creating and I

appreciate creation I'd like it to stay

in America and not go to Switzerland mr.

Zuckerberg I am as you know Facebook can

be sometimes an unkind place both toward

my personal appearance and today

apparently towards your haircut

but I just was a mother of a teenage boy

I just want to say thanks for modeling

the short cut you've got about 15,000

contractors watching murders stabbings

suicides other gruesome disgusting

videos for content moderation correct

congressman yes I believe that that's

correct um according to one report I

have and this is straight out of an

episode of Black Mirror these workers

get nine-nine

minutes of supervised dwell --mess time

per day that means nine minutes to cry

in this stairwell while somebody watches

them would you be willing to commit to

spending one hour a day for the next

year watching these videos and acting as

a Content monitor and only accessing

accessing the same benefits available to

your workers congresswoman we we work

hard to make sure that we give good

benefits to all the folks who are doing

mr. Zuckerberg we're cleaning my time I

would appreciate it yes or no would you

be willing to act as a Content Manager

have that life experience I'm not sure

that it would best serve our community

for me to spend my time mr. Zuckerberg

are you saying you're not qualified to

be a Content monitor no congresswoman

that's not what I'm saying my first

question is simple but very

thought-provoking how realistic of

betrayal' was the social network
