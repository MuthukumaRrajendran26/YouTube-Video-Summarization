this is not a good deal for Northland

i'ma plead with him not to try and

suggest that what would be a bad deal

for Northland should then be a good deal

for the people of Scotland if what was

being applied today to the people of

Scotland I would be voting against it

for his sake and for his people's sake

and that's why I am encouraging him to

puig answer for our sick well we will

certainly vote against it because I

don't believe this is a good deal period

mr. speaker

how did the Prime Minister even signal

up to a deal without understanding the

impact on the economy of what he

dereliction of duty mr. speaker the

truth is because the Prime Minister

isn't concerned with the economy the

Prime Minister isn't concerned with the

facts the brexit ears don't care about

facts during the referendum campaign and

it looks as if they're doing the same no

the truth must heart because mr. speaker

the truth is this every version of

brexit is going to leave us worse it

would continue to damage our

relationship with the European Union

that doesn't grant us much scope to

develop relations with other countries

it is also clear that the heightened

economic uncertainty has been forecast

to reduce business investment by 1

billion pounds and 2019 damaging our

economy and leaving Scotland

this is a great founding frame for

getting away

I'm a mindful of warts what a fool I was

only a puppet and Sobers Ulster and so

was Ireland and a political game that

was to get the Conservative Party into

power now by the DUP maybe choking in a

wads of Carson I am sure that the he as

a member of the leader of our political

party will remain the government that

Scotland will not be duped a second time

honourable friend is correct and you

know what I say to the Conservatives

that knows that are here for now from

Scotland that if this deal goes through

if this has the impact on Scotland and

creates a competitive disadvantage

then it's increasingly clear and we

could see it from the messages that are

coming from us even today from people

that voted no in our referendum in 2014

they are making it very clear that they

want Scotland's right to choose and I

make this guarantee to you mr. speaker

that Scotland will become an independent

nation

short orders people to him giving away I

think the house is faced with an

impossible choice this is like being

asked to buy a house just based on the

estate agent details designed to sell it

with no chance to look inside it or see

any kind of contract on it we spend

about two months scrutinizing and

debating the finance bill and that is

just for a one-year budget for Britain

isn't it absolutely ridiculous that we

can't even see the bill let alone the

economic impact before allowed to take a

decision

absolutely and heaven knows what the

term of the mortgage might be let me

make it clear I certainly wouldn't be

buying any house from this Prime

Minister Mr Speaker breaks it in any

form will damage the branding reputation

and standing of Scottish produce our

civil society its regulatory alignment

to key markets its commercial and

political relationships abroad and even

recognition of skills and qualifications

Scotland relies on the skills and labor

that the EU offers for its economic

growth

grexit will only serve to weaken our

access to a vital labor market and

considering that Scotland's native

population is declining

we need more migration to our country

[Music]

finally giving way but what he is not

telling the house is there every major

business group in Scotland is

encouraging this house to support this

[Applause]

specimens of chromophore CBI the

Federation of small businesses in a few

ants the Scottish fishermen's Federation

all of them pleading with us to bring

uncertainty to a name and they still

don't listen to the SNP they are not

Scotland

[Applause]

Oh

we're grateful to the Honorable tender

member for sterling I remind the house

and interventions must be brief and we

need to expedite progress subtle hint

mr. Ian Blackburn Thank You mr. speaker

and you know it is illuminating to hear

such voices in this house because I'm

afraid the harsh reality is that many

business organizations many industry

organisations in Scotland

see the impact and not just in Scotland

throughout the UK the British Chamber of

Commerce the National Farmers Union the

food and beverage Association the timber

trade federation of all talked about the

negative impact of this deal but you

never get me the truth from the Scottish

Conservatives mr. speaker no I'm going

to make progress because I'm aware that

other colleagues wish to speak mr.

speaker it didn't have to be like this

if the Prime Minister had any interest

in the people of Scotland he would have

engaged with our Scottish government

from the very beginning the Scottish

government sought to compromise we did

this by offering up Scotland's place in

Europe a compromise position for all of

the United Kingdom and for Scotland to

remain in the single market and the

customs union hey you know I have to

tell you that we had no engagement with

the UK government over these papers but

I can say this to you when I went to see

Michelle Varney he'd read every page of

that document that's the difference

between the attitude of our friends and

colleagues in Europe and the disdain

that our Scottish government get some

Westminster

our plan was to miss dismissal to France

and then followed by years of the UK

government ignored in Scotland ignoring

our Parliament's mr. speaker with

Northern Ireland getting access to the

single market in the customs union it is

clear that the Prime Minister is willing

to put trust in the people of Northern

Ireland to manage its relationship so

it's inexplicable that he won't trust

the people of Scotland who also voted

overwhelmingly to remain in the unified

Union this offer gives Northern Ireland

a competitive advantage over Scotland

and whilst we respect and understand the

unique circumstances of Northern Ireland

I want to be clear everyone in the SNP

wants to see the continuation of peace

and stability but the proposal in this

deal is in effect has been kept in the

single market in the customs union as a

consequence that was our compromised

position and the UK government

completely ignored us ignored Scotland

the Prime Minister has shown the people

of Scotland total contempt a prime

minister who has no mandate from

Scotland yet he seeks to impose his

beretta against a democratically

expressed will silences the wishes of

our people and weak nano economy this

Prime Minister and his brexit fanclub in

number 10 don't care about Scotland

lyrics obsessed with only one thing

winning and delivering their brexit

fantasy at any cost

mr. speaker the dishonesty and lies of

the well you know I I hear the minister

shouting from the front bench not true

where was the engagement with the

Scottish government about race in Europe

it simply didn't happen

it was absolutely completely true he can

shake his head because he doesn't like

the reality mr. speaker the dishonesty

eyes of courtly

come treat the dog for breakfast in the

first place

should be fun

[Applause]

resume your seat as far as I'm aware the

right honorable gentleman is not

currently giving way and so they order

and so the chosen is actually shouldn't

stand there portentous way as though he

has an absolute right to intervene it

might be courteous to allow him to do so

but such an allowance has not yet been

made mr. Ian Blackford

I'm afraid today mr. speaker this house

will be listening to our voices and

perhaps the right honourable gentleman

might catch your eye later on mr.

speaker the dishonesty and lies and

thought leave throughout this country to

vote the brexit in the first place and

this would be something that the Prime

Minister and many in his cabinet should

be ashamed of

they have torn our country their

Carlin's their own party apart mr.

speaker this is the beginning of the end

of their precious union atonium vision

for society Scotland will not be ignored

any more the deal must be stopped

and Bend today whether this deal passes

today or not the government needs an

extension this deal is devastating for

Scotland we will not vote for it and we

call for the extension period to be used

for an election so that we can get rid

of this rotten Saudi government out of

the Scottish National Party are here to

do our job to stand stronger for

Scotland those across this house who

ever want to lay claim to representing

the voices in the interests of the

people of Scotland you cannot support

this deal you cannot inflict economic

and social harm on our society miss

after myth from the Prime Minister and

his cronies but the facts are clearly

the European Union accounts for 56

percent of the UK's exports and 65

percent of imports either through the EU

directly or to other countries but the

EU has trade arrangements with the

direct value of EU trade is over triple

the value of US trade the brexit

secretary even said that the EU was the

UK's most important partner 100,000 jobs

in Scotland at risk our fisherman farmer

and crafters all disadvantage viola

steel as the Scottish seafood

Association put it this could switch the

lace out for a small exporter five

separate certificates all have to be

done on October 31st for any small

exporter that is possibly trying to sell

30 kilos of top-quality langoustines to

a restaurant in Paris switch the lights

off the restaurant order is going to go

and buy his lovely language deeds

somewhere else not my words that's from

the spot of seafood Association and I

hope I hope mr. speaker that people in

Scotland can see the government front

bench on laughing people's livelihoods

at risk

and the government front bench thinks

it's funny you should be utterly utterly

Asche

mr. speaker the Scottish National Party

will not stand by and let this

government Ripper economy and our

country's future apart we are Europeans

and Scotland is a European nation

members across this house should unite

with the SNP and bring this government

down a general election is the best we

know to stop this prime minister and

stop this dangerous threats in the area

mr. speaker let me see this anyone any

single member here this afternoon who

backs the Tory Prime Minister and his

cheating vote leave campaign by shaft in

Scotland will never not ever be forgiven

by the people of Scotland overnight

we've seen the reports the rumours and

the whispers mr. speaker is the Labour

Party really going to allow their

members of parliament to vote for this

catastrophic break severely let me

remind the Labour Party what the tea you

see said this deal would be a disaster

for working people it would hammer the

economy cost jobs and say all workers

rights down the river the Prime Minister

has negotiated even a worse deal than

Theresa May all MPs should vote against

it that's the words of the tea you see

so let me ask cry has deleted of the

opposition not yet guaranteed the all

Labour MPs won't vote with the Scottish

National Party this afternoon against

this deal a deal that would be

devastating for Scotland ripping us out

of the EU against her will terminating

our freedom of movements rights

threatening jobs living standards our

public services and the economy is the

leader of the Labour Party really

willing to allow any members of his

party to write the blank cheque for this

Tory prime minister to deliver breaks it

not a single member

of the Labour Party should be voting for

a deal that delivers a race to the

bottom on workers rights on

environmental standards and paves the

way for dismantling our precious NHS it

would be absolutely staggering that with

a No Deal threat on the table any Labour

MP could even think about voting for

this toxic deal mr. speaker labour must

not ve handmaidens of heat or he breaks

it which we know will cost thousands of

jobs and harms people's livelihood so I

appeal to every member of

I thank the right honourable gentleman

way I wonder if he got section Aries

speech from John Landsman so could I ask

does he agree with me but when it comes

to workers rights the EU isn't God

the fact is local authorities up and

down the UK have to outsource contracts

to the European Union at the detriment

of workers in the local communities we

have seen a rise in zero-hour contracts

and poor conditions partly because of

that or outsourcing does he agree with

me

[Applause]

I fight I fight right others the ladies

or colleagues together and committee I'm

Portland the builders she knows to the

right honorable gentleman to face the

house so we can all hear mr. Ian

Blackburn is simply say to my right

honourable Fred but I would trust the

European Union with workers rights

before I would trust the opposition we

must stop the excuses and finally act by

backing the SNP tonight to reject us

damaging view secure an extension and

call an election so we can bring this

Tory government down and stop right here

but speaker mr. speaker

meanwhile Scottish Tory MPs are prepared

to vote for a deal that he previously

pledged that they would not back simple

and responsibility and moral covered

this I see to the Scottish Tories you

are serving the death knell on the Union

by voting for this deal independence is

coming and we will take our place as he

proud European nation what a shift in

time mr. speaker from what Ruth Davidson

said in 2014 no means we stay in we are

members of the European Union

mr. speaker the people of Scotland now

know more than ever you can never not

ever trust a Tory

we already knew that despite the promise

promise after promise

[Applause]

we wish to expedite the debate at the

radical German must be heard as I think

he's approaching his parish mr. Ian

Black

Thank You mr. speaker and perhaps a fee

settle down we can get through this and

their voices might be hurt

we already know that despite promise

after promise made by the Scottish

Tories to protect our fishermen that the

backstop loophole in the deal threatens

to be potentially devastating for the

Scottish fishing sector under the

proposed deal it might actually help if

you listen rather than trying to show

because this is about the livelihood of

fishermen that they've falsely claimed

to protect mr. speaker mr. speaker under

the proposed deal

Scottish fish exports to the European

Union face being hit by damage in

terrace any move which could see

Scottish vessels registered in Northern

Ireland to land their catch there and

then have it moved to the Republic for

processing to escape those duties would

pose a huge danger to Scotland's fishing

ports and unweighting processing

industry that's the reality of what the

Tories are threatening to do to a

fishing industry with directly

threatened thousands of jobs and could

make the sector among the most hardest

hit by brexit in the whole of Scotland

Scottish fishing sold out by the

conservative

the spark reality I caused to the

bluster of a Yuki Tory government which

once again treats Scotland as an

afterthought well mr. Speaker we in the

SNP we will not stand for it

I warn members who marched through the

lobbies with the government this

afternoon that selling Scotland out by

backing this deal will be the final nail

in the coffin for the Union mr. speaker

while the UK drag Scotland out of the EU

against her will while this Tory

government downgrades our devolution

settlement and destroys our rights in

Scotland the SNP look entirely ATO

record we are ambitious for our nation

and not this Prime Minister not the

leader of the Opposition not any leader

of the Liberal Democrats but anyone will

stand in her way the Scottish people are

sovereign and they should have the

choice to determine their own future mr.

speaker this year Scotland is marking

the 20th anniversary of the evolution

the establishment of our Scottish

Parliament the first speech that was

made in the new Spanish Parliament and

me 1999 was by my good friend Winifred

doing at the time she made that speech

she was also of course the mother of the

European Parliament having served there

since 1979

when he expressed the hope that the

Scottish Parliament would try to follow

the more consensual style of the

European Parliament and other European

Parliament's rather than the more

confrontational approach that we

witnessed again here today in

Westminster and interactions know our

actions today we are trying to stay true

to that advice well the remains

uncertainty over whether this proposed

deal will pass what is absolutely clear

is it would take us out of the European

Union out of the single market out of

the customs union against the

overwhelming Democratic will of the

people of Scotland mr. speaker Scotland

did not vote for brexit in any form and

unlike others the SNP

will not vote for brexit in any form

Scotland has been shafted side Lane

silenced ignored by the shooby

government and it cannot be ignored

today members I are jus you not stand by

and allow this Prime Minister to drag us

into an economic abyss because I warn

the house it is cleaner than ever that

the best future for Scotland is one as

an equal independent European nation

that is a choice that the SNP is

determined ensure is given to the people

of Scotland and those reports against

Scotland's interests this afternoon will

be aware you are ending the Union

Scotland is not for leaving Europe we

will become an independent nation my

message to Europe is leave a light on

for Scotland five minute oh five minute

limit on backbench speeches will have to

apply with immediate effect though I

don't anticipate that that limit will

last very long

mrs. Theresa May

[Applause]

Thank You mr. speaker mr. speaker when I

arrived at the House of Commons this

morning I saw the message good day for

May I thought that perhaps consensus had

come across the whole of the house and

that they were already been decided that

this deal would be supported by the

house tonight

unfortunately my view on that was

premature and I think only premature but

happily for England of course it was a

reference to Johnny Mae having scored

the boat in our victory against

Australia I hope the whole house will

forgive me if I say that standing here I

have a distinct sense of deja vu but

today's vote is an important

well I intend to rebel against all of

those who don't want to vote to deliver

brexit

mr. speaker today's vote is important

the eyes of the country no actually the

eyes of the wider world are upon us

today

and every member in this house has a

responsibility in the decision that they

will take to determine or whether or not

they are going to put the national

interest first and not just an

ideological or a single issue or a party

political interest but the full wider

interests of our constituents and as we

look at this as we look at this issue it

is something the decision we take

tonight will determine not just the

future of our country our the future

lives of our constituents but I believe

the very future of our politics because

we have today to take a key decision and

it's simple do we want to deliver brexit

do we want to deliver on the result of

the referendum in 2016 well we know we

know the views of the Scottish

Nationalist Party they they reject

results of referendum they

when this House voted overwhelmingly to

give the choice of our membership of the

EU to the British people did we really

mean it when we voted to trigger article

50 did we really mean it when the two

main parties represented in this house

stood on manifestos in the 2017 general

election to deliver brexit did we really

meet I think there can only be one

answer to that and that is yes we did

mean it yes we keep faith with the

British people yes we want to deliver

brexit because if know there's a if if

the right honourable lady we'll just

wait for a minute because if this

Parliament did not mean it then it is

guilty of the most egregious contract on

the British

they're happy many views across this

house I want to say simply to some of

the groups involved there are those some

of whom believe passionately and have

believed for some time others who've

come to this more lately that there

should be a second referendum I say

simply this you cannot have a second

referendum simply because some people

don't agree with the result of the first

I don't I don't I don't like oh there

are many people who want to speak so I'm

going to carry on I've taken many

interventions and questions across here

I don't I don't I don't like referenda

but I think that if you have one you

should abide by the results that people

have given you then there is the Labour

Party front bench and I've heard much

from the Labour Party front bench over

the last three years about the

importance of protecting jobs of

protecting manufacturing of protecting

people's livelihoods if they really

meant that they would have voted for the

deal earlier

is their chance to show whether they

really care about people by voting for

this field tonight

in this happen this afternoon I hope

this two speaker in this House of

Commons and then I say to all of those

across this house who say they do not

want No Deal I've said it before I've

said it many times I hope this is the

last time I have to say it if you don't

want No Deal you have to vote for a deal

this is crying out for certainty people

want certainty in their lives

investors want to be able to invest and

want the uncertainty to be got rid of

they want to know that this country is

moving forward if you want to deliver

brexit if you want to keep faith with

the British people if you want this

country to move forward then vote for

the deal today

[Applause]

Thank You mr. Beatty Kyle

Rikka and I say I say with all respect

and humility to the former Prime

Minister that there will be a lot of

people watching this now and listening

to her words that will feel very

strongly that the only kontrick is a

prime minister who makes a solemn

promise to the public that there will be

under no circumstances a border down the

Irish Sea and then seeing the same

person traipsing through the lobbies to

vote precisely for it so I would expect

a little bit more humility from her

missus mr. speaker

all of us who are very participant in

the referendum debate noticed one thing

the prospectus for Briggs it was a very

poorly defined prospectus it was very

difficult to gauge precisely what it

would mean for our country but when the

Prime Minister signed the article 50

treaty

she had the legal right to define breaks

it she came back with this deal over 500

pages of definition of brexit this deal

defined it and for almost a year the

Prime Minister said and the government

said that this deal respected the will

of the people and now we have a separate

deal that's been brought back by a

separate government and this government

is saying that this fundamentally

different deal represents the will of

the people it is a different deal with

different customs arrangements different

regulatory systems and a different

border for the United Kingdom and they

say this represents the will the people

I make this simple point both deals

can't represent the will of the people I

say with all humility if you want to

know what people voted for if you want

to know what the will of the people is

you can ask them not ask them based on

promises asked them based on facts

because we have the facts now the

compromise that the honourable gentleman

for Sedgefield and i have been working

on is a compromise because we could be

the remain as who open the door - Briggs

it it is about fundamentally breaking

the gridlock here in Parliament in our

back of that

and it's based around a deal I'll give

away I've been listening to the

Honorable member with interest and would

he agree with me that whilst the

referendum settle the question of

leaving what it didn't settle was where

we're going and that is why this house

has been debating over the last three

and a half years different ways of

leaving the EU some people believe in

the may deal

some people wonder may deal miners bat

stop some people want to Northern

Ireland back stop some people want the

customs union

some people want her deal from p1 of

Magnolia does he agree with me but that

is why whatever deal that the government

is putting before us should actually be

given to the people for a final say I'm

extremely grateful for a thoughtful

intervention and of course I agree with

him

because I speak of somebody who was

voted for three separate versions of

brexit I haven't opposed

most members of the ERG were voted for

braces so the key question is how do we

break the gridlock how do we get through

this impasse the idea of a referendum

based on a deal is a confirmatory

referendum we put the prospect of

prospectus back to the people and say is

this good enough for you the exactly the

same way that we did in Northern Ireland

with the good a good eye good friday

peace agreement I will give way Thank

You honourable gentleman for giving way

and as he knows back in February 2016

before the referendum that suggestion

was put to the then prime minister who

stood at that despatch box and said that

the proposal the very idea was

absolutely ridiculous

nobody in this house disputed that then

where was he I was here in the house and

I was working constructively with our

members across the house and I voted for

three separate versions of brexit I have

done my bit to try and get across the

line in this but we've got to the point

now where so many different people

simply because the prospectus for exit'

wasn't defined at the start of the

process it was only defined at the end

of the process that so many people in

this house have a different version of

brings it that we are irreconcilably

divided therefore we have proposed a

compromise whereby we will allow the

deal to pass through Parliament in

return for inviting the public in to say

in a definitive final say whether they

will allow this deal to pass the public

can decide is this feel good enough for

them for their family for their

community their jobs and our country if

it is then we can leave directly on

those terms without any need to return

to this place if it's not we can remain

with a deal we have two propositions

bound in international treaty and law

that are implementable straight away we

grained growing support for this across

the house when we pushed it last time

people repeatedly said to us that if the

Prime Minister's other times deal is

defeated they would want to come and

consider this but they wouldn't want to

consider it before any defeat

well a problem was that we didn't get

the opportunity to press for a vote

straight afterwards but now we do

because the government is pushing two

motions tonight one on their deal one on

No Deal we will have an opportunity to

vote after the house is spoken on the

main deal so to all people who want to

support the deal I say this focus on the

deal support the deal but except one

thing if the deal does not succeed in

the first vote tonight we have to make a

choice and there is a choice on the

table that keeps the deal alive that

keeps the deal intact it is the only way

in those circumstances that the deal can

proceed forward and in those

circumstances I hope that people from

across the house will decide that the

country needs resolution and there is an

option that remains standing that will

break the gridlock that will get Briggs

it out of Westminster back into our

communities for one definitive final say

and we can bring this nightmare to an

end

Mr Speaker I hope I would never be

driven in these long debates on brexit

so finally deciding what my opinion is

on the choice between No Deal and a bad

deal and I read to say that when my

right honourable friend the previous

prime minister put forward the

proposition for I had considerable

doubts about her belief that no deal is

better than a bad deal those doubts have

increased because what we have before is

now is undoubtedly a bad deal I think

it's a very bad deal

I think it's wholly inferior to the deal

that was negotiated by my right

honourable friend the former prime

minister for which I too voted three

times like the Honourable member from

Brighton that I we cannot be accused of

taking part in the debate seeking to

block brexit Andhra beauty

the wishes of the British public and all

the rubbish which the more fanatic

brexit ears and their followers

frequently hey letters but now the

choice is very real it is a very bad

deal for reasons which I won't die later

on others have I actually have

considerably sympathy with the members

from Northern Ireland the independent

unionist whom I almost always agree with

also the Democratic Unionist this is a

most controller constitutional position

they're being put in as members of the

United Kingdom and I would very much

rather that we didn't have this

situation of a border down the Irish Sea

because there's absolutely no doubt

that's quite a clear customs and

regulatory border being envisaged down

the Irish Sea it has to be said that the

effect is to save the all Irish economy

from the near calamity that a total No

Deal

would have resulted in I have no idea

how anybody would have operated a No

Deal situation across the border and I

thought these weird propositions of a

customs border somewhere in Northern

Ireland but not on the border had little

or no chance of working that although

the Irish at least have the economic

consolation that they will say long

through the transition period as they

are now I am extremely worried that the

purpose of going to negotiate this

convoluted arrangement over Ireland was

so that the economy of Britain could be

taken out of the customs union and the

single market straight away and and if

that holds after the transition period I

think that will have the most damaging

effects on our economic future for all

the reasons that other people have given

in the earlier

and lengthy speeches we've had now

therefore it's all to be played for in

this transition period I actually do not

believe that a good free-trade agreement

a good agreement on security fighting

international crime agreements on the

licensing of medicines the possible

arrangements through the European

Medicines Agency all things spelled out

are likely to be achieved by the end of

next year the candidate in which a lot

of brexit chairs like to hold up as a

model took about nine years before that

was put in place so I do wish that we

activ prepare to contemplate a more

realistic timescale but meanwhile I

think the votes today we and the

princess the next week or two have got

to get us through the the necessary

process to put in place a withdrawal

agreement so we have a transition period

in which we can have the full

negotiations about the ultimate

destination and all my votes in this

house personally have been to ensure the

calamity of leaving with no deal on the

31st of October and whenever was never

allowed for happening for that reason I

think we should support this deal I

cannot understand the government's

resistance saying that that of course we

should legislate before we abandon the

projection of the been act and decide we

don't need a extension the government

says oh you can take that for granted

the detail getting the votes we all know

that none of us are sure whether there's

a majority for this government at all

for the present deal today if they can

keep it through the whole of the

legislation I sure

to order a great wait to see that they

can be more grateful than ever before to

the right honorable and learning

gentlemen the five-minute limit still

applies but the Honourable general is

the last member to benefit from it

Sammy Wilson as a party we have been

supportive all throughout this process

of delivering on the referendum result

of the British people we have defied and

opposed the procedure of securely which

is gone in this place the political

machinations which have gone on this

place to try and undermine that the

irony is that today which should be a

day of rejoicing for us when the Prime

Minister was back with a daily we find

that Northern Ireland and Northern

Ireland alone will be left with in the

clutches of the European Union by being

de facto members of the customs union

and being tied to European regulations

now the government has put forward two

defenses fertilization the first is that

there there will be no border down the

Irish Sea there is no border than the

Irish Sea but let's look at the facts of

this as a result of the customs

arrangements first of all every good

which is exported from gb to Northern

Ireland will be subject to a customs

declaration movements will be subject to

checks unless it can be proved that the

goods are not going I'd say Northern

Ireland Judy will be paid only when

you've proved that there aren't going

whether to be paid back and on top of

that will be all of the regulations of

the European Union imposed in Northern

Ireland now if anybody tells me that

that does not represent an economic

customs legal border hard border between

Northern Ireland and the rest United

Kingdom I don't know what a hard border

looks like that

and I'm furthermore where it Kim turning

to bits in the spice I have heard it

said that if there were to be an extra

camera please from the border between

Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic

or one additional piece of paper had to

be signed that would represent a brick

and the Good Friday Agreement because it

would represent a hard border between

Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic

so on one hand you can have all of these

checks between Northern Ireland and GP

and it doesn't count as a hard border

but one camera on the border between

Northern Ireland and Irish Republic does

cut is a hard border and I think that

that shows the high false the argument

has been put forward by the government

that they have not accepted a hard

border between northern art and what's

the implication of that it means that we

are first of all cut off from the

country to which we belong and secondly

our economic relationships with the

biggest market that we have are damaged

the art this the second argument put

forward by the Minister today is this

that well you could get out of up you

come

you can vote against it and that will

not work

I'll give away the moment that we just

released our arguments let me just fix

this argument you can vote against it

but of course there's a mechanism a very

in Northern Ireland and for dealing with

sensitive issues its enshrined in an

internationally binding agreement and

that mechanism because of the sensitive

nature of politics in online says that

any controversial issue has to be

decided by a cross community vote that

part of the Belfast agreement which is

so sacrosanct in this face unto those

who negotiate

has died being poor light of the Belfast

agreement and I'll give way a very

grateful to libel gentleman and he's

making his own powerful monument which

we have heard could I ask him in a

limited time available that he turns his

attention and addresses the amendment

made by my old friend Rada my friend for

a Dorset West because if he's concerned

a hard border mr. speaker he must

recognize that the dog may be opening if

that passes today for a hard border and

no deal brexit to emerge well first of

all the hard border is there and you

know I've made the argument and I defy

anybody to tell me that if you've got to

fill in a customs declaration you've got

to have lorries and vans searched at the

ports coming into the northern Arlen

you've got to pay taxes on goods which

come from TP that that's not a hard

border already and we will and let me

but let me come to this issue of consent

is important because the Minister

dismisses unionists fears by saying you

can vote your way out of it

well of course the mechanism for voting

our way out of it is they're dying by by

an international treaty why is that not

going to be adhered to because the

government and the EU and the Irish

government knows that that would be an

effective way of Northern Ireland doing

the very thing that the minister has

said we'd be able to do remove that a

year to move the ability of Northern

Ireland to take itself out of this

arrangement and of course we only get

the chance after four years we're fitted

to without any consent at all degree was

made that in Northern Ireland at the

moment and for the last a thousand days

where we have had no government there

has been a majority not just a simple

majority a significant majority of

parties and paper who won't to get back

to work we are being held and

blackmailed by a minority party

Shenfield and yet this government has

defended that minority veto for over a

thousand days meaning there's no

government of Northern Ireland well of

course that's the irony that we that we

have to avoid having an assembly because

the voting mechanism of the Belfast

agreement must be adhered to but when it

comes to getting out of this arrangement

which has severe consequences for

Northern Ireland the mechanism of the

Belfast agreement doesn't have to be

adhered to by again

either we don't have we we we avoid a

hard border or we have a hard border

either we adhere to the Belfast

agreement we don't adhere to the Belfast

agreement and that's an this agreement

that the go with the sang turns all of

those things on their head and that's

the reason why we will oppose it and I'm

sure that honourable members across the

the hice who have defended their

constituency interests whether it's a

fishing industry in Scotland or in

Cornwall whether it's the the industrial

worker the rights of workers and they're

in their own constituencies they will

understand why we are will not give in

to this agreement which we believe does

damage to our part of the United Kingdom

and which will lead to the focus of

attention away from table away from

London towards Dublin because don't

forget we will be tightened we will be

tied in turn arrangements variant

arrangement where the the laws for

Northland are women and Brussels the

British government have no input the

storm account will have no input so

where is the focus of attention come

then fur industry and lobby groups and

politicians in Northern Ireland Dublin

and so we move towards unit and then

down about we were asked what we would

do in relation to the amendment all I

can say is this that we would be feeling

in our due date if we do not use every

strategy which is available to try and

get guarantees changes and alterations

which will well - which will safeguard

the interests of the United Kingdom the

owners of our constituents and the

interests that we represent order a

three-minute limit now applies Chris

Grayling speaker I was planning to be

brief anyway

I campaigned to leave mr. speaker but at

every stage of the campaign and I argued

that we should leave on good terms with

our friends and neighbors that we should

leave with a deal I supported the

previous prime minister in what she

sought to achieve

pay tribute to this Prime Minister for

what he has done in bringing forward a

deal but after a year of turbulence in

this place when we have not really come

near to finding anything a majority in

this house can agree on what is

absolutely clear today is that we are

much closer than we have been before to

something which this Parliament is

willing to give its support to I pay

tribute to the Prime Minister for

achieving that and I strongly urge this

house to unite behind this agreement but

I specifically mr. Speaker I want to

talk about the amendment being brought

forward by the original member for West

Dorset and I want everyone all sides of

the house to think about this I know my

rights are open well he has his reasons

for bringing this amendment forward but

the consequence of it is that this house

at a moment where the nation is watching

us to see what decision we will take

about the deal that has been brought

back from Brussels this house today may

decline to form an opinion that is the

consequence of passing the amendment

that we will today not decide whether we

support this deal or not and I put it to

you mr. speaker but the truth is the

public of saying to us is enough is

enough get on get out so we can get

ahead it's as simple as that

well mr. speaker ups I agree with my

rattle war friend and that to my mind is

the crux of the issue around this

amendment today are we really going to

say to the public today we're not today

going to make our minds up we're going

to yet again defer the decision and

every member will have to go back to

their constituents and explain why today

in a moment that is the first Saturday

sitting since 1982 we were not able to

take the decision about whether we

support the principle of this deal or

not I think that would be deeply

damaging to our democracy I think it

will be deeply damaging to reputation of

this house and of every individual in

this Parliament and Mr Speaker I

strongly urge everyone here whatever

their views whether they are for this

deal whether they're against this deal

let us not put ourselves in a position

today where we're simply not taking a

decision and saying to the public do you

know what we'll put it off to another

day I do not think mr. speaker we can

afford to do that my urge everyone in

this house not to allow that situation

to happen miss Kendall mr. speaker the

decision we make today will shape the

future of our country for years to come

and in making that decision three issues

weigh most heavily on my mind

the first is the potential risks this

deal poses to the future of the Union of

the United Kingdom we have heard many

times already

that the deal explicitly separates

Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK

with a border down the Irish Sea and

with Norman Northern Ireland remaining

part of that he used trading system

something the Prime Minister promised he

would never do and these proposals I

fear have a knock-on implications for

Scotland's future relationship in the UK

- I fear that the deal is an open goal

to the SNP and their bid for

independence

we've already heard the argument that

Northern Ireland voted to remain they're

still part of the EU with frictionless

trade

why shouldn't Scotland have that - Mr

Speaker I have always believed in the

importance of unions that we are

stronger and have more power and control

when we work together

I don't expect all honourable members

opposite to share that most fundamental

of Labor beliefs but as members of the

conservative and unionist party I find

it very hard to believe they'd vote for

a deal that could put the future of our

union at risk the deal also has

potentially profound consequences for

the future shape of our economy and

public services paving the way for the

government to take England Scotland and

Wales out of the single market and

customs union the hardest of all hard

breakfast short of No Deal with all the

risks that bring some manufacturing and

services and whatever the Prime Minister

claims there are no legal guarantees for

workers and consumers rights and

environmental standards they can deny it

till they're blue in the face but we

remember it was precisely in order to

cut those rights and standards that

brexit is argued for years that we

should leave the EU so they cannot

convince us otherwise now to be honest I

wish honourable members opposite would

just be honest and say we believe the

future of the country is a low tax small

state deregulated country they've got a

perfect right to think that but they

should have the guts to put that vision

of Britain

finally mr. speaker on the implications

for our democracy

I know colleagues on both sides of the

house understand the risks this deal

poses to the Union and to our economy

economy but they believe the risks to

our democracy of not voting for this

deal are even worse but the truth is

this deal is not what people were

promised during the referendum

neither will it get brexit done far from

it we will have years more negotiations

with another cliff edge at the end of

the transition I don't doubt that many

people will be angry if this deal is

voted down tonight but we cannot put

that back we must put that back to the

British people so they can decide is

this the future for the country that

they want to thank you mr. speaker I

share the view of my rifle and learn it

Fred the member for Russia myth that the

deal that's being presented to us has

many flaws one of the principal flaws is

as a unionist I think it does threaten

the Union of the United Kingdom very

directive but I'm bound to have to also

accept that I think brexit generally

threatens the union of the

Kingdom very directly and I've never

really seen an easy way of trying to

resolve that and deliver brexit at the

same time

secondly although the deal is a matter

on which I should congratulate my right

honourable friend the Prime Minister he

negotiated it he was unhappy with the

earlier deal and he now says he's

satisfied with it I remain of the view

that if one looks at its detail in terms

of the likely negotiating process that

will have to take place next year I am

left in very serious doubt that will in

fact be possible to achieve a free trade

agreement and that therefore this house

will be confronted in 12 months time

with very similar challenges to the ones

that we face at present and with deep

economic consequences if we can't find a

way through them so I'm afraid I am NOT

enthusiastic about the deal was

listening to my right honourable friend

the member for Maidenhead who's been

very consistent in her view on the issue

of brexit namely that for us as a house

or MPs to both offer a referendum and

then try to thwart it by our own actions

or reject it is a colle trick and I

don't disagree with her about that

although we have this disagreement and

if I don't believe that it is in any way

a con trick when one finds oneself

ending up with something so utterly

different from what was being offered I

don't see anything wrong in going back

and asking the electorate whether that

is what they really want when I remain

of the view that that possibility exists

and if it were to be a majority view of

the house that it should be done

I would support it and seek to have that

carried out because I think the

consequences are so momentous but I'd

also like to make clear to the Prime

Minister but if that were to fail I

would not seek to oppose leaving on

these terms well to make that quite

clear we've got to resolve this but that

then brings me to the amendment of my

right honourable

the member for West Dorset it is frankly

extraordinary that a government that

says it wants to follow a sensible

process then seeks to railroad that

process in a way that makes it likely

but proper debate will not take place

and to that I am profoundly i profoundly

object and for that reason I would

support that amendment and anybody in

this house who wants an orderly form of

brexit should do so as well

Mr Speaker I will be voting for the

amendment of the right honourable member

for West Dorset because it is an

insurance policy against no deal my

accident or wire design what is very

clear from the debate so far is this

that the deal the promises brought back

will give us less good access to our

biggest nearest and most important

market that we enjoy today and less good

access to the deal negotiated by the

former prime minister would have given

and I cannot understand why anyone

should regard that as something to be

celebrated cheered or recommended it is

no wonder the government does not want

to do an economic assessment because it

would show what the government's last

economic assessment shows and I thought

it's very striking as my right or my

friend in his typically forensic and

eloquent way told the house what it

would mean practice to watch the

euphoria that was evident on the benches

opposite earlier give way to cold

realization of what it will mean for the

businesses and industries that we

represent in our constituencies and I

simply ask the question mr. speaker why

would we want to undermine our future

economy investment opportunity and

potential in this way the second point I

want to make is about consent because

the Prime Minister was right in asking

us how are we going to heal the rift

that brexit has created if this deal is

defeated today it will be the fourth

time in which the house has been unable

to agree a way forward and I am the

first to admit that we cannot carry on

like this

we need to find a way forward and that

is why a way of doing so has been

offered in a very prescient intervention

a year ago by my honourable friends the

members for home and Sedgefield with

their compromise proposal and it is a

compromise because there is in politics

a division between those who advocate if

we can't get a deal we leave with no

deal and the other hand those who say

let's just cancel the result of the

referendum pretend it never happened now

I do not subscribe to either of those

views the compromise is to say there is

a way in which we can get this done and

achieve a decisions and that is by

asking the British people and at the

heart of that question is this do the

British people have the right to change

their minds now I fear that some people

who reject a referendum would cry no

they don't we had the one vote and

that's it I disagree with that view

because it is fundamental to our

democracy that when the facts change

events to change or time passes we

should have the opportunity to change

our minds if we wish I do not know what

the answer to that question is the only

people who know are the British people

and that is why I will vote for my

honorable friends amendment today

because I think we should ask the people

what they now want sodium cash I don't

say very simply and get it out of the

way straight away having given a great

deal of consideration to all the issues

that have been discussed over the last

few weeks and having had the opportunity

to discuss with ministers and the

number-10 in various other places and in

our groups and one thing in an hour and

I have come to the conclusion that we

must support this deal

I will I go further and say that one of

the reasons why I believe it is so

important and I say this with great

concern with respect for the DUP because

I know that there are elements about

this deal which are which do fall short

and I'm gonna say something else too and

that is that with regard to article 4 I

still regard that as a serious problem

but I am glad that the prime minister

has responded as he did today with a

personal assurance that he will ensure

in the bill when it comes that

parliamentary sovereignty will be

recognized notwithstanding I used the

word notwithstanding the provisions that

otherwise apply on through withdrawal

agreements in article 4 and furthermore

that he will also give us a guarantee

that we're vital interests of this

country are affected the European

scrutiny committee will continue to have

the opportunity to make sure that the

house has the opportunity to consider

and vote on questions which so arise I

wrote in large on that now because that

hasn't been entirely finalized the bill

has not been published but I do say that

there are signs of very great progress

in that regard because that is about the

principle of sovereignty and the

principle of consent if the Select

Committee procedures are followed along

the lines that I am proposing actually I

also believe that norges Allah will

benefit from that because they

themselves will be able to come into the

Commission proceedings and give evidence

with regards to the manner in which this

is operating through them and then the

matter could then if all goes well in

terms of the bill itself have the

obviously they will have the opportunity

to have a vote on that on the floor of

the house now I am sim

making that quite clear now because I

believe in the present circumstances

this is is a very very historic moment

well it is a moment which we have to

seize so then let's get out by the 31st

of October no second referendum no

revocation of article 15 get brexit they

are next have a general election and

let's sort this out once and for all I

want to say some words about the nature

of the deal before us and mr. speaker

this is all a question of whether or not

we should support this deal depends on

trust for the people of Northern Ireland

we have heard that they cannot trust

this deal from their representative

rather their representatives today this

could take us backwards not forwards in

Northern Ireland mr. speaker and we are

learning about the conservative and

unionist party that before long they

will be the party of only England they

are putting our union at risk for the

people of the GB Northern Ireland border

whether that birkenhead Holly had

Australia they cannot trust this deal

and the Conservative Party is becoming

only the party of the South of England

the people mr. speaker

although manufact of our manufacturing

terms we know that damage has been said

by evidence of Hankerson Francis O'Grady

of the T you see we know that damage

that this deal will do to our

manufacturing town in an inserted party

is becoming only the party of the South

East Home Counties the Conservatives we

want our exit the member for Ally gave

it away the ERG have decided so the

conservative party is becoming only the

party of the ERG and this is their deal

mr. speaker for the next generation they

cannot trust this deal on Environmental

Protection's and the protests we have

seen about climate change those voices

are not heard on freedom of movement and

on our rights at work generations of

trade unions cannot trust this deal now

we on the labour party ventures here we

are representatives not delegates but I

would challenge any Labour MP to

disagree with the delegates of any trade

union branch on in this country you

cannot trust this deal the Conservative

Party is making itself untrustworthy mr.

speaker because inspector instead of

rational policies it's made itself a

historical reenactment society seeking

to undo 40 years of progress true of

which they played a part but their

interpretation of our country's history

is untrustworthy and I want to mention

one lesson from our history when at the

full of the back of France the Polish

pilots who came to Britain to fight with

us called Britain Last Hope Island and

then as now solidarity in Europe not a

Britain that stands alone should be the

source of our hope that was true then

it's true now this deal is bad for

Britain and we should vote it down

dr. Liam Fox I first say I worried about

the amendment those who are thinking of

voting for this amendment tonight should

not do under the illusion that it will

take no deal off the table no deal

cannot be taken off the table we can ask

the EU for an extension the EU do not

need to grant an extension the only way

to take no deal off the table is to

accept the only deal

the Union mr. speaker there are three

reasons why I think we should vote in

favor of this deal today the first is

that it delivers on the referendum and

let's just go back to first principles

we made a contract with the people of

the United Kingdom using the two

elements of our Constitution direct

democracy which said to them we will not

I cannot make a decision therefore you

must take the decision and then using

representative democracy to say we the

House of Commons will determine how to

implement that decision that is what

we're being asked to do today it is our

duty to deliver on what we have promised

the British people if we want to

maintain faith in our electoral and

political system itself 80 percent of us

if only conservative and Labour benches

stood on a manifesto that specifically

said we would honour the result of the

referendum and it's not good enough to

say it's not good enough to say that you

actually favor a deal and then want to

vote down every single detail of every

single deal that has ever made the

public will regard it at best as

disingenuous when those then say to us

well let's have another referendum why

would any citizen of this country

looking at their Parliament that said

we've been asked to have a referendum

vote in a second referendum if we fail

to deliver on what we promised in the

first one is the question of faith in

our electoral system itself the second

reason is to speak of why we should

deliver all this is that gets us onto

the territory of our future relationship

itself three and a half years talking

about the divorce and almost no time

talking about the future relationship

there will be a great debate to be had

about the level of alignment we have

sector by sector with the European

economy that's why there is such a

strong case for having a general

election let's actually get out of here

okay

about what we believe in the future

relationship it also gives us the chance

to help shape global trade policy in an

independent trade policy at a time

global trade is slowing that and finally

it allows us to get on to other issues

so much of our political bandwidth has

been taken up by brexit that the public

feel that we no longer talk about the

issues that actually matter to them of

course there's no such thing as a

perfect deal I voted for the previous

deal three times with strong

reservations

and I've got strong reservations today

but it has come to the point where we

have to deliver on the contract that we

made with the people of Britain

and put together the sort of stupid

party political game keypad it would

actually do what we promised you mr.

speaker

we've reached the fork in the road we

must now choose so do we choose the

route that leads us to an

outward-looking confident nation

punching above its weight in a european

union battling for liberal values in a

world that is increasingly a liberal

isolationist and belligerent a course

which guarantees that EU citizens many

of whom have lived here since the 60s

and 70s won't have to worry about

proving they are entitled to health care

and provides their UK counterparts in

the EU who won't need to fret over what

action to take should be time limited

six months health care guaranteed by our

government expire or do we let ourselves

be led by colourful Pied Piper who chose

his path and this steal not out of any

conviction that his path was just

rational or economically beneficial for

our nation but because he believed it

was the most secure way of achieving his

own ambition but do we meekly follow a

man whose excellent deal according to

such government analysis as they've been

need being willing to make available

will leave at least we'll leave each

household at least 2,000 pounds worse

off and hit British jobs and living

standards with the ferocity of the

austerity triggered by the 2008 crash

this is a deal which as the Prime

Minister confirmed in May in his earlier

rather rambling a dissembling

contribution may not survive the

transition period and could still lead

to a No Deal crash out do we follow in

the footsteps of a man who just a month

ago to a rapturous dup gathering claim

the precious union was in good good

shape and a month later dealt the Union

a hammer blow which could shatter it

within the space of just a couple of

years

are we so afraid of our shadow and lucky

and confidence in our capacity to work

the EU system to our advantage as we

have successfully done for decades that

we have to fall back on a nostalgic

vision of empire and a buccaneering

Britain that is the choice in front of

us today I hope we will choose the

former path it would require one further

step of people's votes to give the

people the final say that would be the

Democratic way away supported by the

hundreds of thousands of people over

there in Parliament's square as we speak

that is the only way of stopping the

brexit rot in its tracks and putting

this issue to bed I would all I would

urge all members to follow that path and

vote the amendment and reject this

calamitous deal

Antoinette Sam back

I've always set out wanting to agree a

deal with the EU that delivers the

outcome of the referendum in the terms

of the 2017 manifest day that I stood

upon I fought against an undemocratic No

Deal and always voted for a deal in fact

I voted for a deal more times than the

Prime Minister made a deal militarized

in the Home Secretary the Foreign

Secretary the transport secretary and

the Environment Secretary combined

despite this I've had the Whitman moved

and those who voted down deal after deal

had been rewarded with jobs in the

cabinet I'd like to support this deal as

well but the government have been

sending mixed messages whilst ministers

at the despatch-box say they want a deal

anonymous numbered ten sources insists

that they'll break the law and deliver

No Deal arrogant to this and the

government Janus like ability to face in

both directions I cannot support the

government without assurances those

assurances come in the form of the

amendment in the name of my right

honourable friend the member for West

Dorset this will ensure that the

government and the members of my former

party stick to their promises it will

also ensure that there's enough time to

scrutinize the what the withdrawal

agreement bill which will likely remain

a mammoth piece of legislation the house

may notice that I'm saying very little

about the content of the deal I was

always taught that if you have nothing

nice to say say nothing suffice it to

say it is substantially worse than the

deal negotiated by the right honourable

member for Maidenhead and perhaps this

still sole merit is to cast her

redoubtable negotiating efforts in a

more positive light and it is a great

shame that opposition members of

parliament did not vote for that deal in

indeed the foreign secretary let the cat

out of the bag yesterday when he said

that this was a cracking deal for

Northern Ireland because it will keep

frictionless access to the single market

my residents and businesses in Cheshire

would like that frictionless

market and if it's such a great deal for

Northern Ireland why can't my

constituents have it - I will smack the

deal subject to the reassurance of the

amendment but I don't like the deal and

given the choice of a dodgy deal or

remain I suspect many constituents would

opt to their latter and as such if I get

an opportunity to vote on an amendment

in in respect of the people's vote I

would vote for that the manager know

she's not in her place that make her

pablo didn't intend any discourtesy to

the Honorable lady and a Sabri it was to

speak on June the 26th in 2016 we had a

referendum which was in effect a

snapshot on a single day a distorted

photograph was obtained it was distorted

by false images it was distorted by fix

on the bus by fake promises of getting

an easy quick deal that would convey all

the benefits of the free trade that our

country has enjoyed for so many Europe

years as a member of the European Union

it was given and it was created by

preying on people's fears and fuelling

their prejudices at the same time three

and a half years later we now at least

have some clarity on two occasions this

government has negotiated a deal with

the European Union now I think that the

Honourable lady has just said that this

is indeed a very bad deal for all the

really good reasons that so many

honorable and right honourable members

have said this place remains divided and

the answer is not yet another general

election the last general election

didn't help us it didn't solve anything

it is several honest

only way now to solve this matter is to

get it back where it began in effect

which is to the people to put that deal

to a confirmatory referendum mr. speaker

people are entitled to change their

minds as the evidence changes and they

now see with clarity what brexit is all

about and I own people who weren't able

to vote in 2016 they surely must now

have the right to be a part and to

determine their own futures given that

so many of them will be affected now I

don't have about Tyler will be so

affected by brexit and its right to that

everybody now that we know what it looks

like and this deal by goodness is such a

bad deal it's bad for the Union it's bad

for job and he undoubtedly opens a back

door to the No Deal

that certain members of the Conservative

Party undoubtedly one and I gently say

to honorable a right all of my

colleagues opposite how they can sit

there claiming to be unionists and to

vote for this field defies belief mr.

speaker what we need is that people's

vote and that's why over a million

people today have come to London let's

get it back to the British people let's

get Brits it done but by way of taking

it back for that confirmatory referendum

no Rebecca long Bailey

mr. speaker and I want to thank all

members of this house for their

passionate contributions today and I'd

like to thank the chancellor for the

Duchy of Lancaster for sharing his mints

earlier with the shadow punch bent but

that's where my Joe reality and sadly

because today is a historic day it's a

daily on which less than 650 people sat

here now will agonize over whether they

are about to make the right choice for

their communities industries and future

generations and today they asked

themselves is what is before us today

truly a deal which protects and enhances

their communities and sadly the simple

and Eric irreconcilable truth is that it

does not and as the shadow Secretary of

State responsible for business energy

and industrial strategy I want to make

it clear to this house if agreed this

deal would be a disaster for this

country and we must reject it mr.

speaker our workers rights

we simply cannot trust what the Prime

Minister is saying they say this deal

protects workers yet instead of

strengthening protections they have

specifically changed the legally binding

withdrawal agreement to remove any

commitments on workers rights and I

think it tells us something but not a

single trade union in this country not a

single one but this deal the tea you see

say and I quote this would be a disaster

for working people unison have said it

would risk every workplace right and

leave public services exposed and

vulnerable while unites a by further

diluting the legal protections for labor

and environmental standards the Prime

Minister has made the laws that underpin

workers rights and public safety

extremely vulnerable in future trade

deals Mr Speaker I could go on but we

should also look at the business case

please forgive me for not giving way

were extremely pushed for time

does this deal mean for business project

simply for business for our industries

and our manufacturing it reduces access

to the markets of our biggest trade

partner threatening jobs opened down our

country at a time when more investment

is needed not less there is no economic

impact assessment and no accompanying

legal advice only that I wonder why

because according to the Guardian

Britain is uncaused to sacrifice as much

as a hundred and thirty billion in lost

GDP growth over the next 15 years if the

forensic deal goes ahead and industry's

been clear on this it needs that market

access

it needs a customs union to keep vital

supply chains flowing yet this deal

sells them out no barrier free access no

customs union instead it was the fantasy

of chasing damaging trade deals with

Donald Trump over the needs of our

country again mr. speaker you don't have

to take my word for it make UK who

represent British manufacturing our

clear commitments to the closest

possible trading relationship in gaad's

have gone and that mr. speaker this deal

will add cost and bureaucracy and our

companies will face a lack of clarity

inhibiting investment and planning even

the CBI have added the deal remains

inadequate on services and that they

have now serious concerns about the

direction of the future UK EU

relationship so this is a bad deal for

industry a bad deal for manufacturing

and more importantly a bad deal for jobs

for mr. speaker let's look at what this

deal will mean for the environment let's

see what green groups are saying about a

greener UK for instance they raise you

order there is an excessive noise in the

chamber it's very unfair on the

Honourable lady who's developing her

contribution let's listen to each other

courteously Rebecca long Baily

- speaker greener UK for instance

they've raised huge concern saying

environmental safeguards are absent from

the new withdrawal agreement and that

the toothless environment bill put

forward by the government and I quote

provides neither an enforcement body

with independence nor a commitment to

non-aggression in domestic law all at a

time when we are facing a climate crisis

across the world this is simply not

acceptable and mr. speaker this

government is asking us to simply trust

them on all these issues quite tellingly

without setting out any detail or

legislation today the Prime Minister

says nobody in his government wants to

reduce rights or standards in this

country well that is a remarkable

statement especially when you look at

their track record how could we trust

them

well members on the opposite ventures

can cheer all they like but how can we

trust and Secretary of State for

business energy and industrial strategy

when she has made clear that the small

businesses she and Visitor's they're

being and I quote no regulation

whatsoever no minimum wage no maternity

or paternity rights no unfair dismissal

rights no pension mics how can we trust

the foreign secretary who wrote a

pamphlet called escaping the

straitjacket which outlined his plans to

cut workers rights and regulations and

how can we trust the Prime Minister

himself who has said the UK should scrap

the social chapter and has claimed the

current weight of employment regulation

is back-breaking mr. speaker the answer

is we can't trust them if their

intentions were to maintain current

standards that why have they flushed

every level playing field commitment in

the withdrawal agreement so Mr Speaker

we are about to make history and in the

final moments before we enter those

lobbies MPs will consider the weight

placed upon their shoulders is this deal

rights for their communities industries

and future generations no it isn't

agreeing this deal doesn't get brexit

done instead it would sell out our

country and sell out our communities

leaving us open to an onslaught

deregulation reduction of Rights putting

jobs at risk and it's something no

Labour MP nor any other MP worries about

protecting

they could ever support even a go

service if I could go

[Applause]

mr. speaker our democracy is a precious

thing and this Parliament is a special

place our democracy depends on respect

for difference and this Parliament

thrives on respecting the sincerity and

the commitment to public service of

every member and that is why I know that

deciding how to vote today for many

members will have been difficult and it

is important that all of us recognize

that for those who argued to remain and

still argue that that is the best

outcome they do so as Patriots but they

take a different view from some of us

and for those who argue to leave and

have consistently argued that we should

leave and have argued for a better deal

we should all recognize that they are

arguing for what they believe is best

for our country I respect those who have

argued for both positions but I respect

most of all the many people in this

house who argued that we should remain

who during the course of that campaign

believe that is the best course for the

country but who now recognize that the

people having spoken that verdict must

be respected

and that is quite not yet not yet and

that not yet and that is why in a debate

characterized by many brilliant and

passionate speeches the speech that

stood out for me was the speech by my

right honourable friends the member for

may tonight

she argued for remain but she also

recognized that when the people had

spoken their verdict had to be respected

and it is not just on our benches it is

on every bench members like the member

for great Grimsby or the member for Don

Valley or for other Valley they all

argued that we should remain but now

they recognize that there is something

more precious than being a lever or a

remainer

that is being a Democrat

what unites us in this house is that we

are Democrats and we voted we voted in

this House of Commons to have a

referendum we voted in this House of

Commons to say that we would respect the

verdict of the people we voted

overwhelmingly for article 50 which

honored that referendum and said that we

would leave how will it look to those

who sent us here now if we say to them

we made those sacred promises but now we

choose to dishonor them it is the case

it is the case I know it is the case I

know that there will be individuals who

are know who will have specific qualms

and concerns about this deal and they

exist all across this house but it is

also the case it is also the case that

the time has come for us to decide none

of us none of us in a country that voted

52 48 none of us in a house of 650

members none of us in a country of 65

million people can ensure that we have

our own perfect brexit no but what we

can do what we can do is we can be

prepared to put aside our perfect for

the sake of the common good and that is

what the public want us to do now

in in in his speech the the member knew

I went in his speech the member for

Holborn and some Pancras laid out some

of the concerns that he has about the

political declaration but he knows and

we know that if we vote today for the

deal if we vote for this withdrawal

agreement we can then move on to ensure

that the future economic partnership

that we all want can be framed in the

best interests of the British people and

we have given I shall give $80 gentlemen

but I'm grateful for his persistence

[Applause]

we can ensure order the Chancellor the

Duchy is not currently giving way mr.

Michel go thank you thank you very much

with Speaker Joe and during that

discussion about our future economic

partnership will every party in this

house every voice in this house will

have equal weight and equal value and

making sure that we can deliver a brexit

deal that delivers for the 52 and for

the 48 is our intention and let me be

clear we on this side of house know I

shan't and no I won't however no however

however tempting it might be I will

decline on this case

another truth is because no deal can

ever satisfy anyone we could spend all

our time searching for that elusive

perfect deal but what would that

position look like to the country what

would it look like to all those who have

sent us here what would it look like to

the Honorable ladies constituents who

voted to leave and expected that votes

to be honored they voted to put trust in

this place to put trust in Parliament to

make a vital decision if we ducked that

decision if we did there if we delay

that I'm afraid that people will feel a

sense of depression and dismay and

demoralisation that the Parliament that

they hoped would keep its promises has

chosen once again to duck its

responsibilities

now I am I am clear Olsen that everyone

who has spoken in this debate has spoken

for the best of motives including my

right honourable friend the member for

West Dorset a dear and old friend of

mine but one of the things that I would

say one of the things that I would say

to him and to others and all that

[Applause]

Thank You mr. speaker it's the chance of

a giveaway everybody has their beliefs

and everybody does what they believe is

right including our own will friend the

member of West Dorset if the bill that

follows the meaningful vote were to fail

how would the government avoid No Deal

before the end of October oh so the

virtue one of the things that this

government is absolutely committed to

doing is making sure that we have a deal

among other things that were also

committed to doing is making sure that

we obey the law a lot of things that

we're also committed to doing is making

sure that we respect to the voices of

all of those in this house let me stay

firmly from this despatch-box

this government is committed to ensuring

that we have a deal and the best way the

best way of getting that deal leaving on

October the 31st and being able to move

on to the other issues which the people

in this country want us to discuss is by

accepting the Honorable motives of the

mover of the amendment but recognizing

also that if we accept that amendment we

will not have a meaningful vote today we

will not unlock the door to our deal

being passed we will have voted I'm

afraid in the terms of that motion for

more delay and I'm afraid and I'm afraid

on that basis I would urge everyone who

wants us know who wants us to honor the

referendum mandate to recognize that

that amendment however sincerely it's

being put is unnecessary what is

necessary now is for us to reach a

moment of decision in the in the other

place law judge the leader of the cross

bench peers in some respects the voice

of moderation in that house explicitly

said that the time is passed for people

to quibble and question the precise

terms of this deal he said a former Lord

Chief Justice the parliament needs to

get on with it otherwise there will be

profound damage to public confidence in

this place

[Music]

and that that is the question that every

member of the house must ask how will

our constituents feel if tonight we vote

to support this deal without the

amendment our constituents will feel

that a cloud has been lifted

Holloman

has listened to them with respect that

the vote in 2016 that we promised to

honor has after three and a half years

of deadlock and division been honored by

a house that at last is ready to unite

and that is the toys that faceis is all

because if we don't vote for this deal

unamended

then I'm afraid that all of the all of

those who send us here watching our

deliberations will say that Parliament

has failed to meet the moments

Parliament has failed to rise to the

occasion Parliament has failed to ensure

that an important democratic vote the

most important vote was the greatest

number of votes cost for any proposition

on our history will be delayed will be

dishonored and will not be delivered and

that is why I urge everyone in this

house to recognize our first duty

[Applause]

our first duty is to the principle that

underpins this place said no the right

honorable general is responding to the

baton he will do sooo to a conclusion is

smuggled a our first duty to our

constituents and to our country is to

keep our promises this house said that

we would honor that referendum mandate

the time has come and the question that

all of us must answer when we return to

our constituencies is did you vote to

break the deadlock did you vote to end

the division of these days did you vote

to bring the country together

[Music]

who supports the government is after me

to do just that

[Applause]

to move the questions well I am indeed

posing the questions I'm extremely

grateful the question is that amendment

a be made as many as are that have been

in say I of the country no

[Applause]

elevate

[Music]

[Music]

YouTube but the question is that

amendment a be made as many as our third

opinion say aye

of the country now tellers for the eyes

Sangam debonair and Matt Weston tellers

for the nose mr. Stuart

Andrew and mr. Ian Stuart

lock the doors

[Music]

Oh

[Applause]

Oh

[Applause]

a lot of feet down the eyes to the right

322 the nose to the left

306

[Applause]

the eyes to the right 322 the nose to

the left 306 so the eyes have it the

eyes have it unlock the question is

colleagues that the motion as amended be

agreed to us when his other ability I

love the country now I think the eyes

have it the eyes have it but we now come

to motion number two our man now celeb

selected the manuscript amendment to the

name of Peter Karl and others minister

or whip on duty did not formally not

moved thank you order order the Prime

Minister speaker thank you

[Applause]

I'm very grateful to you I'm very

grateful to everybody the House of

Commons staff everybody who's put

themselves out everybody who's come to

give up their time in this debate today

it's been a very important debate and

exceptional moment for our country

except a moment for our Parliament alas

the opportunity to have a meaningful

vote has effectively been passed up

because the meaningful vote has been

voided of meaning but I wish the house

to know that I'm not daunted or dismayed

by this particular result it probably

became likely once it was obvious that

the amendment from me my right

honourable friend the member of West

Dorset was going to remain on the order

paper I continued in the very strong

belief that the best thing for the UK

and for the whole of Europe is for us to

leave with this new deal on October to

anticipate the questions that are coming

from The Adventures of it I will not

negotiate a delay with the EU

and neither does the law compel me to do

so I will tell our friends and

colleagues in the EU exactly what I have

told everyone in the last 88 days that

I've served as Prime Minister but

further delay would be bad for this

country and bad for democracy so next

week the government will introduce the

legislation needed for us to leave the

EU with our new deal on October the

30-person I hope I hope that our

European Union colleagues and friends

will not be attracted as benches

opposite are or rather I should say the

front bench is by delay I don't think

that they will be attracted by the way

and I hope that then honourable members

faced with a choice of our new deal our

new deal for the UK and the European

Union will change their minds because it

was pretty close today I hope that they

will change I hope that they will change

their minds and support this deal in

overwhelming numbers since I became

Prime Minister I've said we must get on

and get brexit done on October the 31st

so that this country can move on mr.

speaker that policy that policy remains

unchanged no delays and I will continue

to do all I can to get brexit done on

October the 31st and I continue to

commend this excellent deal mr. speaker

to the house

[Applause]

or in the water mr. Jeremy Corbyn Thank

You mr. speaker

I welcome today's vote Parliament has

clearly spoken or dare order apologies

the Prime Minister was heard yes he was

don't argue the toss with the chair I'm

telling you what the situation is and

everybody could detect the Prime

Minister was heard and the leader of the

Opposition will be heard it is a simple

and unarguable as that Jeremy Corbyn

give us the speaker I welcome today's

vote it's an emphatic decision by this

house that has declined to back the

Prime Minister's deal today

and clearly voted to stop a No Deal

crash out from the European Union the

Prime Minister must now comply with the

law he can no longer use the threat of a

no deal crash out to blackmail members

to support his sellout deal labour is

not prepared to sell out the communities

that we represent we're not prepared to

sell out their future

and we believe that ultimately the

people must have the final say on brexit

which actually only the Labour Party is

offering today is a historic day for

Parliament because it said it will not

be blackmailed by a prime minister who

is apparently prepared once again to

defy a law passed by this Parliament I

invite him to think very carefully about

the remarks he just made about refusing

apparently to apply for the extension

which the EU number-two act requires him

to do

point of order mr. Ian Blackbird Thank

You mr. speaker I'm most grateful I

think all of us in this house are aware

of the responsibilities that we have

this is a crisis that we are in and I'm

thankful that the house has voted the

way it has done on the amendment this

afternoon that is a clear expression

from this house that we cannot crash out

on the 31st of October Mr Speaker I want

to ask you what we can do to make sure

that the Prime Minister respects the law

of the land

that the Prime Minister respects the

been act and sends a letter to the

European Council seeking that extension

and I wonder what we can do to make sure

that the government does not bring

forward a bill until that extension as

has been instructed is delivered upon

and any failure of a prime minister who

thinks is above the law

well Prime Minister you'll find yourself

in court

I don't mean it in any spirit of

discourtesy to the right honourable

gentleman but I think his contribution

was rhetorical in the sense that I don't

think he was particularly inviting my

immediate response if he was doing so I

would say to him that I think judicious

consideration of these matters is always

beneficial to colleagues across the

house everybody of course must abide by

the law the right honourable gentleman

is versatile dexterous and experienced

in the use of the parliamentary weaponry

to try to ensure that his point of view

prevails so we'll leave it there for now

point of order J Swenson Thank You mr.

speaker the prime ministers deal would a

bad deal and the public deserve to have

the final say not just the hundreds of

thousands

people across our country recognize

there are very strongly held views on

both sides of the house on both sides of

this debate but the leader of the

Liberal Democrats must be heard and it

is unconscionable if there is an attempt

to stop someone being heard Joe Swinson

Thank You mr. speaker and the people who

are outside this building right now will

be heard and they deserve the final say

along with millions across the country

to the most urgent thing right now mr.

speaker is that the Prime Minister

complies with the law and I ask your

guidance would it be possible to suspend

the sitting for a short time to allow

the Prime Minister to go and send his

letter and come back and make a

statement to confirm

I'm grateful to the honorable lady

it is not order it is not my intention

to suspend the city the point will have

been heard by the Prime Minister I say

to the Honourable lady all sorts of

things are possible but as to what is

judged appropriate at this time

I think the puckish grin on the contours

of the Honourable lady's face suggests

that she was making a point but not

expecting such a decision I'm grateful

to of course I will come to the earth

now in momentarily of course I will come

to the honourable gentleman a point of

order Sir Oliver let way and mr. speaker

Mr Speaker I want to say first of all to

the Prime Minister that I actually

agreed with what he said at the end

there and that I am absolutely certain

he will comply with the law I want to

say to friends and colleagues across the

house who helped us achieve this

amendment which I believe to be profound

in the national interest if I'm very

grateful for that to cooperate the wrong

ways are now they depart because for

many of us on these benches who have

cooperated in preventing a No Deal exit

by putting in place we're helping to put

in place that then act and help me to

keep it it's insurance policy in place

today

now when the Prime Minister brings the

withdrawal implementation bill to the

House of Commons we will be voting for

it we will continue to vote for it we

will seek to ensure that it becomes the

law before the 31st of October and if it

does so become the law this country will

leave on the 31st of October of hope

that I share with the Prime Minister but

it will do so on the basis of knowing

that should anything go wrong we will

not crash out without a deal on that day

I'm most grateful to the right honorable

judgment and say well many members of

the house for the clarity of his

exposition well people take their own

view of it but it's certainly clear and

very pithy and I'm grateful to the right

honourable gentleman the point of order

mr. Nigel dogs okay this this decision

now will give further time for detailed

consideration of the bill when it comes

forward it will also give an opportunity

to consider in detail whatever

amendments come forward it has the

effect of not approving this deal today

and of course we will examine all the

details of the bill and all amendments

in the light of our overriding concern

about the constitutional economic

integrity of the Union that is our

priority

it will remain our priority in the days

ahead and that is the basis on which we

will now proceed in a timely and

sensible manner our proceeding I hope

the honorable gentlemen take it in the

right spirit if having known him for

every 20 years I say that I feel that

our proceedings would not be complete

without a point of order from the

Honorable gentleman member of a stone

the chair of the European scrutiny

well somebody somebody is suggesting a

division but I will not allow a division

on that matter point of arrest William

cache there is much talk about the law

of the land the law of the lands it

stands at this moment in time is quite

simple section one of the withdrawal

that 2018 categoric two states that the

European communities act is repealed on

exit day versus the 31st of October just

in case anyone can't read who is

grateful and until the house will be

indebted to the Honorable gentleman

where is legal exegesis and there are

other views on that matter but the

Honorable gentleman has registered his

with his customary force

my point of order Johanna cherry speaker

if members were leaving the chamber I

understand the disappointment of the

Honorable and learning lady but I cannot

compel members to remain I cannot to

coin the phrase take anybody hostage I

do not have the power to incarcerate so

I'm trying to be helpful to the

Honorable and leaded lady I'm playing

for time I'm playing for time if members

who quite unaccountably do not wish to

listen to the Honorable and learning

lady would leave the chamber quickly and

quietly the rest of us including

assuredly the chair wishing to hear the

Honorable lady can do so I think people

are gradually beetling out of the

chamber if the chair of the education

select committee feels that he can be

fill out and conduct his conversation

outside that will be very greatly

appreciated by the chair thank you point

of order add your honor Jenny

[Applause]

thank you for your indulgence viewers in

Scotland are accustomed to the sight of

the Tory benches emptying when speaker's

every members of Parliament's

representative Scottish seats go up and

I'm very much looking forward to seeing

that in the SNP party political

broadcasts in the soon to come general

election but Mr Speaker the point I want

to make is an important one the Prime

Minister has failed to secure an

approval of the withdrawal agreement

today in terms of the been act and that

means that under the law of this land he

should be retreating to number 10 to pen

a letter to the European Union in terms

of the act and in terms of the

undertakings as so described by the

Secretary of State Frankston European

Union the undertakings that he gave to

the Scottish Court fortunately mr.

speaker were back in court on Monday

morning and it will be possible then to

secure the courts assistance if the

Prime Minister has floated the law and

the promises he gave to the courts but

Mr Speaker can I ask this shoot the

Scots shoot Scotland's supreme court

mandate you to sign the letter required

by the act on behalf of this Parliament

will you do so thank you I'm grateful to

the Honourable unmarried lady I have no

expectation of being so asked and

moreover I have no aspirations to the

exalted status that would have been

attained by a person so requested or

indeed directed by the court but the

short outs of the honourable and

learning lady is that if I were

instructed by this house I would do as

instructed and if I were directing or

instructed by a court I would do as

directed that is my instinctive reaction

I would of course seek further and meta

particulars I would take advice but I

repeat I haven't been asked I'm not

expecting to be asked I'm not looking to

be asked but I would do as I was

required to do and I

and have no hesitation in so doing yes

yes indeed

point of order Caroline Lucas very much

mr. speaker I welcome the vote on this

amendment because it shows that a

majority of this house has stood up for

more democracy not less they've stood up

for more slit food for more scrutiny not

less and they have also voted to rule

out a disastrous No Deal but I believe

it will also give us a chance mr.

speaker to let the people have a final

say as they're demanding outside here

now over a million of them demanding

that right the Prime Minister has

changed his own mind

more times than we can possibly count

most recently on the issue of the border

in the Irish Sea it cannot be right that

the British people are the only ones

were not allowed to change their minds

and I look forward to the opportunity

that with a sponge affords us to come

back to put whatever deal is in front of

us to that confirmatory ballot a point

of order I say to her publicly what I

said to her privately that I'm sorry

that on account of constraints of time

and the desire to bring matters to a

conclusion I was not able to call her

today in the debate that she has at

least had a mini speech in the form of

her point of order and I know that no

power on earth would or should stop the

Honourable lady contributing frequently

on future occasions and I certainly look

forward to that yes very very well point

of order mr. Behrman coker mr. speaker

is there any power that you have to

enable this house and indeed the public

to properly understand what the Prime

Minister has actually just said to us

according to the law passed by this

house if the deal will no deal is not

agreed then there is a letter attached

that acts which the Prime Minister is

required to send today the 19th of

October now it may be my

misunderstanding mr. speaker but I have

no idea from what the prime minister

said as to whether he's actually going

to write and sign that letter or whether

he's not going to do that if he's not

going to do it is the speaker that means

he's not part of complying with the law

that has been passed by this House of

Commons any of our can stitch

who don't comply with the law face the

consequences is there anything that we

can do to properly understand whether

the Prime Minister intends to comply

with the legislation and send a letter

or whether he's simply going to ignore

it thing and I'm not a lawyer I say that

is metal some very considerable pride is

that the legal position is clear and I

did dissent from what the Honorable

gentleman has just said about the legal

position that ministers have made and I

say this quite neutral a number of

statements about adherence to or

compliance with the so called been out

those statements haven't always been

immediately and obviously compatible

with each other I think we have to await

the development of events in general

terms it is of course true to say that

ministers have emphasised their

commitment to observe the law including

the prime minister has said that on a

number of occasions it is also true that

the Prime Minister has indicated that he

is not willing to seek an extension my

understanding of the legal position is

the same as that of the honourable

gentleman I think that we must await the

development of events the honourable and

learning lady from the Scottish National

Party raised a similar concern about

this matter it has now been echoed by

the Honourable gentleman further

enlightenment may follow when the leader

of the house uncoils when he uncoils

and addresses us from the despatch-box I

don't know I'm not psychic we shall see

but what I would say is I think that

matters are coming to a conclusion today

but the house will sit on Monday and I

act confidently anticipate that the

Honourable gentleman will be in his

place and ready to leap to his feet with

alacrity to advance his point of view

and that of others

the unknown gentleman walks room is

shaking his head in a mildly eccentric

manner not at me well we're deeply

grateful I wasn't looking to call Leon

or gem brother if he particularly wanted

to raise the point of order and

especially as he used to be my

constituent it far be it from me to deny

him not today okay fair enough

I think a point of order the leader of

the house point of order mr. Jacob Riis

mark Thank You mr. speaker

in the light of today's decision I

should like to inform the house that

Monday's business will now be a debate

on a motion relating to section 13 1b of

the European Union withdrawal Act 2018

and I shall make a further business

statement on Monday the well I note what

the leader has said and we will hear

what others have to say and a point of

order and that's been done by the

Honorable gentleman on a point of order

on a point of order the shadow leader of

the House battery dies can I thank the

leader for making that point of order

and in response would like to ask him

through you mr. speaker why we are

having a rerun of the vote if that's not

the case could the bill be published and

could the bill be debated in an orderly

way and thirdly how does courteous is

this to Her Majesty the Queen when we

are still debating the Queen's Speech

when are we
