Trudeau's reelection campaign thrown

into chaos in the US the Justin Trudeau

story dominated every network even

nudging Donald Trump out of the

headlines how much of an impact could

this game they'll have on Trudeau's

chances well it's going to have a big

impact Justin Trudeau has apologized

overseas that prompted discussion and

debate so should our public figures be

held to account for mistakes in their

past why would he not have known at age

29 that this was an offensive thing to

do the photos have been splashed far and

wide from the New York Times to

Britain's Guardian American reports

compared Trudeau to the governor of

Virginia who too was caught up in a

scandal involving a yearbook photo and

blackface for many this offensive photo

of one of the world's most powerful

leaders likely comes as a surprise and a

disappointment in almost every instance

the coverage portrays a sense of shock

and images that don't fit with what the

world has believed it knows of the

Canadian prime minister who is this guy

you know is he is he really is Canada's

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Trudeau

has long been a source of international

media fascination especially in the u.s.

often portrayed as more of a celebrity

than a world leader days were devoted to

his supposed bromance with former

President Barack Obama but that shine

has apparently worn off a stunning fall

from grace racist happened dessert as as

late as 2001 which is pretty modern

times what's clear is that an audience

watching from afar has the same

questions as many Canadians how why and

what happens next it's hard to say how

all this will impact next month's

Canadian election but Trudeau is already

struggling in the polls
