ladies and gentlemen the new year has

began with our world in turmoil we are

living in dangerous times a lot has

happened between the u.s. and Iran since

the beginning of 2020 and the conflict

has continued to escalate the recent

spike in tensions followed the targeted

killing of Iran's most powerful military

general Qasem Soleimani a US drone

strike killed Soleimani as he left

Baghdad International Airport President

Donald Trump said the general has killed

or badly wounded thousands of Americans

and was plotting to kill many more the

attack also killed two members of the

popular mobilization forces including

its deputy commander thousands of people

came out the next day in Baghdad for

soleimani funeral procession Trump

warned Iran that if it retaliates the US

will target cultural Iranian sites and

it will be hit very fast and very hard

Iranian diplomats javad zarif responded

by saying that targeting cultural sites

is a war crime Iran then says it will no

longer follow the limits within its 2015

nuclear deal world leaders on gala

Merkel Emmanuel macron and Boris Johnson

released a joint statement about the

conflict calling on everyone involved to

exercise utmost restraint in the US

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Saudi

Arabia's defense minister met in

Washington to discuss how to maintain

peace in the region and the American

defense secretary said the country has

no plans to pull its troops out of Iraq

meanwhile people flood the streets of

Tehran to mourn Soleimani and in his

home city of Kerman more than a million

people showed up for Soleimani funeral

there was a stampede more than 50 people

were reported dead and more than 200

people were hurt the general was buried

later on and because of safety concerns

Canada Germany and other allies say they

want to pull out some of their troops

stationed in Iraq the next day Iran

struck back against the u.s. launching

missile attacks on two military bases

used by us-led forces in Iraq the same

day in a seemingly unrelated incident

ukrainian International Airlines flight

ps7

to crash near iran's capitol shortly

after takeoff all 176 people on board

the flight to kiev were killed including

at least 63 canadians soon after leaders

from the US and iran reacted to the

attacks on the military bases now the

issue of vengeance or retaliations

different issue well we just gave them a

slap in the face as long as I'm

president of the United States Iran will

never be allowed to have a nuclear

weapon I'm pleased to inform you the

American people should be extremely

grateful and happy no Americans were

harmed in last night's attack by the

Iranian regime then came more reports

about the plane crash in Iran suggesting

US officials are confident Iran shot

down the Ukrainian Airlines flight well

I have my suspicions somebody could have

made a mistake on the other side it was

flying in a pretty rough neighborhood

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

confirmed his government has new

information showing the plane may have

been shot down the evidence indicates

that the plane was shot down by an

Iranian surface-to-air missile this may

well have been unintentional this new

information reinforces the need for a

thorough investigation into this matter
