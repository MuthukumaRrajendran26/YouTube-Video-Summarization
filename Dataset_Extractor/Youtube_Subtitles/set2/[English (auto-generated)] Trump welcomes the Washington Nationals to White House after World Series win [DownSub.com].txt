the White House so congratulations

today the first lady and I are thrilled

to welcome to the White House the 2019

World Series champions the Washington

Nationals for the first time in nearly

100 years our nation's capitol is

celebrating a World Series victory

that's big stuff the last time

Washington DC was home to the World

Series champs the president was a

gentleman named Calvin Coolidge that's a

long time ago nearly a century later the

Nationals have brought back the trophy

to America's capital and you've won it

this is the first World Series in

franchise history and it's going to be

really the first of many

I predict I want to congratulate the

terrific owners of the team your

principal owner Mark Lerner Ted Lerner

great people the Lerner family a man who

has become very famous I think he's much

more famous than me right now general

manager Mike Rizzo you have become

a manager and you watch all the mistakes

made in baseball and other sports and

then you watch what this man did his

manager he didn't make any he didn't

make any Dave Martinez and all of the

incredible coaches and players they're

all here and we really just want to

thank you and I want to thank everybody

you have some very special people and

that beautiful that's a beautiful trophy

I've watched that I've looked at that

trophy for a long time for a long time

I've admired it many years we're also

delighted to be joined by the thousands

of proud Nats fans including secretary

David Bernhardt secretary Alex SR acting

secretary Kevin McHale inin

administrator Andrew wheeler ambassador

Robert light Heiser many many folks from

Congress are in the audience

senators and everybody you're all here

we love you all and we have a good

friend of mine bill Posey representative

Bill Posey you're here someplace

thank you all for being here a lot of

power sitting on this lawn and standing

on this lawn throughout this season the

Nationals captured the hearts of

baseball fans across the region and

across the country America fell in love

with the Nats baseball they just fell in

love with that space ball that's all

they wanted to talk about that and

impeachment

I like that space ball much more you

worked every count hustled for every

base you fought for every run and

produced a comeback story for the ages

never happened like what happened with

the Nats and that means a lot of good

decisions were made you reminded us all

why baseball is truly America's pastime

so great for the sport nearly two months

into the season the Nats had a 19 and 31

record and I watch it closely too I

wasn't too happy it looked like things

weren't going so well Mike Wright but

these two guys they didn't give up they

didn't give up and I'm sure that

everybody was I'm sure the media was

with you all the way right I remember

some nasty stories boy did that change

pretty quickly right that's great but

you were second to last in the National

League and it looked like it was going

to be a rough year but you never doubted

as pitcher Max Scherzer and boy did he

pitch well what a job I've watched you

for a long time nobody nobody throws it

better than you do what a great job you

did max think under pressure as well

under pressure as well but you know max

said we have the experience we don't

fold under pressure which puts more

pressure on the team but that's one of

those things right and that's exactly

what happened you didn't fold under

pressure from then on the Nationals won

two games for every loss which is a

tremendous percentage winning percentage

as you battled for every win Gerardo

Parra changed his walk up song to baby

shark

that was a favorite of his two-year-old

daughter and it became the anthem for

the Nats fans everywhere and I tell you

what that turned out to be a very very

powerful little tune in the final weeks

of the regular season

you were down six runs against the Mets

in the bottom of the ninth you scored

seven runs I do remember that well

including an amazing three-run homer by

Kurt Suzuki where's Kurt come in say a

couple words come on I love you all I

love you all thank you

[Applause]

what a job he did I didn't know that was

gonna happen

and by the way max will you come over

here please come

I asked the first lady do you think I

can throw a ball as fast as him she said

yes darling absolutely I don't think so

my gosh to be in this moment with

everybody cheering him further to being

at the White House what a month what a

magical month and what when the city

gets behind you and your teammates

believe in each other and you have one

through 25 on the roster competing magic

happened and what a day to be able to

share it all with you so you beat the

Mets in the bottom of the ninth you

score that 7 runs including the amazing

three-run homer by Curt and the Nats as

always they lived up to a motto it's

stay in the fight that's true about life

stay in the fight you never know what's

gonna happen stay in there soon you

began a legendary postseason run against

the best teams and top bases in baseball

everybody thought it was over because it

was almost like Mike you were just going

against all of the good teams Dave it

was sort of an incredible thing and then

Josh had her then Clayton Kershaw to

Justin Verlander and Garrett called you

know those names right there really good

all right pretty good pictures right

back and you took care of it you took

care of things pretty incredible you

prevailed in five elimination games and

you were pitching you were really facing

the best pitchers in baseball the

absolute top and you trailed in every

single game every single one of those

games you were trailing and executed

four of your comebacks in the seventh

inning which I guess is a lucky inning

maybe and seventh inning and then in a

couple of cases later was a team effort

players 1 through 25 gave every single

thing they had they gave their heart

they never quit they never gave up they

gave their heart

at the wild card game it's such an

incredible story at the wild card game

you were down by two runs in the eighth

with bases loaded and two outs

that's when breakout star Juan Soto come

here one look at his head of hair he's

got no hair problem I want to tell you I

mean I just want to thanks everybody

here all the support you've been doing

it for us for the whole team I think you

bring the energy we need to win this

team and we're here we love you all

thank you fantastic job one but Juan

brought in three runs to win the game we

all remember that one by the end of the

postseason Juan became the youngest

player ever to hit three home runs in

the World Series that's fantastic great

job in the division series you were down

against the Dodgers late in the final

game but with your relentless old-school

style of play the Nationals sent the

game to extra innings I was incredible

with the bases loaded in the 10th Howie

Kendrick hit an epic grand slam home run

where Sally come on

DC you already know how I feel about you

and I feel about this team you know

truly something special what we're able

to do this year you guys had a big part

in that but the guys in this locker room

had the biggest part you know no guy

ever gave up we all kept fighting

especially with a 19 and 31 start

I mean it's miraculous what we did you

know Davi believed in us our office

front office believed in us our families

believed in us and trusted us and you

know what we brought a title back so

enjoy it because I know we will

[Applause]

great job ally in Game one of that

series by the way honorable Sanchez shut

down the Cardinals offense and came

within four outs of a no-hitter that

would have been nice honorable where are

you come here come on they're more

concerned with speaking than they are

with playing that's pretty good please

thank thank you everybody for be here

this is a special moment for me for my

family you know for for the whole team

and more than was the thing that we show

in the game is Joe for you guys

almost a no-hitter in the next three

games Washington outscored st. Louis 18

to 6 won the National League pennant and

you headed to face the Houston Astros

they were here two years ago they were a

great team and are a great team but you

faced him in the World Series ever since

the team came to Washington in 2005 Nats

fans had dreamed of that incredible

moment after 14 years only one player

from the original team was left I know

you know you have no idea I'm talking

about it

and he's a great guy and he's a great

great player and that's Ryan Zimmerman

come on Ryan come on I have to get Ryan

up here and he had some great series

thank you guys

what an unbelievable honor to be here to

be in front of you guys this is stuff

that you dream about to see all the fans

show up the parade look at this crowd

here you know we couldn't have done it

without you so thank you guys so much

mr. president me and my teammates first

of all would like to thank you for

having us here this is uh was an

incredible honor that I think all of us

oh well never will never forget and I

would also like to thank you for keeping

everyone here safe in our country

[Applause]

and continuing to make America the

greatest country to live in the world

[Applause]

thank you very much Ryan so you know

Ryan was your original first ever draft

pick and I think that was a good pick

what do you think good pick good in Game

one Ryan stepped up to the plate for his

first at-bat he reached back took his

swing I was watching too when he scored

the first World Series home run and got

you off to a real start in Nationals

history I was the first ever Nationals

history and Ryan I have to tell you I

know a lot of people in this city and

they love you they really love you great

job great job

thank you you had two big wins in

Houston and beat two great pitchers

headed back to DC hoping for another

sweep and it was looking like it was

gonna be easy right you were thinking it

was gonna be easy

and then something bad happened to the

best of my knowledge he lost three games

how did that happen we won't talk about

that but that showed under pressure what

happened and you were getting good at

that because that's been the whole

season when you think it's never there's

never been anything like this has

happened to baseball before it's

incredible instead you suffered that

three heartbreaking home-field losses in

a row now the Nats would have to do what

no team had ever done win all four games

on the road which is not something

that's very easy to do and you're

playing a great team and you're playing

against great pitchers and then you have

a man named Stephen Strasburg did

anybody ever hear of him Stephen so

Stephen started Game six and dominated

the Astros for over eight innings with a

1.98 think of that less than two against

the best hitters in baseball a 1.98 er a

in the playoffs you became the first

pitcher in history to go five and OH in

postseason starts

player in history and I think Dave I

think that's a record that's gonna hold

up for a long time there are certain

records and hold up for a long time I

suspect that's gonna be one of them huh

five and Oh is pretty much almost

impossible because they have to be long

series and lots of things have to happen

congratulations Stephen come on over

Stephen we want to hear you we want to

hear you Stephen was also designated

World Series MVP

[Applause]

yeah we've certainly come a long way mr.

president you know I think starting out

in nineteen and thirty-one only makes

this that much better you know we could

have been like the other teams we could

have won over a hundred games and it

could have been smooth sailing all the

way but it wasn't it wasn't easy and I

think it was we only had one choice and

that was you know stay in the fight and

we stuck together we pulled for each

other and man what a way to celebrate

finally finishing that fight thank you

[Applause]

I'm gonna consider that for more World

Series wins okay

that would be very exciting that's true

despite a controversial interference

call that was slightly controversial

Mike said that was bad they might have

to find you for that but yet it's

incredible call see they can't find me I

thought it was a terrible call for

interference call in Game six

the Nats rallied and scored seven runs

to the Astros two and kept hope alive

next came Game seven what a game and Max

Scherzer started and just as he did

whenever Stephen Strasburg took the

mound the Nats one every single

postseason game that max started I mean

that's incredible the two of them what a

job the whole team what a job but days

before he suffered unbelievable pain

crippling pain they say in his neck and

back and I thought to myself that's the

bad thing you have a great pitcher a

great fastball pitcher and you have a

bad back and I wouldn't have thought

that he could have pitched in Game seven

but that night he held the Astros to

just two runs over five innings

stranding nine runners and base that

that was a game he pitched more with his

heart than with his muscle that was

incredible

that was hard he really did that was an

incredible job he was in a lot of pain

he handed it over to Patrick Korbin

Patrick come on Patrick you know fear

thing I don't know I don't know what

there is that took took guts what an

honor this is very special day for me I

just want to say one thing about this

team we believe in each other all year

we're really good friends on and off the

field and I'm excited I'm here for five

more years thank you

so Patrick as you know pitched three

clutch scoreless frames and relief and

that's a lot of pressure and he handled

it in the sixth

Asdrubal where is he Cabrera where is he

what a job he did come here where are

you come here come on we got to get him

up

come here and Ryan they executed a

critical DoublePlay unbelievable where

is that guy that was a hell of a play a

lot of quickness but at the top of the

seventh you still needed one last

comeback that's when the Nats batted you

hit in six unanswered right six

unanswered runs including Adam Eaton's

two RBIs Adam Eaton and you won and you

won the trophy and you won the World

Series and you're champions frankly of

the world the whole world is talking

about it was very exciting it was great

even if you're a non baseball fan and I

am a total baseball fan but there are

plenty of non fans out there everybody

was watching as Dave Martinez said often

bumpy roads lead to beautiful places

that's right that's really look at this

beautiful hair

well I can explain how sorry MB to be

here

one of things are you guys for the

support I love you guys and I hope to

come back next year to great play that

was a great play that was an important

play too huh he doesn't do that who

knows maybe we're standing here with

somebody else and nobody in the audience

today in the heart of our nation's

capital in the city that everybody

adores in many ways and a city that

adores you and your team and your

champions we're here to celebrate a

World Series win for the ages this is

really something that was very special

you stayed in the fight and you were

down so much from the regular season to

the postseason to the I would think that

the odds would have been pretty small

that you could have done what you did

but you did because you have tremendous

ability but you have tremendous heart

maybe even greater heart you stayed in

the fight you finished the fight I want

to just congratulate everybody and again

to learn a family great great people and

congratulations it's a fantastic job

you've all done thank you

so now I'd like to invite to say a few

words general manager Mike Rizzo and

then Dave will say a few words and then

they're gonna keep going on and just

keep celebrating because as soon as they

lose the first two or three games

they're not gonna be heroes anymore

that's the way life works but that won't

happen to them

DC representing big time I love it

you guys got after it not a baseball

town not even close

huge baseball town what a great fan base

we had the playoffs let the latter part

of the season in the playoffs you guys

were electric it's unbelievable I like

to thank the president and the first

lady for having us here we're honored to

be here in the long tradition of

honoring champions champions at the

White House there's a particular honor

because Washington DC not only is the

nation's capitol in the most powerful

city in the world is our hometown we've

heard all the players talk about you'll

hear Davey talk about it but I've got to

talk about this is a special group of

human beings right here great baseball

players yes we know that great skills

great players they've had great

accomplished accomplishments in their

careers but what a special group of

character people we have we're so

fortunate here in Washington DC to have

representatives of the of the Washington

Nationals with Washington across the

front of their jerseys that take care of

their business so like these guys do

it's incredible thank you guys I'm

always so proud to to tell people that

when you when you read about the

Washington Nationals you read about the

Washington Nationals in the sports

section and I think that is very

important to tell about these players

they put together a crater on a

tremendous run at the end of the season

through their perseverance their

teamwork their love for each other and

love for the game love for the name on

the front of the Jersey more so than a

name on the back of the Jersey they were

they put together a miracle season in an

unforgettable postseason we're proud to

say that we are the 2009 world champions

in a season that unified a region when

the region needed unifying the most and

again as our manager David Martinez said

so eloquently after our many many many

celebrations this year five of them I

think bumpy roads do lead to beautiful

places and this here is a beautiful

place thank you yeah I wasn't gonna I

wasn't gonna talk today but my throat's

a little hoarse we met with the cast

last night and they got a little

interesting and and I don't want to take

up too much time because apparently my

boys don't like wearing shirts anymore

they you know they often say adversity

builds character we got some characters

we got some characters at heart and what

I learned about these boys they had one

heartbeat or you love they won't want to

know all year long and I'm so proud of

this group of guys and what it means to

this city and to be a part of it thank

you

[Applause]

so I just want to thank everybody we're

going to call this Washington Nationals

day we're going to celebrate this as the

day for the Washington Nationals and I

really think it's gonna be the day and

the week and the month in the year it's

been very special what you did Dave Mike

done and the fans I don't think there

can be fans like the fans that we have

White House enjoy looking at this great

Washington Nationals congratulations
