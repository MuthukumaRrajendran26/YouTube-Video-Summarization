thank you thank y'all so much for coming

here

[Applause]

it is longing for me to stand next to

you today together in this fight and it

is great to be in Los Angeles in

California and I I would say a special

thank you to you organizers we recognize

we are the village of la is younger the

people were injured at Han now we are

often called Karenina

tongra who entire Los Angeles base

earlier this week I visited paradise in

California and I met with survivors who

showed me around the devastation Street

hopefully you would know houses

I heard heartbreaking stories 18,000

buildings were destroyed and at least a

six people died today in California we

see the wildfires happening

just on the corner

bonfires are being intensified by the

climate crisis but it's not just here

everywhere around the world would you

see these horrible environmental

feedbacks that countless of people are

suffering and dying from right now we

are living in the beginning the climate

and ecological breakdown and we cannot

continue to look away from this crisis

anymore I mean what is it that seem to

your heart so hard to understand

we have been repeating the same message

over and over again the scientists have

been repeating the same message over and

over and over again and yet they are

still not being listened to it is the

year 2019 why is the world still

ignoring the science and those wills

affected by this crisis

[Music]

[Applause]

why are the people in power still

pretending that everything is fine and

we can just continue to live like now as

if there was no tomorrow

well there is tomorrow is this world but

we some people will live and we need to

fight for that tomorrow and we need to

protect this as if our lives depended on

it because it does

people are already suffering and dying

from the climate and ecological

emergency and it will continue to get

worse doesn't it mean anything to the

decision-makers

we won't I will never understand how

they can put short-term interests above

human lives above the planet itself in

our very future

[Applause]

but we young people have had enough we

say no more

and if our parents won't speak up for us

that we will we are draw the line and we

will make sure the people in power don't

get away with continuing right now the

older generations are failing us they

are failing future generations but

future generations do not have a voice

and the biosphere doesn't have a voice

so we will be the voice that speaks up

and we will be the voice speeds up for

ourselves that right now that is what we

are doing we are speaking up and that is

what we will continue to do every Friday

we will strike and every single day we

are speaking up and we will not be

silenced do you think they are listening

to us we will make them listen thank you
