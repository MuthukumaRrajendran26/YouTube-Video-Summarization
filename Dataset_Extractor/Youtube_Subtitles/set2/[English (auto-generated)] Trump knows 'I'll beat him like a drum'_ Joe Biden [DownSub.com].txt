I know I know Trump deserves to be

investigated he is violating every basic

norm of a president you should be asking

him the question why is he on the phone

with a foreign leader trying to

intimidate a foreign leader if that's

what happened that appears what happened

you should be looking at Trump Trump's

doing this because I'll beat him like a

drum and he's using the abuse of power

and every element of the presidency to

try to do something to smear me

depending on what the court the house

finds you could be impeached but I'm not

making that judgment now the house

should investigator at the house should

investigate this this appears to be an

overwhelming abuse of power to get in

the phone with a foreign leader who is

looking for help from the United States

and asked about me and imply things if

that's what happened that appears to be

what happened we know that's what

Giuliani did this is outrageous
