in color I can't tell you make her model

I heard at least three shots this has to

end

we put I gave housing and moratorium

they have no longer Smith deep they

don't pull their safety meeting and get

their together

we've had enough I am sick of attending

funerals they are not gonna be happy

until people start taking it into their

own hands

we are tired this is second housing

doesn't giving him this place needs help

they better step up their game and they

better start cleaning housing up because

we are sick sick and tired of burying

bodies it is not young innocent people

that didn't desert okay I'm not good

the rivers cameras this is broad

daylight they should all you know who

did it need to know the call they should

know the lace license plate they should

know we deserve justice this is this

needs to have justice to this we need

way too much justice visit me justice

it's not right it's not right to nothing

it's not right to no one and whoever did

this you have a sick mind

nearly you're sticking your stomach and

I thought I hope I I pray that you have

guilt and you just turn yourself and

have that guilt and give that person the

give the families the justice and

everything they need to cope with this

that's my last part we have a lot of

drug issues in this complex we have a

lot of drug addicts Bible Sunday is up

hell on earth I wouldn't put my worst

enemies dog in that building it is

disgusting the dirty needles the the

drugs the extras the people who think

that they own this place

I've lived here 20 years I started in

the townhouses I moved over there to the

one bedrooms this has got to end and I

told them a month ago when we had their

shooting up here unfortunately nobody

was hit I told them the next one will be

bodies sure Christ a month later here we

are

bodies we're sick of it we are sick of

it it's not just here if

every housing complex and they do not

give a damn
