American patriots that's what you are

your taxes you raise your children you

follow our laws you respect our police

Democrat who is sold you out John bel

Edwards with a great new Republican

governor now this Saturday you also have

a not a bad football game coming up

unbeaten I was watching a little bit of

a clip today your quarterback does not

look too bad does he huh

but it's a great game LSU in Florida so

here's what you do

it's olive oil I want you to enjoy the

game but I don't really want you to

enjoy the game if you don't vote first

you know why because you'll be sitting

there watching some incredible football

and you feel guilty it will ruin your

entire afternoon so go out and vote and

then go and enjoy the game the way it

should be enjoyed as you've seen under

Republican leadership America is

stronger than ever before and that's

what's happened we've created six

million new jobs and opened 10,000 new

factories since my election the United

States has the hottest economy on earth

you know these prime ministers and

presidents and kings and queens and I'd

hate to say it sometimes dictators but

we take them as they come right we take

them as they come but they always sort

of sir congratulations on the great job

you've done with the economy

that the hottest number that the hottest

economy in world we've got the number

one economy anywhere in the world and

had our opponent gotten elected you

would right now be the number two

economy to China and we are now so far

ahead it will never happen if smart

people are standing

we've ended the war on American energy

with your help right here in Louisiana

the United States is now the number one

producer of oil and natural gas anywhere

on the planet and how about these

Democrats they want to get rid of oil

they want to get rid of natural gas they

want to go to wind darlin I just can't

watch the show tonight the wind that

just stopped blowing

I can't watch LSU in Florida there's no

wind today I'm angry I'm really angry at

John bel Edwards is nothing the job we

are securing our borders taking care of

our great veterans and restoring the

unrivaled might of the US military like

never before

and by the way and we're going to

introduce some but you have two great

senators here tonight you have great

congressmen we approve something called

veterans Choice the veterans now can go

see a doctor outside of the VA if they

have to wait for two weeks or three

weeks or three days they can go and they

can see a doctor we pay the bill they

get better people are waiting for four

five six seven weeks so our veterans

were taking care of a veteran you notice

that with the veterans because a lot of

veterans here but you notice it used to

be all the time every time or there's a

veteran where's the vet right there how

are you sir it looks like a veteran do

not gonna mess with him great thank you

very much but you notice we don't see

the bad stories about the veterans now

the fake news will go out all over the

United

well

there look NBC is one of the worst in

the world there look there look for a

veteran they're gonna find the veteran

that's not a hundred percent happy and

they're gonna make them a star but you

notice for a year and a half we've been

in great shape right they don't talk

about the veteran

your amount

you know what your police work fast

they work fast they don't mess around in

Louisiana do they oh that was beautiful

I love to see it our police are great

law enforcement great for an incredible

job but all of our nation's gains are

put at risk by a rage-filled Democrat

Party that has gone completely insane

for nearly three years Democrats have

waged a non-stop battle to overturn your

vote overruled your voice override your

values and overthrow the results of the

most spectacular election in the history

of our country

2016

but your senators in your congressman

and frankly the real senators and the

real congressmen and women of this

country they're not standing for it the

good people of Louisiana will never ever

stand for it it's a hoax it's a hope the

Democrats are fighting to restore the

wretched political class that threw open

our nation's borders shift away our jobs

sacrificed our wealth surrendered our

sovereignty flooded our cities with

Drugs and Crime and Bob get us down in

one foreign war after another the

endless wars have to stop half this time

we directly take it on the unholy

alliance of corrupt Democrat politicians

deep state bureaucrats and the fake news

media there they are right there

you know it's really funny I see all

those red lights so that means you live

right as soon as I start talking about

the fake news I see those lights go off

so fast but then they come back on and

you know why they come back on because

last night by far all over a cable all

over the place the highest-rated show

was what we did in Minnesota a state

that were going to win

that's why they come back on because

they have no choice they may hate jump

but they want to get those ratings hey

what's gonna happen in 12 maybe 16 years

when I'm no longer president see I'm

just driving their ratings are going to

tank I actually think they're going to

endorse me because if they don't can you

imagine having Pocahontas as your

president

now the real Pocahontas we wouldn't have

minded but the fake Pocahontas you can't

ever or how about sleepy Joe

his son who knows nothing about energy

unlike the people in this room

he flies into the Ukraine he flies into

Ukraine he walks out with a hundred and

sixty eight thousand dollars a month

three million dollars never he doesn't

know what a gasoline tank looks like and

they're paying him hundreds of thousands

a month then he flies into China and he

takes out 1.5 billion dollars I gotta

tell you you know I just made a great

China deal today for energy for the

farmer

for the banks for so many euro

technology one of the grapes phase one

is a big phase in fact the biggest

problem it'll be 40 to 50 billion

dollars in farm purchases I don't think

our farmers can produce that much I said

that's okay you know my people said sir

could we make it 20 I said no make it 50

our farmers will buy more land and

they'll buy bigger tractors

now they actually said I want my farmers

I love my farmers I want them to come

back to me sir we can't produce this two

larges so much sir

it's too much we can't produce that much

wheat and corn and all the stuff because

I want to tell you I got China to order

a lot it's true

no it's true so China in their record

year of course they'll catch it within

you know two dollars it was two dollars

off he gets a Pinocchio although Schiff

got four Pinocchios for making up what I

said or a phone call

shifty chef but their biggest year was

16 billion dollars in Agra that's a lot

16 billion that'sa left corner 16

billion was their biggest year they're

going to buy not 16 not 20 not 30 not 40

they're going to buy between 40 and 50

billion dollars worth of Agriculture

and my people said to me sir they can't

do it they cannot produce that much I

said you know what

no that's show my people wanted to stop

at 20 I said I'm not stopping at 20 I

want them to come back and say sir we

can't do it because I love my farmers

but they're gonna be out there busy

they'll be going they'll be good they're

gonna be more tractors sold and they're

gonna be bigger and better and more

powerful and they're gonna be made by

American companies like John Deere and

cake and Caterpillar so for you sinners

and you congressmen that are here it was

one hell of a deal this is phase 1 phase

1 you got to see these and they are

happy to do it they are happy to do it

we had a great relationship but I'll

tell you so let me get back to Biden

right remember where's hunter you know

last night I said where's hunter it

became like the hottest thing in the

whole country

I just said by the way where's hunter he

walked out of China so he walks out with

1.5 billion dollars and I said you know

those aren't the same guys that I've

been dealing with from China for the

last year and a half those guys don't

give you a 1.5 billion and you know

nothing that's not the same Chinese

people I want to meet those people

instead of 50 billion it would be five

hundred billion dollars worth of corn so

it's a crooked deal and the fake news is

always covering up for Joe Biden right

the fake news

they go while the claim is totally

unsubstantiated every single discus with

me any claim is okay with them while the

claim is totally unsubstantiated and I

say but it's not unsubstantiated

he took out a fortune out of Ukraine

knew nothing took out a fortune out of

China how tough is China I called one of

the biggest people on Wall Street friend

of mine really big powerful guy disaster

I said let me ask you just one question

what are the chances of doing that he

said zero I said so you're the biggest

on Wall Street Steve Steve you're the

biggest what are the chances you could

do that he said even the big ones can't

do that but for a guy to walk in off the

street with no experience a bad track

record just got thrown out of the Navy

and he walks away with 1.5 billion and

then these people these crooked people

back there say this is totally

unsubstantiated

can you imagine John Kennedy bill can

you imagine if Don jr. or if Eric trump

or of our beautiful Ivanka she worked so

hard can you imagine if they walked out

with one and a half billion dollars they

wouldn't be saying totally

unsubstantiated they'd be saying where's

the nearest cell this is a horrible

thing so it's a disgrace what's going on

it's a whole big fat disgrace and it's

very unfair to Republicans but you know

what we hear and they're not

the Democrats and the media their

partners their partners okay you ever

see in the the word manufacturers never

been used before for this we're talking

about the southern border and they're

talking about in a manufactured crisis

they said it was not a crisis that it

was manufactured when you had caravans

we stopped it and the wall is being

built like you've never seen before but

remember a few months ago in a

manufactured crisis ABC NBC in a

manufactured crisis ABC again

manufactured CNN crooked as hell in a

manufactured crisis manufactured then

you go to CBS ladies and gentlemen and a

manufacturer there's a word that was

never used and yet every single network

used it because you know what it's

collusion it's collusion

luckily with us there was no collusion

that's the real collusion right there

they colluded and they conspired to

sabotage our incredible movement and

they wanted to sieve the American voter

and they want to hurt the American voter

and we had an election in the history of

our country there's never been a greater

victory than the victory we had in 2016

and we're going to have a bigger one in

twenty

they've been trying to stop us for more

than three years with a lotta crap you

know the first time I heard about Russia

they said sir do you know anything about

Russia no have you colluded with Russia

and I laughed I thought they were

kidding and weeks would go by out of

here somebody else come up soon these

are they about Russia no no I know where

it is I don't deal with it I told the

house to a guy about 12 years ago he was

from Russia that's a long time ago no I

don't know then they come up again sure

this Russia keeps coming up do you

anything about it this is the witch-hunt

this is the insurance Bali for you know

this this was the insurance policy

remember from the two lovers if she

doesn't win we've got an insurance

policy these people are corrupt these

people are disgusting to two lovers and

they put it on the FBI server so their

spouses wouldn't find out

because they didn't want to put it on

their private that didn't work out too

well for Peter struck at least the

parents did it Lisa I love you I love

you Lisa I love you Lisa I love you so

much I can't even see straight Li Lisa

she's gonna win 100 million to nothing

but just in case Lisa my darling I love

you God just in case she doesn't when

we've got an insurance policy

essentially saying we're gonna take him

out

these are corrupt people folks

and then she said Peter I love you I

love you so much

you're so great Peter I don't think she

loves him too much anymore do you I

don't think she loves him I hear that

word is not too good the word is she's

not in love anymore

we've been living through this so-called

insurance policy because they know we're

putting a stop to their pillaging and

their plundering and their hoaxes

the Radical Democrats policies are crazy

there politicians are corrupt their

candidates are terrible and they know

they can't win an election day so

they're pursuing an illegal invalid and

unconstitutional impeachment

they're scammers and con artists

perpetrating hoaxes and witch hunts a

man like Gregg Jarrett great guy he

wrote a book and the book tells you the

whole story bestseller book Gregg

Jarrett great guy so many bungeed oh I

tell you so many he's not a lawyer but

he's better than the lawyers he's called

street smart but these are great so many

great people John Solomon should get the

Pulitzer Prize how about these

fraudulent writers at the New York Times

they get Pulitzer Prize and they got it

all wrong they have to give back their

Pulitzer Prize but that's a fix also

isn't it huh I've just won the Pulitzer

Prize for talking about Trump and Russia

but they were all wrong now the people

that were right like Sean Hannity and

Rush Limbaugh

laura ingraham and tucker carlson judge

Jeanine waters my waters and frankly the

best show by far in the morning is Fox

and Friends also got the best ring and

Lou Dobbs how about Lou Dobbs

and Varney he's Greg you know Barney's

great and Maria Bartiromo and you know

what and there are many others many

others many others but they get it right

but why is it John Solomon why aren't

these people getting the real Pulitzer

Prize because they were right they

called it right The Times The Washington

Post they're dishonest

horrible I think very very bad for our

country publications it's a phony deal

so they're writers get Pulitzer Prizes

for getting it wrong and the great

writers that really got it and I don't

know them I never even met some of these

people but the ones that really got it

right they go home empty-handed doesn't

work that way and the people see it you

know the people see it so some of the

names that I mentioned all of the names

that I mentioned and plenty that I

didn't I'll tell you thank God we have

them on our side

and its own way thank God that we have a

thing called social media because we get

the word out like nobody has ever gotten

the word out before but it's called a

witch hunt

the story of the greatest mass delusion

in American political history that's

what it is

this is one of the great con jobs ever

we must never let it happen to another

president this should never be allowed

to happen again

when Schiff goes out and speaks before

Congress they never thought I was gonna

release the transcript of my call and

this whistleblower what's going on with

the IG how come the IG brings a

whistleblower forward and the

whistleblower who works now for Buyten

did you hear this one came out yesterday

but the whistleblower comes out with a

totally phony report on my phone call

but they never thought I'd release it so

they were gonna be okay

eight times quid pro quo except it was

no time and if you listen to what they

said it would sounded horrible that's

why I had to release it I called up

Ukraine and I said do you mind I had one

of my people make a call do you mind if

we release it they said what the hell is

that all about and by the way the

president of Ukraine yesterday came out

and he said he did nothing wrong

what are you talking about I think they

look at our country they think we're all

crazy they think we're crazy but he said

really nice the new president good guy

and he got elected on an anti-corruption

platform because Kareem is you know

Ukraine is known as a unfortunately very

corrupt place but they'll straighten it

out but he came out yesterday and he

said so strongly and the fake news

hardly puts him on hardly put someone

and he said it before he said it to the

United Nations and his foreign minister

said it so strongly he said there was

nothing wrong with that call there was

nothing wrong they don't even know what

the hell were talking about but nobody

thought I'd released the call probably

nobody thought we had a transcript so

when I heard the viciousness but here's

the worst of all worse than the whistle

blow now the whistle blow what's this is

a whistle why are we protecting a person

that tells you things that weren't true

but listen to this

so shifty ship shifting little add a

little Adam Schiff

Adam I've had you up to here I've had

you up little Adam sure he comes out and

he made up my conversation and I was

watching fortunately because a lot of

people sort of think like oh I guess

that's what he said I said I never said

that

and then when Pelosi nervous nervous

tense

nervous dancing yeah nervous dance

nervously

I used to think she loved the country

she hates the country because she

wouldn't be doing this to the country if

she did she hates the country Nancy

Pelosi hates the United States of

America because she wouldn't be doing

this and I'm telling you foreign nations

foreign people looking at us they

honestly think we're nuts and then you

have presidents and saying nothing was

wrong the president of the country

that's in question but Nancy Pelosi said

well that's what he said isn't it but

she was angry as hell when she got to

read the transcript because she said

wait a minute that's not what I was told

but she was stuck she was stuck but

think of a guy who makes up a phone call

makes up my words viciously says eight

quid pro quos in other words you got to

do this so we're not going to do that

and there were none there were none they

couldn't believe it when I released that

call I would have loved to have seen

their faces and then he goes before the

United States Congress and before the

American public and he makes up the

story of what I said

made it horrible and vicious not even

close it's not like gee he missed a

couple of words he missed every word he

missed every he made it up it was

fiction

it's unbelievable and honestly I don't

know congressman but are you immune from

something like that that should be a

crime

anyway that's why tomorrow I need you to

send the radical democratise tablished

bent aloud and clear message you are

going to fire your Democrat governor

who's got a lousy job and send a great

Republican to the governor's mansion

when John bel Edwards ran for office he

made your state a sacred promise that he

would not raise your taxes then he got

elected and broke that promise by

ramming through the largest tax hike in

your state's history John bel Edwards

and you know because this state

obviously likes me I think I won like by

a lot

I don't even know why the hell you like

a guy that lives on Fifth Avenue but I

like you too but I used to go to

construction sites my father would be

putting up houses or a building and I'd

go and I'd work with the workers and

that's when I realized these are the

people I love these are the people these

are the real people I know I'm all I

know the good ones I know the bad ones I

like those workers but John bel Edwards

lied to the people of Louisiana while

every other state is making massive job

gains and you don't even know this

Edwards terrible policies are killing

jobs across your state Edwards is now

trying to destroy Louisiana's energy

sector you know that right with threats

and lawsuits inspired by the radical

left-wing Washington activists and

Democrats what he's doing right John bel

Edwards not good goes around saying I

like Trump very much he's very good but

behind my back he doesn't like me friend

of mine knows him well he said behind

your back he's not so good John bel

Edwards was a super delegate for crooked

Hillary Clinton

and he supported by the way looks like

Bernie losses chancer Bernie was hitting

a baseball today to show how strong he

was there just wasn't a lot of bad head

speed

Bernie get better for but Bernie I just

get better well get better faster it's

the only time I've ever said anything

good about him but but boy did they take

advantage of him four years ago and he

let him do it

you can't do that you can't let people

take advantage you figured I'll wait

four years it's a little bit tough but

it looks like you know when Bernie gets

out which seems inevitable when Bernie

gets out it looks like those will go to

your radical leftist Elizabeth Warren

and that unfortunately will be the end

of sleepy Jokers I would really probably

most like to run again I don't know sort

of anybody care whoever it is just put

him out there let's get this thing going

but John bel Edwards supported far-left

candidates like Stacey Abrams our friend

Brian Kemp he did a number on Stacey

Abrams she's still saying what happened

what happened she had Oprah you know

Oprah used to be a very good friend of

mine she used to go to Mara Lago place I

have in Palm Beach she loved mar-a-lago

she loved the key lime pie she did know

so do I

she loved the key lime pie but she used

to go she loved me until I decided to

run for office but she went to Georgia

and she campaigned for Stacy and Obama

went and Michelle Obama went

and they can't pay and all Brian Kemp

had was Donald Trump

and we had a rally at the airport and

there were 55,000 people at that rally

that was the day before maybe two days

before the election I said Brian

congratulations you're gonna win you're

gonna win

and he won by two and a half points

which was amazing every star everybody

went down there for Stacey Abel's

Louisiana cannot take four more years of

a Liberal Democrat governor raising your

taxes killing you jobs attacking your

and us is and taking money from open

borders extremists how about these

people they want open borders let

everybody come in let them off

tomorrow you've got a vote John bel

Edwards out

and the way you do that is before the

game you got to get going you got to

just leave it an hour early maybe even a

half an hour ten minutes I don't care be

late for the game I couldn't care less

but you got a vote before the game and

what it is just so you understand it's a

runoff so if he doesn't get 50% then one

of our two great candidates will win

that and it'll be John bel Edwards

against one of our two great and they're

both great people they great

Ralph Abraham and Eddie risk phony

Ralph Abraham and Eddie are both throw

jobs pro-worker

pro-family pro-life and they're Pro

Louisiana energy if that's ok you know I

was here a couple of months ago and they

opened the biggest LNG plant I have ever

seen in my life right were you there

they've been trying to get this thing

approved for years and years and years

and they couldn't and then President

Trump came along and I got those permits

so fast for them these big energy

executives were sitting back and they

couldn't get it approve nothing they

could do would get it approved your

governor was lousy they were all lousy

nobody could help that thing was so dead

and I came along and I got it approved

and then the consultants probably called

up these big energy executives

sir we were able to get it approved for

you I never even saw these people but I

know it was a good thing and they

probably got millions in consulting fees

I'd rather give it to you people or

rather give it to something charity but

they came along I could just see nobody

knows consultants better than me they

make the environmental rules tough so

you have to pay them a lot of money to

skirt your way through but it takes

years and years and millions and

millions so I got that plant approved

and I came down two months ago right two

and a half months ago cutter rivet I've

never seen anything so big and now

they're gonna double it up I understand

and they're building an even bigger one

in another location of Louisiana

right they will protect your Second

Amendment are two guys and John bel wah

John bel Edwards when it gets close and

they start calling from Washington and

Schumer and Pelosi call we want you to

get rid of the Second Amendment he's a

hundred percent gonna drop the Second

Amendment you're not gonna have the

rights that you have or anywhere close

John bel Edwards will not protect your

second amount our guys support your

police they defend the great workers and

families of this state if you want a

governor who will fight for your values

get out tomorrow and cast your ballot

for Eddie or Ralph it's very important

Eddie it Ralph where are you Eddie and

Ralph where are you come up come up

you know what

so here's the problem we're on live

television all over the place they don't

like this because they go up they say

put Trump back on he gets better ready

somebody tell you these guys are the

greatest here's the thing I'm gonna have

me to say like a quick minute or two but

you're not allowed to hit your

Republican opponent you're only allowed

to hit John bel Edwards because he

deserves to it's just incredible is this

incredible yes

we need someone to do for Louisiana what

President Trump has done for the USA we

need a conservative we need a

businessman

we need someone is not beholden to

special interests we need someone that

will fight for Louisiana that's why I'm

in this race folks

let's go get it let's fire John bel

Edwards and let's thank our president

for coming down here to help us

I just want to thank the president for

coming to Louisiana and making Louisiana

we need him to make Louisiana great

again and my sound

mr. president we thank you thank you so

much for taking care of our veterans for

rebuilding our military and for

protecting our southern border and mr.

president I dropped a resolution to

expel Nancy Pelosi from the House of

Representative no America

[Music]

okay you got to do it tomorrow let's go

get a runoff and one of these two guys

that feel good just vote tomorrow for

the entire Republican ticket just vote

we're also delighted to be joined by two

really good friends of mine these are

warriors

these are warriors different types of

people but equally I mean they fight for

you and they love this state and they

love this country one here's a strange

name when I first heard he called me up

sir they said there's a man named John

Kennedy on the phone

I said who he's running for the Senate

in a state that likes you a lot I said

where Louisiana

and I said let me check it out and it

was true there was a man named John

Kennedy very successful guy a brilliant

guy you're not gonna know what this

means because I'm a big like student I

like academics believe it and if people

don't know my uncle was a professor for

35 years of something at MIT I like that

stuff

he went to Oxford Oxford's like as good

as it gets and he was a great student at

Oxford you know he puts on that country

stuff all the time but I want to tell

you and we know the country's smarter

than the other guys anyway but so John

Kennedy calls it I'd love to have your

support I'd really love it if I could

but I said John to me you're the real

John Kennedy you're the real deal and we

came down it was I'll never forget it

was a Friday night and it was this

massive airplane hangar someplace I

don't know where the hell all I know is

in your great state and we had thousands

and thousands of people show up and I

looked at him and I liked him and I

looked at that crowd I said you know

what I think you're gonna win tomorrow

the election was on a Saturday and John

Kennedy won by a lot it was a great

thing and a great thing for our country

where is John Kennedy c'mere c'mere

c'mere jump and then we have another guy

any time I talk about healthcare any

time I want to know anything about

medical any time I want to know anything

about taking care of people I call a man

named Bill Cassidy he's incredible what

a heart what our heart come on up here

John come here Joe Oxford

is this incredible or what

I mean is this Louisiana

I told you Donald J Trump loves

Louisiana like the devil loves sin

mr. president thank you now mr.

president earlier I gave them a quiz I

imagined you were running against Joe

Biden

I asked him a set of questions who's

more likely to secure the southern

border Joe Biden or Donald but there's

one question I forgot to ask him who

promised to build a new Calcasieu River

bridge

two great men two great men two great

Americans another man who's very brave

he was really in bad condition I was at

the hospital the night that he was

expected to die

he wasn't looking too good that night I

have to tell you I went there and the

doctor said it's almost impossible to

save him

and honestly I saw him today I swear I

think he's better looking now that he

was 2 years ago the greatest thing he

was playing baseball he was shot while

they were practicing he was shot at

second base Steve Scalise right Steve

but the greatest

so he's recovering and I mean he really

I don't want to go into it but he he had

a lot of damage and he went out and he

played in the baseball game like six

months later seven months later he could

hardly stand up and they had a bit

second base he didn't have big range

like I'd say range would be about six

inches and the first batter rips a

ground ball right at him I said oh this

is gonna be terrible and he got down and

he got that ball and he caught it and he

threw it to first he could barely throw

it through it the first and the batter

was out I said that's like a miracle the

first pitch of the game

I said how tough is that I don't think

anybody else would have been able to

stop that sucker that was hard hit but

he's a great friend of mine

and he's another one he loves your state

of the 2019 Little League World Series

championship so after their Louisiana's

own River Ridge little league baseball

team but I have to tell you the crazy

story so I'm in the look at his hand

some kids it tries to be crazy how good

look in there look at him so kids stay

there first time cuz I got a time so I'm

in the White House today and we had the

Little League girls championship team

and they were incredible and they come

from North Carolina and they were

undefeated I think they were like 20 you

know and then of course I got into a

competition who's better you or them and

one of these guys gave them a 25% chance

I don't know if you're very popular on

your team anymore that's a pretty good

but they were incredible then they had a

tremendous team North Carolina and then

I said so you're from North Carolina and

then the guys came in and I said where

are you from

they said Louisiana

and that one guy is like 6 foot 2 he's

12 years old and he's the pitcher and he

throws the ball they say one of the

young guys was telling me 75 miles per

hour I said no wonder you won the other

team can't see the pitch that's pretty

good 75 I think he's being recruited by

the entire major leagues all right he's

12 years old

but I said - so where you from they said

Louisiana's that you won't believe this

I'm going on a beautiful plane called

Air Force one world's most beautiful

pool I'm going to a place called

Louisiana do you want to come

and they looked at their parents

actually didn't want to take their

parents to heck with that part I didn't

want to take their coaches but their

coaches are great and their coaches are

here and the coaches raise your head

coaches like you've come up with them

but they won the whole deal all over the

world they're the number one team and

this like somebody told me they sorta

for like thousands of teams all over the

world and they won and I got so used to

watching Japan win you know for years

Japan won I think they ended up beating

Curacao right Curacao

but Japan would win and it was always a

little controversial

you know to be a guy you twelve of

course I I'm not saying this I wa he's

twelve

but he seemed to be 18 but I'm only

kidding Prime Minister Robbie cuz I he's

a friend of mine to he'll understand by

either way I kid he threw the ball this

one kid about a hundred and nine miles

an hour faster than any major leaguer

and he was 12 he had the greatest muscle

tone anybody's ever seen for 12 years

pitch a bad game

thanks goes I don't think they want to

leave

thank you fellas champions there's no

joke they don't choke and we don't choke

we don't like chokers with the help of

everyone here tonight America is booming

again and winning like never before

we're winning we're putting America

first you haven't heard that in a long

time seven million Americans have been

lifted off of food stamps since our

great election unemployment just reached

its lowest rate in over 50 years

unemployment for African Americans

Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans

have hit the all-time lowest rates in

the history of our country

wages are rising fast and they are

growing twice as fast for low-income

workers they have the biggest percentage

increase low-income workers 1.3 million

fewer children live in poverty today

than when I was elected 1.3 million

people I've got a record number of

job-killing regulations we passed the

largest package of tax cuts and reforms

in American history nearly a trillion

dollars has already been poured back

home it's coming back in remember people

would have their money over there they

couldn't bring it back in it was

prohibitive the legislation was

impossible we got rid of it over a

trillion dollars now has been brought

back in and it's being spent building in

the United States instead of building

overseas

meanwhile the Democrats running for

president have pledged to abolish all

American production of oil and natural

gas oh that's wonderful

in other words Democrats are promising

to annihilate Louisiana's economy

but we're never going to let them do

that and I have to tell you this isn't a

campaign speech because we're gonna win

it by like 35 points one of your senator

said what are you senators just say this

is really I came here to get you to go

out to vote tomorrow I don't want to get

too carried away with this but what do

your Senators just told me said sir you

don't ever have to come back to

Louisiana we have your back go to those

states that are closed go to Michigan go

to Pennsylvania go to North Carolina I

don't think they're very close you know

the other night in North Carolina two

weeks ago we won two congressional races

they thought we'd lose one or the other

was going to be maybe a 1.2 point

victory

we absolutely won them by so much nobody

ever saw I did something like this the

night before the election we did this it

was the same kind of an arena it was

packed and that was North Carolina I

think we're gonna do great there I think

we're gonna do great in Pennsylvania

with won Pennsylvania last time the

first time in many years

we won Michigan we won South Carolina

and Florida and Wisconsin though we won

Wisconsin Wisconsin we need the USMC a

we got to get that approval we got to

get Nancy to approve the u.s. MCA if she

does it that really you know we call him

to do nothing Democrats and it's really

that there nothing's but we'll do it

after we take over the house if it

doesn't get done the last administration

betrayed our nation's energy workers now

we are proudly promoting American energy

independence we're independent

I approved the Keystone XL pipeline and

the Dakota access pipelines 48,000 jobs

my first week in office I signed

executive orders to speed up the

construction of critical energy

infrastructure which you people are so

well aware of and I opened up Anwar the

largest drilling site perhaps they think

anywhere in the world it's in Alaska

they couldn't get it done even Ronald

Reagan could not get it done we got it

done bill and John and your congressman

we got it done

we're also reversing decades of ruinous

trade policies that ransacked the

communities of this state Louisiana

lost one in four manufacturing jobs

after the twin disasters of NAFTA what

are the worst trade deals ever made in

history which were replacing and China's

entrance into the World Trade

Organization probably the worst trade

deal ever made now we are replacing

NAFTA with the brand-new US Mexico

Canada agreement

and the USMC a will be a massive victory

for farmers and ranchers and growers and

workers all across the state I don't

know if the farmers are gonna need it

after China they may say we can't do

anything more please please we don't

want anymore mr. president

they'll be calling me from Nebraska

they'll be calling me from Iowa remember

he used to say we're winning so much

please please mr. president

we don't want to win so much we're not

used to they'll be calling me from

Nebraska

they'll be calling me from Iowa they'll

be calling me from that beautiful

midsection which was so beautiful bright

red you know yet a little blue and the

edges and if there was honest voting I

really think I would have won that too

but there's not it's not whatever they

tell you there's no but they'll be

calling please we don't need any more we

can't do it we'll go grace again we're

working too hard they want us too much

is that a nice feeling that was that

great Democrats in Congress should get

back to work and pass the US MCA

immediately we've taken the toughest

ever action to confront China's decades

of abuse and now we're getting along

with China this was a great day this was

the day I don't know of anybody sir fact

I was almost late for you because I was

with China I said I'm not gonna be late

for Louisiana even if it means

standing up China a little bit it was

between Louisiana and China I had to

take Louisiana but today I was with the

Vice Premier of China one of the most

powerful men in the world highly

respected and we made that significant

progress toward a new deal that's

getting papered now and who knows

getting papered but it's gonna happen

because they want it they want it badly

and it's going to end the mistreatment

of American workers and companies it's

going to be so great for this country

it's gonna be great for China too we

will not rest until we've achieved

economic fairness and justice for the

American worker and for American people

one issue after issue Democrats have put

the needs of foreign citizens ahead of

our own citizens it's true you know we

protect borders of other countries we

don't protect our own borders but I want

to thank Mexico the President of Mexico

it's great 27,000 Mexican soldiers are

on our border and you see the numbers

they plummeted 27,000 think of it all

because the Democrats wouldn't approve

simple changes to what we call the

loophole still the polls it's a good

name because it just absolutely mistakes

made years ago and the Democrats in 15

minutes we could solve the problem so

Mexico has helped us more in our border

than the Democrats honestly they're

terrible and all they want to do is this

foolishness they don't want to pass

anything all they want to do is play

these games because they're desperate to

win in 2020 and instead you see what's

happening with the polls it's turning

the other way because people see their

game the voters are smart

in a recent democrat debate every single

Democrat presidential candidate raised

their head in favor of giving free

government health care to illegal aliens

and then you wonder why they come to

America why wouldn't they come free

health care free education free

everything and I jokingly said one time

and everybody then gets a Rolls Royce

and the fake news said president replied

he said that the illegal immigrants all

get a Rolls Royce they don't have a lot

of sense of humor that's the problem

with this press what a bunch of dopes

free Rosa

the president told the lie they don't

get a Rolls Royce aw I'm only kidding

about the Rosa I just don't want to have

a story you don't have a bed sorry I did

it again I promised the rolls I was just

kidding

the Democrat vision for America is to

rob American taxpayers to fund socialism

for the entire world if you don't want

Democrats to raid your health care steal

your money over crowd your schools and

overwhelm your communities then you have

only one choice you have to go out

tomorrow vote Republican get John bel

Edwards the hell out of office

[Applause]

in everything I do I never forget that I

am not president of the world I am

president of the United States of

America we reject globalism and we

embrace patriotism we believe that every

American citizen no matter their

background deserves a government that is

loyal to them the Democrat Party and the

extreme radical are trying to abolish

the distinction between citizens and

non-citizens in many cases people that

come into our country illegally used to

be treated then I mean they were treated

better than our vets hey we have a great

vet we have a number of great vets

people that came in illegally were

treated better than our vets that

treated better than our own citizens not

anymore

[Applause]

just recently New York City I Love New

York City we got some real bad

leadership over there now New York City

you know the mayor ran for president he

left he got zero how did you get zero

it's impossible there's got to be one

strange person out there their votes he

he got zero and New York wanted him to

do so well they were backing him because

they didn't want him back as bear they

would have even said let him be

president just keep him the hell away

from me but New York City the same mayor

issued a rule that the use of the term

illegal alien can now be punishable with

a fine of up to 250 thousand dollars

did you imagine can you imagine you're a

hard worker you're saving your money

this built up that 250,000 after 15

years of construction work you got 250

or rich you feel better than Trump ever

did and you just happen to and one of

those bad moments use the word illegal

alien and they say thank you very much I

want your money and give me that 250,000

you worked your ass off for the left's

attack on free speech goes hand in hand

with their attack on America's borders

the Radical Democrats assault on

American freedom and American

citizenship will now end Democrats also

continue to encourage foreign

interference in our elections by

refusing to support a simple and

beautiful thing called voter ID

maybe I can ask our senators and

congressmen put a bill it is so popular

you know if you want to go out and buy

groceries you need identification if you

want to do almost anything you need

identification the only thing you don't

need identification where is to vote the

most important single thing you're doing

to vote you don't need it you know why

because they cheat like hell that's why

maybe John and bill could put out a

voter ID I never spoke to them about you

guys believe in that they can put it out

they'll do it oh you have it in the

state do you have a strong federal

application I love it that's why I love

this state that's why I won by so much

oh that's so great

listen to this now I know why I won by

so much because people couldn't cheat

that's great will you have it for

tomorrow's election yes I love this

state but don't change put it out for

every other state because most states

don't have it we believe only American

citizens should vote in American

elections and that's not what's out

you go out to California you see what's

happening out there it's a disgrace the

voter abuse it's a disgrace what's

happening in California

Democrats even support deadly sanctuary

cities which defy federal law

enforcement and ilish violent criminal

aliens or to your streets

Republicans believe our cities should be

sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans

not for criminal alien and we will

always stand with the heroes of ice

Border Patrol and our great law

enforcement that got that person out of

here so fast night they had cops love

Trump but I said cops love Trump and

Trump loves cops it's for the Democrat

Party has never been farther outside the

mainstream honestly they've gone crazy

they've got care they're not doing

anything they're just evil it's like

they're thick they're crazed lunatics

every Democrat running for president has

pushed a healthcare agenda that would

end Medicare as we know it

betraying our nation's seniors my

administration will always protect

Medicare for our beloved seniors and we

will always protect patients with

pre-existing conditions

and will also protect your private

insurance we have a hundred and eighty

million people is private insurance here

a lot of people how would you like it if

they take it away so that you can walk

to a hospital emergency room something

you go to a hospital emergency room

because you have a cold that's that good

we've taken swift action to lower the

price of health care for working

families with new options that cost up

to 60% less than failed Obamacare and we

got rid of the individual mandate in

Obamacare the most the most unpopular

unfair thing that's where you pay a

fortune for the privilege of not having

to pay a fortune for your health care so

you're paying not to have to pay it's

terrible anyway I got rid of it that's a

big deal that's a big deal

that was not easy our ambitious campaign

to reduce the price of prescription

drugs has produced the largest decline

in drug prices in more than 50 years you

see them and we're bringing them down

much slower and we're even gonna give

our state's you know the drug industry

has it pretty well wired drugs are very

expensive outside in other countries you

could buy the exact same drug for 50

percent 60 70 percent less than you pay

same drug same factory same company so

it's not like it different I just gave

Ron DeSantis governor Florida and I'm

giving other governors the right to go

to Canada and other states and other

countries other countries to buy the

drugs because they pay much less we can

cut our prices by 50 60 70 percent in

some cases so we're giving States the

rights to go to other countries and make

a deal on drugs it's easier than going

through this horrible system where the

Democrats refuse to allow you to do

anything to cut the price of drugs they

don't want to let you do it to help

patients with life-threatening

conditions we passed I love it right to

try so if you're terminally ill if

you're very sick we have the best

doctors and labs technicians in the

world they have so many different things

but it'll be four five six years you

couldn't get it you know why you're

terminally ill in their town we don't

want to make you sick you're terminally

ill you're gonna be around for four

weeks and they say we can't give you

this drug because it may hurt you

for 50 years they've been trying to get

it not that easy and I did it pretty

quickly I said you know what we'll do

we'll do these like little disclosures

that says you're not gonna sue the

government you're not gonna sue the drug

company you're not gonna have them

coming but people come in now they

signed and I tell you it's a miracle so

many people have been saved it's

incredible it's incredible they don't

have to wait six years

they'll be gone right to try proud of it

virtually every top Democrat also now

supports late term abortion ripping baby

straight from the mothers war right up

to the moment of birth that's why I've

asked Congress to prohibit extremely

term abortion because Republicans

believe that every child is a sacred

gift from God

Democrats are now the party of high

taxes high crime open borders late term

abortion socialism and blatant

corruption the Republican Party is the

party the American worker the American

family and the American Dream that's

what they want Republicans want the

American dream we have confirmed 100

people don't even believe this record

stuff 1 Obama gave me 140 to 140 to

federal judges I said how many do I have

I figured it was done so you have a

hundred and forty toys that you gotta be

kidding

within two months we'll have about a

hundred and eighty to federal judges

including Court of Appeals to apply the

laws written including two great Supreme

Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett

Kavanaugh our historic investment in

rebuilding the military has included

twenty five billion dollars to a place

called Barksdale Air Force Base over

here right here in Louisiana and forty

million dollars to Naval Air Station

joint Reserve Base New Orleans right and

our warriors have now more happiness

more missiles more rockets more tanks

more fighter jets and more of everything

our troops need to defend our nation

than we have ever had before and it's

all made in the USA

at the same time we're putting a stop to

the endless wars we have to bring our

folks back home Wars going on for 19

years and we're really police agents

we're not fighting wars that were just

policing and we can't do it not fair not

fair other countries should help us they

don't treat us right but this starting

to do you watch going into the Middle

East is one of the worst decisions ever

made in the history of our country it's

like quicksand

we spent eight trillion dollars in the

Middle East and then we want to fix up a

highway or we want to build your bridge

and they say sir it's a lot of money we

just spent eight trillion dollars in the

Middle East we got nothing for it we're

slowly and carefully bringing our great

soldiers and warriors back home after

decades of rebuilding foreign countries

we are finally rebuilding our own

country for years you watch as your

politicians apologize for America

remember that not so long ago not so

long ago remember bowing we don't like

the bow now you have a president who is

standing up for America and we are

standing up for the great people of

Louisiana

the path to victory begins with a giant

wind tomorrow right here in the great

state of Louisiana with your support we

will show the corrupt Democrats in

Washington that the American people are

not backing down we will never ever

forget we will send a terrific new

Republican governor to Baton Rouge

more products proudly stamped with the

four beautiful words made in the USA

science and medicine finding new cures

for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS

epidemic in America you didn't know that

this could be done it will be ended in

10 years we have the medicines to go can

you believe that and it could have been

started a long time ago and they didn't

do it but I'm doing it we've already

started 10 years the AIDS epidemic will

be n to think of that who would have

thought we could do that we will defend
