all of the different instances that you

recalled have you since been made aware

or remembered of other instances and if

so how many I guess I think it is

obvious that this is something that was

deeply regrettable I am wary of being

definitive about this because the recent

pictures that came out I had not

remembered there is no escaping this no

way to put Justin Trudeau's racist

Aladin costume back in the bottle and

now we know he's worn brown or black

face at least two other times this was

in 2001 he was 29 and a teacher at a

private school in Vancouver this is him

in high school in Montreal he wore black

face and sang the Harry Belafonte song

des Eaux and Global News has obtained

this video from a source in the

Conservative Party a third instance of

him wearing racist makeup there are

other people in the video too it was

shot in the early 90s the location is

unclear Trudeau said today he doesn't

remember it and he's wary of saying

definitively if there are other times he

did this for several decades Trudeau has

managed to keep this quiet

all of it another political crisis he

created himself through his own actions

his own poor judgment

now he's been forced to confront it

right in the middle of an election

campaign good evening and thanks for

joining us our chief political

correspondent David akin is traveling

with the Trudeau campaign

David people have been fired for this

kind of racist behavior you asked Justin

Trudeau directly today whether he

considered stepping aside what did he

say yeah well he's not getting fired as

the short and simple answer and well I

think a lot of people watching it may

say it's very admirable for him to

denounce his own racist behavior and as

he said take responsibility for it that

is the question I put to him why not

step aside we didn't get a chance to

talk about important issues here in

Manitoba while he was here it's all

about talking about his issues in his

problem so why not step aside his

liberal Leader

there's lots of leadership talent in the

Liberal caucus and let someone else lead

the party I asked him why he thought he

was so indispensable I will continue to

do the work that is necessary to keep us

moving forward in the right way

Canadians have an important choice to

make on October 21st and I trust

Canadians to make that right choice I

certainly hope that they will continue

to support us in the work that we're

doing but they might not and I know that

that is something that all Canadians get

to decide David you know the word

hypocrite comes to mind because Justin

Trudeau has championed minority rights

he's attacked political rivals for

intolerance that's less egregious than

this what is the political strategy to

try to overcome this we're gonna see I

guess in the next couple of days I mean

really we're in Terra incognito no

political strategist has ever seen this

no political reporter has ever seen a

situation like this it's very unusual

for an event like this to come into a

campaign and completely disrupt the

major brand of a political leader I mean

there's been examples most of them we

can probably point to in the United

States but I think we're into

unchartered waters for mr. Trudeau

certainly there are going to be liberals

who say the Justin Trudeau I've known

for the last four or five years bears no

resemblance to the young immature man 29

year old man who committed these

horrible racist acts when he was younger

and they're gonna stand stand by him in

that front but also importantly I asked

Trudeau if he was going to change the

tenor of his campaign they've been

digging up all these social media posts

that are embarrassing about their

opponents would that stop or would he

continue to attack and it sounds like

there's not gonna be much of a change

we're gonna continue to make contrasts

with our opponents and we're going to

continue to put forward strong pieces of

policy that will demonstrate how we

believe that investing in Canadians is

the right path forward David it will be

voters who decide the price Trudeau pays

for this can they trust a leader who

committed a racist act and kept silent

about it for years does it come down to

a matter of trust I think that may

emerge as the ballot quest you know

every election you're always wondering

what is

alik question I think this is gonna be

one of them can you trust the Prime

Minister that we didn't know about this

unless he got caught we didn't know

about SNC lavell n unless he got caught

we didn't know about the yaga Consul

Eagle vacation unless he got caught it

is going to come down I think to trust

do people really trust the Prime

Minister and people may do some you know

what I call moral math because I was

talking to everyday voters today of all

different backgrounds and though they're

very disappointed with these pictures

they've seen in Trudeau they also go but

that picture sticks in my mind of our

Prime Minister welcoming Syrian refugees

when no other country would take them

there's that Trudeau that does those

sorts of things that are mired by so

many around the world and then there's

this Trudeau when he just gets caught

out so it's going to come down to trust

do you trust that this is not going to

happen again

and he could be counted on to represent

Canada in this country and around the

world
