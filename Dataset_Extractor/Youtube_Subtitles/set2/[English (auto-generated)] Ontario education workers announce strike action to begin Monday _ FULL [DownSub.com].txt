good morning my name is Laura Walton I'm

the president of Ontario School Board

Council of unions and I've been leading

our negotiation team in Central Parking

on behalf of 55,000 education workers

represented by the Canadian union of

public employees or kewpie I'm here

today with Darcy me Katherine who is the

school boards coordinator for QP and I'm

also joined by Fred Hahn president of QP

Ontario representing all of our members

in every sector throughout the province

as you know QP members began work to

rule job action two days ago on Monday

September 30th our decision to work to

rule was taken after we had met with

representatives from the Ministry and

the council of trustees Association for

more than twenty days despite Q P's best

efforts we were not able to reach an

agreement that secured services for

Ontario students or delivered a fair

deal for the dedicated education workers

we represent we decided to initiate work

to rule in the hope that it would create

enough pressure to resolve the impasse

we had reached with the province and

school board trustees it was a step

towards meaningful progress that would

lead to a freely negotiated settlement

we were clear the intent was to apply

pressure to employers and the government

while maintaining student safety this

hasn't happened instead we are seeing

behavior from our employers that has

given us great concern without any

justification whatsoever from school

boards we have employers closing

programs and laying off workers some

boards are paying parents to do the work

of QP members some are asking students

as young as 10 and 11 to supervise

students across the province boards are

cutting more services and putting

students at greater risk this is not

safe and this is not sustainable

we have no choice but to invoke the next

step in the legal process we follow for

school board bargaining this morning QP

+ OS BC you gave the legal 5 day notice

that our school board members will

commence full strike action on Monday

October 7th even as we take this step we

are prepared to get a deal that will

avoid strike action we are inviting the

Council of Trustees Association and the

ministry back to the table for some hard

collaborative work we have cleared our

schedules and are available as soon as

possible if there is a fair deal to be

had parents students and the public can

be assured that QP will find it I commit

to the families of Ontario that our team

will be doing everything possible to

find a deal that is fair for everyone if

there is no fair deal to be reached make

no mistake

QP members are ready for full strike

action on October 7th I now invite Darcy

to share Thank You Laura I'm Darcy me

Catherine the Ontario School Board

coordinator for QP we understand that

this situation will be stressful for

students parents and communities in the

short term but this government's cuts

have hurt students and our schools

across the province and our focus has

always been to reverse this damage and

to secure services QP education workers

are determined to respond to the current

situation in a way that will ultimately

benefit students families and our

communities we do not take escalating

our work to rule to full strike lately

in fact we believe that a fair deal is

with in the provinces grasp there are

outstanding issues but QP always comes

to the table with solutions

the minister and school board trustees

have raised the issue of our members who

can't come to work because they are sick

and injured and it is true that this has

been a sticking point at our table we

have proposed other measures to address

the causes of absences improving return

to work protocols examining the effects

of excessive workloads and classroom

violence on sick leave we have solutions

we are ready to help them address the

concerns they have

we aim to secure services for students

services that allow them to get the most

out of their learning experience by

ensuring that they are safe healthy and

supported in schools these principles

inform every single one of our proposals

we invite the province and the CTA to

come to the bargaining table we urge

them to stop fixating on cuts that do

nothing to help our students and our

workers and instead to focus on securing

services for our students and ensuring

decent secure jobs for education workers

it's now my pleasure to introduce Fred

Hahn president of QB Ontario Thank You

Laura and thank you Darcy my name is

Fred Hana I am the president of QP and

Ontario we have 55,000 members who work

in our schools but we also have over

200,000 members who work for cities and

towns all throughout our healthcare

system and our social services and at

universities in every corner of the

province many are also parents and

grandparents of students in schools in

Ontario I'm here today to offer the full

support of our entire Union in the

efforts being put in by our school board

workers to use collective bargaining to

fight back against the cuts to services

in our schools from the beginning of

this process our school board membership

has been clear about their goal to

restore services lost by cuts but of the

provincial government to protect

services going forward and to do so in a

way that doesn't penalize our members

Quintero education workers deserve

respect students in our schools deserve

properly publicly funded and publicly

delivered education services our

communities need public services not

cuts but the four conservatives have cut

hundreds of millions of dollars from

Ontario's schools in the last year and

that's resulted in the loss of vitally

important services and supports for

students our education workers make on

average thirty eight thousand dollars a

year there's some of the lowest paid

workers in our public education system

the majority are women more than 70% of

them are laid off each and every summer

they faced years of cuts to the

important services they provide

they've already faced years of frozen

wages and wages that do not keep pace

with inflation they have already had

their charter rights violated

enough is enough our students our

schools our communities and these

workers deserve a fair negotiated

agreement they deserve better they

deserve services that will actually help

students and not penalize workers we're

proud to stand with keepeez o sbcu as

they push to negotiate a fair agreement

and we will stand with them and whatever

actions they have to take in order to do

that keep anteras committed to rallying

the support of our union parents and

communities in this critical fight for

fairness public services and respect

Thank You Fred in conclusion let me say

this make no mistake

Kewpie members are prepared to go on

strike we are ready we are ready to do

the hard work needed to prevent this

action

I hope the province and the CTA are

prepared to come to the table and do the

same I'm hoping that the government and

CTA wants to avoid a full walkout as

much as I do

I'm giving students and Families my

personal insurance that we will do what

it takes to get a fair deal that

protects the services and that both

sides can

to be fair I'm happy to take your

questions within minutes of work to rule

beginning on Monday school boards had

already taken the initiatives to have

children as young as 10 and 11 doing

supervision they started laying off

canceling programs we had one board that

sent out an incorrect memo stating that

we would not provide a medication to our

students they literally took the weekend

to figure out ways to reduce services

that are already at a critical point yes

yes in York Catholic we already have

seen them cancel their entire continuing

education program

programs canceled won't it exacerbate

the situation rather than Aleve it

definitely and this is to apply pressure

we don't see a work-to-rule the answer

to work to rule in the five days notice

is a way to have people we configure how

we're going to provide student services

instead they've essentially just started

withdrawing services even further than

what our work to rule lays out so there

may be a full strike in order to achieve

what we need the previous question you

know won't that put the breakfast clubs

programs at risk by striking so the sad

story about breakfast programs was in

2008 2012 we actually negotiated

additional service monies so that EA's

and you sees we're able to have a seven

hour workday which included doing the

breakfast program because we saw that as

a much needed services in our school in

the last eight years the government and

the school boards have made the

concerted effort to reduce all of those

services and have cut all of those

positions and have asked people to come

in volunteer to do it instead we hear

what folks are saying about the

breakfast program and we're making a

move to provide breakfast programs on

the lines polling stations at schools

across Ontario for the federal election

on October 21st what happens if this

strike continues until then well what

I'm hoping is that the government and

the CTA will get serious that will come

back to the bargaining table will

resolve the issues that are outstanding

will provide an agreement that is fair

for our members and preserves services

and that that we won't have to get there

if that does happen what's the

contingency plan

Elections Canada has already sent a list

some things like that yeah and and

they'll have to deal with that but

there's nothing that our members would

do that it would impede the democratic

process to allow people to vote Minister

last night and and one of the things

that he brought up was absenteeism and

that there's a you know a pretty high

percentage of educational support

workers that are absent and that you

know after eleven days pay is still 90

percent and that ends up costing boards

millions and millions of dollars for

budgets that are already strained and

that was one of the sticking points

allegedly um what's your response to

that and what do you have to tell

Ontarians that may see that as a waste

of money because most most folks don't

have ninety percent pay after eleven

days being off work but the minister

calls absenteeism is really the reality

that our members get sick at schools

anybody who has anybody who's a parent

who has a kid that gets sick knows that

their family members get sick you know

this happens in schools but absenteeism

or sick leave also includes people

who've been injured at work because

their workloads have increased because

other co-workers won't replace because

they were facing violent incidents no

and no small reason because there

weren't enough supports and services in

those schools and so our team has it as

well and is willing to address all of

those issues to figure this out to make

sure that that things make sense both

for our members and for students and for

school communities I can answer that

Travis so first of all it's an average

55,000 people across this province which

means that we do have people who

unfortunately receive diagnoses that

mean that they're going to be off work

for quite a sufficient amount of days

but we also have people who don't use

any days at all right so this is an

average the 15 days which is not the

correct number that we saw in the data

that proves that they provided but as an

average of 55,000 people so that takes

into account folks who have cancer

diagnosis who have done surgeries who

have had knee replacements there is a

number of reasons

folks are off sick we have said to them

we hear you but you're talking about

absenteeism that is a symptom of the

problem that is not the problem itself

let's get to the table and talk about

why folks are away from work and that is

going to bring out conversations such as

workload

such as workplace violence such as

workplace culture all of these things

will have to be addressed

you can't just point at ill people and

punish them in order to achieve minimal

savings we are opened up the invitation

today we have not and I do know that the

minister has gone on record saying that

we do I have asked for him to send those

to me again I have looked in my calendar

I have looked in my email I have not

seen a single offer of any dates that's

why we're here today saying let's get

these dates on the table let's get to

the table let's roll up our sleeves and

let's make this happen

definitely it's a and service security I

think many of the folks around here have

heard me say service security quite a

lot

we have huge concerns that we have

parents contacting us that there are not

EAS to get their children off buses that

there are libraries that are safe spaces

for some of our honorable student

population being closed because those

positions have been cut and it's quite

concerning when you take a look at the

financial accountability assessment and

learn that there is more money going to

upper management than is being provided

to those frontline workers that's a real

problem and we need to address the level

of services think the cuts need to be

reversed we need to maintain those

services and we need to improve them in

the future because our children deserve

nothing less

when I see detrimental effects on

students work to rule dances paying

canceled that sort of thing

the government is gonna say that you

guys are using students as pawns how do

you respond and what do you say to

students that are looking at a fairly

bleak future without you without you

guys doing so we had very heartwarming

piece come in to us today we're one of

the students in one of our high schools

went and tied a purple ribbon around

every single locker the public and the

students are standing by us they

understand that there may be some

short-term losses but in the end they

are seeing those losses because of what

this province and what the school boards

have already done when they are not able

to have classes that they need in order

to graduate and move on when we have the

government and the school boards

reducing our jobs which are good jobs

that our students could be performing in

the future they understand that we're

fighting for them number seven is do not

administer medication for clerical our

secretaries don't administer medication

medication is administered by EAS that's

what is assigned to the medically

fragile students clerical is the office

secretary they should not be doing

medication at all ppm what ppm 81

actually outlines that it's a legal

document and those are education

assistants that are aligned outlined in

the government's own policy we are

delivering medication that is not struck

work by our yeas I'm gonna take Collins

you know you guys have the work to real

campaign right now why is that not

enough why do you have to escalate this

to a full strike why can't a

work-to-rule get you to where you want

it yes definitely and you know what we

did for six weeks last time so I hear

what you're saying but we did not have

employers and the school boards and the

provinces making issues like they are

right now where they are actually

putting our students in jeopardy

no one who is 10 years old should be

assigned to look after to kindergarten

classes over lunch hour

reason that is happening and we have no

verification that that's happening that

you guys are making but the only reason

that is happening is because QP has

started work to rule in the first place

so who really is putting students safe

it wouldn't be happening at all if we

had enough services in the schools

that's like you brought that up a couple

times now parents might find a shock in

here 10 and 11 year olds looking after

students where is it happening can you

give us can you give us specific

examples I have several school boards

where it's been reported to us several

school boards where that's been reported

to us we even had one report coming in

where school board's tried to offer

students in high school volunteer hours

to do supervision which is actually a

violation because you cannot be doing

volunteer hours during school time in

accordance to the ministry so there are

several too many to sit here endless

today and the reports keep coming in

coming in coming in what is wonderful

about this is that our parents are

calling our hotlines and our parents are

talking to us about how concerned they

are they understand why they're doing

this what they don't understand is why

schools are being left open across this

province instead of the buzzer being

handed over to the administration as per

the work-to-rule document principals

have chosen to unlock the doors and

leave them unlocked

why are you informing the media first

before the Ministry of Education about

the strike action because as of ten

minutes ago government didn't know that

this was happening that would be

incorrect they just saved it earlier

this morning they received it at 9:30

this morning so half an hour notice

before you guys publicly when reading

your articles it seemed like many people

already knew about it already

quick question about whether what it

would signal to you if the government

recall the legislature to legislate you

back to work that would be a mistake

these workers have already had their

rights violated once they're not

prepared to go through that again what

people should be doing is taking their

time and energy to go sit at a

bargaining table and resolve the issues

in a way that provides services for

students and doesn't penalize our

members that should be the focus

but the timing of this the timing okay

the political timing can you say

anything to persuade people that this

doesn't have to do with the fact that

there's a federal election campaign and

you know it might actually you know harm

the Conservative Political Fellows of

the Ford government to have terrorist

goals in a strike during election time

one would suggest that the action of

this government since June of 2018 are

sufficient to already have done harm we

are choosing this because this is the

time for our members we came in very

early into the bargaining process to try

and achieve a deal before school even

went back and then you give a

work-to-rule campaign a very short

amount of time to work Mike the public

not think you're trying to create chaos

in the Ontario school system to benefit

other political parties and hurt

conservative and your share the only

chaos that has been created in this

system is as a result of the cuts of the

provincial government and of course

we're campaigning against those cuts as

our parents as our communities as our

families and of course we've got to use

every tool that we have as a union to

try to protect services for students to

try to protect the work that our members

do that's what that's what our members

are doing with collective bargaining the

timing of the collective agreements

happen to coincide with the timing of a

federal election that was not timing of

our choosing can schools

stay open and you know our our support

workers striking because or does the

Union know if teachers are not far

behind so that would be taken on a

case-by-case basis and it really is

dependent on the level of services of

the people that we represent in that

school I do have school boards where we

only represent one particular employee

group I don't know if they would shut

down versus a school board where we

represent a fairly diverse group it

really will be left I would assume

unless the minister chooses

differently I would assume that it would

be up to each local school board to make

that decision I'm aware that effo is

doing strike votes as we speak workers

in general regardless of what the job

title is our really frustrated and it's

frustrating when you're sitting at a

bargaining table and you're having

someone attack some of your most

vulnerable members and asking them to

head towards poverty just because

they've received a diagnosis that's

frustrating and I can see how other

teacher groups are following along and

doing what they need to do I respect

them I support them they know their

membership best and will do what's in

the best interest of their membership

just as we do what's in the best

interest of ours we've had some really

good discussions and then we've had some

other discussions that are not very

fruitful and I don't think that's any

different than any other negotiation

table everyone comes in with a mandate

you know I will run folks you know we

did work to rule for six weeks under the

Liberal government's as well goes to the

crown and to the chair of the Council of

Trustees Association yes it would it

goes to the crown who then gives it to

the ministry when did you guys arrive at

this decision to escalate so it's been a

long couple of days where we've been

fielding these calls in the decision was

placed we brought in together all of our

leaders again last night and the

decision was taken last night

in the system with disabilities are you

concerned that a strike means that many

of them would not be able to go to

school I'm also concerned that the

future they have right now under this

current government and the way the

school boards are going are not

providing them the supports that they

require day in and day out and I say

that as a parent of someone with

learning disabilities before this press

conference this morning about this five

day notice it was going to be given and

if those discussions did take place were

there any discussions about teachers

crossing the picket line should those

discussions we gave our partners a heads

up as we would because we all work

together in schools and discussions are

ongoing about solidarity and support but

each of the teachers unions that we have

been in touch with have expressed their

support in solidarity for our members

we're going to talk to them about that

and figure it out oh we do have someone

here to speak French today

okay well look that would be ideal I

think it would be ideal because what we

want here is pressure to resolve these

issues so that our schools can function

and so that people can just get back to

doing the jobs they love but they're

dedicated to I know our goal is to

achieve a collective agreement that

actually restores the services that work

overseas well if if that is a decision

that the government takes but by way of

their actions and it will be their

actions that lead us there you made one

quick allegation I believe that the

front doors of schools aren't being lost

yes is there an understanding of what

you know potential

you know negative outcome could be from

that absolutely we asked we never asked

for the doors to be unlocked if you look

at the documents that were provided we

have said that they need to return the

buzzer system over to the administration

it's the school boards in the

administration who have taken the tactic

to unlock the schools rather than

continuing using the buzzer system they

would be the ones choosing to leave the

door we did not there's nothing in ours

that says that it actually clearly

states to return the use of the buzzer

to the administration I know you said

previously worked rule campaigns have

been much longer what was carrying on

but we're still going to begin tearing

continuing this on we're not stopping

work to rule we're going to continue on

that factor is just the extent that the

school boards are doing unlocking doors

is a really good example that's not a

safe practice that was not done last

time we're willing to go back to the

bargaining table and have good

discussions about where we need to be in

order to achieve a fair collective

agreement that is going to provide

services to our students schools and

communities but also ensure that our

members are taken care of

nope if you see any light at the end of

the tunnel let's say Sunday night

Monday morning are you guys willing to

absolutely the goal here is to get a

collective agreement Oh confident are

you that you have the public support
