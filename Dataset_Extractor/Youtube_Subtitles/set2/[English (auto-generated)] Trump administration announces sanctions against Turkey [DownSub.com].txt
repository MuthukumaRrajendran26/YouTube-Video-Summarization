since the Turkish military across the

border into Syria President Trump has

been regularly briefed and monitoring

developments and has expressed his great

concern about the loss of civilian lives

and the impact and the destabilizing

impact the Turkish military invasion in

Syria is having in the region today here

at the White House the president

convened a principals committee meeting

recommendations were made and to the

president in just a few moments all

recognized the Treasury Secretary who

will detail punishing sanctions that

have been placed on Turkey president

also today was very active engaging with

leaders in the region first a telephone

call with Kurdish general Moslem where

he received a report about the

circumstances on the ground

Syrian defense forces have been a strong

ally of the United States of America the

president was very very interested in

hearing from from Jevon general Muslim

about the status of forces on the ground

a general Muslim reported to him that at

this point Turkish forces had not gone

beyond the 30 mile buffer zone but

general Muslim expressed particular

concern about the city of kobani and

asked the President to raise that issue

directly with president air dhawan and

the Turkish government as a as a great

concern of Kurdish forces

for the president after that call spoke

to president air21 president era Diwan

reached out and requested the call and

president Trump communicated to him very

clearly that the United States of

America wants Turkey to stop the

invasion to implement an immediate

ceasefire and to begin to negotiate with

Kurdish forces in Syria to bring an end

to the violence

president Trump reiterated his offer to

mediate and arbitrate a negotiation

between Syrian defense forces and the

Turkish military and the president has

directed me and Robert O'Brien to lead a

delegation to Turkey in the immediate

future but to begin discussions and

negotiations to bring the bloodshed to

an end

the President did receive a commitment

from president air Dewan to not attack

the city of kobani as I said general

Moslem had raised the issue of kobani as

a paramount importance to the Kurdish

population president Trump was very

direct with president air21 on that

point and received a firm commitment

from President air21 that there would be

no attack against the city of kobani

today the president also met with

Senator Lindsey Graham who was present

when the President signed an executive

order implementing a new range of

sanctions against Turkey but again to be

very clear the president of the United

States called on the president turkey to

stop the invasion to enact an immediate

ceasefire and to begin to negotiations

with Kurdish forces in Syria and the

president has directed me to lead a

delegation to Turkey but to begin those

discussions about how we can bring

we can bring this violence to an end

with that let me recognize the Treasury

secretary will describe the new

sanctions that have been implemented

today Thank You mr. vice president so as

you know last week the front the

president announced that there would be

sanctions forthcoming if Turkey moved

forward with these actions last Friday I

briefed you on the specifics of the

authorities today the president signed

those authorities and instructed me to

put them into action so effective

immediately

we have sanctioned three of the

ministers the Minister of Defense the

Minister of Interior and the Minister of

Energy we have also sanctioned the

Department of Defense and the Department

the Ministry of Energy these sanctions

are both primary sanctions as well as

secondary sanctions for any financial

institutions that are doing significant

transactions I'd like to specifically

say that with these with these sanctions

we will be simultaneously issuing two

general licenses the first general

license will be very clear that the

United Nations and other NGOs that are

conducting humanitarian responses will

be able to continue I'd also like to be

clear that we will be issuing a license

for the US government and parties of the

US government to continue operations

with Turkey

as well as we will be issuing a license

so that Turkey can continue to buy fuel

we are not looking to shut down the

energy for the people of Turkey license

number two will authorize a 30 day wind

down period for all the general

operations to allow for ordinary

business the president has been very

clear these sanctions are very very

strong he is prepared to remove these

sanctions if there is the necessary

actions on Turkey's appointment again we

will be issuing a press release

detailing the specifics of this and the

appropriate licenses with that I'm happy

to take two or three questions on the

technical issues associated with the

sanctions mr. secretary question for you

on what is going to be the redline that

will lift these sanctions essentially

you just said that the president is

willing to do so what are the conditions

that president air Dewan has to me is it

a ceasefire as the vice president said

mr. vice president a question for you

why is the president confident that

these sanctions are not too little too

late to stop what's happening on the

border well water I'll answer the why

not too little too late and I'll ask

I'll let the vice president answer the

issue

we can take the removal as we've warned

all along our desire is not to shut down

the Turkish economy our desire is to see

a appropriate response these sanctions

will be very severe on the Turkish

economy we can continue to ramp up these

sanctions so we're very clear in warning

the government of the sanctions we were

deliberate last Friday and not putting

them in place the president has been

monitoring the situation and the

concerns and with that I'll turn it over

the vice president president from made

it very clear that the United States is

going to continue to take actions

against Turkey's economy until they

bring the violence to an end

what an immediate ceasefire and we want

to begin negotiations between Turkey and

Syria Defense Forces president Trump

again offered at the United States of

America mediate those discussions but

from from very early on the president's

been very clear we have great concerns

about civilian populations we have great

concerns about religious minorities

Christians and other religious

minorities within the area where the

where the Turkish invasion is currently

underway and of course we have concern

about Isis fighters who are being held

by Kurdish forces today now general

Muslim did give the president an

assurance that the Kurdish forces would

continue to to support the prisons that

detain Isis fighters but the president's

also made it clear to Turkey that we

expect them to take efforts to continue

to restrain and ensure the ongoing

detention of any any Isis fighters

captured over the

two years of fighting but the

president's objective here is very clear

that the sanctions that were announced

today will continue and will worsen

unless and until turkey embraces an

immediate ceasefire stops the violence

and agrees to negotiate a long-term

settlement of the issues along the

border between Kirkenes here what did

the president authorized in his

conversation initially with President

Erdogan a week ago on Sunday did he

authorized any military action by the

Turks short of what we've seen so far

and then secondly sir you say that the

president asked for a ceasefire what did

her Dewan say in response to that did he

commit to anything well the United

States of America did not give a green

light the turkey to invade Syria

president has been very clear on that

point and reiterated that to present

their to wanted a that president air

Dhawan I think notice president Trump's

mind on this matter very clearly today

President Trump pressed him very

strongly in the telephone call today to

immediately embrace a cease fire

as I said he's directed me to lead a

delegation will be leaving as quickly as

possible to travel into the region to

pursue a ceasefire and a negotiated

settlement but the president the

president looked he said from the time

he was a candidate and forward that he

wanted to bring an end to endless wars

and opportunities for us to bring troops

home to have American forces come out of

harm's way has always been a priority

for this president but that didn't mean

that this president

in any way in any way encourages

violence anywhere in the world let alone

along the border between Turkey and

Syria the President reiterated that

point to President Merida want today and

we're going to continue to stand very

strongly the sanctions that have been

imposed today are a beginning president

Trump made it very clear that we will

continue to use the strength of this

economy and and will continue to engage

our allies president spoke to president

McCrone of France today we're going to

be engaging allies around the world and

as president Trump did today we're going

to continue to call on President air to

want to end the violence come to the

table and embrace it ago she has the

visit with erawan been canceled and can

you tell us specifically what is the

United States going to do about all of

the Isis fighters that have escaped from

the jails as our reporters on the ground

have indicated

well there's been no decision made about

a scheduled meeting that's month that's

still on the table is it still a

possibility well let me say the

president could not have been more firm

with president erawan today the United

States of America simply not going to

tolerate

Turkey's invasion of Syria that any

further we're calling on Syria to stand

down the end to violence and come to the

negotiating table and that's the reason

the president's sending me to the region

to make his agenda very clear and we're

going to be looking we're going to be

looking for Turkey to take strong action

in that regard the president also made

it clear when he talked to the general

Muslim of the Kurdish forces when he

talked to President air21

that we anticipate and expect that

Kurdish forces and Turkish forces will

safeguard and ensure the ongoing

detention of Isis forces some of them

have already escaped general Moslem told

me told the president today in his words

we keep Isis under control

he made that commitment to the president

and and president air Dhawan also knows

where President Trump stands but make no

mistake about it

president is very concerned about

instability in the region's very

concerned about the loss of innocent

civilian lives is very concerned about

religious minorities and that's why

today at the president's direction the

United States has imposed punishing

sanctions on Turkey and made it very

clear that that will only be the

beginning

unless turkey is willing to embrace his

ceasefire come to the negotiating table

and the
