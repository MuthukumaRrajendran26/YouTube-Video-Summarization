for indigenous people mr. Schurr we'll

start with those things well strut with

you here we go again and I wore my

orange turban again about anyways though

Casio ten most serious that's a very

serious question if you see what I've

seen is mr. trudeau he talks a lot of he

talks a good games publicly about the

decisions he makes privately

are the problem when it comes to

indigenous communities if there was a

willingness to do something right away

it could be done it's as simple as that

if the decision was to fund indigenous

kids the same way as other Canadian kids

that could be done it shouldn't have to

go to court I would respect these

communities it's a matter of dignity if

you start with that recognition it could

solve so many problems equal funding

thank you is the starting point thank

you
