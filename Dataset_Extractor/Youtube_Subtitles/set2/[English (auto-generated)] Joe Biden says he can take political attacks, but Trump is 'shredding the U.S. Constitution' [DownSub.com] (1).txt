ladies and gentlemen 47th vice president

of the United States Joe Biden thank you

for being here when I announced I was

running for president I said I'd believe

that the core values of this nation our

very democracy was at risk an events in

recent days have made that even clearer

not only me but I think everyone whoever

president who believes there's no limit

to his power for the President believes

he can do anything and get away with it

if a president who believes he is above

the law

pursuing the leader of another nation to

investigate a political opponent tell

puentez election is not the conduct of

an American president the allegations

that blocked hundreds of millions of

dollars he blocked tennis moves in

dollars and congressionally approved

date to another country as an allegation

unless he agreed to smear a political

opponent is not the conduct of America

president denying Congress information

which it is constitutionally entitled to

and obstructing its efforts to

investigate actions is not the conduct

of an American president it's an abuse

of power it undermines our national

security it violates his oath of office

and it strikes at the heart of the sworn

responsibility of the president a

president has to put national interest

before personal injury I knew when I

decided to run this president would

attack me and anyone else we thought

would be a threat to his

we needed you well that's what he does

that's what he's always done and know

that even though every reputable

publication has looked at the charge

that has been made against me and I

found the baseless um untrue and without

merit that's not about to stop him I can

take the political attacks they'll come

and they'll go and in time they'll soon

be forgotten but if we allow a president

to get away with shredding the United

States Constitution that will last

forever

too many people so many good decent

people have taken the oath to this

nation and given their lives over the

past 243 years to let that happen

too many people are serving this nation

right now and honor in do they have

taken to let that happen this isn't a

democratic issue a Republican issue it

is a national issue it is a security

issue this time for this administration

to stop stonewalling to provide the

Congress of all the facts

it needs including a copy of the formal

complaint made by the whistleblower and

it's time for the Congress to fully

investigate the conduct of this prisoner

the president should stop stonewalling

this investigation and all the other

investigations into his alleged

wrongdoing using its full constitutional

authority Congress in my view should

demand the information it has a legal

right to receive the Congress does not

and the president is not does not comply

with such a request in the Congress he

continues to obstruct Congress and flunk

the law Donald Trump will leave Congress

it might be no choice but to initiate

impeachment that would be a tragedy but

a tragedy of his own making I've always

believed and still do that America is a

truly special and unique nation better

than any

other nation in history we have made the

experiment of self-government work we

have always been a beacon to other

countries around the world we know who

Donald Trump is it's time to let the

world know who we are

thank you very much
