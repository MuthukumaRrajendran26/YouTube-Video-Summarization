I go rent the bed and then I Drive it

take it downtown to Toronto and I just

start using it as a weapon

alik Minassian accused of Toronto's

deadly young street van attack wearing a

white prison jumpsuit sits in the corner

of an interrogation room and carefully

describes in detail one of the most

horrific days in the city's history the

planning began a month earlier I was at

Seneca College and I decided to form

writer and book a either a truck or a

van with done and they had a ten-foot

ban available van was too perfect a

medium size to use as my weapon in the

library of Seneca College where

Minassian had just completed a four-year

software development program he says he

made a call to rent a van can I ask why

you chose April 23 I it was I felt it

would be a more symbolic if I had

completed my exams Minassian recalls

paying a $400 deposit for a carefully

chosen vehicle because it would be large

enough to inflict severe damage the

morning of April 23rd 2018 began like

any other for Minassian around 7 a.m. I

have breakfast I brush nothing

unusual then a walk around his

neighborhood sometime at home on the

computer

I just wanted to pass the time until he

left took the bed and brought it out to

Toronto and a pen and I come in at the

mr. bellos act now what are you thinking

while you're in the man I'm thinking

that this is it this is the day of

retribution it was a warm sunny spring

afternoon when Alec Minassian arrived on

Yonge Street an area he says he knew

would be packed with people and it was

shortly before 1:30 he says he pulls his

man up to an intercept and it stopped at

a red light he waited for it to turn

green and as soon as I saw there were

pedestrians I just decided to go for it

ok I floor the pedal I speed the van

towards them and I allow the van to

collide with them seven minutes of

Terror along a lengthy stretch of North

York and then the venn came to a stop

actually to be honest the only reason I

stopped my attack was because someone's

drink got splashed on my windshield and

I was worried that I would crushed van

anyway so I decided ok now I wanted to

do more but I've kind of been foiled by

a lack of visibility I see a patrol car

pulled over and I hear the cop screaming

at me to get out an exchange with

Toronto police constable Ken lab

captured on iPhone video your plan was

to die by suicide by cop I reached into

my pocket with my left hand and quickly

pulled it out and you formed my hand

into the shape of a gun like this what

do you hope that he would panic and she

so he explains why he got down on the

ground if I'm gonna live I'd rather not

encounter physically and painful

experience so I decided I have no choice

but to admit the heat at that point

Minassian was handcuffed and arrested

not the usual everyday experience ten

people died sixteen were injured I feel

like I accomplished my mission if the

families of those people who were

murdered and were injured we're in this

room right now what would you say I

honestly don't know what I would say
