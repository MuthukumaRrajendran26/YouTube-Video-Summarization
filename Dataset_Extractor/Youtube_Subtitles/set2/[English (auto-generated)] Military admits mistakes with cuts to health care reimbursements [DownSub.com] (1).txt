a global news exclusive report on

military healthcare funding is getting

the right attention tonight the story

was front and center on the election

campaign trail and triggered the Alberta

government to demand changes military

brass are admitting the Department of

National Defense shouldn't have made

cuts to hospital health care payments

without consultation the Canadian Forces

also made a major promise today that it

won't allow a multi-million dollar

shortfall to happen our Ottawa bureau

chief Mercedes Stevenson broke the story

yesterday she joins us now Mercedes

because of your reporting the military's

acknowledged it made a mistake what

exactly are they saying the military is

saying that they tried to do too much

too fast reversing a decision now to

drop the rates that they reimburse

hospitals at now it's important to stop

here Robin and to note that people in

the Canadian Armed Forces don't get the

same health care as those of us who are

in the provinces they're covered by the

federal government now they were looking

at a situation where people were paying

up to five times as much as

interprovincial rates and the military

said we'll hold on here that seems like

a lot of money perhaps we can save some

it came from a position of trying to get

costs under control

but what ended up happening is that the

military unilaterally published rates

and that those rates were so low they

matched that of what the federal

government pays for refugees the

province has said that would not even

begin to cover the cost now the defense

minister who is running right now as a

Liberal candidate as well put his

Defense Minister hat back on and spoke

to Global News about this saying that

the reasons for trying to get this under

control was that they feel the practices

being used by hospitals were unfair

here's what he had to say as it stands

now a member of the kingdom forces when

they get treated at a hospital

pays more for the service than a

Canadian just because they don't be just

because they wear a uniform and that is

wrong

so the military healthcare system has

been under significant strain and they

said while perhaps this is somewhere

that we can cut after all military

members and the Canadian military both

pay into provincial healthcare with

their taxes it's not unusual for the

federal government who has

responsibility for people like inmates

the Canadian military and the RCMP to

pay for their care but this is just too

much so the effort perhaps coming from a

place that made sense but they're saying

that the way that they went about it was

the wrong way and they will now continue

to pay those original higher rates until

they're able to come to an agreement

with the provinces ok Mercedes how are

things changing now well we can tell you

that as in terms of what's changing some

of the promises that are being made

Robin first of all money has been moved

around inside the military healthcare

budget as it faces significant pressures

for things like increased requirements

for mental healthcare and a force that

has come back from Afghanistan all of

that put at risk millions of dollars

that needed to go towards care so the

military tonight is promising number one

they will not allow there to be a

shortfall in the funds for military

healthcare and number two they say if

any soldier sailor or airman a woman is

charged for seeing a doctor and one

Hospital in particular was threatening

to do this that they will make sure that

bill is covered nobody will pay out of

pocket for their bills and that they

will make sure that the military

healthcare budget stays on track
