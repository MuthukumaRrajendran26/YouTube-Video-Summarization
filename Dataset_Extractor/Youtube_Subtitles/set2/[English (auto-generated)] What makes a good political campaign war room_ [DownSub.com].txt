hello I'm Mercedes Stevenson and this is

the West block politics perspectives and

players political war rooms it's the

center of operations for an election

campaign it is here where decisions are

made that determine how party leaders

respond to events how events will be

staged and what their attack strategy

will be against their political

opponents so who determines the makeup

of a war room anyhow and how it will

operate during the campaign today

perspectives from three war room

strategists who know the drill and

McGrath for the NDP Fred de Laurie for

the Conservatives and Richard Mahoney

for the Liberals my name is Fred de

Laurie I'm a conservative strategist

okay hi I'm Ann McGrath and I'm a

longtime NDP strategist and campaigner

and advisor hi my name is Richard

Matheny I'm a longtime liberal campaign

strategist to run campaigns at the

federal provincial level so war room is

a part of the campaign office sometimes

they're they're kind of confused amongst

each other campaign offices were the

entire national campaign would would sit

with tour rapid-response target seats

field operations and the management the

war room is the Rapid Response part of

the of the campaign office in which you

have a number of staff it could be five

to thirty that are sitting in are

usually one room TV screens all over the

place they're tracking everything that's

going on across the country news wise

and politics wise they've got their

laptops up and they're the ones that are

they're the Rapid Response Team for the

for the campaign they're the ones that

are looking tracking the other leaders

and and of course the roam leader what

you do is you look at who's who's got

some experience who are the up and

comers because you want to have the mix

in a war room because it has to be it

has to be a vibrant place that has to be

energetic it has to have a lot of ideas

that are generated in it so you want to

look for that mix of experience and

bright young new enthusiastic

campaigners who have something to say

and often have some really creative

ideas and we've Liberal Party has looked

at at the federal provincial level how

other parties have done it and so forth

in fact a lot of that was inspired by a

great documentary called the war

on the 1992 Clinton campaign which

actually because they let the cameras in

maybe when they shouldn't have showed a

lot of people that things had really

modernized that the the rate of response

even back then that was required was so

fast that you had to really change the

way you worked and so that's been

happening I think all the time and today

you know you've the story's developed so

quickly you can get the kernel of a

story that breaks in the morning kind of

morphed into a totally different story

across the country by midday or even

earlier the rapper respond to the war

room is set up to contrast with your

opponents there's some call it attack

and also to defend your meter and

campaign team I would say all the worms

are actually pretty well functionally

the same they're all set up very

similarly they all have the same tasks

at hand I don't think there'd be a

different much of a difference between

any of them they're quite

interchangeable you know the news that

day you know when you know when you've

been able to knock another campaign off

their game that's always a kind of an

interesting day and you you know by the

feel of it like so for instance you know

a headquarters in a war room that is on

its game has a kind of a buzzy feel

there's a there's a lot of ideas going

around people feel kind of enthusiastic

and energetic and happy with with their

accomplishments so you can really tell I

mean it's just like there's a buzz in

the room there are so many things that

go into an election campaign how a

leader connects how he performs

extraneous events that happen in the

course of a campaign every day that you

don't see coming but basically the war

room is key but you're smart really

seasoned people they're looking for

things to do to make sure that your

message gets out there and things that

you know you might need to defend

against when your opponents are

attacking you so that all happens in a

kind of collective energize sometimes

coffee fueled sort of group so yeah I

mean I you can never say what is the one

thing to want to campaign or war lost a

campaign

but as that film shows you it was that

kind of creative smarts around that

around that team that probably did a lot

to deal with you there so it's hard to

know but a key part of it that's all the

time we have for today thanks so much

for joining us for the West block I'm

Mercedes Stevenson
