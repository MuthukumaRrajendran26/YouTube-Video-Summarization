effective today I am no longer leader of

the Green Party of Canada Elizabeth May

hasn't hidden the fact she's done being

a political leader just not done with

politics I wanted to choose a moment

when we had had a lot of success before

leaving the party had high hopes of

winning more seats in 2019 the Greens

landed with free MPs in Ottawa and 6.4

percent of the popular vote that's the

best result for any Green Party in the

world under first-past-the-post system

it's always been a challenge for greens

to elect additional MPs because of the

discriminatory electoral system

[Applause]

may a lifelong environmentalist took the

helm of the party in 2006

it wasn't easy being green and a party

of one

this is a woman who came in with a group

of political activists and created a

national party that could hold its own

on the national stage the new leader

will be picked in October 2020 and will

have to be election ready because the

minority government could fall at any

time they will be hoping for candidates

for the leadership who have a relatively

high profile who are known quantities at

least regionally ideally nationally and

have a strong reputation that can build

on what Elizabeth May herself has has

built thus far the opening creates an

opportunity for provincial green leaders

who've had historic wins Quebec's Alex

Terrell is already considering what will

be a tough job going beyond the existing

pockets of support and building a

stronger party is a real uphill

challenge in Canada's first past the

post electoral system may is staying put

as an MP she's even considering the

speaker's job after the next election

but her first priority you can't

postpone the decision it just makes

sense thank you very much stepping aside

for the sake of the party's fortunes

when the writ drops Robin Gill Global
