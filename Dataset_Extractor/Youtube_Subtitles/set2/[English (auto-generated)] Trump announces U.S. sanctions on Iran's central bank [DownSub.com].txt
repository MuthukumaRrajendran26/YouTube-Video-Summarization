so if I may intercede for just a second

we have just sanctioned the Iranian

National Bank that is their central

banking system and it's going to be at

the highest level of sanctions

so that just took place in a couple of

other things we have our Secretary of

Treasury here Steve minuchin if you want

to say just a word Steve before we begin

mr. president as you instructed me we

are continuing the maximum pressure

campaign this is the last remaining

source of funds so both the Central Bank

of Iran Israel well as the National

Development Fund which is their

sovereign wealth fund will be cut off

from our banking system so this will

mean no more funds going to the rgc or

the fund terror and this is on top of

our oil sanctions and our financial

institutions sanctions thank you mr.

president is very big we've we've now

cut off all source of funds to our n

that does right to the tub right to the

tub okay yes right to the touch thank

you very much thank you appreciate it so

we're dealing with many nations we're

dealing with some of the neighbors to

Saudi Arabia and of course we're dealing

with Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is very

much involved from the standpoint of

what we're doing and what they're doing

and we're working together with others

we're also working on the cost of this

whole endeavor and Saudi Arabia's been

very generous we want to see if it works

out and if it works out that's great and

if it doesn't work out that's great in

the end it always works out that's the

way it is it always works out so you'll

be seeing certain things happening but a

very major factor is what we did these

are the highest sanctions ever imposed

on a country we've never done it to this

level and it's too bad what's happening

with Iran it's going to hell

doing poorly they're practically broke

they are broke and they could fought

they could solve the problem very easily

all they have to do is stop with the

terror

they have been the number one as you

know Scot very well number one country

worldwide of terra between sponsoring it

and doing it themselves and we can't

have it they have a tremendous potential

they have an incredible potential I can

think I can speak on behalf of Australia

too and the sense that would like to see

them do very well we were discussing it

before the prime minister myself we want

to see them to do well but it looks to

me like with what's happening maybe they

want to keep going at it and when they

go at it with us there's no way they win

no way they went in any way or in any

capacity
