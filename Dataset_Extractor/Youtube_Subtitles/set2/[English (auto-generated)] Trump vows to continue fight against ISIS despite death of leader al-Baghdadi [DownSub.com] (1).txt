US President Donald Trump making a

surprise announcement at the White House

saying one of the most wanted terrorists

in the world has been killed Abu Bakar

al Baghdadi is dead he was the founder

and leader of Isis the most ruthless and

violent terror organization anywhere in

the world

no US military personnel were killed but

the president says a large number of el

bog Dottie's fighters were eliminated

during the raid at a compound in

northwestern Syria and the terrorist

leader tried to hide he died after

running into a dead-end tunnel

whimpering and crying and screaming all

the way the US Defense Secretary says al

Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest

killing himself and three children mark

espera says that terrorist body was

mutilated but test results gave a

positive identification we have

confirmation - through a form of visual

and also some DNA confirmation

the president says capturing or killing

the founder of Isis was a top priority

it came after the president faced

scathing criticism for pulling US troops

from the turkish-syrian border leading

to the slaughter of hundreds of Kurds US

allies and the escape of hundreds of

Isis soldiers but the president is still

vowing to continue the fight we were in

the compound for approximately two hours

and after the mission was accomplished

we took highly sensitive material and

information from the raid the president

says al Baghdadi was under US

surveillance for about two weeks some

world leaders welcomed the news of his

death this reflects the United resolve

of the free countries led by the United

States to fight the forces of terror the

terror organizations and the terrorist

States but other struck notes of caution

I think is a game changer in the war on

terror the war is by no means over the

president vice president pence and

several military leaders watched the

raid in real time from the White House

Situation Room the president says Russia

Syria and Iraq all supported the raid

and he warned other terrorists

throughout the world they should never

sleep soundly
