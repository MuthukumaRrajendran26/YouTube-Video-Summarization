madam secretary madam Speaker governor

friends colleagues staff the seeds on

good soil the parable of the sower tells

us stands for those with a noble and

good heart who hear the word retain it

and by persevering produce a crop the

seed on good soil Elijah Cummings came

from good sort

and in this sturdy frame goodness took

root

his parents were sharecroppers from the

south

they picked tobacco and strawberries and

then sought something better in this

city South Baltimore and Robert worked

shifts at a plant and Ruth cleaned other

people's homes they became parents of

seven preachers to a small flock I

remember I had the pleasure of meeting

Eliza's mother Ruth and she told me she

prayed for me every day and I knew it

was true and I felt better for it

sometimes people say they're praying for

you and you don't know

they might be praying about you but you

don't know if they're praying for you

but I knew miss Ruth was telling the

truth so they were the proverbial salt

of the earth and they passed on that

strength and that grit but also that

kindness and that faith to their son as

a boy

Elijah's dad made him shine his shoes

and tie his tie and they'd go to the

airport not to bore their planes but to

watch others do it

I remember Elijah telling me this story

Robert would say I have not flied I may

not fly but you will fly one day we

can't afford it right now but you will

fly as grandmother as Elijah related and

as grandmother's do was a little more

impatient with her advice your daddy

she said he'd been waiting and waiting

and waiting for a better day don't you

wait and Elijah did not wait against all

odds

Elijah earned his degrees he learned

about the rights that all people in this

country are supposed to possess with

little help apparently from Perry Mason

Elijah became a lawyer to make sure that

others had rights and his people had

their god-given rights and from the

Statehouse to the House of

Representatives his commitment to

justice and the rights of others would

never ever waver

Elijah's example the son of parents who

rose from nothing to carve out just a

little something the public servant who

toiled to guarantee the least of us have

the same opportunities that he had

earned a leader who once said he'd die

for his people

even as he lived every minute for them

his life validates the things we tell

ourselves about what's possible in this

country not guaranteed but possible the

possibility that our destinies are not

preordained but rather through our works

and our dedication and our willingness

to open our hearts to God's message of

love for all people we can live a

purposeful life that we can reap a

bountiful harvest but we are neither

sentenced to wither among the rocks nor

assured of bounty but we have the

capacity the chance as individuals and

as a nation to root ourselves in good

soil

Alijah understood that that's why I

fought for justice that's why he

embraced this beloved community of

Baltimore that's why he went on to fight

for the rights and opportunities of

Forgotten people all across America not

just in his district

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

he was never complacent free knew that

without clarity of purpose in a

steadfast faith and the dogged

determination demanded by our Liberty

the promise of this nation can wither

complacency he knew was not only

corrosive for our collective lives but

for our individual lives it's been

remarked that Elijah was a kind man I

tell my daughters and I have to say

listening to Elijah's daughter speak

that got me choked up I'm sure those of

you have sons feel the same way but

there's something about daughters and

their father

and I was thinking I'd want my daughters

to know how much I love them but I'd

also want them to know that being a

strong man includes being kind

that there's nothing weak about kindness

and compassion

there's nothing weak about looking out

for others there's nothing there's

nothing weak about being honorable

you're not a sucker to have integrity

and to treat others with respect

I was sitting here and I was just

noticing the Honorable Elijah Eve comes

and you know this is a title that we

confer on all kinds of people who get

elected to public office

we're supposed to introduce them as

honorable but but Elijah Cummings was

honorable before he was elected office

there's a difference

there's a difference if you were

honorable and treated others honorably

[Applause]

outside the limelight on the side of a

road in a quiet moment counseling and

somebody who work with letting your

daughters know you love them you know as

president I knew I could always count on

Elijah being honorable and doing the

right thing and people have talked about

his voice there is something about his

voice it just made you feel better you

know there are some people that you have

that deep baritone a prophetic voice and

when it was good times and we achieved

victories together that voice and that

laugh was a gift but you needed it more

during the tough times when the path

ahead looked crooked when obstacles

abounded when I entertained doubts or I

saw those who were in the fight start to

waver

that's what Elijah's voice mattered most

and more than once during my presidency

when the economy still looked like it

might plunge into depression when the

health care bill was pronounced dead in

Congress I would watch Elijah rally his

colleagues the cost of doing nothing

isn't nothing he would say and folks

would remember why they entered into

public service our children are the

messengers we send to a future we will

never see he would say and he would

remind all of us that our time is too

short not to fight for what's good and

what is true and what is best in America

two hundred years two three hundred

years from now he would say people will

look back at this moment and they will

ask the question what did you do and

hearing him we would be reminded that it

falls upon each of us to give voice to

the voices and comfort to the sick an

opportunity to those not born to it and

to preserve and nurture our democracy

Elijah Cummings was a man of noble and

good heart his parents and his faith

planted the seeds of hope and love and

compassion and righteousness in that

good soil of his his harvested all the

crop that he could but the Lord is now

called Elijah home to give his humble

faithful servant recipe and it now falls

on us to continue his work so that other

young boys and girls in Baltimore across

Maryland across the United States and

around the world might to have a chance

to grow and to flourish that's how we

will honor him that's how we will

remember him that's what he would hope

for

may God bless the memory of the very

Honorable Elijah Cummings and may God

bless this city and this state and this

nation that he loved god bless you

[Applause]
