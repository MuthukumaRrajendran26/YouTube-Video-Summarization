you

as we get in chairman angles joining us

we're here joined by the Select

Committee on climate crisis and an

esteemed panel of witnesses for this

hearing and the voices leading to the

next generation on the global climate

crisis I know a few of our witnesses

have a hard stop at 11:30 in order to

get to their next event advocating on

these issues so I'll just ask that all

the members keep their questioning to 5

minutes or less so we can finish as many

members as possible without objection

all the members may have five days to

submit statements questions extraneous

materials for the record subject to

length limitation in the rules and I

just like to call on the chairman of the

full committee who has a few words to to

offer chairman Engel good morning

everyone I just wanted to invite

everyone to come to the Foreign Affairs

Committee and by the looks of it you're

all here I want to welcome everybody

climate change is certainly something

that is so important and the aggravating

thing about it is that there are so many

who still deny it so I look forward to

to listening to what our young people

are saying today because the world is

really their future and we owe it to

them to do what we can now to make sure

that the world is saved and climate

change is certainly something that is

happening and if we don't do anything

about it

it will certainly imperil future

generations I'm just happy to welcome

everybody to the Foreign Affairs

Committee room thank you like to thank

the chairman

I just like to recognize myself for five

minutes for an opening statement our

panel represents the next generation of

leaders and so naturally we're speaking

to the future however let us be clear we

are also speaking to the present we're

witnessing the effects of climate change

daily

whether it's storms forest fires floods

and other disasters occurring with

increasing intensity and frequency

increased migration

due to sea level rise threats to food

and water safety this is the reality

we're facing right now because of

climate change regardless of where we

live we all see it when we go home I see

it every time I go home my district is

in southeastern Massachusetts and has

one of the longest coastlines in the

country and includes Island communities

on Cape Cod we're anticipating a sea

level rise of one to two meters by 2100

and three to twelve meters in the next

few hundred years erosion and storm

damage costs families and businesses

trying to live with more than they can

afford as every storm approaches and

with each storm are also worried about

the cost to lives as well our historic

fishing and lobster industries are

threatened by increasing ocean

acidification and rising ocean

temperatures our state and local

governments under immense pressure to

address not only sea-level rise but air

and quality issues and in spite of

having some of the best scientists and

researchers right in that area in UMass

in Woods Hole

it's an incredible challenge there been

efforts spanning generations now in my

district to diversify our energy supply

offshore wind solar power they'll bring

in new jobs yet there are still major

gaps in access for our communities and a

real struggle to overcome the political

and bureaucratic obstacles that go with

making necessary changes to how things

are currently there must be leadership

in addressing climate change because we

and especially your generation can't

afford for things not to change this is

a global issue and the biggest polluters

are going to be needed to make big

changes to do their part but we need to

be honest with ourselves as

leaders so far our generation has failed

to adequately address our climate crisis

this failure isn't fatal

yet our failure to change will be change

happens through leadership we wouldn't

be in this situation right now our

witnesses would be safely and happily in

school pursuing their dreams and not

protesting and pushing their government

to act if everyone was doing their part

America knows how to lead in a crisis

and it's high time we pick ourselves up

and get back to this fight to bring the

rest of the world with us because

waiting for other countries to do the

right thing is making a bad bet on our

future there's so much we could and

should do right now in our country we

have bright minds to engineer solutions

to the future America has shaped

revolutions in industry time and time

again and it's made our country better

off every time now the stakes are so

much higher and in spite of all our

resources and ingenuity the one thing we

don't have is time the IPCC report warns

us that without cuts in carbon emissions

the world could see an average sea level

rise of 62 centimeters over the course

of a lifetime of people born today

that's over two feet and scientists are

gravely concerned that sea level rise in

the next hundred years could be even

faster than in the hundreds of years

that preceded it I'd like to thank our

witnesses extraordinary young leaders

fortified with scientific research for

being here it's regrettable they have to

be the Paris agreement should have been

reached decades ago and we should have

been well on our way by now towards far

more aggressive targets giving

communities and industries the time to

adapt and giving you a much more hopeful

outlook on the future but here we are

and I hope your testimony today will

galvanize us to act now before we are

truly out of time

ranking member Adam Kinzinger for his

opening statement Thank You mr. chairman

thank you all for being here we

appreciate it given the high level of

interest in this hearing the late start

and the many people that have questions

I'll be brief climate change is real and

the best way to combat it is by reducing

not only our nation's carbon emission

but that of the rest of the world the

changes we are seeing in the climate

posed both short and long term

challenges and I believe they can be

addressed in two major ways first we

need diversity in our energy sources

energy diversity is energy security

similar to one's own personal investment

strategies this nation cannot afford to

put all tags in one basket if you're

looking to invest you don't put all your

savings into one stock and let it ride

you diversify your investments and

mutual funds bonds real estate etc

second we need to support market driven

innovations to develop new clean energy

technologies that will put the United

States the forefront of environmental

technologies Illinois 16th congressional

district is a great example of why this

market of what this market driven

strategy would look like my districts

home to four nuclear reactors which

serve as actually it's eight reactors

for plants which serve as the most

abundant clean and stable energy source

on the planet as well as hundreds of

wind turbines solar powder panels and

geothermal thermal sources these diverse

sources not only provide year-round

reliable clean energy but also have

produced high-paying jobs from my

constituents around the world many

nations are implementing strategies to

combat climate change and nuclear must

be part of that strategy unfortunately

some of our closest allies are taking

their nuclear reactors offline at a time

when we need low-carbon energy sources

meanwhile as the West looks at options

to combat climate change we all know

that China's global emissions continue

to rise for every tonne of carbon

dioxide reduced by the United States

China adds nearly four times as much

today the Chinese account for 30 percent

of global emissions while some may say

that the United States needs to be the

leader of combating climate change I

would say that we already are

since 2005 global emissions have

increased by 20 percent but the United

States and missions have decreased by

more than

next 12 emission reducing countries

combined while reducing global emissions

is vital it's also important to note

that there's over 1 billion people

living without access to electricity

that's 1 billion people burning coal and

wood for heat 1 billion people living

with increased risk for foodborne

pathogens 1 billion people living

without access to basic sources of

information like the radio from a

foreign policy standpoint this should

not be overlooked the next global health

crisis or conflict could easily come

from these communities living in poverty

we must encourage other developed

nations to reduce emissions while

understanding that for economies just

getting off the ground it's not entirely

possible at least not without

substantial health from the United

States and our allies it's gonna take

major innovation and breakthroughs to

not only reduce our emissions here at

home but also provide clean reliable

power to those currently living without

it all Americans want to be good

stewards of their environment Tesla

doesn't sell cars because of the sound

system and people don't put solar panels

on their roof because they look good

consumers especially young people like

young people like we have today on our

panel want to know that policymakers

share their values I believe we do and

that will continue to see market driven

solutions that combat climate change and

provide clean energy to the world with

that I yield back the balance of my time

thank the gentleman for his comments

chair now recognizes the chair of the

Select Committee on climate crisis MS

Castro well thank you chairman Keating

for hosting this hearing today thank you

for including the members of the House

Select Committee on the climate crisis

we're thrilled to be here

the youth climate movement has grabbed

the attention of the world and it's due

to the hard work of many of the students

in this room and many young people all

across the planet did you all know that

Congress's first major hearing on the

climate crisis was in 1988 Congress has

had plenty of opportunity to understand

that burning fossil fuels warms the

planet and alters the Earth's climate

yet science

tell us that more than half of the

carbon pollution that has been emitted

into the atmosphere has occurred since

that hearing in 1988 I've been in

Congress since 2007 and we've done some

good things since then we've raised auto

efficiency standards we've supported the

dramatic expansion of wind and solar

power we've started to fund the kind of

climate resilience to protect the places

that we know and love but it is not

enough not by a long shot this year

under speaker Pelosi's leadership we

passed our first major piece of climate

lettuce legislation in 10 years a

bipartisan vote sent HR 9 climate action

now to the Senate where it awaits action

that bill takes a common-sense approach

of keeping the United States in the

Paris climate agreement because the us

we shouldn't back down we shouldn't

surrender not in the face of the climate

crisis we need to take bold action now

70% of young people in America say they

worry about climate change I don't blame

them they're doing more than paying

attention in science class this

generation is the most well informed and

connected generation in history and

everything they're learning has driven

them to a new level of engagement and

students are asking policymakers a very

powerful question what's the point of

going to school to learn about the

climate crisis when your elected

officials aren't doing enough to act on

it the climate strike movement has

United young people in all countries all

across the globe they're cooperating to

demand climate action and they're asking

us to cooperate with allies to cut

carbon pollution and protect our

communities it's not lost on us that the

United States is responsible for the

biggest share of carbon pollution

accumulated in the atmosphere to date so

we have a very serious response

to lead but we're also the world's

greatest engine of innovation and we can

do this we have the solutions local

communities and states have acted boldly

but a strong national climate action

plan has been missing we've heard from

scientist in the Select Committee

hearings as we will hear from these

young people here today that we must do

more and that we do not have time to

waste our answer has to be more than a

promise to do better

our solutions must equal the challenge

before us and I'd bet that 10 or 20

years from now young people marching and

striking today will be serving in the

Congress and we need to take bold action

now because we can't leave it up to them

to clean up the mess that Congress has

made people say this next generation

gives us hope but that's not quite right

is it this generation is giving us a job

to do the job is addressing the climate

crisis if we do our job then we will be

worthy of their hope because that means

we'll have started to create the future

that they're fighting for the

committee has a mandate to come up with

an action plan for Congress and we need

your ideas we want the ideas to come

from all corners of this country and

beyond you can go to climate crisis

house.gov slash info request and tell us

what your ideas are to solve the climate

crisis not all good ideas emanate from

Washington DC I think you know that but

it's only through cooperation through

coming together in our democracy that we

can address the climate crisis these

young people are rising to the challenge

and we need to rise with them thank you

and I yield back Thank You chair now

recognizes the ranking member of the

Select Committee mr. graves Thank You

mr. chairman

you

this is the primary audio circuit for

the Reuters live service

this is the primary audio circuit for

the Reuters live service

you

shins that we've had in the United

States moving forward even under the

Paris Accords that folks are sitting

here giving accolades doing in saying is

a great idea and I want to be clear

I support the US as target in the Paris

Accords I think that signing on to an

agreement and agreeing to something that

allows for China to come in and have a

50% increase adding another five Giga

tons of greenhouse gas emissions

annually by 2030 is inappropriate it is

moving in the wrong direction not in the

right direction

I also remain confounded reading letters

like this one that says that we need a

pressure the Organization of Petroleum

Exporting Countries in cooperating

countries to increase world oil supplies

in order to lower prices at the pump the

impact of rising fuel prices on our

economy and on family budgets is

significant and widespread this letter

goes on to say the current run-up in

world oil prices is effectively attacks

on All American families discretionary

budget except that the money goes to

OPEC as opposed to the United States

Treasury so let me say again this letter

is advocating for increased world oil

production because prices are too high

who do you think signed this letter who

do you who do you think signed this

letter think about if just a minute put

a name in your head this letter was sent

by senator Cantwell senator Menendez

senator Chuck Schumer and Senator Ed

Markey just last year I I remain so

confused by what it is that we're doing

what is our policy and and mr. chairman

ask unanimous consent that this be

included in the record look any of my

from my home state my home stays is at

risk of existence moving forward with

see rise but we've got to make sure that

we're moving forward in a rational

manner that builds on successes and

corrects failures rather than these

confounding policies that make no sense

yield back

well thank you I'll now introduce our

witnesses greater to in berea is from

Sweden

she's a climate activist who helped

build the Friday's for future movement

where she began going on strike from

outside the Swedish parliament on

Fridays she is spoken on the climate

crisis before the EU Parliament welcome

miss Jamie Margolin is from Seattle

Washington she's co-founder of the

co-executive and co-executive director

of the zero hour an international youth

climate organization founded in the

summer of 2017 she's also a plaintiff in

Piper the state of Washington mr. Vic

Barrett is from White Plains New York

he's a fellow with the Alliance for

climate education and a plaintiff in

Giuliani Juliana versus United States

welcome mr. Benjie backer is from

Appleton Wisconsin he's the president of

the American conservation coalition a

nonprofit organization to educate and

engage conservatives on climate change

all of you are here we welcome all of

you we appreciate your efforts please

limit your testimony to five minutes and

without objection you're prepared

written statements will be made part of

the record I'll now go to miss to brief

for her statement my name is I have not

come to offer any prepared remarks at

this hearing I'm instead attaching my

testimony

it is the IPCC special report on global

warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius the SR

1.5 which was released on October 8 2018

I am submitting this report as my

testimony because I don't want you to

listen to me I want you to listen to the

scientists and I want you to put unites

behind the science and then I want you

to take real action thank you

Taksim

be smart going my name is Jamie Margolin

and I'm a 17 year old climate justice

activist from Seattle Washington I'm

missing a lot of school to beat here

it's my senior year of high school I

have college application deadlines

looming over me and to be honest I've

barely even started because I'm too busy

fighting to make sure that I'm actually

going to have the future I'm applying to

study for you're here spending a few

moments with me but that is nothing

compared to the hours that members of

Congress have spent with lobbyists from

corporations that make billions of

dollars off of the destruction of my

generations future I want the entirety

of Congress in fact the whole US

government to remember the fear and

despair that my generation lives with

every day and I want you to hold on to

it how do I even begin to convey to you

what it feels like to know that within

my lifetime the destruction that we have

already seen from the climate crisis

will only get worse what adds insult to

injury is the fact that we keep getting

promised what isn't there on college

applications I keep getting asked what

do you want to be when you grow up the

media pop culture businesses in the

whole world tells me that I and my whole

generation will have something to look

forward to that we just don't you're

promising me lies everyone who will walk

up to me after this testimony saying

that I have such a bright future ahead

of me will be lying to my face it

doesn't matter how talented we are it

doesn't matter how much work we put in

how many dreams we have the reality is

my generation has been committed to a

planet that is collapsing the fact that

you were staring at a panel of young

people testifying before you today

pleading for a livable earth should not

fill you with pride it should fill you

with shame youth climate activism should

not have to exist we're exhausted

because we have tried everything we've

built organizations organized marches

and worked on political campaigns I sued

my state government in a lawsuit called

Piper versus versus the state of

Washington along with 12 other

plaintiffs for contributing to the

climate crisis denying my generations

constitutional rights to life liberty

and property

the lawsuit is also arguing that the

natural resources of my state are

protected as a right under the

Washington State Constitution the

shellfish salmon orcas and all of the

beautiful wildlife of my Pacific

Northwest home is dying due to ocean

acidification caused by the climate

crisis and communities all over Seattle

are suffering from the new fossil fuel

infrastructure being built to lock in

decades more of climate destruction into

my state my friends and I were warned to

stay inside the last two summers because

our city was shrouded in a suffocating

smoke from wildfires it gave me such bad

headaches for so long and my friends

with respiratory illnesses had to go to

the ER is this the future that we have

to look forward to well we the youth are

working as hard as we can to make sure

that it isn't on July 21st of 2018 after

an entire year of non-stop organizing

despite being full-time high school

students with a lot of homework to do my

organization's zero-hour marched on

Washington DC in a pouring rain storm

and in 25 cities around the world

demanding urgent climate action from you

and all of our leaders and that was only

the beginning

but by 2030 we will know if we have

created the political climate that will

have allowed us to salvage life on Earth

or if we acted too late by then we must

be well on the path to climate recovery

but this must start today in fact it

should have started yesterday by 2030 I

will be old enough to run for Congress

and be seated right where you guys are

sitting right now by then we need to

have already achieved net zero

greenhouse gas emissions and be rapidly

on the path to climate recovery I can't

wait until I'm sitting in your seats to

change the climate crisis you have to

use the seats that you have now because

by the time I get there it's going to be

way too late the good news is that

experts agree that there are multiple

pathways to decarbonize the United

States energy system and that doing so

is both technologically and economically

viable and beneficial the most

frustrating thing is that the US

government can't even begin to imagine

the massive political shift that has to

happen in order for us to solve this

issue the politics just has

been invented yet solving the climate

crisis goes against everything that our

country was unfortunately built on

colonialism slavery and natural resource

extraction this is why the youth are

calling for a new era altogether as

Greta mentioned the Internet the

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

Change report that we only have a few

months left in order to create the

massive political shift needed to

transition our world to an entirely

renewable energy economy this needs to

happen within the next 10 years which is

our deadline to save life as we know it

people call my generation Generation Z

as if we are the last generation but we

are not we are refusing to be the last

letter of the alphabet I'm here before

the whole country today announcing that

we are instead at Generation GND the

generation of the green New Deal the

only thing that will save us is a whole

new era the green New Deal is not just

about the specific plans laid out in

resolutions it's about a new chapter in

American history and transforming our

culture into one that celebrates

encourages and enables radical climate

action it is right here testifying

before you that I am proud to announce

that history is being made you've heard

of the Reagan era the New Deal era

well the youth are bringing about the

era of the green New Deal thank you mr.

Barron my name is Vic Barrett I'm 20

years old and I'm one of the 21 youth

plaintiffs and the Giuliani versus

United States constitutional lawsuit

suing the executive branch of the

federal government for knowingly causing

climate change I'd like to recognize my

fellow plaintiffs in this room sitting

behind me I'm a first generation in

Korea for non American my people are in

our indigenous community originally from

the island of st. Vincent in the

Caribbean in the 18th and 19th centuries

we were pushed from our homeland on st.

Vincent by British colonial power

settling on the eastern coast of Central

America and Honduras and Belize despite

overwhelming adversity we organized our

community and emancipated ourselves to

protect our future as a people however

the struggle continues for me and my

peace

well as temperatures increase sea levels

rise storms become more intense and

frequent and the coral reefs and

Fisheries upon which we depend disappear

the oceanfront land that my family has

inhabited for generations that I'm

supposed to inherit will be underwater

if the US federal government continues

to promote a fossil fuel based energy

system it is not just me and my people

in Honduras being harmed by climate

change frontline communities around the

country and around the world are already

feeling the effects of the climate

crisis from the dispossession of land -

to the grave public health threats that

are disproportionately affecting myself

and other young people these frontline

communities are made up of people who

look like me young black and brown LGBTQ

indigenous identities which place them

at a significantly higher risk to

experience the impacts of climate change

than the general populace due to their

marginalized status in our society

I myself have felt the consequences of

climate change directly growing up in

New York I was impacted by the climate

change fueled hurricane sandy which left

my family in school without power for

days I still experience grave anxiety

about experiencing another climate

driven disaster like superstorm sandy

and the harm that these storms will have

on myself and my family as someone who

already struggles with anxiety and

struggles with depression from my

understanding of climate change and what

I experience watching our government

knowingly perpetuate the climate crisis

is extremely overwhelming I wrestle with

this anxiety every day from the moment

that I wake up in the morning to the

moment I fall asleep at night if we keep

going on with business as usual both

Honduras and New York the places where

my family and I are from will forever be

lost to the sea that is one of my

greatest fears that climate change is

going to take these places away from us

my co-plaintiffs also experience both

the mental and physical health impacts

of climate change my co-plaintiffs with

asthma and allergies have suffered from

the prolonged wildfire and allergy

seasons in the West limiting their

ability to participate in certain

activities or even go outside many of

them like me are also struggling with

psychological harms from climate change

the medical community now recognizes

climate change as a grave public health

threat one of our experts describes

climate change as a public health

emergency

which is disproportionately impacting

children and youth in a myriad of ways

he lists specific health thoughts

exacerbated by climate change including

heat stress extreme weather events

wildfires decreased air quality and

infectious disease all of which pose a

disproportionate threat to children and

to youth another one of our experts dr.

Lisa Van Susteren a psychiatrist known

nationally for her work on climate

change explains that quote with

continued government actions that

exacerbate the climate crisis the

plaintiffs and those they represent will

suffer catastrophic emotional injuries

she goes on to state that the federal

government's quote sanctioning of

climate change as lawful and federal law

and policy makes a psychological injury

suffered by individuals including the

plaintiffs particularly harmful and

insidious she warns that without

immediate action by the federal

government to address climate change the

mental health impacts will worsen and be

lifelong just as my federal government

sanctioned discrimination in schools and

housing until the middle of the last

century

a policy that harm children my federal

government has also orchestrated and

sanctioned a system of fossil fuel

energy that is harming children in

another way

irreversibly threatening our health our

personal security our homes and our

communities by recreating a dangerous

climate system like youth who have come

before us in the Civil Rights we've been

and other social justice movements it is

often the youth that must shine a light

on systems of injustice so in 2015 21

young people myself included filed a

lawsuit against the United States and

agencies of the executive branch to

safeguard our constitutional right to

life liberty and property and including

our rights to personal security and

bodily integrity and a stable climate

system that sustains our lives and

liberties I was born into a world in

which my future and my past or uncertain

born into a world where my culture and

inheritance are literally slipping into

the sea born into a world where my

people are going extinct show children

everywhere that you care about our

future and the future of all generations

to come now is your time to stand in

solidarity with me and my co-plaintiffs

America's youth and communities around

the world to fight for a just future

free from catastrophic climate change

thank you thank you mr. Becker

good morning my name is Benji Becker

president and founder of the American

conservation Coalition a non-profit

focused on bolstering conservative

voices in environmental discussions I'm

also a 21 year old senior at the

University of Washington in Seattle and

I would like to thank chairman Keating

ranking member Kinsey our chairman

caster and ranking member graves for

holding this very important hearing I'm

also honored to share this panel with

Greta Vic and Jamie each of you have

played a critical role in generating

worldwide awareness around this issue of

climate change so thank you I'm a

lifelong conservative activist but like

most of my generation regardless of

political affiliation

I believe climate change is real I

believe humans are making an impact and

with global emissions rising 1.7 percent

last year we're at a crossroads in

history my generation doesn't care about

the politics around climate change we

want productive discussions realistic

answers and sound policies most

importantly I believe America plays a

vital role in solving this problem and

that we must lead by example between

2005 and 2007 teen as already mentioned

we led the world in emissions reductions

more than the next 12 countries combined

however while our contribution to

greenhouse gas emissions is declining

we still contribute nearly 15% of global

greenhouse gas emissions which is second

most in the world

however Americans have been told that

one-size-fits-all approaches such as the

green New Deal are the only solution

such policies advocate for an economic

transformation that increases government

control spending and regulation these

approaches inhibit innovation and are

not an effective way to reduce emissions

in fact

countries with highly restrictive in

government controlled economies like

Venezuela have disastrous environmental

records and while on the other hand

countries leading and emissions

reductions have some of the freest

economic systems in the world we can't

ignore this reality and the fact of the

matter is we cannot regulate our way out

of climate change markets and

competition reduce emissions for

more than heavy-handed regulation a

truly effective climate plan will

capitalize on America's strengths

technological advancements empowered

consumers entrepreneurial businesses

effective government and bold global

leadership we need to decarbonize fossil

fuel emissions increase the number of

nuclear and hydro power plants continue

developing solar and wind and encourage

research and development into other

clean energy technologies it's easier to

export innovative American technologies

than burdensome regulations to

developing nations we must also

understand the privilege Americans bring

into this conversation across the globe

those who can most easily adapt to

climate change are wealthy and live in

developed countries it's unfair to ask

someone to make choices based on

sustainability when they're struggling

to survive as we transition to cleaner

energy landscapes in the United States

and abroad we need to consider the most

vulnerable in our world there are still

over 1 billion people without

electricity worldwide transitioning to

clean energy needs to happen but it

can't happen overnight

climate change conversations are often

dominated by hopelessness and despair in

reality fighting climate change is an

opportunity to improve human health lift

people up and grow the economy and I see

promising signs many bipartisan

climate-related Bills have been

introduced and passed in the last two

years we're reducing emissions and

creating remarkable new technologies

more Republicans are speaking up than

ever before this innovation based

approach is not limited to the United

States either just yesterday the British

conservation Alliance a group inspired

by my organization ACC was launched by

students in the United Kingdom to

advocate for market-based environmental

reforms we're making strides in the

direction in the right direction but we

must do more each of us play a critical

role in tackling climate change to my

fellow conservatives the climate is

changing it's time to claim our seat at

the table and develop smart limited

government policies to establish

American leadership on this issue there

is a reasonable conservative approach to

climate change and we need to embrace it

to those on the left without your

leadership this would not be receiving

the attention that it deserves

but now it's time for solutions

politicizing climate change has deepened

the partisan divide and delayed real

action if you truly want to address

climate change work with conservatives

who want to champion reforms to Congress

on climate change it's not about

Republicans or Democrats it's about

those who are taking effective action

and those who are not our conversations

on climate change should be about

cutting global greenhouse gas emissions

not about political pandering to

President Trump

climate science is real it's not a hoax

it's accepted that humans are having a

negative impact on our climate as a

proud American as a lifelong

conservative and as a young person I

urge you to accept climate change for

the reality it is and respond

accordingly we need your leadership and

lastly to young people you have

remarkable power the four of us

testifying up here today are all under

the age of 22 or the world is listening

with open ears and hearts to our voices

and voices just like yours stand for

what you believe in up with the world

and don't back down

climate change is about our future and

people need to hear you and us in

conclusion I grew up on the shores of

Lake Managua in northern Wisconsin where

I connected with the outdoors early in

life nature is where I find the most

peace and calm within myself that's why

I founded the American conservation

coalition to fight for wild places and

stop climate change from destroying them

the health of the environment affects

all of us regardless of where we live

our background or our political

affiliation it's time for Americans to

join together find solutions on climate

change and protect our planet for

generations to come thank you thank all

the witnesses for their testimony and

their urgency it came through in all of

your testimony I now recognize myself

for less than five minutes so that we

can get as many people to ask questions

as possible not just with a miss to

memory you chose to submit the IPCC

report in lieu of your written testimony

could you expand on why it's so

important to listen to the science

well well I don't see a reason to not

listen to the science is such just such

a thing that we should be taking for

granted that's we listen to the current

best available United science it's just

something that's everyone should do this

is not political opinions political

views or my opinions this is this is the

science so yeah thank you

in all over your testimony not just

urgency came through when I was

listening to what you had to say but as

someone from another generation

listening the last thing we would want

for the generations to follow for our

children grandchildren and other

people's children and grandchildren is

to hear in some of your remarks actual

fear and anxiety being expressed could

you each of you that you can jump right

in as you see fit comment on what that's

like I I think that that message should

be heard by all of us not just urgency

but what are we doing to the next

generation how are their lives impacted

by what we're not doing and what we're

doing so if you could I'll let you just

choose among yourselves each of you have

a chance to answer that question for for

me it's it's really been affecting

because similar to Vic I already have

like underlying issues of like anxiety

and it's just really hard to grow up in

a world full of ifs you know I don't

think a lot of people in Congress

understand the conversations that are

happening in everyday American high

schools but we're constantly asked

prepare for your future study for your

future do this for your future but our

world is full of ifs I'll be talking to

my best friend and she'll be like yeah

you know I really want to see this

natural place sometime if it's gonna

still be around I really want to study

to be this if that's

gonna be a possibility and it's just

like this constant looming uncertainty

and it's a weird form of of nihilism and

and weird just fear that's that's been

existing in my generation where kids are

joking like what is even like the point

the world is is ending what are we

studying for what are we doing and it's

this kind of depression it's this fear

that is not just among me or my

panelists here but but everyone and that

anxiety is something that no child

should ever have to fear because if you

think about it if you go back to what is

the purpose of a parent down to just the

biological purpose its to to give their

child the best future and the best life

that they can possibly have and the

amount the supposed American dream is to

make sure that children have a better

future than the adults but right now

it's like some members of government and

some corporations are actively pointing

a gun to children's futures and actively

making it worse actively going out of

their way to support corporations and

poison us and destroy our future and

that is horrifying and it feels like a

betrayal it's like a knife to the heart

to know that people who have kids

they'll go around in these campaign ads

and they'll be like holding these babies

like oh you should vote for me look at

me interacting with a small child while

they actively poison and choose their

wallets over their children so it's it's

very devastating and scary but it's also

it feels like we've been betrayed in

less than a minute would anyone else

like to comment on that young people are

in the midst of adolescence isn't

characterized as being easy without also

dealing with the greatest existential

threat of our time I definitely

understand and agree with the panelists

that this is something that a lot of

young people stress about and actually

that's why I got into this movement to

begin with in 2016 is because I thought

that it was something that Americans

needed to tackle and the movement that I

associated with the conservative

movement needed to tackle as well but

the more that I've gotten into this

movement of the climate change movement

the

or that I've seen that this is actually

a positive but there's actually a lot of

opportunity here that we have time

science says so that doesn't mean we

don't have to act but but we do have

time and we have an opportunity and a

chance for people to come together on

this issue and work across party lines

and generate economic growth to solve

this issue so I feel hopeful great I now

yield to the ranking member mr. graves

Thank You mr. chairman and I want to

thank you all for your for your

testimony all of you it was it really

was impressive and I very much

appreciate it mr. Berg you said let's

unite behind the science I couldn't

agree with you more let's unite behind

the science and I think we actually need

more science not less mr. Becker you

said that we need to stop this partisan

fighting and actually work together to

yield solutions that that makes sense so

let me say it again you have folks that

proposed this green new deal yet when

it's brought up for a vote nobody votes

for it

no one you have efforts like last week

to stop energy production yet you have

letters going out saying hey we want you

to produce more oil in Middle Eastern

countries and other nations that don't

share American values and that have

dirtier energy that have higher

emissions than in the United States this

whole thing is a charade when you

actually look at science mr. Burke and

you look at facts the facts are it

wasn't waxman-markey legislation here

that was designed to require emissions

reduction that yielded the United States

leading the world in emissions reduction

it was actually folks doing the right

thing

stepping in and actually reducing

emissions carry through innovation

through energy efficiency through

conservation so where we are leading the

world and in fact we have beat the

projections under waxman-markey the

mandatory legislation and we've done it

with cheaper energy prices those are the

facts next going mr2 back

when you look at where we've actually

made progress once again talking about

last year I work together

mr. series and I and others on the

Transportation Committee where we've

developed the first resiliency standard

bipartisan unanimous bill passed out of

the committee where we dedicated record

funding to resiliency and mitigation and

in the United States today we're

spending more money on climate science

technology and Energy's energy solutions

than anywhere else in the world those

things have been done in a bipartisan

manner and are actually yielding results

not the charades

these things aren't yielding anything

mr. Neuberger let me ask you a question

if you're sailing across the ocean and

you're picking up trash along the way

and for every one piece of trash that

you pick up there's a boat right next to

you dumping out five pieces how would

that make you feel first of all we were

going so fast there wasn't all right

well if you were slow sailor like me how

would that make you feel well first of

all if you used that logic then I am

also dumping a lot of trash in the ocean

and then I would I would stop dumping my

trash in the ocean and tell the other

boat to stop dumping their trash in the

ocean as well and and and and that's

that's the important point here I think

that what we need to be doing is we need

to be focusing on the countries that are

dumping trash in the ocean of course

that's a metaphor the fact that China is

Madhu Singh emissions yet China under

the Paris Accords are going to be

increasing their emissions by nearly 50

percent five Giga tons annually so while

in the United States we need to continue

investing in innovative solutions and

exporting clean energy technologies it

makes no sense for us to be doing it if

we're simply watching for increases in

in China mr. Becker the IPCC report

talks about numerous solutions moving

forward including clean energy and

others

under IPCC does it contemplate only only

renewable energy sources moving forward

thank you it actually does not I think

that it shows a strong trend that we

need to generate more clean energy going

into the future there's no doubt about

that and reduce emissions vehicle energy

technologies but there's no statement in

the IPCC report that says that we need

to go 100% clean to reduce emissions at

the level that we need to to fix this

problem so moving on from there if

moving forward even under IPCC it

doesn't contemplate not using any

conventional fuels moving forward for

the next few decades anyway do you think

it makes sense to utilize the fuels from

the nation that has the cleanest energy

or do you think that it makes more sense

to for example use Russian gas that

releases 13 percent greater emissions as

we move forward which makes more sense

or do you think it makes sense to

perhaps get fuels from Nigeria that just

a few years ago had 2,000 ongoing spills

I think I think it's important for

Americans to understand that we do

generate fossil fuels cleaner than

anywhere else in the world and while the

rest of the world still relies on fossil

fuels that's an important thing to note

I do think while we continue to generate

power for the rest of the globe and

uplift people we as a country also start

transitioning more and more to clean

technologies which I think we're

starting to do but I do believe that

making sure that the rest of the world

is is generating fossil fuels safely is

important because it's going to be a

part of our future especially today and

the United States does do a cleaner than

anywhere else in the world that's that's

a fact

and it's something that we have to think

about Thank You chairwoman Kasten mr.

Becker in your testimony you point out

that the UN United States must leave by

example and despite recent emissions

reductions the United States is

currently the second highest emitting

country in the world annually and

although we ranked number two now the

United States

is responsible for the most carbon

pollution accumulated in the atmosphere

some people say that the United States

should not dramatically reduce our

emissions because China and other

countries aren't doing enough I'd like

to have your view on that and have each

of the witnesses comment on that briefly

yeah I think that's a false approach

because we've never in history looked at

a problem that we contribute in the

United States and said well if it's

happening somewhere else then we

shouldn't fix it

so I don't think that's a reasonable

excuse but I also do think it's

important to note that other countries

are emitting and that we must hold them

accountable as we hold ourselves

accountable America has led on lots of

initiatives in the past you have people

in Hong Kong waving their flags and

seeing the American national anthem

right now because we inspire them we can

do the same thing i climate change the

United States beats to 25 percent of

historic emissions in the world and if

we are the country that we say we are

for the leaders that we say we are we

need to lead by example here and work on

art what we're doing here is so that the

rest of the world can follow our lead I

have a question when your children ask

you did you do absolutely everything in

your power to stop the climate crisis

when the storms are getting worse and

we're seeing all the effects of the

climate crisis when they ask you did you

do everything can you really look them

in the eye and say no sorry I couldn't

do anything because that country over

there didn't do anything so if they're

not gonna do it then I'm not that is

shameful and that is cowardly and there

is no excuse to not take action to not

improve how as much as we can in the

United States and how can we call

ourselves the city on a hill if or the

an example for the world if we're going

to be cowards and hide behind waiting

for other people saying that I'm not

going to do this because they didn't

I want you to think about this is all

about being able to look your children

in the eye and say I did absolutely

everything I could for you I know that

we're up against a lot of pressure I

know that the time is running out but

like my honey however you call your kids

I did everything I could and so I just

don't understand as a parent how can you

look your kid in the eye and say there's

this impending crisis everything is at

stake but I stood back and I didn't

really do anything I didn't take action

I didn't act like it was an emergency

because our neighbors over there weren't

doing it so I'm just not going to how

can you tell your children that I just I

think I don't need to add anything but

just another perspective I am from

Sweden it's a small country and there it

is the same argument why should we do

anything just look at the u.s. they say

so just so you know that's that is being

used against you as well chair

recognizes representing Miller thank you

to chairman castor and ranking member

graves as well as to our Foreign Affairs

counterparts chairman Keating and

ranking member Kinzinger for hosting us

today and I want to say a very special

thank you to all of you for being here

today and for caring so much about our

earth throughout our work on this

committee I have long said that any

recommendations that the Select

Committee on the climate crisis makes

must ensure that we provide for

innovation and not taxation Solutions

should work to reduce our carbon

footprint but not come at the detriment

of increased costs for consumers

mr. backer I want to thank you for your

leadership and your candor we all must

do whatever we can and do our part to

take care of our beautiful world in your

testimony you discussed how we cannot

regulate our way out of climate change

what are some of the ways that we can

better utilize technology and increase

innovation thank you if we really want

to focus on reducing emissions which I

think we all agree is the end goal that

we're talking about here today it needs

to be about the results and the results

can come from innovation like you're

alluding to if you look at the

technologies that we can have around

carbon capture taking carbon emissions

out of the air from fossil fuel emitting

plants and and being able to put that

into the earth or reuse it for another

type of product or you look at the

shifts in the transportation sector to

transition to cleaner cars and cleaner

technologies that's the example of

things that we can do across the globe

and continue innovating because

innovation like I mentioned in my

testimony is something that we can

export to other countries very very

easily because it creates jobs it's more

efficient and it ends up helping the

economy a great example of this is 194

of the world's largest companies have

pledged to go 100% renewable by 2030

2040 or even sooner than that

they're doing that because it's more

cheap it's more efficient and it helps

their consumers it's done that because

of innovation and if we put regulations

on different industries we're not going

to be solving the problem we need to

work on decarbonizing fossil fuels and

reducing emissions now and we can't do

that with regulation we can only do that

through innovation we need to innovate

our way out of the climate change

problem thank you I yield back my time

vice chairman Lynn's bamberg thank you

very much thank you all for being here I

hold your commitment to fighting for the

future generations of this planet and

the highest esteem and I'm grateful for

the attention you're bringing to these

critical issues through your advocacy

miss tun berry in your speech to un

secretary-general Antonio Guterres on

climate change you said we are facing an

existential threat and I agree the

scientific consensus is clear climate

change is real its effects including

changes to rainfall and farmers growing

seasons sea-level rise along our coasts

an exacerbation of conflicts abroad are

a threat to us all in fact our

intelligence community and two former

secretaries of defense have cited

climate change as a root cause and

driver of instability and global threats

making it not just a moral imperative

but a national security imperative as

well I'm curious in your travels as an

activist and as an advocate

have you heard stories or have you

engaged with those who are focused on

the issues of how climate change and the

instability it causes internationally

are impacting security issues and how

those might impact our future

generations I have of course met many

people who who have experienced

environmental and climate related

disasters and who who try to help people

to to come back from that and I haven't

been meeting so much with people who

have told me stories about it being a

national security threat because I see I

simply haven't had enough time to do

that there are so many people to meet

and so many stories to hear so I can't

listen to them all but I imagine maybe

one of the one of the others have it

doesn't see

so maybe then you should talk to someone

who who is an expert in that area and

and you mentioned apart from the

security aspect of things that you have

spoken with many who have faced

disasters at home due to global climate

change could you perhaps give a couple

of examples just for the committee to

hear of the stories you've heard yes I

have met people who whose communities

were simply whose neighborhoods were

destroyed by natural disasters who were

amplified by the climate crisis I've met

people whose food and water supply is

being threatened by by environmental or

climate related catastrophes and it's

just it's so sad that I it's so

incredibly many people so incredibly

many examples that's that is just

horrible because so many who have

experienced this and so many who are

suffering from this today and I mean we

are already seeing the consequences and

unacceptable consequences of this today

and it will only get worse

the longer we delay action unless we

start to act now thank you very much I

would also like to add answering that

question I would like to acknowledge

that we have some Amazon protectors in

the room right now who are fighting to

protect the Amazon rainforest and that

is a place in the world where people are

gravely suffering not exactly from

climate change itself but from the

causes of the climate crisis the animal

agriculture industry is behind and the

the collusion of the animal agriculture

industry with the governments of Brazil

and other countries that would rather

make a short-term profit than protect

the lungs of our planet the Amazon

rainforest is the lungs of our planet

and that's why we're seeing these

massive fires and it is indigenous

protectors like the ones here sitting

who have been fighting literally putting

their bodies on the line

and suffering from these fires and I

don't want to speak for them because I

don't know their own stories but I

encourage you talk to them later but I

think it's also very important that as

we speak from an American perspective we

also realized that the climate crisis is

global and that even though maybe you

know for me personally I have Latin

American roots and that my family is

from Colombia but even if you don't have

those roots in Latin America the Amazon

rainforest is the lungs of our planet

and so it burning down we must unite

with Latin America and we was unite with

the indigenous activists and listen to

them and give them a platform and also

not perpetuate the same systems of

oppression that have been pushing them

down because because it is and I don't

want to speak for this and I don't know

if thick you have anything to add but it

is this the same systems of oppression

that are causing the climate crisis that

are making people feel the worst effects

to add to something that I heard earlier

I just want to say real quick I realize

my time is running out but Albert

Einstein defined insanity as trying to

solve an issue with the same thinking

that caused it and right now something

that has been disturbing me a lot is

seeing the way that we are trying to

colonize and buy and sell our way out of

a problem caused by colonization and

buying and selling thank you mr.

chairman I'm over time I yield back

represent Bertrand Thank You mr.

chairman I really don't have any

prepared notes I'd sitting there just

thinking in 1977 I was confronted with a

problem I was my father used to grow

tomatoes

Oh mr. Chairman I appreciate you in the

vice chairman everybody for allowing us

to be here

I meant to do the protocol first I

apologized but and I was my father used

to grow these tomatoes he'd get about a

half a dozen tomatoes and he put about

$20 in chemicals and all kinds of nasty

stuff and I thought to myself you know

I'm putting that stuff in my body and I

thought there's got to be a better

solution and I stopped a it's called KUB

knoxville tillage board they used to cut

all the trees that rock they were

growing on the power lines and they'd

grind them up usually about six o'clock

in the morning and wake us all up and I

stopped and asked one of those guys one

time I said

hey what do y'all do at that stuff and

they said well we take they've gotta

realize this is 1977 okay I was in I was

in between my seventh and eighth grade

years and he said we take it to the

landfill and I said well how much did

they pay you for it and they said we

don't we pay them to take it and so the

wheels started turning in my head and at

that point I became a capitalist I

realized that there was money to be made

you could save the environment at that

time it saved about 25% of the landfill

space in in our community and I got into

that business but but I want to and I've

realized now that of our of our trash

stream about 85% of that is compostable

it does not have to go into the landfill

when it goes into the landfill everybody

just thinks a lot of people thinks it

just goes away it doesn't go away it

creates all kinds of bad things for the

environment the the gas is the one of

those feared gases is methane it's when

something decomposes in an anaerobic or

in the absence absence of oxygen so if

we could compost those things 85% of

that waste stream could be turned back

into soil which would be utilized I

think in a capitalist manner and you

wonder about capitalism well I had the

opportunity I was sitting there with AOC

and I was pitching to her capitalism I

don't really know if it if it caught on

with her or not but my point was this I

said you wanna you want to do away with

airplanes

well airplane engines that put out gases

that are harmful the environment and I

said MIT right now has an airplane

engine that has no moving parts and

allegedly puts nothing harmful into the

environment no moving parts and that to

me that's just Buck Rogers but I got on

YouTube and I watched the video and I

watched it you all could probably

understand it but my 55 year old brain

just doesn't understand it but it's

fascinating to me but granted all it did

was fly a glider about the length of a

football field well I got to thinking

this little cell phone right here 20

years ago according to my friends at Oak

Ridge National Laboratory was a hundred

million dollar computer 20 years ago

capitalism brought this now everybody

basically has a television

studio can get to all the information in

the world can contact anybody in the

world for about I don't know about a

hundred bucks a month and it's a pretty

good deal and that was through

capitalism and I would encourage you all

to explore that that realm of our of our

economy I have a piece of legislation

and I would encourage you all I would

like to hear from each one of you all

what you all think about it's called

carbon capture it's a capitalist view of

capturing carbon and utilizing it in

this House Resolution 38 sixty-one and I

would encourage you all not now look it

up get on your little computers y'all

know how to use them better than I do

somebody'll show me when when I get your

email and I would encourage you all to

read that and see what it is not I

applaud you all for being here

I applaud your enthusiasm I'm incredibly

proud that you are this concerned about

our environment in our world and thank

y'all so much for being here mr.

chairman I yield back the remainder of

my 55 seconds well thank you

representative Lujan thank you very much

mr. chairman and to all of the chairs

and ranking members for bringing us

together today to all of the panelists

to our witnesses who are here with us

today I want to thank you as well before

I begin my questions though I I just

want to remind my colleagues that those

those mobile phones that were once too

big or a desktop that weigh thousands of

pounds they got smaller because of

federal taxpayer investment by the

United States of America investing in

the research so I hope that there's an

openness in a willingness that we take

the same step let's put our money where

our mouth is let's make sure that we're

investing those dollars and we're

answering this call and miss Jim Burke I

appreciate the power of your testimony

you laid it out in a document right in

front of us a document where experts and

scientists have laid out the path in the

road for the world to take policy action

it's simple the works been done for us

we just have to follow that path so I

want to thank you for that and now I

don't want to have to defend one of my

colleagues as well she can

defend herself as we all know

congressman Cortes or congresswoman

Alexandria Ocasio Cortez has not said

that she wants to stop air travel her

policies instead let's do better let's

act and I think that that's what we're

here to do so I apologize I took a

little bit of my time to respond to some

of the statements that were said earlier

but I thought it was important so mr.

Bergmann I was your age of the

concentration of co2 in the atmosphere

was 350 parts per million this year we

eclipsed 415 parts per million I'm gonna

try to make some sense out of this what

many scientists have said is that we

only can get to 430 parts per million to

get to an increase of 1.5 degrees or be

able to even hold at 1.5 degrees

increase if we get to 450 parts per

million again we're at 415 already that

gets us to two degrees let me share what

that means with 1.5 degrees 14 percent

of the global population will face

extreme heat at 2% it's 37 percent at

1.5 degrees we will see an ice-free

Arctic once every hundred years at 2

degrees we see it every 10 years at 1.5

degrees our fisheries declined by 1.5

million tons and our coral reefs decline

by at least 70% at 2 degrees our

fisheries will decline by twice that and

we'll lose 99% of our coral reefs we see

the difference between what is

devastating and what is even beyond what

devastating can even be described as mr.

Berg the science could not be more clear

if we wait the climate crisis will only

be more devastating just a year ago you

were protesting outside the Swedish

parliament now you are part of an

international coalition of young people

demanding action I asked a few students

that I have the honor of working with in

New Mexico and one of them responded her

name is marina Webber Stevens she's one

of the founding members of the glow

bull warming Express anyone that's

interested can find them at the global

warming Express org and she asked a very

important question but one that I think

you have an answer to and it's this what

is the best way to get the younger

generation teens and students involved

in advocacy to address the climate

crisis and I would add to that adults

what can we be doing how can we get more

young people involved how we can get

more young people involved I think to

just tell them the truth tell them how

it is and because when I found out how

it actually was that made me furious so

I was I wanted to do something about it

and that is the at least I spoken to

many now and I think that is the

experience many others have because as

it is now people in general don't seem

to be very aware of the actual science

and the how severe this crisis actually

is so I just think we need to inform

them and start treating this crisis like

like the existential emergency it is

then I think people will not understand

and want to do something about it

I think that's powerful tell them the

truth with that I yield back mr. Carter

Thank You mr. chairman and let me begin

by thanking all four of you for being

here I cannot tell you how much this

builds up my confidence in the in the

younger generation having you involved

in this it's extremely important that

you be involved in the process and I

applaud you for being here and I thank

you for being here I want to start with

you mr. backer it's it's it's really

good to see someone who's interested in

such an important project or such an

important topic I should say and also

who understands that we need to factor

in the economy in this in the economic

impact that that something like this

could have do you think that the state

of our economy and and the need to

maintain a robust economy because after

all you're all going to be participating

in our economy in a way you already are

but in the future you will be even more

it's important that we have a robust

economy so that we'll be able to provide

jobs for young people and for all of our

citizens but do you think it's it's

important to consider that when we're

considering climate change

thank you mr. Carter and also thank you

for being a member of the Roosevelt

conservation caucus

it's a caucus started by Republicans

focused on bringing conservatives back

to environmental discussions it's a it's

a major step forward so thank you so the

economy definitely needs to be a part of

this conversation because if we don't

take the economy into consideration

we're leaving the people who are at the

most risk at Kent we're keeping them at

the most risk we're allowing people who

are in the lower poverty levels to be

affected the most by our policies there

is a opportunity a strong opportunity to

be economically sensible and

environmentally sensible economic

sustained economic sustainability and

environmental sustainability do go

hand-in-hand and I think a lot of people

who are on this issue and believe that

this is a is a topic that's of

importance believe that the agricultural

industry corporations and fossil fuels

are a lot of the times the enemy but

they're part of our society and they are

today and they will be for the next at

least for the short term and so if we

want to lower emissions and we want to

have a cleaner economy we have to work

with people instead of against people

because the only way that we're gonna

truly reduce emissions is to do that and

that is true with the economy because we

can't have a strong environment without

a strong economy and the worldwide

statistics show as I mentioned earlier

that the most free economies are the

cleanest in the world does that mean

that they're done and that they don't

have to do more not in the slightest

but economic success and environmental

success go hand-in-hand ok if I could

and I'll let you just second there I

want to show you something on the screen

if we can get it up it's a chart that

the EPA has put out that we're gonna be

able to do it I just hold it up you want

me to hold it up ok all right ok are you

gonna be able to get this ok well

unfortunately you can't see it very well

but it is a chart that the EPA put out

in 2018 and it shows the growth of our

economy since 1970 in the United States

has actually grown our economy our ghost

medics take pride of the kids has grown

almost 300% our vehicles miles traveled

has grown almost 200% population is

grown energy consumption has grown but

our carbon output has decreased over

that period of time so it is possible to

do we can grow our economy and decrease

our carbon output we have done that

since 1970 in fact if you look we've

actually decreased the six common

pollutants almost a hundred percent

since 1970 while growing our economy so

it can be done one thing I want to make

sure we understand is that look look

listen to me this is not a Republican

Democratic issue this is an American

issue this is a world issue it's not the

United States versus China versus India

all of us have to work on this together

I've always believed in climate change I

believe the climate has been changing

since day one I don't I'm old enough to

remember you're not but I'm old enough

to remember the early 70s when we

thought we were headed for another Ice

Age well just man having an impact on

that yes we do have an impact how much

that might be debatable how

however we should do something that's

one of the things that I'm so excited

about and mr. backer you mentioned this

about the opportunities that exists here

because I've always said we've got to

had three things we got to have

innovation we've got to have mitigation

and we've got to have adaptation in that

innovation the greatest innovators the

greatest scientists in the world are

right here in the United States of

America that's why I'm excited about us

leading the way and I think we can't

lead the way yes we've got much to be

done there is there's no question about

that

you also mentioned about agriculture I

represent a very rural area in South

Georgia the rural community is going to

play a big part in this we cannot leave

them behind that is going to be very

important as well we have to be very

careful my message is simple and that is

that yes this is something we have to

deal with but we can't destroy our

economy when we're dealing with it we

have to keep that in mind we have to

have affordable reliable clean energy

Thank You mr. chairman and I yield back

well thank you as we said before we have

a hard stop so here's what I want to

just do in closing to be no closing

statements to allow whatever time is

limited I do want to recognize

representative Brownlee who's been here

paying great attention throughout the

whole hearing representative Levin

represented Titus representative Omar in

the case that we may not have the

opportunity because you do have to leave

so I'll now recognize representative

Meeks Thank You mr. chairman thank you

for this very very timely and important

hearing

climate change is undoubtedly an

economic threat that's true a national

security threat that's true and

ultimately and most importantly an

existential threat

it has battered our coasts set us and

set our forests ablaze in my home state

mr. Barrett's home state of New York

superstorm sandy destroyed the property

and uprooted the lives of

thousands of New Yorkers including many

living in my district I left if left on

abated climate change will displace

world populations Islands mr. Barrett

you're correct we'll be gone where

people currently live and it will

continue to wreak havoc on our own cost

and billions and damage that's economics

if you're not prepared there will be

billions of dollars that will cause

economic damage if we don't do something

about climate change

it will also climate change threatens to

undo the last 50 years of progress in

development in global health and poverty

reduction so we've got to do something

urgently if the world that we leave

behind that we all hold this world in

trust for the next generation so I look

at the world that I leave behind for my

new baby granddaughter will look

dramatically different if we do nothing

today indeed a drastic reduction and our

carbon footprint will be one of if not

the most important missions of our time

I also want to say and I heard miss ma

Golan say this a number of times I just

want to let you know that anxiety

research indeed shows that young people

have high levels of anxiety it isn't

though just because of climate change

everything from the economics to health

disparities to student loans etc of

course climate change is compounding

that problem but what you are doing by

being here

and leading does make a difference and I

just used the example of one of my

colleagues who at 16 years old helped

change and shape a nation his name was

John Lewis he put his life on the line

he had a lot of anxiety if you talked to

him but by doing this with that anxiety

and turning that anxiety into something

that you are going to lead to change it

makes the world a better place for all

of us

so I compliment you on how you all using

your anxiety to make a difference in the

world that is something that is so

important and indeed yes all young folks

I'm old enough to remember the civil

rights movement when it was led by

students and high school students who

said I'm sick and tired of being sick

and tired and they changed things so

believe this that each and every one of

you mr. Becker I've been listening to

you you are part of a change that's

going to make us all better to make this

nation and this world better one of the

things we will fight back and forth but

guess what I still bet on America we'll

go through some of the bad times because

lord knows I've seen bad times and I've

seen us come through it so I want to say

to each and every one of you don't give

up on America because what America is

all about is that if we stand up and

fight if we stand up for what we believe

in we will change things it does make a

difference it is the reason why I can

sit here mr. Barrett because I've seen

my father go through some terrible times

as an African American and then I saw

Barack Obama become President of the

United States

just for black folks but for all folks

keep up your work you will make this

place we call earth not only exist but

thrive and be a better place and I yield

back

well thank you thank you for your

extraordinary testimony it makes a

difference it will make a difference and

by the way it's bipartisan and based on

science thank you for being here we also

want to thank representative who's been

here too as well so you stayed later

than you agreed to I know how hard

pressed you are so if I could just ask

those in the audience and the press

allow the witnesses to go to the ante

room well where we came in from so that

you can get to your next place more

quickly so please remain seated allow

the witnesses to go to the ante room so

that they can have an expedited way back

to the next meeting which they agreed to

stay longer to hear our testimony with

that I adjourn this hearing thank you

you
