you people love you you they come here

whatever it is you love our way of life

you love our milk and honey at least you

could pay a couple of bucks for poppies

or something like that these are the

words that sparked outrage the reason

why Sportsnet has parted ways with Don

Cherry I don't know why he things like

that the Comets came Saturday night on

the weekly segment coaches corner and

one day later sports nets President

issued a statement calling the comments

offensive but there was no word on

disciplinary measures that came on

Monday afternoon in the form of a new

statement that says following further

discussions with Don Cherry after

Saturday night's broadcast it has been

decided it is the right time for him to

immediately step down people have mixed

feelings on the development I think

they're pushing it a little bit too far

sad that this is the way I'd end for the

guy right like after all these years

while others say it was the right choice

to make it was something that was needed

to be done to show people in those

positions that you guys can't make

controversial comments about immigrants

the National Hockey League issued a

statement on Monday saying the decision

was justifiable adding the opinions he

expressed are in direct conflict with

the values of diversity and inclusion

that we embrace as pillars of our sport

I'm sure he made remarks which were

hurtful discriminatory on Sunday Ron

MacLean addressed the controversy I owe

you an apology too that's the big thing

that I want to emphasize i sat there I

did not catch it did not respond I was

glad that Ron stood up and said

something but it's too bad he couldn't

find it himself to do it in the moment

but there's been no public statement

from Cherry himself the 85 year old only

quoted in a Toronto Sun article saying I

have just learned I've been fired by

Sports Net for comments made on Coach's

Corner

November 9th in the article cherry is

also quoted saying I know what I said

and I meant it everybody in Canada

should wear a puppy to honor our fallen

soldiers some experts say cherry has had

a history of making controversial

statements I guess the only surprise for

a lot of people is it's taken this long

but he

lasted till 85 you know throwing zingers

out there to the public that seem to

always get excused or people slough them

off but the backlash from his most

recent comments shows it is something

that is not being tolerated Erika Vella

Global News and reaction continues to

pour into social media the hashtags

fired on sherry and Don Cherry must go

were among several that were shared

another hashtag that was used I stand

with cherry but Twitter Canada says

fired on sherry has been used 15 times

more often than I stand with cherry
