I actually enjoy coming here I usually

try to come once a week maybe this is

kind of the only parenting you can do at

this point right you just keep their

grave clean and decorate it for

Christmas decorated for Halloween and

for their birthdays in September 2016

our little girl was born but she was she

actually died when I was 34 weeks

pregnant so she was stillborn

[Music]

when we found out that we were expecting

a girl we of course like any other

couple brainstormed names and of course

like every other couple did not agree on

any so we we had a couple and I've

always loved the name Marlowe I had a

feeling something was wrong on the night

of September 15th I remember it very

vividly it was a Thursday night and and

she just the movement patterns weren't

what they used to be you know like once

you're dead far along you kind of get

used to you anticipate it we went to the

hospital and then they checked me in and

we did quite a few ultrasounds and they

confirmed that indeed her heart had

stopped it was probably the most surreal

moment of my life because it just felt

like this is something that happens to a

friend of a friend of a friend you know

you kind of hear about it you feel bad

for them and then you move on you never

think that's something like this could

happen to you less than 1% of babies

born in North America are still born a

stillbirth means losing a baby after 20

weeks of pregnancy the biggest thing for

their follow-up physician to figure out

is what do we think the likely ideology

why did this happen so do we think it's

an infection so it more of a one-time

event or is it possibly a problem with

the uterus where there's something like

a septum or something that needs to be

repaired anyone can have a stillbirth

but it's more common to happen to people

who are 35 or older smoke cigarettes

during their pregnancies and people who

have lost a pregnancy before these are

just some of the factors that can be

linked to still birds and many people

like Magda fall outside of all of these

she was 33 years old when she had her

stillbirth and doctors said it was

random you don't really have a chance to

comprehend what's happening plus your

body is healing like you just you know

it's 34 weeks that's basically a

full-size infant

everybody has somebody died in their

family you know it's it's inevitable

people die but having your child die is

just it's it's a pain like no other

another type of pregnancy loss is a

miscarriage this is when someone loses a

pregnancy within the first 20 weeks

early miscarriages are much more common

in still births in the first 13 weeks of

gestational age up to one in four

pregnancies end in a miscarriage my name

is Michelle Bilodeau and I had my

miscarriage in November 2015 that was

the that was my first pregnancy

Monday morning I woke up and got ready

to go to work I went to go to the

bathroom and I noticed that I was

spotting and then on my way to work I

realized that this was something that

was bad that was happening it wasn't

just spotting I just see a doctor at the

walk-in clinic and he you know I just

kind of told him what was going on

through lots of tears and he told me

that yeah he thought I was having a

miscarriage doctors told Michelle she

miscarried because it was likely a

non-viable pregnancy meaning the baby

had no chance of being born alive

probably about 70 percent of all early

pregnancy loss is due to abnormal

chromosomes so meaning that the parents

both have completely normal genetics but

either the wrong sperm or egg is chosen

so what that happens is you create a

chromosome abnormal pregnancy after I

had my miscarriage I was still really

nervous to get pregnant as soon as we

started trying again I got pregnant

right away Michelle had her daughter

Emeline in December of 2016 every year

she goes as a lion for Halloween so far

a friend of ours called her Emma lion

we're really lucky that we had her but

I'm also like we're one and done I'm not

having another one there's a bunch of

reasons for that one and one reason is

because I've had a miscarriage and I

don't know if I can go through that

again

I feel like women feel like they have to

rush into having kids because we do have

a clock that goes out eventually right

so but I think if you've had a

miscarriage you need to give yourself

some time to grieve women don't talk

about miscarriages and after I had mine

that kind of stuck in my head that you

know women don't talk about it women

don't talk about it so when I had mine

and then was pregnant with my daughter I

just realized that I wanted to talk

about it

because women so frequently don't

[Music]

my biggest advice to people who who meet

somebody who has gone through this it's

just you know ask the baby's name ask

them questions about it and just help

them validate that experience you know

because you're acknowledging that it

happened you're acknowledging that it

was it was a human being that had died
