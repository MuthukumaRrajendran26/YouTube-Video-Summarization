the best moment is the moment of

realization it was a long time coming

there isn't a baseball fan around who

didn't write off Washington's team last

night last spring or any time over the

last 95 years the team's owner was born

one year after Washington won its last

World Series in 1924 what followed the

old Washington Senators World Series win

was almost a century of futility and

disappointment a team so bad a hit

Broadway musical and movie told the tale

of a ball fan who would sell his soul to

help Washington win when young luck is

batting zero get Chuck chin up off the

floor for Washington it seems there were

outs at every base in its history the

team left Washington for Minnesota in

1960 the new team still hapless lasted

11 years and moved to Texas Washington

would then go 33 years without a team

until the Nationals in 2005 and even

their home plate was out of reach for a

team now forever linked to Washington's

baseball history the Montreal Expos

Montreal too had a long struggle to keep

its team and this fate would have it the

Expos moved to Washington for some the

Nationals win is at best bittersweet

Expos nation proclaimed indifference

Congrats to them but they're not our

team still a comeback in sports is an

uplifting story a team that couldn't win

a home game in the World Series still

won it all and fans back in DC could

celebrate at long last

[Applause]

maybe Montreal will make a baseball

comeback as improbable as Washington's

one former Expo Dave Martinez eventually

became the manager of the now World

Series champs just to be a man

who gets an opportunity to even play in

the World Series and all now to win it

what an unbelievable feeling a sport

steeped in the memory of its past and a

team that came to understand what it

really takes to win and Broadway knew it

all along
