if we don't hold this president

accountable we could be ceding our

ability to hold any president

accountable Democrats are trying to

impeach the president because they are

scared they cannot defeat him at the

ballot box the historic vote split

predictably down partisan lines it's a

sad day for all of us Democrats use

their majority to approve the rules for

the next phase of the impeachment

inquiry the yeas are 232 the nays are

196

despite Republican calls to shut the

whole process down trying to put a

ribbon on a sham process doesn't make it

any less of a sham the next phase of the

inquiry moves the case against the

president into full public view with

open hearings and the release of

transcripts from earlier depositions so

that the public can see the facts for

themselves for the first time the

president's lawyers will be able to

question witnesses but Republicans argue

the probe is still illegitimate claiming

it's based on a flawed process and an

anonymous whistleblower shortly after

the vote president Trump phoned into a

British radio show I think what it means

and what a lot of people are saying

because it's a hoax and you know high

crimes and misdemeanors well what's a

high crime and misdemeanor when you have

a very appropriate conversation notably

only a select few Republicans have come

to defend Trump's conduct on that July

phone call with ukrainian President

Vladimir szalinski there's nothing in

that phone call that is wrong or

impeachable and as the vote took place

the impeachment inquiry continued behind

closed doors with testimony from a top

White House advisor who was on that call

the inquiry has already heard from other

White House officials who raised serious

concerns about the conversation staff

who believed Trump made clear demands

for Ukraine to open an investigation

into Joe Biden in exchange for US

military aid as Jackson and now that the

impeachment inquiry is moving into this

public phase is there a timeline for

events well that part is still a bit of

an unknown but nationally televised

hearings could begin in the next few

weeks until then those closed-door

interviews are going to continue and

it's worth pointing out that congressman

ad

Schiff who's been leading the

investigation said that today's vote

paves the way to make public transcripts

of the depositions and interviews that

have already taken place interesting so

there are still key people Jackson being

called to testify behind closed doors

who's on that list yeah John Bolton has

to be the biggest name there he's

Trump's former national security adviser

he of course left abruptly in September

over disagreements with the president

meaning that it's now hard for the White

House to actually block him from

testifying Bolton's deputies have

already sort of said that Bolton was

angry about the pressure being placed on

Ukraine to launch that investigation

into Joe Biden and of course Bolton

would have intimate knowledge of what

exactly was happening inside the

administration so watch what happens

there very closely
