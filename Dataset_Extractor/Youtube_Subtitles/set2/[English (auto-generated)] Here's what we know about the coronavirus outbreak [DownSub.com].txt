most of the nearly 300 confirmed cases

are at hospitals here in Wuhan there is

heightened concern all across the world

including here at the US officials here

in Wuhan have designated nine hospitals

as treatment centers including this one

right behind me all eyes are on a new

strain of a corona virus the outbreak of

this new virus is linked to a seafood

and animal market in Wuhan China

it's a corona virus and it's likely that

this originated in some non-human animal

and and jump from a nonhuman animal into

a human now health officials believe the

virus is spreading through human to

human contact the first reported case of

this new virus was on December 31st 2019

so what is a corona virus and what do we

know so far about this new strain

viruses is one of a group of viruses

there are a number of corona viruses

that affect humans there also a lot of

other corona viruses that infect other

species of animals like other corona

viruses the strain of zoonotic which

basically means the virus can travel

between animals and humans in people the

symptoms vary some can be mild like the

common cold or much more severe like

SARS or MERS it's also true that when

SARS first started it actually changed

fairly quickly over the first three

months so we don't know whether this

virus is a virus that is going to be

stable the way it is now or whether two

months from now it's going to have some

different characteristics then it

appears to have now the way in which any

corona virus is transmitted is pretty

similar a virus has to get to the cells

that line the back of your nose and your

throat so that can happen because you

breathe the virus in sometimes they

might land on the surface around them

and you might put your hand down and

then put your hand up to your mouth

though it can be it can be through the

air or it can be from time and depending

on how you look at it the symptoms the

virus causes can mirror the common cold

most people would really think about

fever cough and shortness of breath

and unfortunately for us in the northern

hemisphere it's we're in the middle of

influenza season right now so it's not

uncommon at all for people to have a

fever cough and shortness of breath

because of an influenza infection or an

infection with one of about a million

other circulating viruses that cause an

influenza like illness the first

confirmed case was in China since then

more cases were reported elsewhere in

Asia along with the US
