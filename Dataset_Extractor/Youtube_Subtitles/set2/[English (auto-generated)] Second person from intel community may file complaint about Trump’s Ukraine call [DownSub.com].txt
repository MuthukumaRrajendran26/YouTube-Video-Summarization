with his presidency potentially on the

line Donald Trump's call for corruption

investigations could spark a new

whistleblower battle the New York Times

reports a second intelligence community

official is thinking of filing a formal

complaint despite Trump's reactions to

the first it's reported the official has

more direct knowledge of what's alleged

to be a pressure campaign on Ukraine to

investigate Joanne hunter Biden despite

criticism Trump has openly called for

China to follow suit insisting it has

nothing to do with politics sparking

reaction from the former vice president

what he's doing that no president has

ever done

no president there's also a question as

to whether or not a true quid pro quo

was associated with Trump's call to

Ukraine text messages appear to show the

release of Defense aid if an

investigation was started in an

interview with The Wall Street Journal

Republican Senator Ron Johnson says he

was told exactly that by EU Ambassador

Gordon Sunland Johnson saying my

reaction was oh god I don't want to see

those two things combined notice the

president didn't deny that he had said

those things we want the tapes we want

the information we want to end the

stonewalling that has gone on we'll work

through this process meanwhile the

impeachment battle is also being fought

between Congress and the State

Department a Friday deadline for

documents from the Secretary of State

was ignored Mike Pompeo calling the

requests abuse asked them to do so

without saying hey don't bother calling

the State Department lawyers just talk

to us directly that's a that's

harassment and I'll never let that

happen to my team Democrats leading the

impeachment claim any request that goes

unanswered will be deemed obstruction

leaving the party to insist grounds for

the impeachment inquiry are solid

they're just names going around of me

and and I'm saying Donald you used to

own a casino you know the house always

wins

regi what has been the reaction from

Republicans well Robyn there aren't many

Republican senators that have spoken out

against the president's actions and the

few that have found themselves in the

line of fire from Trump's Twitter

account Utah senator Mitt Romney says

the president's appeals to foreign

nations is wrong and appalling but Trump

then hit back telling Romney to wake up

and saying he's bad for Republicans but

the lack of noise from the GOP might

have an impact on how the 2020 election

plays out the latest poll shows 51% of

Americans are in favor of impeachment

and if Republicans choose to line

themselves up with the president they

risk alienating some of that population
