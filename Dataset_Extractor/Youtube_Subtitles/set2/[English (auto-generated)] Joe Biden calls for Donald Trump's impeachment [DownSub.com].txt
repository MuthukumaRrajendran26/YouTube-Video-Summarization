he believes if he does something it's

legal

period and perhaps most important he

believes there's nothing we can do about

it he believes he can and will get away

with anything he does

we all laughed when he said he could

stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and

shoot someone and get away with it

it's no joke he shooting holes in the

Constitution and we can not let him get

away with it
