well I'm not siding with anybody we've

been in Syria for many years you know

Syria was supposed to be a short-term

hit just a very short-term hit and we

were supposed to be in and out that was

many many years ago and we only have 50

people in that area that's a small

sector and I don't want those 50 people

hurt or killed or anything I don't want

anything bad to happen to our people and

I told that to president Erdogan I said

don't hurt any of our any of our people

get hurt

big trouble now a couple of things I

think there's a lot of pressure on

Turkey they've been fighting with the

PKK for many years their natural enemies

have you read today a couple of reports

saying that when President Obama started

this whole thing as you know it was

started by President Obama

he created a natural war with Turkey and

they're their longtime enemy PKK and

they're still there and they're still

hating each other beyond anybody's

belief but I have told Turkey that if

they do anything outside of what we

would think is humane to use the word a

second time we talked about Hong Kong we

talked about this they could suffer the

wrath of a extremely decimated economy I

consulted with everybody I always

consult with everybody if you remember

about eight months ago I talked about

doing this and we kept 2,000 people

there and then slowly brought them out

but once we captured Isis I didn't see I

don't want to stay there for the next 40

years not gonna do anything the end game

is going to be the same I have great

respect for all of the people that you

named and they have their opinion and a

lot of people do and I could also name

many more than you just named of people

that totally are supportive you see the

names coming out people are extremely

thrilled because they say it's time to

bring our people back home we're not a

police force they're policing the area

we're not a police force
