today's charges demonstrate that we will

partner with law enforcement agencies

across the government to protect our

technology supply chain from

infiltration and compromised by foreign

adversaries and those who would trade

our national security for personal

profit thank you I will now turn the top

podium over to assistant director in

charge bill Sweeney of the FBI thanks

rich good morning everybody we alleged

to Jack and Francis cavasso along with

their co-conspirators risk the security

of the United States by selling tens of

millions of dollars of prohibited

surveillance equipment and other

products to US government agencies and

private sector customers with the

majority of that money going to PRC

based manufacturing companies barred by

law from having these contracts in the

first place they did it all for one

reason and one reason only to make money

over the course of the past decade their

company have insured technologies made

upwards of eighty million dollars

including approximately 36 million in

federal government contracts do not let

the fraud and money laundering charges

distract you from the real threat

created by their conduct it is

outrageous there should be no question

in the mind of any American as to the

absurdity of doing business as we allege

today with a PRC based manufacturer of

video surveillance technology with known

cyber security vulnerabilities falsely

representing products is made in the USA

is dangerous business when American

servicemen and women around the globe

among others are dependent upon the

security of the technology supporting

and surrounding them have ensures

clients were deliberately deceived by

the fake made in USA labels which were

added to the Chinese manufactured

products representing the products as

manufactured here in this country in

reality the only thing made the United

States were the lies I Ventura sold to

its victims if there are any other

vendors out there who are considering

cutting corners like the Cavazos today's

announcement should serve as a warning

to you

your decisions have broader implications

beyond your company's bottom line and

inappropriate decisions you make will

likely result in similar consequences

many thanks rich to you and your team

the agencies that are represented by the

leadership here today a person wanted a

note CDP Troy and Frank and your team

General Services Administration Office

of Inspector General New York field

office the General Services

Administration provides systems and

programs to help federal government

agencies to purchase the goods and

services they need to serve the American

public this investigation was initiated

by the Office of Inspector General in

2017 as a result of a complaint

submitted to GSA OIG hotline that

Aventura technologies incorporated was

lying to the government cleaning

products sold to the US government were

made in America when in fact they were

actually manufactured in China our joint

investigation not only established

probable cause to substantiate these

allegations but uncovered other

potential criminal schemes involving the

subjects arrested today it is vital

GSA's acquisition systems and programs

have integrity and be free from

manipulation and corruption GSA

contractors must be honest and

forthcoming when doing business with the

US federal government

today's allegations are not about

technical errors in a database or on a

form nor are they about an

administrative violation this

investigation is about corrupt behavior

a conspiracy to intentionally break the

and deceive the government in order to

improperly obtain an allelic excuse me

illegally profit from federal government

contracts the GSA Office of Inspector

General with our law enforcement

partners and the United States

Attorney's Office will continue to

investigate fraud corruption and other

financial crimes impacting GSA with

particular emphasis on products that

endanger the safety and welfare of the

government employees or compromised

government infrastructure and systems we

encourage anyone with knowledge of

wrongdoing involving a government

contract or government contractor to

report stocks to GSA's office of

inspector general for investigation

thank you for your time good morning my

name is Troy Miller I'm the director of

field operations for Customs and Border

Protection here in New York the US

Customs and Border Protection takes

great pride in working with our federal

state local enforcement partners and

industry stakeholders to fight

cross-border trade and dangerous and

illicit goods the case this case is of

it as a great example of collaborative

law enforcement efforts to uncover

dismantle cripple and dismantle criminal

enterprises that seek to defraud the

United States government for personal

gain while jeopardizing our national

defense and causing economic harm to

their competitors based on a request

from the Inspector General of the

general service Services

Administration's CBP initiated a focused

operation CBP tracked more than 500

shipments that Adventura imported into

the United States from China between May

2017 and today

CBP along with our partners determined

that a venture imported many fully

assembled and finished products

Aventuras imported goods did not bear a

country of origin markings when they

arrived at JFK John F Kennedy Airport

and many items arrived preassembled with

aventuras logo at American flags United

States law requires that all imported

goods with few exceptions must be marked

with the country of origin

the time of import this is a perfect

example of how law enforcement comes

together to bring these individuals to

justice thank you good morning everyone

my name is William Cal I'm the special

agent in charge of the Treasury

Inspector General for tax administration

northeast field Division the ticular

office of Investigations is charged with

the detection investigation and

Prevention of fraud waste and abuse

within the Internal Revenue Service and

Internal Revenue Service programs

including federal contracts the federal

contracts and procurement process

today's arrests represent the

culmination of years of complex and

multifaceted investigative efforts

requiring coordination by federal law

enforcement officers and prosecutors

from over 10 US government agencies

these defendants fraudulently line their

pockets with millions of dollars in

taxpayer funds while potentially placing

the security of the United States in

jeopardy

the defendants knowingly made false

statements to secure US government

contracts worth millions of dollars

the defendants then took affirmative

steps to secure the goods and products

from outside of the United States while

purporting and creating the illusion

that these products were all made in

America the ticket office of

Investigations is committed to working

independently and with our law

enforcement partners to root out this

type of fraud from the government

contracting a procurement process

I want to thank US Attorney Donohue and

for his steadfast support and that of

his talented prosecutors that they all

gave to this investigation and to our

law enforcement partners as well thank

you all good morning my name is John

peasant Jack from the acting special

agent in charge IRS Criminal

Investigation New York field office this

morning 34 IRS special agents along with

our partners participated in arrest

warrants search warrants interviews and

seizure warrants in today's global

economy individuals businesses and

government alike take pride and comfort

in purchasing products marked made in

America but

defendants like the ones charged today

threatened that trust we put this valued

label and furthermore risk of our

country's national security what is most

shocking about this crime in an era when

Nash when we were so focused on US

manufacturing and ongoing trade talks

are focused on protecting our national

security that there would be so many

co-conspirators who have knowingly

defraud the United States government and

put American lives at risk for personal

enrichment while 70 percent of IRS

Criminal Investigation are tax related

charges

the investigators early on realized that

money-laundering related to the

siphoning of illicit proceeds through

shell companies and attorneys was the

most appropriate and most impactful

charges as a representative of IRS

Criminal Investigation I'm often asked

why IRS would be involved in a national

security investigation like this one or

similar type case IRS agents

investigates significant and complex

cases where any economic gain or pure

greed or the motivation of the

underlying crime today's charges send a

clear message I RS criminal

investigation and its law enforcement

partners work tirelessly to expose con

artists devising elaborate schemes that

exploit our financial system for their

personal gain we are proud to be

standing here today with our law

enforcement partners and we thank all of

them for the work that they did in the

Aventura investigation thank you

good morning my name is Leo Lamont I'm

the special agent in charge for the

Naval Criminal Investigative Service

northeast field office product

substitution is not a victimless crime

it is a serious offense that puts our

brave men and women in uniform at risk

these servicemembers are putting their

lives on the line every day and we need

to have the conference and they need to

have confidence in their weapon systems

and equipment they are issued and it

will not fail them at the worst possible

moment our sailors Marines and other

armed service personnel deserve to have

the equipment that meets the highest

standards and safety and performance

counterfeit the substandard parts and

components simply cannot be dependent

upon American taxpayers are also victims

the flagrant and wrongful misuse of

taxpayers dollars erodes the public

trust and jeopardizes the Department of

Navy's efforts to obtain the best

technology and equipment for our sailors

and Marines investigating product

substitution and mitigating risks to the

Department of the Navy supply chain is a

top priority for the Naval Criminal

Investigative Service and sched will

continue to aggressively seek out and

combat fraud in all forms that impact

the Department of Navy thank you there

were a couple different ways that this

was brought to the attention of the

investigators but you're right there is

a an explanation in the complaint and

I'll stick to the the four corners of

complaint but essentially there it says

that one of the members of an Air Force

security unit noticed that there was an

image in the software that related to a

Chinese security service and so

obviously that raised some questions why

would there be an image of a badge of a

Chinese security service uploaded into

the software of an American camera and

that led to the inspection of the camera

and the inspection revealed as

inspections throughout the course the

investigation revealed that that

equipment was actually manufactured in

China and that the software was from

China

again it'd have you take a look at the

the complaint which lays it out in more

detail but sensor when you're talking

about their network surveillance systems

so you're not just talking about a

standalone camera that was manufactured

in China you're talking about

surveillance systems and other

electronic equipment that you put in

your installation and you use in your

installation to take note of what is

going on and to record what's going on

so obviously when you have Chinese made

cameras with PRC software loaded into

the network into sensitive installations

such as army bases Navy bases do a

facilities and even American aircraft

carriers that causes a great great

concern for our national security I'm

not gonna go beyond what's in the

complaint but you'll see the complaint

it does set forth and as we said this

morning that there were no cyber

security risks here meaning that this

software that was then deployed into

u.s. systems was known to have

vulnerabilities that would allow others

to access those networks and had we

known that this was Chinese software we

may have been able to take steps to

patch it and address that risk but

because this was masked and we did not

know it was Chinese software in many

instances those steps were not taken

we are in the process of working with

our partners to make sure that it is all

removed and remediated I can't say

exactly where we are in that process

right now you will see in the complaint

that there's some very explicit

conversations in email and otherwise

between jacquard Osso and individuals in

the PRC who are supplying this equipment

where he's making it very clear that the

origin must be masked so the happy

modifications made to the software

because if traits let's just look at the

software they can see where it comes

from so he makes requests to have that

information that ident identifying

information removed similar to the way

they miss mark the hardware itself again

I won't go past the complaint but you

can see that individuals in China were

well aware where this was going and that

the end-user should not be in a position

to learn the origin of the equipment

[Music]

yeah I don't want to go what beyond

what's in the complaint we do not

specify the impact on naval or military

operations I will say obviously we had

to go in there and remove this equipment

so there was an impact on operations I

certainly would go so far as to say

ships were taking a service or anything

like that you know the investigation has

taken a number of months I think the the

complaint might give you a better

understanding I believe it was CBP who

first recognized the scope the scale in

the nature of the problem and then

brought in a larger team to address it

but had been underway for quite some

time it's a 13-year skiing right and so

obviously we were deep into it before

anyone the US government had any inkling

that there was something wrong here and

that required us to go back and then for

some certain short period of time we

also a collection is go through so for

instance the shipping on the board that

I showed you previously I was a shipment

that came through JFK that was

intercepted opened marked in ways that

the recipients would not be able to

recognize and then allowed to proceed so

that we could then see them ultimately

delivered to the end-users in u.s.

facilities and confirmed that in fact

those were the pieces of equipment that

Aventura brought from China there's

nothing to complain about that and we

don't have any information about that

today but I just think it is interesting

to show the brazenness of the scheme

that he is accusing others of using the

equipment that he himself is submitting

to the US government

we executed a search warrant this

morning and I've insurer we already have

a lot of their business records but

we're certainly going to be going

through those to make sure that we are

aware of any shipments that they have

brought to the u.s. and run those down

and remove a remediate there are no

allegations of the complaint about the

Chinese government itself and we're not

making any today obviously it's a grave

concern to the United States that

infrastructure is compromised by a

hardware and software made in the

People's Republic of China

all right maybe one more question as far

as we tell at this point

Aven sure is simply ordered it from the

PRC they relabeled it repackaged it and

sent it off the US government and

private customers all right again thank

you all for being here today if you have

any further questions please direct them

the domore Zhu Li and we'll get you an

answer thank you once again thank you to

the assisting United States Attorney's

and our great partners who made this

case
