will people be coming in the back here

for a second and we'll let them get

organized and just I want to thank

Governor Lee by the way for being here

we will talk about Metro for a little

bit and then I know the governor wants

to update the state on the state and so

and then we'll have questions thereafter

and we have collected here are a whole

lot of specific area experts so just to

give the next session some shape to it

okay well if everybody's here thanks

let's get started

good morning last night was a reminder

about how fragile life is at any moment

an event can show up and make us all too

painfully aware of this this morning's

tornado devastated our community and I

want to extend my deepest condolences to

the family friends and loved ones of our

neighbors who we lost as a result of

this deadly storm I had a chance to

visit with storm survivors early this

morning of the Nashville farmers market

and I was struck by the strength of

spirit displayed by our neighbors of all

ages and I also will say their pets it

was great to see their pets with them

giving comfort to each other now as I

speak firefighters and urban search and

rescue personnel continue to examine

collapsed buildings to ensure first and

foremost that all residents are

accounted for I want to thank our first

responders utility workers and Metro

agency professionals for the incredible

work they've done overnight to keep our

residents safe and our cities running

and I want to thank our neighboring

counties for their offers of help both

for today and frankly the weeks to come

and I'd like to remind those of our

neighbors who've been displaced by storm

damage that we currently have to

shelters open and running in East

Nashville there is the east magnet high

school and on the west side the

Centennial Sports Plex is up and running

now for the many thousands of you have

called posted and emailed with generous

offers to help I do have some

recommendations hands on Nashville is

ramping up efforts with community

partners and volunteers to begin cleanup

efforts throughout our hardest hit

neighborhoods you can sign up to

volunteer at H o in dot o-r-g now

monetary donations please the Community

Foundation at CF MT org is equipped to

handle financial donations and then the

Community Resource Center is available

for donations except for clothing and

all three are worthy community partners

and will put your donation and money to

good work

now basically Metro agencies have been

working since early this morning to

quickly respond to this storm assess

damage citywide and to begin recovery

efforts many Nashvillians are without

power at this moment and I urge you to

be patient and rest assured that NES is

working hard to restore power throughout

the city now as damage reports continue

to come in I urge Davidson County

residents to stay clear of damaged

structures and downed power lines so

that emergency crews and officials can

do their work and to report a non

emergency cleanup request which there

will be many residents can dial 3 1 1

from anywhere in Davidson County and

frankly if you can refrain from driving

on our roads today you will help metros

cleanup and recovery efforts to go

further faster now my office it's been I

want to compliment that state and the

federal government for their offers of

assistance Nashvillians our

oan for our realities ilion's and it's

time to show the world once again that

we can accomplish a whole lot when we

come together as a community and lend

each other a helping hand so if you can

avoid traveling today please do so

remember our three great community

partners to take donations do not go

into a damaged structure or near a

downed power line that's extremely

important and as we recover from this

we'll be continued to be a great great

city but it will take a while for people

to get power back on to every home in

Nashville now with that being said I

want to just acknowledge people here

from the metro and then turn this over

to the state we have our Farr Chief

William Swan is here available to answer

questions chief Anderson of our great

Police Department Scott Potter from

Metro order to cause to Jenkins from any

us he's gonna have just a big job in the

weeks ahead Eddie Davidson from Piedmont

natural gas gas leaks are a big concern

and a situation like this mark

Sturdivant the Director of Public Works

and then Patrick Sheehan the director of

FEMA is here but with this I'd like to

turn this over to the governor and then

we'll be open to answering questions

from you thank you Thank You mayor thank

you let me first say that there's been a

real coordinated effort thanks to the

mayor thanks to the team in Metro

Nashville Davidson County I applaud the

efforts of folks that have been up all

night long and working to make sure that

we have the appropriate response and

we've coordinated that effort with the

Tennessee effort the statewide effort I

have been at the State Emergency

Response Center we're here today at the

Metro right now at the Metro response

center so I think the thing that I want

to say first is thank you for your

efforts and for all of those that are

working to make sure that folks are safe

and that we respond to the tragedy

secondly let me just acknowledge tragedy

it is heartbreaking we have had loss of

life all across the state four different

counties have at as of this morning had

confirmed fatalities in Benton County

Putnam County Wilson County Davidson

County non confirmed fatalities so far

there are a number of people that are

missing in different areas many that are

injured and being transported so I

encourage all of you to pray for the

families across our state that are

facing tragedy right now and that are

dealing with heartache and hardship in

in ways that that that only they know so

our hearts go out to them and our

prayers go out to them and for those who

are supporting and making the efforts to

to support them so we do have we do have

non confirmed fatalities there are folks

missing where we have deployed teams

across the state in a search and rescue

effort where that's necessary we do have

a very strong coordinated response we

have ambulances lined up and and

available in sections where we need them

we deployed additional state troopers to

Wilson County to Smith County and beyond

we have we have opened up shelters

around the state where necessary we have

been in touch with the White House this

morning to assist to ask for assistance

federally we have been in touch with our

with our federal delegation senators and

congressmen so that they're aware and we

are coordinating that effort from a

federal standpoint it's a state of

emergency and that allows us to to

access additional additional services so

we're doing everything that we can to

respond to this that being said it's a

very difficult situation and we'll be

expanding that response as the day

unfolds and

we understand even greater what the

damages are I'll be I'll be in a

helicopter flying over damaged areas

across the state later this morning and

that will give all of us a better idea

of the extent of the damages that's all

being analyzed right now so I'll just

we'll have a Q&A here to get specific

questions but I think overall I wanted

to to remind folks of the tragedy and

and our need to reach out and support

others also to encourage folks that we

have a very strong coordinated effort

and response here in Tennessee that I'm

I'm very proud of the folks that have

been up all night long working to make

sure that we that we accomplish what we

need to get accomplished and that we

have much to know and much to learn in

the hours ahead and we'll be providing

information and input and feedback to

Tennesseans as we get that information

be mindful of the things that the mayor

said not traveling into downtown if you

don't need to and that would hold true

in Putnam County and and other areas of

damage don't go where the damage is if

you don't need to be there we have

emergency personnel that are assisting

but then but then do stay aware of how

it is that you can volunteer when the

time is right to surround our citizens

and to be there for them when they need

it

so I thank you for the opportunity I

thank you mayor for and many in this

room who are coordinating the effort we

we will stay on it all day long and

continue to report back why don't we why

don't we have our our personnel from

emergency response teams come up here

and then we'll have we'll do Q&A the

Chiefs would come up also and team

thank you so we'll take questions and

then direct responses to the appropriate

person well you always worry we we have

a we've got a lot of great codes

inspectors here so they did their job

and you can look

you

we're making sure that that

that went as safely as it did well it's

very inspiring you know I mean many of

them over in one case had their

three-year-old child that they grabbed a

packing plane and were able just to get

out and done it they were calm

they were resilient they were looking

after each other there was not a lot of

conversation I will say but there was

grace because I think they realized how

lucky we are with the fragility of life

that's my overwhelming feeling was just

a group of people experiencing grace

together

so we we did speak with the White House

this morning and the way this works is

when we had when we can provide

information that shows that we have a

disaster that qualifies for federal aid

then we begin to submit for that so they

actually have reached out and said is

there anything you need us to do right

now immediately and until we have a full

assessment we don't believe that's the

case but what they will be able to help

us with is assistance down the road so

and we will apply for that and

coordinate those efforts with them but

let me just say I was encouraged with

the immediate response and the immediate

coordination between the federal

government and our state in a total

willingness to help us out and we'll be

walking down that path together with

them in the days ahead

yeah well personally Maria and I are

praying for every single one of those

families and not just the families but

the communities around them you know

that lost tragic sudden loss like that

can be a powerful it can do powerful

damage in a community but it can also

bring a lot of hope so we're praying

we're hopeful that people will surround

those families and and there's a really

good possibility that there may be more

because of the number of folks that we

know that are missing and haven't been

reported and you know it's early and

it's it's early yet but a couple things

one one we do need to reach out to them

but and two we will respond to them in

ways that that really government can but

it's going to take a community to

respond to these families and I'm

certain their communities their churches

their their folks will gather around

them and that's what we know it happens

in this state we're remarkable people

who respond to tragedy and crisis in

remarkable ways and I'm sure that will

be the case for those families and

any other step might that might be

affected well thank both the mayor and

the governor's hit on a couple points

and that's our urban search-and-rescue

teams from the time this event started

to actually currently right now there

are action door-to-door community checks

along with PD we have our personnel

right now going up in there to get an

aerial view of the devastation we will

actually map it out from the air and

then bring it down back to the EOC and

we will actually then from there deploy

more people out to the most devastating

areas that we see but it is a collective

effort we we know we've got 48 as far as

building collapsed and then we have

either full collapse or partial collapse

from the fire department standpoint we

had 30 personnel that was injured we've

made over 400 calls from the time the

event started to now we transported over

a hundred and fifty-six personnel it has

already been stated unfortunately we

have two fatalities and one severely

injured but again this will be an

ongoing effort as we gather our

resources and sort of take a view of all

the damage because again once it started

we had people there actually trying to

get people out of structures and get

them in a fashion orderly fashion into a

safer zone and now we're just trying to

map it out so that we can actually put

more boots on the grounds to make sure

that we're taking care of people that we

may not even know that's injured or hurt

so again everybody's working very hard

when we started activation started this

morning around about 1:45 where we

actually pulled in all the

infrastructure that we needed all the

teams from from police to fire Public

Works and water and NES and so many

others that Red Cross and many others so

we can all come together collectively

and make decisions as one body to be

able to be more in an orderly fashion so

again I just commend everyone and like

the the mayor said and the governor

we're resilient people usually come

together when something like this

happens so we're just looking for

everybody to come come together as one

and just to help out your fellow man

thank you these are the 30 personnel

that we have that are actually injured

these are on the scene injuries that

took place so these from anywhere from

people that was aiding and helping but

remember the total transport that we

made from the from the calls it's been

about 156 personnel we had about 400

calls I mean from the time again it

started to now we're just now level

leveling out where we're back to a more

normal status as far as our call volume

that's coming in but just a lot of when

the event happened you can imagine we're

just overwhelmed with all the calls and

again I just commend the departments

with their response and just being on

point

yeah we don't know that yeah we just the

reports are just coming in and Patrick

Sheehan may have an update on that but

know there are you know these tornadoes

drop down in multiple places across the

state so and it's it's still early yet

but there's debris damage and building

damages in places severely for example

in in Putnam County and knowing who is

missing and who is not is hard to find

out at this point but that that

information will come as the day

progresses you know I can't answer that

I just know that the report is that

there are there are missing persons

across the state but I didn't get

information on which counties have how

many folks not at all it's significant

you can see that even in even in

Germantown it's significant but this

stretches all the way you know from from

the middle of this to actually from one

end of the state to the other when you

consider Benton County to to Putnam

County and beyond

so there'll be extensive damage but we

don't know how much that'll be yet

downtown we've actually deployed

generators to polling stations that are

reporting that they don't have that they

don't have power so of course we want

people to to exercise caution in in

areas like downtown Nashville where

there's where there's damage in the

streets and that sort of thing but we

also want folks to to exercise their

rights and get out their votes are very

important day for for that so we're

going to make it as as possible make it

make it possible for as many folks as we

can to vote and wherever we find a polis

tation that there's a problem where

we're reaching out to correct that

actually chief Swann has a list I think

it's worth going over of the alternative

polling places if he would bring us

up-to-date in mayor what we decided to

do the Election Commission is actually

putting out alternate places to go vote

and they're doing via the news media of

course in the social media outlets so if

you just pay a close attention than add

also from the EOC perspective we'll be

putting that list out because it's a

pretty big list so I will not take the

time to mention each one of them but

just know they move the time of to 8

o'clock and there will be voting today

and

and they're doing a great job of getting

alternates vote voting locations so just

pay closer attention to that and we'll

constantly put that out so we want

everybody to actually be able to and put

it in perspective chief I think it's 15

polling locations out of 169 precincts

so the likelihood of voting going on in

your precinct as normal is very great

right is very great only less than 10%

are effective with a 15 polling places

that are having an alternative site out

of basically 169 precincts so the

likelihood of you being able to vote

regularly at your home precinct is very

great but everybody should check and

make sure if they are on one of that

list of 15 and the Election Commission

is facilitating regular voting and I'm

sure if you get there up until 659

tonight they will keep it open for you

thank you everyone will send out those

precinct locations

and again I do want to thank the state

very much and the governor for being

here and we're going to need the state's

help and the federal government's help

for the assistance to rebuild because

that's what's gonna happen starving in

about two days once NES gets the power

back on

then on to getting our city rebuild no

but some areas clearly will be wouldn't

you agree and actually the cost if you

didn't mind just giving us an update cuz

I know you've got thousands of viewers

for whom that's very much upper mind so

Thank You mayor first let me say that

our hearts are broken for the city that

we service and love and that we stand by

our customers our neighbors and our

friends and we will get through this

tragedy in terms of statistics our

initial assessment is there 50,000

customers out we've got four major

substations out now we were able to

restore power to the central substation

which feeds a big part of downtown we've

got about 80 poles out and the 161

kilovolt line that that's a TV a line

that feeds the Hermitage substation is

out and that's one of our major focuses

we can get that line back up then that

will restore power to most of the people

in Hermitage

but it's going to be a massive effort a

massive coordinated effort we will try

to get power on as soon as we can and

people that can accept power they're

going to be some people that won't be

able to accept power for a while but

we'll get the power on to the people

that can accept it

that's what would you do you have

anything to add from a teammate

perspective and then that we've we've

not said so the election support so is

not just Davidson County so Secretary of

State's office and governor and our

teams have had conversations today about

coordinating to make sure that power is

available to those polling locations

they can take it and I know that

secretary Harkins team is working to

with the Attorney General to make sure

that they can be as flexible as possible

with accommodating votes and I'm not

sure how that discussion is gone I'm

sure the Secretary of State's office is

preparing remarks about that but we're

all working to make sure that

Tennesseans can vote today it's an

incredibly important day for our

democracy and it wasn't the immediate

need that we were focused on but we knew

that today it was very important so and

we do have searches and rescues going on

in a number of counties and that's why

we don't have numbers yet but that will

continue to develop and the governor I

think is right that we will see an

increase in the number of fatalities

today so please keep those families your

thoughts and in your prayers and be

mindful about ways that you can help so

going into those areas today and

tomorrow probably not the best way but

there'll be people that need donations

and they're reputable organizations

that'll be able to help them so please

find ways which should be like that

I'll just add two mayor's closing

comments it is a very tragic and

difficult day in Tennessee but this is

where people come together to see

Redemption and tragedy and we see that

with our emergency personnel all across

this state doing exactly what we need to

do to respond I'm very proud of the

responses from Metro all the way to

these remote counties

statewide and even the response from the

federal government as tragic as this is

and our hearts are broken we we are

certain that will will surround these

folks and we'll do what's necessary and

we will take what is a difficult

situation as Tennesseans do and make the

most of what we can we have great

for as this day unfolds where it's

headed and what the days ahead will be

for us through this very difficult spot

that our state finds itself in but very

hopeful place as well
