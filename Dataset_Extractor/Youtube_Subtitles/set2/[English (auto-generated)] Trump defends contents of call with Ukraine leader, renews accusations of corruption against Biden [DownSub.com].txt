and the conversation was perfect it

couldn't have been nicer I saw Rick

Scott I saw many of the Senators talking

about it many of the congressmen talking

about it not a thing wrong unless you

heard the Adam Schiff version where he

made up my conversation he actually made

it up it should be criminal it should be

treasonous he made it up every word of

it made up and read to Congress as

though I said it and I'll tell you what

he should be forced to resign from

Congress Adam Schiff he's a low-life he

should be forced to resign he took a

perfect conversation realized he

couldn't read it to Congress because it

was perfect it was a very nice

conversation I knew many people were on

the phone not only were many people on

the phone we had stenographers on the

phone taking it down word-for-word he

took that conversation which was perfect

he said I can't read this so he made up

a conversation and he reported it and

and said it to Congress and to the

American people and it was horrible what

he said and that was supposed to be

coming from me but it was all fabricated

he should resign from office in disgrace

and frankly they should look at him for

treason because he is making up the

words of the President of the United

States not only words but the meaning

and it's a disgrace it should not be

allowed to happen the whistleblower

wrote not that conversation he wrote a

vicious conversation in other words he

either got it totally wrong made it up

or the person giving the information to

the whistleblower was dishonest and this

country has to find out who that person

was because that person is a spy in my

opinion you ready so when a

whistleblower purposely or not give

something that's totally erroneous now

here's where I fooled him they never

thought I'd release the conversation

they never thought in a million years

that I'd release the conversation when

little Adam shift saw the the text when

he read it he couldn't believe it when

Nancy Pelosi who worked today early

Nancy Pelosi called for essentially

impeachment let's impeach the president

before she saw the transcript and this

is an exact word

word transcript of the conversation

right taken by very talented

stenographers listen to me so when she

saw that she was she I heard she went

crazy she said we can't impeach him of

this conversation that's a great

conversation she went by the

whistleblower and the whistleblower was

so bad I would even think about it but

he and let me tell you something

Biden's son is corrupt and Biden is

corrupt and I'd rather run against Biden

than almost any of those candidates and

I think they're all weak but I think

Biden has never been a smart guy and

he's less smart now than he ever was

thank you very much thank you
