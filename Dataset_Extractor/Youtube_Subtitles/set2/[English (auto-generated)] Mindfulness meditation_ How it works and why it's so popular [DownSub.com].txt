that's my husband he meditates like this

every single day for an entire hour

he started the habit about two years ago

at first I was a bit skeptical but he

insisted meditation changed his life I

quickly found out he wasn't the only one

hooked on the practice billionaires like

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Bill Gates

boast about their meditation routines

athletes use it before games to help

improve their performance even schools

around the world offer mindfulness

classes to students and of course

there's an app for it actually thousands

of them the most popular ones headspace

and calm headspace was developed in 2010

and has over 60 million subscribers it

features animated meditation lessons

voiced by its co-founder Andy Puddicombe

a former Buddhist monk today meditation

training mindfulness based activities

such as mindful walk and then there's

the calm app with over two million

subscribers it became a unicorn in

February 2019

it's valued at a billion dollars I think

the reason that people are turning to

apps is because we're more stressed and

anxious than we've ever been before

right there is so much uncertainty in

the world there's so much stress people

are overworked they're needing to find

peace in their lives so apps are great

in a way that they're so accessible in a

20-18 study by the CDC meditation was

identified as the fastest-growing health

trend among adults in the u.s. in 2012

four point one percent reported using

meditation in 2017 that increased to

fourteen point two percent so what

exactly is mindfulness and what's the

hype I started off by experiencing it

for myself

at Toronto's mindset brain gym so what

you have on your head right now is

called a muse brain sensing headband

it's essentially got EEG sensors right

on the forehead and behind the ears and

we're measuring the brainwave activity

generating just take a nice big deep

breath into the belly and a nice slow

exhale out the mouth whenever you notice

your mind wandering away from the breath

your focus is gone elsewhere just catch

it observe where your mind went and let

the thought go come back to focusing on

the breath this is kind of like a mental

bicep curl or a mental pushup so I was

calm for 45 46 seconds yes of the five

minutes you were focused for 45 seconds

of those and how long were you active

for 22 seconds so you were actually

distracted only half the time you were

really calm and focused okay not a bad

first meditation session and I know what

you're thinking Buddhists and Hindus

have been meditating for centuries in

the East the West is simply playing

catch-up and you're right but while this

is seen as one of the paths to

enlightenment

this type of mindfulness meditation is

entirely secular and has been stripped

of his religious undertones which

basically makes it more marketable to

the masses in the West there are a whole

bunch of different kinds of meditation

but this one particularly trains people

to become aware and to notice their

experience and when I say experience I

really mean thoughts sensations and

emotions that may just pass through the

mind mindfulness meditation helps you to

become aware of all of that activity it

also allows you to approach it in a way

that's not judging it in the last few

years

neuroscientists have taken a serious

look at what is going on up here in the

brain when mindfulness is practiced MRI

is found a physical difference gray

matter was more dense in areas

associated with focus memory emotion and

empathy this practice has been

associated with structural and

functional changes in brain regions that

regulate attention and introspective

awareness mainly in the frontal cortex

and also in a grain region called insula

it has also been associated with changes

in the hippocampus and other brain

regions that are typically associated

with learning and memory as well as

changes in cortical midline structures

which are associated with a sense of

self it's also been shown to help reduce

stress and anxiety by reducing activity

in the default mode network or dmn

that's the part of the brain that

activates when the mind is passively

resting for example when your mind

wanders or your danger email you start

thinking about others ruminating about

yourself remembering the past

envisioning the future anything but

being focused on what's happening right

now this could lead to negative thoughts

and feeling anxious or depressed when

you're meditating all of your focus is

on the sensations you feel throughout

your body while breathing this focused

attention actually helps you control

this inner chatter and turn it down and

builds up the capacity of the

attentional and the executive network to

be up tuned so you're getting a little

bit more intentionality and a little bit

less just being carried away by drifting

states of mind or asking yourself

questions about judging yourself or

evaluating yourself in fact when

researchers compared the brains of

experienced meditators like monks they

found them to have smaller amygdalas

which is connected to the dmn and

activates when we're stressed all this

could eventually translate into how we

interact with people in the real world

someone cuts you off in traffic the next

thing you know you're honking at them

and those are behaviors that are very

typical and very habitual but it may

also be that those kinds of behaviors

also continue to promote states of mind

that are not very helpful so mindfulness

by giving you a window into how you

actually feel or think or sense in the

body gives you just a moment of pause

and a moment of choice in terms of

asking yourself what do I want to do

next because you kind of see what the

options are more clearly meditation is

definitely not a fix-all it's just meant

to be a complimentary health approach

some people may feel that when they

believe all of the hype around

mindfulness that it can actually do

everything for them it can replace you

know getting treatment if you really

need it it can be a kind of magical

solution just like training muscles at

the gym the more you meditate the better

you get at it

and the better control you have over the

thoughts in your brain one thing is for

sure this is no fad mindfulness

meditation is likely here to stay
