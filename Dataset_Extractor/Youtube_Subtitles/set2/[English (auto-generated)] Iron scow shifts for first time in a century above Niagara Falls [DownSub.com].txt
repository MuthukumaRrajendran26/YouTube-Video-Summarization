it was one of the most remarkable

rescues in the history of Niagara Falls

a dredging scow with two men aboard

broke loose from its tugboat in 1918 it

got stuck on rocks barely 600 meters

from the falls but luckily just 200

meters from the big power station they

had to fire a line from the top of the

power plant out to the poor old sky out

there Jim Hill of Niagara Parks says a

u.s. Coast Guard cannon fired the

lifeline

a local hero Red Hill went out over the

water untangled the lines and after 17

hours with pulleys and a harness the two

men were brought to shore this is such a

compelling story that that it involves

bravery and it involves International

Cooperation and it has a happy ending it

was too risky to do anything more with

the scow and so it was left where it's

sat for decades a tourist attraction we

called it the barge when I came here to

look at this 50 years ago when I was a

kid and we wondered at the time how does

it stay in one place well it took

another 50 years for it to finally move

a century of pounding water and rusting

metal and finally gale force winds last

week eventually pushed the iron Hulk off

its rocky perch it moved about 50 meters

that much closer to Niagara Falls Alf

McGrath was taking pictures of it hours

before last week's storm and came back

today to compare I think it's broken up

quite a bit more to his before picture

and after he says it's sad to see it

breaking up before it looked like a boat

now it just looks like a mess now that

the scow is movable its days may be

numbered quite a story from from that

long ago rich Eckert brought his son to

have a look the historic significance

not lost even on a seven-year-old it's

been there for a hundred years it's

really cool that it just moves so anyway

Niagara Parks officials are watching it

more closely now operators of the Maid

of the Mist have been caution and

chances are it will break apart and the

rugged memorial to a heroic rescue will

vanish for good over the falls

but in those constantly churning waters

it has sure lasted longer than anyone

ever thought it would
