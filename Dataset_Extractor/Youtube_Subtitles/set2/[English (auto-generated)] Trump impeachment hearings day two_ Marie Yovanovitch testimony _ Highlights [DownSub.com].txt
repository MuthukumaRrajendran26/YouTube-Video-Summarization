as we sit here testifying the president

is attacking you what Twitter and I'd

like to give you a chance to respond

I'll read

part of one of his tweets everywhere

Marie ivanovitch went turned bad she

started off in Somalia how did that go

he goes on to say later in the tweet is

a US presidents absolute right to

appoint ambassadors well first of all

I've asked you Voinovich the Senate has

a chance to confirm a deny an ambassador

do they not yes I think consent what

would you like to respond to the

president's attack that everywhere you

went turned bad well I I mean I don't I

don't think I have such powers not

Mogadishu Somalia Somalia and not in

other places

I actually think that where I served

over the years I and others have

demonstrably made things better you know

for the US as well as for the countries

that I've served in Ukraine for example

where there are huge challenges

including you know on the issue that

we're discussing today of corruption

huge challenges but they've made a lot

of progress since 2014 including in the

years that I was there and I think in

part I mean the Ukrainian people get the

most the most credit for that but a part

of that credit goes to the work of the

United States and and to me as the

ambassador in in the United in Ukraine

ambassador you've shown the courage to

come forward today and testify

notwithstanding the fact you urged by

the White House or State Department not

to notwithstanding the fact that as you

testified earlier the president

implicitly threatened you in that call

record and now the president real time

is attacking you what effect do you

think that has on other witnesses will

this to come forward and expose

wrongdoing well it's very intimidating

said I'm designed to intimidate is it

not I mean I can't speak to what the

president is trying to do but I think

the effect is to be well I know mr.

phonic you had a few quick questions for

the Ambassador yield to you mr. phonic

Thank You mr. Nunez ambassador Jovanovic

thank you for being here today

the gentlewoman was suspended what is

the interruption for this time it is our

time the gentleman will suspend you're

not recognized mr. Nunez you were my

hustle I just recognized under the house

resident 660 you're not allowed to yield

time except him the nordica the ranking

member yielded time to another member of

Congress it's not accurate you're

gagging ambassador Jovanovic I want to

thank you for a woman will suspend

we're not recognized this is the fifth

time you have interrupted members a

woman will suspend mr. chair we we

control the time and customary of this

committee that whoever controls the time

can yield to whoever they wish if we

have members of Congress that have a few

questions seems appropriate that we'd be

able to let mr. phonic ask her questions

as soon as you or minority council

recognized frankly you're the best of

this nation and I cannot think of

anybody else I would

rather have representing us in a foreign

capital than you my colleagues have gone

to a great deal of effort to better

understand the facts surrounding your

removal I think the facts are pretty

clear there was a smear campaign and it

was orchestrated by a corrupt Ukrainian

prosecutor the president's attorney the

president's son and even some of the

president's allies his favorite TV

station so that campaign led to your

removal despite 33 years of outstanding

service progressive responsibilities and

awards and so I kind of sit here with a

mix of emotions on the one hand there's

some pride and gratitude for all your

outstanding service and on the other

hand I'm angry like my friend from

Connecticut in fact I'm very angry about

how it is the most powerful person on

the face of the earth would remove you

from office after your stellar service

and somehow feel compelled to

characterize you as bad news and then to

ominously threaten that you're going to

go through some things so I am an

inquiry but I'm not surprised after all

as was suggested earlier he said the

whistleblower may have committed treason

a crime punishable by death even though

the whistleblower strictly adhered to

the letter of the law as independently

attested to by both the Trump appointed

inspector general and the Acting DNI

after all he even demeaned the memory of

Senator McCain McCain after he lied at

his grave at the Naval Academy grounds

despite a lifetime of public service and

serving six years as a prisoner of war

in a tiny cell in Hanoi being beaten and

tortured every day and after all he

belittled the Goldstar Khan family whose

son captain Khan gave his last full

measure of devotion out of love for this

country and let me tell you as somebody

whose older brother never saw his 35th

birthday because of service in the VA

nom War those words are deeply offensive

words matter and the words leveled

against you constitute bullying of the

worst order your good character your

outstanding reputation have been

besmirched in a way that is devoid of

common decency but here's my message to

you there is nothing ambassador

Ivanovich nothing he can say or do not a

thing that will in any way diminish the

nature and quality of the service you

have rendered to our great nation not a

thing and there is not a thing he can

say or do that will diminish our

gratitude to you for that service and I

thank you again for it thank you so as

to the larger point I I would like you

to answer what does this mean to Ukraine

when the United States actually engages

in the kind of behavior that we are

attempting to discourage them from

engaging in namely a politically

motivated prosecution what does that

mean to our relation what does that mean

to them in their struggling efforts to

become a robust democracy what's the

impact in Ukraine for this behavior

I think Ukraine like many countries

looks to us for the power of our example

and I think that when we engage in

questionable activities that that raises

a question and it it emboldened those

who are corrupt who don't want to see

Ukraine become you know a democracy a

free-market economy a part of Europe but

want Ukraine to stay in you know under

Russia's thrall and that's not in our

national security interests Thank You

ambassador you wanted

thank you so very much welcome as I said

last a couple days ago to the witnesses

welcome to year four of the impeachment

proceedings I'm sorry that you've gotten

drugged into this for three years we've

heard these outrageous and frankly

unbelievable accusations regarding

Russian collusions accusations that we

now are know are absolute nonsense there

was no basis at all despite promises

from some members of this committee that

they had secret proof that would prove

this collusion and grand we know that it

was nonsense but now in year four we

apparently move on to Ukraine and quid

pro quo culminating yesterday when the

speaker announced that the president

would indeed be impeached and removed

for office for bribery and with that

statement I would now feel compelled to

ask you madam ambassador as you see it

here before us very simply and directly

do you have any information regarding

the president in it√≠d States accepting

any bribes no do you have any

information regarding any criminal

activity that the President of the

United States has been involved with at

all yeah thank you thank you for

answering that directly the American

people know this is nonsense the

American people know this is unfair and

I have a prediction regarding this I

think that public support for

impeachment is actually going to be less

when these hearings are over than it is

when the hearings began because finally

the American people are going to be able

to see the evidence and they're going to

be able to make their own determination

regarding that now I want to ask you one

thing very quickly and you can ask us

again and again but my question is

slightly different you've been asked as

you recognize that the president any

president has the ability to ask his

ambassadors to serve at will I'm curious

do you think that's the right policy

yeah I probably think it is I I do as

well

it may be imperfect there may be times

when it's not used perfectly but I agree

with you it is the right policy I don't

think that we should change

now I'd like to read from some previous

statements including one of your own as

well as others regarding the

appropriateness of investigating

corruption in the UK from Miss Fiona

Hill so again the fact that there are

investigations into corruption in the

energy sector in Ukraine as well as

Russia and many other countries is not a

surprise from yourself your previous

testimony question was it the general

understanding that verismo was a company

that suffered from allegations of

corruption your answer was yes from

ambassador Sandland I am I just am

generally aware that brisbin's

considered a potentially corrupt company

would you agree then that it's

appropriate to investigate corruption

I think it's appropriate if it's if it's

part of our national strategy what I

would say is that we have a process for

doing that it's called the mutual legal

assistance treaty we have one with

Ukraine and generally it goes from from

our Department of Justice to the

Ministry of Justice in the country of

interests okay and that's the usual

pattern I appreciate that regardless of

the process so it's appropriate for us

to investigate potential corruption

especially look we're about to give

these some of these countries hundreds

of millions of dollars that the US

taxpayer said here's a dollar of line go

ahead and give it to this other country

but please only do it if you know it's

not going to be used for crop purposes

or against our national interest and and

I'll conclude with this because I

promised my friend mr. Jordan I would

save him a little bit of time we

mentioned earlier that the vice

president when he was went to the

Ukraine and called for the specific

firing of a specific prosecutor that he

was as they say completing official US

policy but the interesting thing is this

the Vice President had exactly two

countries that were his responsibility

that time China and the Ukraine and he

has bragged and been very proud of his

influence in the previous administration

he says again and again that the Obama

administration listened to him so it

doesn't surprise

me that they would be fulfilling a

policy that this vice-president

certainly helped to formulate today

we've seen you as this former ambassador

of this 33 year veteran of the Foreign

Service but I want to know about you

personally and how this has affected you

personally and your family yeah it's

been a difficult time I mean I I'm a

private person I don't want to put all

that out there but it's been a very very

difficult time because the President

does have the right to have his own or

her own ambassador in every country in

the world but does the president have

the right to actually malign people's

character I mean I may not be against

any law but I would think that it would

be against decorum and decency I mean

there's a question as to why the kind of

campaign to get me out of Ukraine

happened because all the president has

to do is say he wants a different

ambassador and in my line of work

perhaps in your line of work as well all

we have is our reputation and so this

has been a very painful period I'd ask

him Sparta but I love to repeat the

question Thank You mr. chairman I'm

asking might you might maybe we can kind

of see why the president was a little

concerned when you have the highest

ranking officials in the government the

Ambassador criticizing him Parliament to

remember Yashica Lysenko criticizing him

when you have avakov the guy who first

told you about Giuliani criticizing all

this going on and when you couple that

with the concerns he has about

corruption the concerns he has about

Europe not doing enough the concerns he

has about reluctance is sending the

hard-earned tax dollars to any country

to I have indulged you with extra time

but I appreciate indulgence is wearing

out I appreciate it there is a question

hard our adult is more out with you a

long time ago mr. Djamel I had to tell

you that I'm about to gavel you down so

if you have a question I suggest you you

I'm asking her is do you think there's

maybe a reason that this was that the

president Trump's concern was justified

you know I can't speak for the President

on this but what I would

say is you've listed a number of actions

I think from my point of view that

doesn't that doesn't create a Ukrainian

government strategy to interfere in our

election didn't say that mr. jordan he's

allowing the bastard answer the question

so I would just say that you know US

politicians will often criticize

policies of foreign foreign counterparts

even perhaps during their elections you

know this this happens in politics and I

think that it it doesn't necessarily

constitute interference would you ever

write an op-ed or near time with a

presidential candidate in Ukraine Jordan

your time has expired mr. Welch you're

recognized thank you

I will just emphasize once again about

the importance of your testimony mr.

Kent and ambassador Taylor gave us the

broad outlines of this story this is a

story about an effort to coerce

condition or bribe a foreign country

into doing the dirty work of the

president investigations of his

political rival by conditioning US

taxpayer money by conditioning a meeting

that President Solinsky desperately

wanted and needed to establish that

relationship with the most powerful

patron of Ukraine the United States of

America the fact that they failed in

this solicitation of bribery doesn't

make it any less bribery doesn't make it

any less immoral or corrupt it just

means it was unsuccessful and to that we

owe other dedicated public servants who

blew the whistle had they not blown the

whistle we wouldn't be here and I think

it is appalling that my colleagues

continue to want to out this

whistleblower so that he or she can be

punished by this president

but let's underscore once again while

you are the beginning of this story

you're not the end of it but nonetheless

the beginning is important

because the beginning of the story is an

effort to get you out of the way an

effort by Rudy Guiliani and crewmen and

Parnas and corrupt Ukrainians like Lutz

n KO to get you out of the way because

they felt you were an impediment to

these political investigations the

president so desperately wanted Giuliani

has made it abundantly clear he was in

Ukraine on a mission for his client for

the President to investigate the Biden's

and you were viewed as an obstacle that

had to go not just by Giuliani but by

the President of the United States and

if people had any doubt about it they

should do what the president asks read

the transcript and what they'll see in

that transcript is the president praises

the corrupt he praises the corrupt Lutz

Enco he condemns the just you and then

he asks for an investigation of the

Biden's there is no camouflaging that

corrupt intent we are adjourned

let's pick our speaker condition

chairman you disparage these disparage

those members on this side of the aisle

we should have a chance to respond to

your disparaging remarks mr. Chairman I

demand her seat mr. chairman mr.

chairman mr. chip

[Applause]
