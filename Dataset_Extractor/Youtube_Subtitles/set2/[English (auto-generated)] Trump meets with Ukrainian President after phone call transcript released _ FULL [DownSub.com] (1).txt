he's got a great reputation he's very

very strongly looking at all sorts of

corruption and some of the problems

they've had over the years I think it's

one of the primary reasons I think like

to stay in the meeting but we have lots

of witnesses if you'd like to have it

but the country of our country is doing

phenomenally well we are we have the

best economy we've ever had we have the

best employment numbers that we've ever

had and we have now almost a hundred and

sixty million people working which is

more than we've ever had so we're doing

very well in every respect it I have a

feeling that your country is gonna do

fantastically well and whatever we can

do thank you very much

thank you very much it's a great

pleasure to me to be here

and it's better to be on TV than back

home yeah thank you very much and I'm

not the first time so they say in New

York but I know that you never been in

Ukraine and your predecessor also how to

say it I mean didn't find time

so I didn't give me a war that you will

come to our great country well I'm gonna

try I know a lot of people like you I

will say this I know a lot of people

from Ukraine they great people and I

owned something called the Miss Universe

pageants years ago and sold it to IMG

and when I ran for president I thought

maybe it wouldn't be the greatest thing

on the Miss Universe and Miss USA

pageant but it's a great thing and we

had a winner from Ukraine and we've

really had we get to know the country

very well in a lot of different ways but

it's a country I think with tremendous

potential yes I know it because I'm from

this country and I am one to thank you

for invitation to Washington you invited

me but I think I'm sorry I'm sorry but

but I think you forgot to tell me the

date but I think they know before us and

I want to thank you - thank you

specially mr. president - USA - your

government like I said that I know many

many people many faces like the second

family after we know each other

thank you for your support especially

now when you know when we have to really

to worse in Ukraine the first one is

with corruption

nobody will fight no will be winner in

this fight I'm sure and the priority

micro your key to stop the work on the

bus and to get back our territories

Crimea and bus bogans

thank you for your support in this case

thank you very much

if you remember you lost premier during

a different administration that during

the Trump administration yeah so you

have chance with help us that's right

administration they give us Crimea and I

don't think it was something that you

should have but that was done a long

time ago and I think was nailing poorly

but it's just one of those things one of

the elements that we discussed is the

United States helps Ukraine but I think

that other countries should help Ukraine

much more than they're doing you Germany

France the European Union nations they

really should help you a lot more and I

think maybe together we'll work on that

they have to feel a little bit guilty

about it because they don't do what they

should be doing you're very important to

the European Union you're very important

strategically very important and I think

they should spend a lot more in helping

Ukraine and they know that also and they

actually tell me that but they don't

seem to produce so I'm sure you'll talk

to them and I'll certainly be talking to

them thank you very much mr. president

ah you know now we need I want to tell

you that we now load the new country and

I'm sorry but we don't need help we need

support real support and we think thanks

everybody I think all of the European

countries do share pass but we also want

to have more more but I understand only

together America and EU only together we

can stop the war and you know we are

ready we just want to tell that we are

remember that we're the biggest country

in Europe but we want to be the richest

one its roots is in my heart

well you know you have great people in

Ukraine and you have very talented

people our sense of manufacturing in

terms of some of the things

do and we'll be doing we're doing

trading already but we should be doing a

lot more trading with Ukraine but you

have very talented people they make

great things at the top of the line

really so that's very important the

other thing cuz I heard you actually

have over the last fairly short pretty

time you've really made some progress

with Russia I hear a lot of progress has

been made and just keep it going be nice

to end that whole disaster

whoa to know that now we have the new

team the new Parliament the new

government so now we voted about 74 laws

new laws which help for our new reforms

land reform big validation that they

know about concessions that we reload

the general per security and we launched

the service secretary is resolution an

anti-corruption court as we came we did

I will launch the anti-corruption court

it it began to work on the fifth of

September and it was you know it was

after five days we had the new value so

we are ready we want to show that we we

just just come and if somebody if you we

want to help us so just let's do

business cases we have many investment

cases we ready and stop corruption in

Ukraine because that will really make

you great that will make you great

personally and it will also be so

tremendously a nation in terms of what

you want to do and where you want to

take it thank you very much

thank you very much I think you ran

everything so I think you read text I am

sorry but I don't want to be involved to

democratic often elections elections of

USA no you heard that we had I think

good phone call it was normal we spoke

about many things and I so I think and

you read it that nobody push it by the

way

you know there was no pressure and you

have to do is see it what went on with

us all but you know that but you could

ask the question and I appreciate the

answer but whatever he can do in terms

of corruption because the corruptions

massive now when Biden's son walks away

with millions of dollars from Ukraine

and he knows nothing and they're paying

a millions of dollars that's corruption

when Biden son walks out of China with

1.5 billion dollars in a fund and the

biggest funds in the world can't get

money out of China and he's there for

one quick meeting that he flies in on

Air Force two I think that's a horrible

thing I think it's a horrible thing but

I'm going far beyond that I know the

president and I've read a lot about

Ukraine I've had a lot of

country's he wants to stop corruption he

was elected I think number one on the

basis of stopping corruption which

unfortunately has played Ukraine and if

you could do that he's doing really the

whole world a big favor

I know and I think he's going to be

successful mr. president on Rudy

Giuliani why do you think it's

appropriate for your personal attorney

to get involved in government business

well you'd have to ask Rudy I imagine if

I wasn't near this that Rudy's looking

to also find out where the phony which

on started how it started he had a

Russian which up that turned out to be

two and a half years of phony and

nonsense and Rudy Giuliani's a great

lawyer he was a great man he's highly

respected

I've watched the passion that he's had

on television over the last few days I

think it's incredible the way he's done

what he's out as he wants to find out

where did this Russian witch-hunt that

you people really helped perpetrate

where did it start how come it started

it was all who nonsense it was a hoax

it was a total hoax it was the media

hoax and a Democrat hoax when his son

and Rudy's got every right to go and

find out where that started and other

people are looking at that to where did

it start the enablers where did it all

come from

it was out of thin air and I think he's

got a very strong right to do it he's a

good lawyer he knows exactly what he's

doing and it's very important if you

believe that there's emails employed

when do you believe that there in

Ukraine do you think this whole thing I

think you mean the 30,000 that she

deleted yes

yeah I think they could very well for

that was a nice question I like that

question because frankly I think that

one of the great crimes committed is

Hillary Clinton deleting 33

females after Congress Center and

subpoena think of that you can't even do

that in a civil case you can't get rid

of evidence like that she deleted 33,000

emails after not before after receiving

the subpoena from the US Congress I mean

I've never heard that she's done far

worse than that although I don't know

how much worse it can be but there were

many other things she did that were

wrong but that's so obvious she gets a

subpoena from the United States Congress

and she deletes him and then she said as

I remember that oh well they had to do

with the wedding and yoga she does a lot

of yoga right so they had 33,000 emails

about the wedding of her daughter and

yoga I don't think so

how she got away with that one is just

but it's one of many and it's corrupt

government because we have corruption

also mr. president we have a lot of

corruption in our government and when

you see what happened with Hillary

Clinton when you see what happened with

Comey in the cave and all of these

people we have a lot of things going on

here to hopefully it's going to be found

that very soon but I think that a lot of

progress has been made a lot of progress

has been

[Music]

well we're working with Ukraine and we

want other countries to work with

Ukraine when I say work I'm referring to

money they should put up more money we

put up a lot of money I gave you

anti-tank Buster's that frankly

President Obama was sending you pillows

and sheets and I gave you anti-tank

Buster's and a lot of people didn't want

to do that but I did it and I really

hope that Russia because I really

believe that President Putin would like

to do something I really hope that you

and President Putin get together and can

solve your problem that would be a

tremendous achievement and I know you're

trying to do that I think that somebody

if you look at what he did it so bad

where his son he goes to China walks

away with a billion and a half dollars

he goes to Ukraine and he walks away

with $50,000 a month and a lot of money

in addition to that and the whole thing

with the prosecutor Ukraine and he's on

table this is it like maybe he did it

maybe he did

he's on tape doing this I saw this a

while ago I looked at it I said that's

incredible I've never seen anything like

that now either he's dumb or I thought

he was in a room full of really good

friends or maybe it's a combination of

both in this case thank you very much

don't cry I mean that we have

independent country and independent

general security I can't push anyone you

know that's it that's the question that

is the answer so I didn't call somebody

or the new general security I didn't ask

him I didn't push him that

sorry I wanted for him the body has been

stored obligated to do what Russell

Damiani community-owned winner of zeroes

well we have many more issues to care

about and to tackle

we have ill advised we have Milan we

have corruption cases as president from

what to do and we know where to go what

to tackle

Chalabi waffles snap Frankie did you ask

how Speaker Nancy Pelosi to find a way

out in the future yesterday she's lost

her way she's been taken over by the

radicals left she may be let radical

laugh at herself but she really has lost

her way I spoke to her about guns

yesterday she didn't even know I was

talking about she's not interested in

guys I'll tell you what Nancy Pelosi is

not interested in guns in gun protection

and gun safety all she's thinking about

is this she's been taken over by the

radical left the whole Democrat Party

and you take a look at what's happening

in the media today the whole party is

taken over by the left and thank you

very much my poll numbers have gone up

but I don't want it to go up for this

reason when they look and when you see

what's happening people are really angry

as Democrats they're really angry at the

Democrat Party and things like as an

example drug pricing getting drugs down

things like gun safety infrastructure

the Democrats can't talk about that

because they've been taken over by a

radical group of people and Nancy Pelosi

as far as I'm concerned unfortunately

she's no longer the Speaker of the House

thank you very much everybody
