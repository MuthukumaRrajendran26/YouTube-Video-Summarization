well earlier this morning we learned

more about the new products coming to

pot shops in Ontario the Ontario

cannabis store which supplies products

to the provinces retailers and customers

online says these new products will be

available as of Monday mark our Castle

is live with more on the new edible

releases mark a lot of people have been

looking forward to this yeah that's

right Travis and they will have 59 new

products in those licensed retailers as

you mentioned as of next Monday January

6 you could see the new vape pens behind

me that is just some of the product that

will be available on Monday let's bring

in David Lobo now he's the vice

president of corporate affairs and

social responsibility for the Ontario

cannabis store

David thanks for doing this absolutely

walk us through some of the new product

you've got out on display here today so

to start next week we're gonna have a

bunch of different categories we'll have

a several products in the soft jus

category we're gonna have one product in

terms of mints one product in terms of

cookies and then several products as it

relates to chocolate we're also going to

have our first beverage product which

will be an infused tea bag alongside all

the vapor products you mentioned and

obviously further expansion from from

here on out this is just sort of the the

first footprint if you will absolutely

so we're working really closely with our

licensed producer partners they're

working around the clock there's going

to be many many more products that come

to the market between January February

March and so a week over week we expect

a lot more products to come out we know

supply is gonna be a bit limited in the

early days but but producers are really

working hard to get more out we

mentioned that limited supply Anna and I

wanted to talk to you about that because

much of the knock on the OCS through the

first year has been limited supply high

prices if you're trying to fight the

black market those are things that make

that hard to do in this next go-around

how do you plan to fix some of those

some of those issues yeah so there's

going to be a number of different

approaches we take we've got competitive

price points to start we're gonna have

to look at how consumers react to those

price points work with our producer

partners to adjust them if they're not

effective and then new products there's

going to be a ton of innovation we have

to understand consumers interest and

bring products out to them quickly David

thank you so much for doing this

appreciate it good luck to you guys so

there you have a new products 59 of them

all different categories will be

available

Monday we'll have a full recap later on

tonight on Global News at 5:30 and our

website global news dot CA / Toronto

back to Marcus all for us live thanks
