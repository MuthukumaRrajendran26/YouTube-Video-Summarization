divorcees laughing outside their

lawyer's office the relief is clearly

visible Thank You Jean Croton Kai papers

particular tribute to you it's already a

victory of sorts for Boris Johnson

getting Europe to renegotiate Teresa

Mays old deal something the EU had said

it would never do it is testament to our

commitment to funding solutions he

provides certainty we're blessed creates

uncertainty the changes are mostly about

replacing the controversial sticking

point of the backstop a clause to keep

Northern Ireland's border with the

Republic of Ireland open after brexit

the New Deal means a customs border will

legally exist between Northern Ireland

and the Republic of Ireland but

practically speaking tariffs will

instead be applied on goods moving

between the entire island of Ireland and

Great Britain it's been long it's been

painful it's being divisive and now is

the moment for us as a country to come

together now is the moment for our

parliamentarians to come together and

get this thing done MPs will now vote on

the deal at a special common session the

first on a Saturday since the Falklands

War of 1982 as it stands we can't

support this deal and will oppose it in

Parliament on Saturday the UK's main

opposition party will instead angle for

a second referendum the pro-british

democratic unionists from Northern

Ireland say Johnson's deal drives a

wedge between them and the rest of the

UK in order to avoid trying to get an

extension he has been too eager by far

to get a deal at any cost

the voting math will be tight and if

Johnston's deal is voted down here on

Saturday he will be legally obligated by

the opposition to go and ask for another

extension to brexit he says he won't

meaning a No Deal crash out brexit on

Halloween is still a real possibility
