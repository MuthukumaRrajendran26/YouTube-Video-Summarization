hours before his scheduled deposition

the US ambassador to the EU

Gordon Sunland was blocked from speaking

to Congress by President Trump and the

US State Department by preventing us

from hearing from this witness and

and Secretary of State are taking

actions that prevent us from getting the

facts needed to protect the nation's

security Sandland was a trump mega donor

before his appointment to ambassador now

whether the president abused his powers

by demanding Ukraine open an

investigation into his political rival

Joe Biden a key focus for Democrats text

messages between Sandland and William

Taylor the top diplomat in Ukraine in

oneexchange Taylor wrote I think it's

crazy to withhold security assistance

for help with a political campaign after

that Saund hland reportedly called Trump

and five hours later samplin wrote back

the president has been crystal clear no

quid pro quos of any kind there are more

text messages that the inquiry has yet

to see ultimately when the truth comes

out you will see that this president did

not hold aid to try to influence a

foreign country to do anything the

stonewalling comes as polls show a

decided shift in support for impeachment

among Americans 58% support the

impeachment inquiry 49% now support

removing Trump from office the White

House has already been warned that any

attempt to delay or interfere with the

impeachment inquiry will be considered

an act of obstruction and that in itself

could eventually become an article of

impeachment used against President Trump
