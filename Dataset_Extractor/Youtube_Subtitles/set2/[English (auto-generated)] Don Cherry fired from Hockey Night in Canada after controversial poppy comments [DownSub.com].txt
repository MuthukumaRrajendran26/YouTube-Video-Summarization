you people love you you they come here

whatever it is you love our way of life

you love our milk and honey at least you

could pay a couple of bucks for poppies

or something like that but I wanted to

address what happened last night on

Hockey Night in Canada

John Kerry made remarks which were

hurtful discriminatory which were

flat-out wrong

we at Sports Net have apologized it

certainly doesn't stand for what Sports

Net or Rodgers represents we know

diversity as the strength of the country

we see it in the travels with our show

and with Aki night in Canada so I owe

you an apology too that's the big thing

that I want to emphasize i sat there I

did not catch it did not respond

[Music]

you
