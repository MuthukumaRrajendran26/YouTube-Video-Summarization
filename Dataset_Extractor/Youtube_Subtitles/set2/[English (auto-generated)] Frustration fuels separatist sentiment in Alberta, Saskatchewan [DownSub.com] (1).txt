a well-attended wex it rally this past

weekend in Edmonton promoting separatism

on the prairies the backlash to the

election on the prairies seems to have

been heard across the country where a

new government with a 33% mandate as

most Canadians believe in Canada is more

divided than ever they see a party

elected government with less than a

third of the vote they see an electoral

map that's divided east/west urban rural

they see the rise of the bloc québécois

it's hard not to conclude that it's a

country that's divided the divide we saw

on election night with the Conservatives

sweep in blue across the prairies is

reflected in new data from epsilen ad

ins were asked would my province be

better off if it's separated from Canada

now this is just days after the election

but the number better off separated is

up to one third in Alberta eight points

more than a year ago and 27% in

Saskatchewan up nine from last year now

the number is only 13% in BC and

dropping and in Manitoba they've never

been much inclined to separate so it is

focused on the two central western

provinces here now in the rest of the

country only Quebec has significant

separatist sentiments the prairies in

Quebec are interesting because they have

similar numbers but the intensity is

going in the opposite direction does the

election outcome for example make you

feel angry well Quebec is the least

angry province in the country only 18

percent agree the election made them

feel angry in Alberta and Saskatchewan

at least 50 percent feel somewhat angry

that it is whose temperament to be

amenable the separatist beak hew leader

made it clear he can work with this

Parliament remarkably different from the

past but Prairie apprehension is rising

we have a more divided country it's

driven in part by concerns the Western

oil economy will be allowed to wither by

the rest of the country these are

historic numbers in terms of level of

anger and Alberta and Saskatchewan they

are rising numbers in terms of mood

toward separation and the challenge for

the new Trudeau government will be

addressing Prairie anxiety without a

single Liberal MP from either Alberta or

Saskatchewan Eric Sorenson global
