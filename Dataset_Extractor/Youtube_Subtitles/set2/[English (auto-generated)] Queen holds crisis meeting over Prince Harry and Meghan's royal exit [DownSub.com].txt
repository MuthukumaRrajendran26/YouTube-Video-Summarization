Prince Harry and Megan dropped a royal

bombshell last week the couple took to

social media to announce their stepping

back from senior royal duties the palace

wasn't impressed in the Queen called an

emergency crisis meeting to figure out

next steps

globals Redman Shannon joins us from

outside Buckingham Palace with the very

latest on this and Redman Prince Harry

along with his dad and brother were

summoned to this meeting with the Queen

any word and what's in store for them

well I think a lot of things will be on

the table Travis after that bombshell

announcement last week that really

blindsided Buckingham Palace here they

had no idea this was coming I remember

Travis just last week when it came out

about an hour or two later getting that

email press release alert from

Buckingham Palace very terse one

sentence email saying this will take

time to sort out and this is the start

of that process for the first time

Prince Harry

sitting down face to face with his

grandmother the Queen along with his

brother Prince William and his father

Prince Charles of course in Sandringham

to talk about how this will all work

reportedly to Megan the Duchess of

Sussex will be on the line as we believe

from Canada on the line on the phone

line as part of this conversation so

what they're going to be sorting out is

whether or not they keep their royal

titles what obligations they will have

toward their charitable causes toward

their royal duties what they will have

to do what they might not have to do

security is going to be a big thing

reportedly it's at least a million

dollars a year to protect the Duke and

Duchess of Sussex if they move to Canada

how much more will that cost the British

taxpayer will it cost the Canadian

taxpayer these are things we're not

quite sure about yet all these things

are on the table there's a lot to iron

out but obviously this was something

that was coming we heard from Prince

Harry a number of months ago saying that

he and his brother were on different

paths we heard the that Megan told the

journalists that it was being difficult

that first year and a half as a duchess

so this is surprising to many but

perhaps there was a clue that this was

coming

so Redmond what is the reaction being on

the ground where you are right now in

the United Kingdom to this unfolding

drama it seems like there was a twist

every day

yeah well I think it's very mixed Travis

I think it's some ways it's generational

you know this young couple reflective of

modern Britain an international couple

megan is mixed-race it's something that

is reflective of a younger generation

here and I think a lot of people of a

younger generation here seem to have

sympathy with them and the the things

that they're going through

but some people are perhaps a little

more clinging on to the tradition of the

royal family take a listen to what some

people on the streets of London had to

say I think it's a bit rich really

they've got married being senior Royals

and now all of a sudden it's been paid

for it's done and now sudden they don't

want to be seen you anymore he's he's a

royal and that's it as he can't get away

from that well you know there are young

couples she should have known what she

was getting into if to start off with

but if you want to be out the limelight

something's the best way to do it so

there would be difficult conversations

had in Sandringham today we don't know

if there will any be any results from

this meeting today but over the next

days and weeks we may have a result of

what happens back to you Travis alright

Redmond Shannon thank you
