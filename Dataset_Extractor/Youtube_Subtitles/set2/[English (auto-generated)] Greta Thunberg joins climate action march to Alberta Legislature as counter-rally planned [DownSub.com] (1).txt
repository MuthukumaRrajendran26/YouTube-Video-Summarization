[Applause]

[Applause]

lots of work done in in indigenous

communities over the years and we have

been and we have we believe it's

important that we use this as an

opportunity to propel indigenous voices

and issues to the front of public

narratives throughout our rally we would

like to highlight just a few of the

incredible projects that our people have

led a project in green energy we would

like to we would like to make people

aware of a sacred earth solar

[Applause]

in 2015 sacred earth solar launched the

pizza pan solar project 20.8 Cade

kilowatt renewable energy installation

in little Buffalo that powers the

community wealth health center the 80

panels solar project has created more

green jobs and reduced the community the

community's resilience on fossil fuels

[Applause]

next we would like to invite Luke Nelson

from Edmonton Youth for climate up to

duel and acknowledgement hello everyone

and welcome my name as you just heard is

Luke Nelson and I have a climate

organizer with Evan Jennifer climate and

I am also a sentient as a settler that

is live in Edmonton my entire life it

can be hard to fully understand that I'm

currently living working and going to

school on stolen land grasping the

realities of colonialism and the lasting

impact that it has on all of Canada is

it difficult and often an uncomfortable

process to undertake what is awesome

I have been involved in organizing the

strikes and evidence it's the first one

in March when I first started when I

first started to participate in climate

organizing I had an abstract

understanding of colonialism one that

could be gained from books but I haven't

begun to start questioning how my

privilege affected me and those around

me as a white cisgender heterosexual

male I have a lot of privilege in our

society and maybe many people living

within the borders of Canada don't have

the same experience as I do when living

in our society accepting the realities

and underlying systemic racism in Canada

is not a simple process and I'm

certainly not finished understanding it

but as someone who is directly benefited

from colonial violence I now know that

it is important to start questioning why

Canadian society is the way that it is

[Applause]

and thus before we begin the rest of

today's proceedings it is vital to give

a land acknowledgment this type of

acknowledgement is certainly not in any

way an ultimate solution to the problems

created by colonialism but it is also an

important step to help grasp that as a

settler I am living on land that is

never rightfully been mine we

acknowledge that we acknowledge that the

land we are standing on is 3d6 territory

3d6 is the traditional home of the Cree

sotto Den a Blackfoot matey and nakata

suit particular the area now known as

Edmonton is in the ancestral home of the

published a spree

[Applause]

some people may be surprised to hear

what a strong emphasis would give to

indigenous rights at a climate protest

however Loney ilysm is fundamentally

connected to the chronic climate crisis

it is vital that the indigenous peoples

who are protected their land for

centuries have their voices heard the

genocide of indigenous peoples in Canada

may seem like ancient history but the

continued oppression and their struggle

against oppression are very much ongoing

when we strive for a solution to the

climate crisis in Canada we must also

simultaneously address the need for

decolonization and repatriation Thank

You Luke

before I say anything I wanted to start

off by sharing a quote from a fellow

indigenous and defender from Coast

Salish territory - hiya Blane quote

Montreal climate strike was one of the

most racist protests I have ever been in

was intentionally pushed received

non-stop racial remarks like it's not

just your land and had to fight for

space the entire time this is what

happens when you whitewash climate

change unquote indigenous peoples are

always overlooked in this movement we

want to thank Greta for standing with us

in solidarity and lifting up

this is our land for those who believe

it's not just indigenous people's land

I'd like my guys for you guys to keep in

mind that indigenous peoples have been

here on Turtle Island for time

immemorial and our knowledge has come

from teachings that my elders have

passed down so I ask you to please

respect and honor that we share this

land but that's because indigenous

peoples were kind enough to let

Europeans settle here our ancestors

didn't make agreements so that we would

be pushed to the side or have to fight

for a chance to speak out to be

activists many of us are standing up to

protect the lives of our family and

loved ones

[Applause]

my system I come from a family of very

powerful women land and water defenders

[Applause]

our net Blackheart for our community

bringing power and running water to our

reservation my family experienced the

effects of climate change firsthand I

actually started speaking out about it

from a young age growing up in my

community my elders talked about water

that flowed clear water that we could

drink without having to boil it I also

grew up eating wild meat my grandparents

talked about the population of the Bison

which is one of the most threatened

animals in Canada and the woodland

caribou that that is on the course of

extinction

now our grandparents warned us to always

check our meat before you eat it because

some animals have diseases such as

chronic wasting disease it surprised me

when I first heard that indigenous

peoples went from drinking clean water

from streams and hunting healthy animals

for food to having to boil water to

drink and discard animals because it's a

risk to our health

[Applause]

whenever I traveled home I loved looking

outside or I loved looking outside

because of how amazing the scenery is

even when the Sun sets I can't help but

stop and look to the sky the world has

so much more to offer than resources and

it's beautiful

I just don't understand how people can

take it for granted

when I travel I noticed the beauty

mother earth holes and I started NASA's

trauma to more beautiful this earth used

to be much more settlers came up north

and stopped to see the Alexander falls

in the Northwest Territories you could

walk right out to the to where the water

was flowing because of how low it was my

enact told me the water used to rise in

the summer when the snow melted and how

the water was clear and you can see the

freshwater fish it's starting to me that

I can only imagine what my elders got to

see and experience our communities are

at the forefront of the climate justice

movement here on Turtle Island our homes

are constantly being deforested

exploited and extracted for money

the Canadian state says we have the most

ethical oil but indigenous peoples would

disagree because we're the ones that use

the land and see industry spilling into

our backyards

[Applause]

most Canadians don't see like this but

we or what the government knows that the

violence against the land is violence

against our people our water

not only do indigenous communities feel

the worst impacts of climate change and

the waste leftover by industry but we

have also led the resistance there there

have been lots of work done in

indigenous communities over the years

and throughout this program we would

like to highlight this work hi hi HB

schmutzie Chowk

I did not come here to play nor is this

for show seeing the negative impacts

industries have made on my community was

a big motivator for me to speak out

about the content issues that indigenous

people face indigenous communities in

Alberta are constantly fighting for

these things that are human rights these

industries around our homes are forcing

us to rely less on those food sources

our sacred medicines that we once were

able to pick for our ceremony and prayer

are now slowly disappearing I was

reading an article where it said that

any would have been bringing warnings

about global warming to the

international community as far back as

the first Earth Summit in 1992 that

proves that indigenous people have been

talking about this issue but we are

continuously ignored as indigenous

people we know firsthand that our people

have been impacted for many years by

climate change and to do this people

need to be more a part of these things

that are said about climate change we

need to be able to sit at the table and

help

leaders to be better as they need us

[Applause]

lives rights and territories of

indigenous people are under attack and

it's not an exaggeration to say that

there is a genocide being committed on

indigenous peoples right now our culture

is being ripped away from us due to this

issue we are unable to do the things we

once did and our elders are unable to

pass down the traditional teachings this

is more than just an issue it is a

crisis I refuse to give it what I've

been taught I will continue to fight

with the strength and push from everyone

I know my voice and other indigenous

peoples voices can and will be heard we

fight for our mother earth

because the fight for mother earth is

the mother of bullfights we are fighting

for your lives our lives and our sacred

territory but we are being detained

threatened murdered only for protecting

our own territories drop of indigenous

blood spilled

many people say indigenous people are

greedy but how is that true when we

think more than we need we think of more

than just ourselves we are fighting for

this cause is not only for our benefit

but for the benefit of every single one

of you here land and everything that is

living on it we see things differently

and choose to act differently in

indigenous tribes the chief or leader

was the backbone of the whole tribe he

or she was a strong person strong wise

person their job was to simply lead and

direct the people they were not chosen

because of their wealth they were not

chosen because of their popularity they

were chosen because they had good

leadership skills the people rather than

commanding them these leaders that we

choose to represent need to have good

leadership skills they need to think

about our future

[Applause]

you need to be more vocal because this

is an important cause our protesting

needs to be strong because this issue

affects us collectively we need to start

coming together because strength is in

numbers and numbers change now we would

like to introduce batula Ghulam Hussain

she is an indigenous seller of color

living in Miss fuchi she's not indigent

she's a settler of color she is an

organizer with climate justice Emmet

inand fundamentally believes that

climate justice must prioritize by Park

disabled and frontline communities

[Applause]

just want to make it extra clear I'm not

digitus so a couple of days ago one of

my best buds Bronwyn Tucker wrote a

thread on Twitter she talked about how

excited we were the Greta was joining us

here today but how there have been so

many other organizers here that have

been fighting for climate justice here

in Alberta and leading the way for so

long folks like Ariel - Ron Shay the

executive director of

[Applause]

folks like Veronica Fuentes a young

organizer with the Beaver Hills Warriors

and Emma Jackson and Stephen Miller and

Gabrielle Kelderman and Marcos Luciano

who fights from migrant justice every

single day and crystal layman whose book

industry in the eye and petrol folks

like Molly Swain and Chris and Chelsea

Vowell who are actively working to make

sure that indigenous people get their

land back looking at this incredible

list of people and looking at all of you

today I know that we can win I know that

we can win because I refuse to believe

that my generation will go down in the

world as it is we know that our house is

on fire and while we have a government

that continues to deny that the climate

crisis is in fact a crisis communities

are already seeing the devastating

impacts of rising sea levels of a

wildfire season in the West and a flood

season in the East the erosion of

traditional territories and the

destruction of islands like the one that

my mother grew up on my mom grew up on

an island called Penda in eastern Africa

as a result of rising sea levels that

Island will be under water generations

of my family's history will be erased I

will never be able to return home to the

lands that my family comes from this is

what the climate crisis is stealing from

us

[Applause]

is robbing communities of color our

ability to return to our homelands and

destroying the places that we come from

I dropped here at the mouth of the

Alberta tar sands being spoon-fed a myth

that when there is a boom in Alberta's

oil and gas industry everyone does well

and reaps the benefits looking back I

know that that's a lie because I'm not

sure how it benefited people like my

parents who were struggling to make ends

meet

even in the biggest booms of industry

while destroying the communities that

they come from but the industry can feel

and is capable and omnipresent here in

Alberta going to school here

we're indoctrinated with the benefits of

the oil and gas industry while they

continue to contaminate water and land

in northern indigenous communities

and living here can feel incredibly

hostile on the best of days for climate

organizers particularly when we have a

government that is in the pocket of big

oil a government that continues to

prioritize the needs of industry over

the needs of workers over the rights of

indigenous peoples but addressing the

climate crisis fundamentally means

breaking down the foundations of what

created it in the first place it means

that we are not accepting band-aid

solutions to systemic problems it means

that we're going to address white

supremacy and extractive capitalism in

our fight to address

[Applause]

this seems like a really big job but

looking at all of you I know that we can

do this together we can build a better

world from the ashes of this one by

prioritizing the communities that are on

the front lines of this crisis that is

indigenous communities communities of

color disabled communities because those

are the people that are experiencing the

devastating impacts of this crisis first

that starts by showing up when these

cuts come down when Kenny targets

workers when Kenny targets indigenous

communities we're going to show up

[Applause]

we're gonna rise up and we're gonna

fight back

[Applause]

I'm gonna end today with a call and

repeat so the answer is gonna be rise a

fight back okay when the communities we

love are under attack what are we going

to do when they say migrants are

stealing our jobs what are we going to

do when they trespass on indigenous

lands what are we gonna do thank you for

- up next we have speakers from Edmonton

use for climate use organizers aiming to

educate empower and engage all people

from Edmonton area to take action on

climate change

Madison Prairie is an 18 year old first

year University of Alberta student

working towards her degree in education

[Applause]

Claire Morrison is 16 in grade 11 both

students got involved with e YFC when it

started in February hi thank you

everybody for coming to the strike and

showing their support March of this year

we held our first climate strike and it

had maybe a couple hundred people and

just last month on the 27th we had

thousands and today we have even more so

thank you so much it's only going to

continue to grow all of us are here

proving that climate change is the

defining issue of our generation but the

problem is that some people don't see it

that way

Alberta is a province defined by its

dependence on oil and gas which makes

all of us responsible for the warming of

our planet this also gives us all it

gives all of us the greater

responsibility to fix this problem and

push for a just transition to renewable

energy

[Applause]

we know that the world's future is up in

the air and that it is not something

that we can just sit by and idly watch

it is clear to see that there is a green

wave among the youth but we cannot fight

this fight alone the climate crisis

affects us all regardless of our age

political affiliation race gender or

sexual orientation

it affects workers in the oil and gas

industry as well who often feel we are

trying to take away their jobs but this

is not the case we do not hate oil

workers we understand that the oil and

gas sector are a big part of people's

livelihoods but we need to start working

now but we need to start working now

while we have time in order to have a

just transition for all it is crucial we

work toward

it is crucial we work to work

diversifying the economy because no

matter what the carbon emissions from

oil production are detrimental to our

environment Canada is one of the worst

per-capita emitters of greenhouse gas in

the world and yet we claim to be a green

country as the worst per capita emitter

out of the g20 countries Canada is three

times worse than the average

average emission rate and Alberta is

eight times worse than that average the

effects

[Applause]

the effects of climate change wildfires

extreme weather events and so on are

visible in Alberta even today and they

are only going to get worse real science

tells us that the wildfires were seeing

now such as the one that ransacked for

Mack are going to increase in number and

severity as droughts get worse high

winds increase and lightning strikes

become more common the climate crisis is

undeniably real the science speaks for

itself and we need to start acting on it

youth voices are growing in Alberta and

they're only going to continue to get

louder we are demanding a future that

respects climate science upholds

indigenous rights and sovereignty

creates millions of good new jobs

through green energy and enshrines

dignity and justice for all

indigenous peoples have been leading

this movement for far longer than any of

the settlers on this land

[Applause]

we have an opportunity to follow their

example and we should gladly take it if

we are to expect other countries to care

about this crisis people in privileged

positions as us need to take drastic

action now because we have the resources

and ability to do so instead our

government is building pipelines which

only depends our oil dependency our

Environment Minister Jason Nixon said we

have the most environmentally friendly

place in the world to produce oil and

gas products this is simply untrue oil

sands oil is not clean whatsoever and it

is not even about how clean the oil is

narratives like this deviate from the

core problem and ignore the science the

science is the unifying aspect of this

movement and we will keep striking until

it is recognized

[Applause]

once again we would like to thank

everybody for their continual and

ongoing support we hope to see you at

our many future events and be sure to

follow us on Instagram student at IKEA

to keep up with our organizing and

everything that we're going to be doing

in the future thank you

[Applause]

Thank You Madison and Claire we've had

governments protect industries at the

expense of the rest of us

this isn't about Greta young young

people and indigenous communities have

been fighting for a way of life

we all deserve we must work towards a

transition way away we must work towards

a transition away from oil and gas that

is just and fair to all impact

communities an insurance dignity and

livelihood of workers across industries

and across regions

now we would like to welcome Swedish

teenage

[Applause]

[Applause]

[Music]

thank you so much everyone who's here

it's I don't know how many we haven't

received any numbers yet but it looks

like thousands upon thousands so thank

you so much

it's incredible to see so many young

people and indigenous leaders gathered

here today and you are the hope so thank

you so much for that I want to

respectfully acknowledge that we are

gathered today on 26 territory a

traditional gathering place for diverse

indigenous peoples including the Cree

Blackfoot Metis well quarter soon

Iroquois the name Rajab way in Yui and

many others whose histories languages

and cultures and people's continued all

around us and and also thank you for the

wonderful reception I received here in

Alberta people are so nice

[Applause]

and I'm very proud to be with you here

today in Edmonton so today is Friday and

as always we are on climate strike young

people all around the globe are today

sacrificing their education to bring

attention to the climate and ecological

emergency we are not doing this because

we want to we aren't doing it because

it's fun we are doing it because we have

a special interest in the climate or

because we want to become politicians

when we grow up we are doing this

because our future is at stake we are

doing this because in this crisis we

will not be bystanders and we are doing

it because we want the people in power

to unite behind the science

[Applause]

in the ipcc sr 1.5 report that was

released last year it says that if we

are to have 67 percent chance of

limiting the global temperature rise to

below 1.5 degrees we had on January 1st

2018 420 gigatons of carbon dioxide left

in our co2 budget and now that number is

down to less than 360 gigatonnes as we

emit for the two gigatons of co2 every

year if you include land use at current

emissions levels that remain in co2

budget is gone within less than eight

and a half years again that budget is

for six to seven percent chance of

staying below at 1.5 degrees of global

temperature rise and avoiding the risk

of setting up several irreversible chain

reactions beyond human control that

would lead to enormous sufferings for

countless of people especially among

indigenous communities and people in the

global south

[Applause]

six to seven percent chance and that is

the best odds the IPCC has given us and

please note that these figures are

global and do therefore not mention the

aspect of equity clearly stated

throughout the Paris agreements which is

essential to make it work on a global

scale that means that richer countries

such as Sweden or Canada need to get

down to zero emissions much faster so

that so the people in poorer parts of

the world can heighten their standard of

living by building some of the

infrastructure that we have already

built such as roads hospitals

electricity schools and providing clean

drinking water these numbers also don't

include tipping points most feedback

loops nor additional warming hidden by

toxic air pollution and they also rely

on our generation removing astronomical

amounts of co2 previous generations co2

out of the atmosphere with technologies

that haven't yet been invented at scale

and maybe never will and this is what

it's all about this is what we are

saying this is not opinions or political

views this is the current best available

science and the politics that even

recognize

this are still nowhere in sight we

teenagers are not scientists nor are we

politicians but it seems many of us

apart from most others understand the

science because we have done our

homework if people really knew about

these things they wouldn't need to ask

me why I'm so passionate about climate

change

[Applause]

if people really were aware of this they

wouldn't need to ask us why we are

school striking for the climate and

taking it to the streets if people

really knew about the full consequences

of the climate an ecological emergency

then they would join us in the streets

[Applause]

in moving on from words to action to

solve this we need to start treating

this crisis as a crisis because you

cannot solve an emergency without

treating it as one

and without seeing the full picture you

cannot leave the responsibility to

individuals politicians the market or

other parts of the world to take because

this has to include everything and

everyone and no one must be left behind

[Applause]

we cannot allow this crisis to continue

to be a partisan political question the

climate in ecological crisis is far

beyond party politics and the main enemy

right now should not be any political

opponents because our and main enemy

right now is physics some people say

that we are fighting for our future but

that is not true we are not fighting for

our future we are fighting for

everyone's future

[Applause]

and if you think we should be in school

instead then we suggest you take our

place in the streets or better yet

[Applause]

covariant join us so we can speed up the

process one year ago we were just a

handful of school children and today we

are over 7.5 million people across the

world that make up

[Applause]

if that is possible then just imagine

what we could do together if we really

wanted to nothing is impossible if

enough people stand united so thank you

and continue and never give up

[Applause]

[Applause]

again we would like to thank rata for

visiting treated snakes to stand in

solidarity with us moving forward we

hope you all stay engaged when Greta

leaves I hope you all have the same

energy when our community stand up there

have been many incredible moments in

history where indigenous peoples have

been taken the lead in protecting our

lands and waters such as standing rocks

oka we encourage you all

lastly we invite chubby creeds up to end

up to end us off and around ants not

around at there's no rooms just a song

we all encourage you to stay cuz Greta

would like to take a picture with all of

you guys in the background

[Applause]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

ha

okay

[Music]

so uh if you want around that so I don't

know how you're gonna do it but you get

spinning my little circle right here we

go

[Music]

[Music]

you
