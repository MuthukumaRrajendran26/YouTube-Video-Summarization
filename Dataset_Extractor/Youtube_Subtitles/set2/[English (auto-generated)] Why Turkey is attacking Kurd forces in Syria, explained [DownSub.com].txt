for the for the Turkish government that

the presence of a Kurdish government on

the other side of its border with Syria

has been seen as unacceptable the YPG

and the SDF are made up of a Kurdish

militia known as the PKK which the

Turkish government basically considers

to be a terrorist organization the

Kurdish forces have launched several

campaigns over the last several decades

to foster an independent homeland to

fight for self-determination in the

region which has led to the Turkish

government out long these kinds of

organizations and so this idea that a

Kurdish militia could control vast

swaths of land so close to the Turkish

border has basically been a non-starter

for the Turkish regime one of the big

geopolitical regional issues involves

the Kurds you have Kurdish minorities in

Syria in Iraq in Turkey in Iran and the

fear of the states in that region is

that you have the potential for a kind

of United Kurdistan part of the

offensive that's going on right now is

that Turkey sees the Kurds in general

and this region in general as a threat

so the idea is that by creating what

they're they're dubbing a security zone

they're creating a buffer between the

Kurds

and Turkey there's about two to three

million Syrian Iraq war refugees mostly

Arabs who are in Turkey they want to

resettle these individuals but they

don't want to just resettle them

anywhere they want to resettle them in

northeastern Syria so that it'll dilute

the Kurdish population and the control

of the Kurds in northeastern Syria

within Syria the regime forces control

the bulk of the country at this point

and the Kurdish fighters control about

1/3 of the country in the Northeast

however there are still pockets of Isis

there are still other jihadist factions

more in the west of the country

Isis has lost as territorial base but

still continues to exist and to mount

attacks even recently Isis does continue

to exist in that part of the world and

to operate they

they mount a gorilla attacks on a

regular basis there were dozens of such

attacks in August alone and even October

the 9th there were a number of attacks

in the city of Raqqa targeting the

Kurdish forces suicide bombings

apparently the remnants of Isis are

currently locked up in very insecure

kind of camps and prisons Kurdish forces

told us that you know if there were some

kind of a Turkish offensive they would

realistically have to pull their forces

away from the camps and prisons and put

them on the frontlines and that would

open the risk of escapes or attacks by

Isis on the camps and prisons to try and

free you know that the members that are

being held there we're now at a stage

where the potential that those Isis

could break out of those prisons and

camps is very real
