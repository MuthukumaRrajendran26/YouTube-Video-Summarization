we had a very good day today the

Republican Party our country there was

no defense of what Robert Muller was

trying to defend in all fairness to

robert muller whether his performance

was a bad one or a good one i think

everybody understands that i think

everybody understands what's going on

there was no defense to this ridiculous

hoax this witch hunt that's been going

on for a long time pretty much from the

time i came down on the escalator with

our first lady and it's a disgrace what

happened but I think today proved a lot

to everybody in fact some of my biggest

opponents wrote things today that I

wouldn't have believed they would have

written and I appreciate that they did

that this has been a very bad thing for

our country and despite everything we've

been through it's been an incredible two

and a half years for our country the

administration our president me we've

done a great job we've got the strongest

stock market the best unemployment

numbers the most number of people ever

working in the history of our country

right now almost 160 million our

military has been rebuilt and getting

even stronger we've done a great job and

we've done it under this terrible phony

cloud a phony cloud that's all it was

and they should be ashamed of themselves

absolutely ashamed and you know who knew

it was a phony cloud more than anyone

elses ship and Nadler and Schumer and

Pelosi every one of them they all knew

his phony stuff and you look at the

polls the polls are showing it maybe

more than anybody else or anything else

and I've had my best balls and I don't

say why but people see what's gone on in

our country with this whole thing I've

been going through it for three years

for three years all nonsense so this was

a very big day for our country this was

a very big day for the Republican Party

and you could say it was a great day for

me but I don't even like to say that

it's great I'll tell you what

I very much appreciate those incredible

warriors that you watch today on

television Republicans that defended

something and defended something very

powerful very important because they

were really defending our country more

than anything else they were defending

our country but they were warriors and

they've been warriors for a long time

the Democrats lost so big today their

party is in shambles right now they've

got the squad leading their party they

are a mess we're even you take a look at

scribe and you take a look at so many of

the people that were the most outspoken

and they say this was a devastating day

for the Democrats and you know it John

and everybody else knows it this was a

devastating day for the different we

were if you take a look at not only the

report beyond the report take a look at

not what he said but what he was forced

to say and even your networks and your

network and your network and you and

every one of these networks they put up

their hands you know we had a couple of

cases with actually we had about six

cases where they asked our people our

representatives television networks

please don't come in tonight we're not

going to be doing much on it and the

reason they're not because it's over go

ahead

[Music]

so WikiLeaks is a hoax just like

everything else and all of those

problems having to do with crime were

the biggest hoax of all it was a witch

hunt a total witch hunt and when you saw

Robert Muller's statement the earlier

statement and then he did a recap he did

a correction later on in the afternoon

and you know what that correction was

and you still ask the question you know

why because you're fake dudes and you're

one of the most and let me just tell you

the fact that you even asked that

question you're fake news because you

know what he totally corrected himself

in the afternoon and you know that just

as well as anybody Caitlyn Caitlyn I

[Music]

don't know whose answers weren't I guess

his answers weren't because if you look

the whole report you take a look at what

they did some of the things that he

didn't even know about some of the

things he didn't even know what was

going on but you know in the end what he

did he actually probably came through

for himself the performance was

obviously not very good he had a lot of

problems but what he showed more than

anything else is that this whole thing

has been three years of embarrassment

and waste of time for our country
