welcome back everybody good to see it's

up 17 or you might think just a special

yeah I mean they're all very exciting

and each year you got to re-establish

yourself as a team as and coaches as a

media person whatever you do the year

you're in is the most important one you

know I you know my dad just tells story

about that I'd say dad what's the

toughest your marriage you say the one

grant so if you put it all in and then

when you're in I think usually turn off

pretty good I know where another cow

any of you guys

welljust it the home opener is always an

interesting game there's stuff going on

I think the home team is always a little

bit antsy I like to start on the road

then we're starting on home time we got

to play good so you know when you have

your opportunity yeah you might be a

little bit nervous

take a deep breath get out there and get

playing get some contact your first

shift or get run over by someone to

yourself in the game get play more

dinners we've just given those a little

more time than on the penalty kill

so because he wants the penalty for us

we need him to do that so he'll be in

the next game

but this buys them more time more reps

and these can get lots of reps and extra

on it and we're trying to stay with that

the best we can yeah but I talked to him

quite a bit about this and what we're

doing so no we're on the same page

moving ahead and we're gonna have a

rotation on a few guys this first a

little bit too little girl what we're

doing and we've talked about it that's a

week that's a lot of progress

we can win face off beacon penalty kill

he stands in the right spots no one saw

it and he's done it before in the leak

and he's won in the leak he's been a

good man this does the job I think

that's what Paul McFarland brings -

right I mean probably this guy you know

I'm just a bug movie about distance I

said we're gonna hire him right out from

under you're a real smart guy

real good power play feel for that

offensive side - whoo good faceoff guy

in teaching guys face offs he's helped

us in the past a little bit you know

I've done this over the years old a lot

is that I'm always looking for the next

coach and always talking to people about

who's the next guy I think I'm a real

good job hired coaches that's why we've

got lots of coaches that are coaching

other places and you know I think it's

an important process you're always

looking for players you need real good

coaches and you need new ideas all the

time and they got great newing ideas

he's a smart young guy there are games

DJ's at the game tonight talks about the

loss of DJ yeah I don't do like loss I

feel like great for Smitty I mean Smitty

came here he knew the program you know I

came here real hard I could get himself

prepared so he could be in it and

coaching the NHL and he's done that a

work card did a good job for us

I couldn't he you know obviously was a

serial winner before he got here and

those are the kind of people I'm always

looking for when we met punch was the

guy who told me about

Smitty and when we met I was impressed

and then we worked and attract develop

program I talked to a number of times

about don't leave before you're ready in

the NHL's that coach he leave before

you're ready you're gone before you

write arrive there when you're over

ready he's over ready

I've watched them play in exhibition

there organize their plans fast they're

going to be one of these teams that no

one's counting on that's gonna be way

better than you think

well I don't mean it's like most mere

mortals it takes you a little bit more

time you know many guys walk in and

start at 18 and so Freddie and took them

on time but Freddie Anderson is a good

good man

number one unbelievable man makes his

teammates better because he's such a

good man and the guys want to play for

him so hard because of the person he is

but then all the extra stuff he's done

to improve his game and be comfortable

and becoming NHL starter it's not easy

to be an NHL starter you're under a lot

of scrutiny a lot of the time and we

need to play well in front of him to

help well I would like to think you put

it behind him the day on it I'm a big

believer that as we all make huge

mistakes

the second you own it you can fix it and

that's the whole key and what do you did

at the time or you didn't he owned it

that's it it's done if you forgive

yourself you got to love yourself first

to share yourself with other people he's

got to share himself as a teammate it's

got to be a great teammate the way you

play and help your teammates - bye

Pauline extra hard this is an

unbelievable life experience warm when

we go through adversity we never wanted

the adversity when were in it when we

get through it we look back and say

that's a building block in life coaches

they're going to be an unveiling of the

captain's afternoon or we just going to

see them appear on the ice they have no

idea no it's not true I do have a great

idea I'm not telling you how's that Mike

you approach offensive and defensive

faceoffs differently with the new with

the new rules and do you think you think

it'll make a difference league wide and

scoring and that's a great question you

know I thought the one where we changed

a few years ago about putting your stick

down first and all that stuff I thought

that was an advantage this one I'm not

certain we've really tried to hone in on

it and we've tried to do the math on it

and we got a bunch of room does more

math on face ups and you could ever

believe but all zones and how you to go

about it

I don't know we're gonna watch and find

out a little more 10-gauge how do you

first round or it seems like this is

Miss Washington pad and yet that was

accomplished 30 person

well I don't worry about that so today

is the most important day for me because

it's the day I'm live so that's what I'm

gonna do we're gonna do that 82 times

and ideally we'll be in that tournament

and we're gonna build our fro no keep

going

so you know I don't think much like that

I just think that we got to build the

rust and we have analyzed and analyzed

and analyzed what wins in the leak this

summer what we had to improve we focused

on at all three counts of refocus on it

now we're trying to build a program to

help success so we can play a long time

in the spring

you gotta get to the spring first that's

theirs don't think it's ever changed

look when you're good you get to play so

real simple you know I like to me he

just seems to be good and every time we

tried to put him in a situation that

make the baby eat now not be as good he

was good again so you know I tried him

in the good games then I tried him in

the bad games I try to play them too

much so he'd be exhausted after I tried

to everything didn't work to display my

talking to guys they a lot of guys flash

about how much leadership is

I mean was it a difficult decision to

pick the guy that's gonna wear that

scene did you have a process that you

had to go through you know we went

through a process it's been going on for

a long time but I've been watching this

guy we didn't name a captain for a long

time because we didn't think it was

obvious and then when we knew was

obvious we I mean going to be wrong we

talked a ton about this we talked to our

players the butter we talked to our

staff about it we talked to our

management team about it and then the

end we made the right decision for the

Leafs and we're excited about this

opportunity seal
