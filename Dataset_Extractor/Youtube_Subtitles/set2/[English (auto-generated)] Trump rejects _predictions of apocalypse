[Applause]

well thank you very much Klaus and very

special congratulations on your 50th

year hosting the annual meeting of the

World Economic Forum a truly amazing

achievement it's an honor to address the

distinguished members of this

organization for the second time as

president when I spoke at this forum two

years ago I told you that we had

launched the great American comeback

today I'm proud to declare that the

United States is in the midst of an

economic boom the likes of which the

world has never seen before we've

regained our stride we discovered our

spirit and reawakened the powerful

machinery of American enterprise

America's thriving America is

flourishing and yes America is winning

again like never before just last week

alone the United States concluded two

extraordinary trade deals the agreement

with China and the United States Mexico

Canada agreement the two biggest trade

deals ever made they just happened to

get done in the same week these

agreements represent a new model of

trade for the 21st century agreements

that are fair reciprocal and that

prioritize the needs of workers and

families America's economic turnaround

has been nothing short of spectacular

when I took office three years ago

America's economy was in a rather dismal

state under the previous administration

nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs had

vanished wages were flat or falling

almost 5 million more Americans had left

the labor force than had gotten jobs and

more than 10 million people had been

added to the Food Stamp rolls the

experts predicted a decade of very very

slow growth or maybe even negative

growth high unemployment and a dwindling

work

and very much a shrinking middle class

millions of hard-working ordinary

citizens felt neglected betrayed

forgotten they were rapidly losing faith

in the system before my presidency began

the outlook for many nations was bleak

top economists warned of a protracted

worldwide recession the World Bank

lowered its projections for global

growth to a number that nobody wanted to

even think about pessimism had taken

root deep in the minds of leading

thinkers business leaders and policy

makers yet despite all of the cynics I

had never been more confident in

America's future I knew we were on the

verge of a profound economic resurgence

if we did things right one that would

generate a historic wave of investment

wage growth and job creation I knew that

if we unleash the potential of our

people if we cut taxes slashed

regulations and we did that at a level

that's never been done before in the

history of our country in a short period

of time fix broken trade deals and fully

tapped American energy that prosperity

would come thundering back at a record

speed and that is exactly what we did

and that is exactly what happened since

my election America has gained over

seven million jobs a number unthinkable

I wouldn't say it I wouldn't talk about

it but that was a number that I had in

mind the projection was two million we

did seven more than three times the

government's own projections the

unemployment rate is now less than three

point five percent and at three point

five percent that's a number that is the

lowest in more than 50 years the average

unemployment rate from my administration

is the lowest for any US president in

recorded history

we started off with reasonably high rate

for the first time in decades we are no

longer simply concentrating wealth in

the hands of a few we're concentrating

and creating the most inclusive economy

ever to exist we are lifting up

Americans of every race color religion

and Creed unemployment rates among

African Americans Hispanic Americans and

Asian Americans have all reached record

lows

African American youth unemployment has

reached the lowest it's ever been in the

history of our country African American

poverty has plummeted to the lowest rate

ever recorded the unemployment rate for

women reached the lowest level since

1953 and women now comprise a majority

of the American workforce that's for the

first time the unemployment rate for

veterans has dropped to a record low the

unemployment rate for disabled Americans

has reached an all-time record low

workers without a high school diploma

have achieved the lowest unemployment

rate recorded in US history wages are

rising across the board and those at the

bottom of the income ladder are enjoying

the percentage by far largest gains

workers wages are now growing faster

than management wages earnings growth

for the bottom 10% is outpacing the top

10% something that has not happened

paychecks for high school graduates are

rising faster than for college graduates

young Americans just entering the

workforce are also sharing in America's

extraordinary prosperity since I took

office more than 2 million Millennials

have gotten jobs and their wages have

grown by nearly 5 percent annually a

number that was unthinkable nobody would

have ever thought it was possible three

years ago

a record number of Americans between the

ages of 25 and 34 are now working in the

eight years before I took office over

300,000 working age people left the

workforce in just three years in my

administration 3.5 million people have

joined the work force 10 million people

have been lifted off welfare in less

than three years celebrating the dignity

of work is a fundamental pillar of our

agenda this is a blue-collar boom since

my election the net worth of the bottom

half of wage earners has increased by

plus 47 percent three times faster than

the increase for the top one percent

real median household income is at the

highest level ever recorded the American

Dream is back bigger better and stronger

than ever before no one has benefiting

more than America's middle class we have

created 1.2 million manufacturing and

construction jobs a number also

unthinkable after losing 60,000

factories under the previous two

administrations hard to believe when you

hear 60,000 factories America has now

gained in a very short period of time

12,000 new factories under my

administration and the numbers going up

rapidly will be beating the 60,000

number that we lost except these will be

bigger newer and the latest years of

economic stagnation have given way to a

roaring geyser of opportunity u.s. stock

markets have soared by more than 50

percent since my election adding more

than 19 trillion dollars to household

wealth and boosting 401ks pensions and

college savings accounts for millions of

hardworking families and these great

numbers are many things and it's despite

the fact

that the Fed has raised rates too fast

and lowered them too slowly and even now

as the United States is by far the

strongest economic power in the world

it's not even close

who's going to be close but a lot of

good things happened to us and some not

so good things happen to certain to

other places they're forced to compete

and we compete with nations that are

getting negative rates something very

new meaning they get paid to borrow

money something that I could get used to

very quickly love that got to pay back

your loan no how much am I getting

nevertheless we still have the best

numbers that we've had in so many

different areas it's a conservative

approach and we have a tremendous upside

potential when all of the trade deals

and the massive deregulation starts

kicking in which will be during this

year especially toward the end of the

year those trade deals are starting to

kick in already the regulations are

kicking in right now and I see such

tremendous potential for the future we

have not even started because the

numbers were talking about our massive

the time for skepticism is over people

are flowing back into our country

companies are coming back into our

country many of you who I know are

coming back in with your plants and your

factories thank you very much America's

newfound prosperity is undeniable

unprecedented and unmatched anywhere in

the world America achieved this stunning

turnaround not by making minor changes

to a handful of policies but by adopting

a whole new approach sentient entirely

on the well-being of the American worker

every decision we make on taxes trade

regulation energy immigration education

and more is focused on improving the

lives of everyday Americans we are

determined to create the highest

standard of living that anyone can

imagine

and right now that's what we're doing

for our workers the highest and the

world and we're determined to ensure

that the working and middle class reaped

the largest gains a nation's highest

duty is to its own citizens honoring

this truth is the only way to build

faith and confidence in the market

system only when governments put their

own citizens first will people be fully

invested in their national futures in

the United States we're building an

economy that works for everyone

restoring the bonds of love and loyalty

that unites citizens and powers Nations

today I hold up the American model as an

example to the world of a working system

of free enterprise that will produce the

most benefits for the most people in the

21st century and beyond a pro worker Pro

citizen pro-family agenda demonstrates

how a nation can thrive when its

communities its companies its government

and its people work together for the

good of the whole nation as part of this

new vision we passed the largest package

of tax cuts and reforms in American

history US stock markets have soared by

more than 50 percent since my election

adding more than 19 trillion dollars to

household wealth and boosting 401ks

for millions of hardworking families and

these great numbers are many things and

citizen pro-family agenda demonstrates

how a nation can thrive when its

and its people work together for the

new vision we passed the largest package

of tax cuts and reforms in American

history we double the child tax credit

benefiting 40 million American families

and lifting 650,000 single mothers and

their 1 million children out of poverty

and out of poverty quickly we passed the

first ever tax credit for employers who

provide paid paternal leave for

employees earning 72,000 dollars or less

annually and past paid family leave for

government employees as a model for the

country we made childcare much more

affordable and reduced or eliminated

childcare wait lists all across the

nation our child care reforms are

supporting working parents and ensuring

their children have access to

high-quality care and education all of

which they very much deserve we lowered

our business tax from the highest in the

developed world down to one that's not

only competitive but one of the lower

taxes we created nearly nine thousand

Opportunity Zones in distressed

communities where capital gains or long

term investments are now taxed at zero

and tremendous wealth is pouring into

areas that for a hundred years or

nothing the 35 million Americans who

live in these areas have already seen

their home values rise by more than

twenty two billion dollars my

administration has also made historic

investments in

historically black colleges and

universities I saved HBC use we save

them they were going out and we saved

them we're removing roadblocks to

success and rewarding businesses that

invest in workers families and

communities we've also launched the most

ambitious campaign in history to reduce

job-killing regulations for every new

regulation adopted we are removing eight

old regulations which will save an

average of American households about

$3,100 per year it was going to be for

every one we do - but we were able to

lift that - aid and we think that's

going to go quite a bit higher we still

have a way to go today I urge other

nations to follow our example and

liberate your citizens from the crushing

weight of bureaucracy with that you have

to run your own countries the way you

want

we are also restoring the constitutional

rule of law in America which is

essential to our economy our liberty and

our future and that's why we've

appointed over 190 federal judges a

record to interpret the law as written

190 federal judges think of that in two

Supreme Court judges as a result of our

efforts investment is pouring into our

country in the first half of 2019 the

United States attracted nearly

one-quarter of all foreign direct

investment in the world think of that 25

percent of all foreign investment all

over the world came in to the United

States and that numbers increasing

rapidly to every business looking for a

place where they are free to invest

build thrive innovate and succeed there

is no better place on earth than the

United States as a central part of our

commitment to building an inclusive

society we established the National

Council for the American worker we want

every citizen regardless of age or

background to have

the cutting-edge skills to compete and

succeed in tomorrow's workplace this

includes critical industries like

artificial intelligence quantum

computing and 5g under Ivanka's

leadership who's with us today our

pledge to America's workers has become a

full-blown national movement with over

400 companies committing to provide new

job and training opportunities to

already very close to 15 million

American students and workers 15 million

America is making sweeping changes to

place workers and their families at the

center of our national agenda perhaps

the most transformative change of all is

on trade reform where we're addressing

chronic problems that have been ignored

tolerated or enabled for decades our

leaders did nothing about what happened

to us on trade before I was elected

China's predatory practices were

undermining trade for everyone but no

one did anything about it except allow

it to keep getting worse and worse and

worse under my leadership America

confronted the problem head-on under our

new phase 1 agreement phase 2 is

starting negotiations very shortly

China has agreed to substantially do

things that they would not have done

measures to protect intellectual

property stop forced technology

transfers remove trade barriers and

agricultural goods and on agricultural

goods where we were treated so badly

open its financial sector totally that's

done and maintain a stable currency all

backed by very very strong enforcement a

relationship with China right now has

probably never been better we went

through a very rough patch but it's

never ever been better my relationship

with President Xi is an extraordinary

one he's for China up to the US but

other than that we love

each other additionally China will spend

an additional 200 billion dollars over

two years of American services

agriculture and energy and manufactured

goods so will be taken in in excess of

200 billion could be closer to 300

billion when it finishes but these

achievements would not have been

possible without the implementation of

tariffs which we had to use and we're

using them on others too

and that is why most of our tariffs on

China will remain in place during the

phase two negotiations for the most part

the tariffs have been left and were

being paid billions and billions of

dollars a year as a country as I

mentioned earlier we ended the NAFTA

disaster one of the worst trade deals

ever made

not even close and replaced it with the

incredible new trade deal the u.s. MCA

that's Mexico and Canada in the nearly

25 years after NAFTA the United States

lost one in four manufacturing jobs

including nearly one in four vehicle

manufacturing jobs it was an incentive

to leave the country the NAFTA agreement

exemplified the decades-long failures of

the international trading system the

agreement shifted wealth to the hands of

a few promoted massive outsourcing drove

down wages and shuttered plants and

factories by the thousands the plants

would leave our country make the product

sell it into our country we ended up

with no jobs and no taxes but by other

countries product that doesn't happen

anymore this is the wreckage that I was

elected to clean up it's probably the

reason I ran for president more than any

other thing because I couldn't

understand why we were losing all of

these jobs to other countries at such a

rapid rate and it got worse and worse

and I think it's probably the primary

reason that I ran but there are other

reasons also than to replace with a new

system that puts workers before the

special interests

and the special-interest will do just

fine but the workers come first well

brand new US MCA is the result of the

broadest coalition ever assembled for

Trade Agreement manufacturing

agriculture and labor all strongly

endorsed the deal and as you know it

just passed in Congress overwhelmingly

it shows how to solve the 21st century

challenge we all face protecting

intellectual property expanding digital

trade we shoring lost jobs and ensuring

rising wages and living standards the

United States has also concluded a great

new trade deal with Japan approximately

40 billion dollars and completely

renegotiated our deal with South Korea

we're also negotiating many other

transactions with many other countries

and we look forward to negotiating a

tremendous new deal with the United

Kingdom have a wonderful new prime

minister once very much to make a deal

as they say to protect our security and

our economy we are also boldly embracing

American energy independence the United

States is now by far the number one

producer of oil and natural gas anywhere

in the world by far it's not even close

while many European countries struggle

with crippling energy costs the American

energy revolution is saving American

families $2,500 every year

in lowering electric bills and numbers

that people said couldn't happen and

also very importantly prices at the pump

we've been so successful that the United

States no longer needs to import energy

from hostile nations with an abundance

of American natural gas now available or

European allies no longer have to be

vulnerable to unfriendly energy

suppliers either we urge our friends in

Europe to use America's vast supply and

achieve

energy security with US companies and

researchers leading the way we are on

the threshold of virtually unlimited

reserves of energy including from

traditional fuels LNG clean coal next

generation nuclear power and gas hydrate

technologies at the same time I'm proud

to report the United States is among the

cleanest air and drinking water on earth

and we're going to keep it that way and

we just came out with a report that at

this moment it's the cleanest it's been

in the last 40 years we're committed to

conserving the majesty of God's creation

and the natural beauty of our world

today I am pleased to announce the

United States will join 1 trillion trees

initiative being launched here at the

World Economic Forum 1 trillion trees

and in doing so we will continue to show

strong leadership and restoring growing

and better managing our trees and our

forests this is not a time for pessimism

this is a time for optimism fear and

doubt is not a good thought process

because this is a time for tremendous

hope and joy and optimism and action but

to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow

we must reject the perennial prophets of

doom and their predictions of the

Apocalypse

they are the heirs of yesterday's

foolish fortune tellers and I have them

and you have them and we all have them

and they want to see us do badly but we

don't let that happen

they predicted an overpopulation crisis

in the 1960s mass starvation in the 70s

and an end of oil in the 1990s these

alarmists always demand the same thing

absolute power to dominate transform and

control every aspect of our lives we

will never let radical socialists

destroy our economy Recker country or

eradicate our Liberty America will

always be the proud strong and

unyielding bastion of freedom in America

we understand what the pessimists

refused to see that a growing and

vibrant market economy focused on the

future lifts the human spirit and

excites creativity strong enough to

overcome any challenge any challenge by

far the great scientific breakthroughs

of the 20th century from penicillin to

high-yield wheat to modern

transportation and breakthrough vaccines

have lifted living standards and saved

billions of lives around the world and

we're continuing to work on things that

you'll be hearing about in the near

future that even today sitting here

right now you wouldn't believe it's

possible that we have found the answers

you'll be hearing about it but we have

found answers to things that people said

would not be possible certainly not in a

very short period of time but the

wonders of the last century will pale in

comparison to what today's young

innovators will achieve because they are

doing things that nobody thought even

feasible to begin we continue to embrace

technology not to shun it when people

are free to innovate millions will live

longer happier healthier lives for three

years now America has shown the world

that the path to a prosperous future

begins with putting workers first

choosing growth and freeing

entrepreneurs to bring their dreams to

life for anyone who doubts what is

possible in the future we need only look

at the towering achievements of the past

only a few hundred miles from here

are some of the great cities of Europe

teeming centres of Commerce and culture

each of them is full of reminders of

what human Drive and imagination can

achieve centuries ago at the time of the

Renaissance skilled craftsmen and

laborers looked upwards and built the

structures that still touch the human

heart to this day some of the greatest

structures in the world have been built

hundreds of years ago in Italy the

citizens once started construction on

what would be a one hundred and forty

year project

the Duomo of Florence incredible

incredible place while the technology

did not yet exist to complete their

design city fathers forged ahead anyway

certain that they would figure it out

someday these citizens of Florence did

not accept limits to their high

aspirations and so the great dome was

finally built in France another century

long project continues to halt such a

grip on our hearts and our souls that

even 800 years after its construction

when the Cathedral of Notre Dom was

engulfed in flames last year such a sad

sight to watch unbelievable sight

especially for those of us that

considered it one of the great great

monuments and representing so many

different things the whole world grieved

through her sanctuary now stand scorched

and charred and a site that's hard to

believe when you got used to it to look

at it now hard to believe but we know

that no true Dom will be restored will

be restored magnificently the great

bells will once again ring out for all

to hear

giving glory to God and filling millions

with Wonder and all the cathedrals of

Europe teach us to pursue big dreams

daring adventures and unbridled

ambitions they urge us to consider not

only what we built today but what we

will endure long after we are gone they

testify to the power of ordinary people

to realize extraordinary achievements

when United by a grand and noble purpose

so together we must go forward with

confidence determination and vision we

must not be timid or meek or fearful but

instead we must boldly seize the day and

embrace the moment we have so many great

leaders in this room not only business

leaders but leaders of Nations and some

are doing such a fantastic job we work

together very closely we will draw a

strength from the glories of the past

and we will make greatness our common

mission for the future together we will

make our nations stronger our country is

safer our culture richer our people

freer and the world's more beautiful

than ever before

above all else we will forever be

loyal to our workers or citizens and our

families the men and women who are the

backbone of our economies the heart of

our communities and the soul of our

countries let us bring light to their

lives one by one and empower them to

light up the world

thank you very much god bless you god

bless your countries and god bless

america

thank you thank you very much
