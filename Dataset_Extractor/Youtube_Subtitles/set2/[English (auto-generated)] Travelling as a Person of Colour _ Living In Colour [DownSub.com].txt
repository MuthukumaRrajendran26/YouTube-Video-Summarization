welcome to living in color I'm your host

Farah Nasser and today we're talking

about what it's like traveling as a

person of color this includes having

your name on a no-fly list having people

approach you to touch your hair

sometimes without your permission and

more today I'm joined by the co-founder

of no-fly list kids could be jack edgy

as well as a travel blogger Jessica

Alfama thank you so much both for being

here and for joining us so I'm gonna

start with you cathedra because you have

an interesting personal story that

involves travel with your son tell us

about it

so my son is now 10 and since he was

born he's been flagged on Canada's

no-fly list

so essentially he's a name match to

somebody who's on that list and since

he's he was born we've had trouble when

we travel with him by by by air so since

he was what how old the first time we

flew with him was when he was 6 weeks

old and I have two older kids never had

any issues before that and suddenly we

were being stopped at the airport we

were he was being security screened and

we didn't know actually they wouldn't

tell us which one of us was being

screened they would just stop the entire

family and once they worked out whatever

they had to and there and they'd let us

go it was when he was 18 months old we

realized that it was actually one of the

agents was sympathetic enough to tell us

that it was him that was actually

flagged because she herself was so much

in shock that he was so little yeah and

it's six what happened when he was six

years old so when he was six years old

actually again same thing checking in at

the airport he was traveling to from

Halifax to Toronto and my husband again

was with him and encountered the same

situation and managed to get a picture

of the agents check ins the check-in

agents screen that showed that he my

son's name and designated high profile

so essentially you know the six-year-old

is a risk to society yes exactly so he

took a picture of it and tweeted it out

and it sort of took a life of its own we

started getting contacted by all these

other parents who had children in

similar situations and co-founded a

group called no flight no fly list kids

and started advocating on this issue

because we thought it was just so absurd

it's ludicrous yeah absolutely

let me turn it over to you because you

love traveling and you travel you say as

a woman of color you fought you have

certain challenges when you travel and

you kind of dress the part

tell me about that yeah I find that as a

woman of color every time I travel I

always stand out by using on my skin

color plus and I find that people are

constantly looking at me of taking

pictures of me and sometimes it's almost

feels like I am the attraction as

opposed to the furniture in the truck

exactly and you know I could be in the

most beautiful place for example in

Thailand grand palace which is like

studded with gold but I'm the trash and

I'm the one that they want to come and

take pictures with almost as if I was

maybe like a spectacle for example and

because of that I find that every time

I'm traveling I'm very conscious about

that and I want to change some outfits

that I wear as opposed to wearing color

I love to wear color but sometimes I

wear you know black collars or like

neutral colors just so I can not stand

out as much as I want to that sometimes

helps because I'm able to blend in a bit

more but in general it's just sometimes

uncomfortable because I want to go

somewhere and experience the place but I

don't want any of those inconveniences

of people just touching me or just like

looking at me like I was an outcast you

know so I find that that really

influences my outfit choices for example

and you've had experiences where people

have touched your hair talked about that

yeah so I've had moments several moments

when people come up to me and just touch

my hair and just sometimes even ask me

questions like who are you from what

what are you doing here I don't know why

they will do that but obviously my skin

color maybe drives them draws them to me

and it's sometimes very uncomfortable

because you know I like I said I just

want to have a good time when I travel

as opposed to being an attraction or

just having people come up to me and

interrupt my activity so it gets it gets

a bit tricky sometimes but I found that

those moments are great for me to just

educate them and teach them about my

culture and sometimes it's not from a

militia standpoint but if you weren't

used to that kind of thing happen to you

in your country for example you might be

taking aback by it so so what did we

just they just grabbed it and they just

grabbed my hair and just touch it and

say wait what is this how did you make

it how long do you take it to make or

just ask me so many like interesting

questions and sometimes I don't want

that sometimes I'm I'm not open to it

and sometimes I just tell them what it

is well yeah and it's exhausting to also

have to keep explaining it's exhausting

what you do to the first person it's

okay but we have to show you often and

it's it's very exhausting so I think

right now because of travel a lot quite

often and I feel a lot more comfortable

because I'm I know what to expect but

usually like the first few times when I

traveled I was so embarrassed sometimes

because I I just didn't feel very

comfortable when people just come in to

talk to me or just take pictures of me

sometimes they don't even ask for

permission they just stand in the corner

and take pictures of me and I'm like oh

what's what yeah what's going on right

but I'm more open to a more open to it

yeah let's go back to no-fly list kids

so what are some of the things that

you're you're advocating for you're

trying to make change with the

government - I guess bring attention to

these children how many children are on

this list so I mean hundreds that we

know of we actually started advocating

on this issue three and a half years ago

when my husband got a picture of them of

that screen and since all those parents

contacted us we formed the group and we

started our advocacy efforts so we have

quite far actually we've you know

there's new legislation in place now

dealing with this issue so the entire

system will be redesigned and hopefully

implemented in about a year's time

hopefully what that means is that these

children will have these children's

names will be removed from the list hmm

that's you know that's our hope you know

at the very least people who find

themselves falsely flagged will be able

to have a mechanism by which they can

get themselves removed from the list

currently that mechanism doesn't exist

so I mean it's been a very long three

and a half years it's taken up many many

hours of our time you know free time

it's almost like a second job but yeah I

mean it I we just felt we had to do it

be going through this how did you talk

to him about this I mean how do you

explain his - child yeah so when he was

six I mean we didn't really say much to

him he was obviously curious about what

was going on why we'll all these news

you know cameras come in our house

why a mom and dad on TV all the time and

a couple of times he was actually his

picture was in the paper as well so we

tried to just give him and I just give

him an explanation that a six-year-old

would understand as he started getting

older he started to get gaining more of

an understanding of it so still we allow

him to ask the questions and then just

try to give answers as long as he's

satisfied with the answers we give we're

good we don't go into too much detail

because I don't really want him to grow

up with that stigma that he stigma

hanging over him that he had this you

know this this sort of like flag on him

I don't want him to grow up with that

hanging over him of course an issue is

growing up I mean a kid is one thing but

if he's an 18 year old a 23 year old

yeah and governments change and some

somehow he still is on the know I mean

that must be a huge concern to you

definitely because you know obviously we

know a lot of teenage boys actually some

who have now become adults sense you

know we've met them and we know from

their experiences that as they get older

the security screenings become

increasingly invasive so when there are

little babies or even my son's age 10

it's just a matter of getting the agent

to clear their name for check-in when

they get older they're not they don't

look so young anymore you know they look

maybe a little bit like adults or

whatever they start getting pulled aside

for secondary questioning at security

and you know getting pulled aside to the

extent where they've missed flights and

have been held up for hours with their

families that can become really scary

some of the boys actually have refused

to fly until this matter is resolved

because they're afraid of what might

happen to them if they go to

international destination some of them

are adults now and still are waiting

until the new system is implemented

because they're just afraid that must be

really terrifying to think about how how

yeah because Canada I mean there's

you're from here either some comfort

there but international destinations

being on this list I mean that anything

that happened you just never know when

you're in a foreign jurisdiction you

just never know what can happen right so

and some of them don't want to take the

risk do you have any safety concerns in

terms of being a woman of color when

you're traveling like you know I'm not

even talking photographs I'm just

talking about safety oh yeah yes that I

do get

sometimes scrutinized I can take maybe

for example get taken to a room for

extra checks I've had that happen to me

a lot and I would find that it's not I

usually ask why are you taking me to

this room is there anything because I

have proper documentation so why is why

do I need to be taking through all of

these rigors just so I can get to a new

country I'm trying to experience so I do

have some safety some safety concerns as

a woman of color and your times when I

could for example go to a place I not

feel very safe because I get this stare

so I'm wondering what's next like are

you go like are you coming to meet me I

just get that I just get scared and

afraid of people just coming to meet me

and asking me questions or questioning

me so I do have safety concerns as

opposed to you know sometimes you just

want to go to a new place and experience

it and not feel like you're in danger of

any sorts but when you have someone even

literally follow you to where you're

going to like walk behind you especially

males it gets very concerning you you

mentioned also that you to us earlier

that you when you were on a bus one

somebody stopped the bus and tried to

take your see if your passport was real

or fake yeah exactly so again I get

people do that a lot to me and this

particular instance was in Mexico and I

was in a bus we're just going to a

different city and then they came up to

me asked me for my past but to see if it

was real and fake and they at that time

I had a different hairstyle so as a

woman of help sometimes I change my

hairstyle so it was like oh this is not

really you I'm like this is me and then

I had to show a different ID with the

matching hairstyle that I had actually

to make sure yeah so it's things like

that little things like that that maybe

other people will get away with that I'm

not able to get away with what what

advice do you have I mean you have

travelled quite a bit with your family

as well what what advice do you have for

people of color who are travelling who

might be a little bit a concern to

travel and do you feel I mean that it is

actually an issuer that people of color

are treated differently when they are

traveling we mean we've been contacted

by families from all different

backgrounds right so

in that sense we do know that people

from all different backgrounds are

impacted on this list however it

definitely it is disproportionately

towards people of color

disproportionately towards people with

Arabic sounding names so you know it is

the sort of like stigma or this

marginalization that that exists around

these kinds of names right I would

encourage anybody who feels like they

may be unfairly impacted on this list

definitely engage your public officials

like contact your MP contact Public

Safety contact us I mean we can always

give advice you know we have a twitter

handle we have a website so we've we've

helped a lot of people along the way and

there are mechanisms now being put in

place to deal with these kinds of issues

just speaking up you know it can it can

accomplish a lot yeah it is I mean it's

a big world out there there's so much to

see and it's a shame if if people were

to feel unsavory it's understandable but

it is I think doing your research

knowing what you're getting into when

you're getting into it is something but

it really hopefully will not be limiting

for a lot of people or feel like it's

not limiting I mean I'm sure you've

inspired some people Jessica who might

not nitin might not consider getting out

there to travel so thank you both so
