my name is Alex palawan and I served in

a Canadian Navy as a seaman HMCS here on

Alex palawan joined the Canadian war

effort in 1941 the same year the Nazis

invaded his birthplace of Lithuania

he was just 17

[Music]

I learned more about Canada by foot from

speaking to the various crew members

that I could have ever imagined and

about people where is a 17 18 year old

kid guarded at the opportunity we were

sort of all in the same boat we were an

all-purpose destroyer it's perfect

worshippers you can get to do all sorts

of jobs that you want to do we were good

for everything

[Music]

the most famous battles were in English

channels

we had the most dangerous luckiest jobs

you know that was our job right front to

clean the channel out so you can imagine

what they could have done you know a

shell could kill a thousand people one

shadow there was a wonderful feeling the

lives that we saved and that was our job

10 of us

ten destroyers love these trees today at

ninety five still have a few hairs wet

Able Seaman palawan remembers the war

firsthand and still speaks at hundreds

of events I again with historic a Canada

well at times I was the most frightened

person in the world and there were times

that I felt like the bravest person in

the world I get try my best to for

Canada and my two relatives my two

uncles

near the end of the war he learned his

two uncle's have been killed by the

Nazis he never forgot the suffering of

his Jewish family in Lithuania

[Music]

now I'm gonna go to the end of the war

by then I knew that my uncle's have been

murdered and I had a dream I had a dream

that they came down and they hugged me

and they kissed me and they told me how

proud they were of me

[Music]

and actually one of the first few times

my life I cried and I never dreamt of

the war again after that

the war

I did my part I repaid what they did for

me I tried my best to repay it

and I wasn't at peace with that

you
