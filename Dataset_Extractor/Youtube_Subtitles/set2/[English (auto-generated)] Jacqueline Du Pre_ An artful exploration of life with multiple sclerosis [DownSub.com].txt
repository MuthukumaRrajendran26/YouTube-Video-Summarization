a mixture of elegance and ferocity

that's how Jacqueline du prais playing

of the cello was once categorized the

story of her multiple sclerosis

diagnosis at 26 share through dance will

be familiar to many with the disease

it began with numbness and unexplained

sensations so I started to dream up this

story which is about her it's to some

extent a biographical work but it's very

much focused on the love affair that she

had with music and I liked the idea of

personifying music and the cello by

using a male dancer in that role there's

a neck of the cello there's a body of

the cello

Kathy Marston got the idea for the

cellist from her sister a music teacher

Duprey was a young English musical icon

I really wanted to take care that I was

portraying the illness with as much

sensitivity and poetry as poses as I

possibly could

la explores the height that she flew to

and then it sort of the loss of her

voice MS often strikes people early in

life women are diagnosed more than men

there's no cure and for some it can take

a devastating toll there's no telling

what what the future holds

some people will lose mobility some

people won't that the path is very

different so it's a it's a really

interesting way to tell the story

through movement I think a very powerful

one

Duprey had relapsing remitting ms it

crept her her fingers and eventually she

was confined to a wheelchair she died at

42 the Royal Opera House in London has

partnered with cinemas around the world

to broadcast the cellist so far only two

small Canadian theatres are slated to

run it one NBC the other in Ontario

I think it is an emotional work and it's

it's heartbreaking but it's not tragic

we should be celebrating the life force

of Jackie as much as the loss of her

talent Marsten's mum also has MS she

hopes the ballet will raise awareness

while bringing people a little joy
