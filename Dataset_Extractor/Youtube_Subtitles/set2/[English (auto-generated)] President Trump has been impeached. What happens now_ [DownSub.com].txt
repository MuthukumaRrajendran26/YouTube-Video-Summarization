but we want to take you first to

Washington where the impeachment of

President Trump is happening right now

this is the House of Representatives

it's just on something historic it is

voted on the first article of

impeachment abuse of power and the

Democrats have won a majority that means

President Trump no matter how much he

objects will forever be known as a third

American president to ever be impeached

it happened after eight hours of fiery

debate what is at risk here is the very

idea of America that idea holds that we

are a nation of laws not of men we are a

nation that believes in a rule of law

the second vote on the other article of

impeachment is happening within minutes

our Jackson prosecco is watching all of

this in Washington Jackson what a moment

playing out right now it really is Don a

moment in history as you mentioned

Donald Trump now only the third

president in history to have been

impeached by the House of

Representatives that lengthy day of

debate was really split down partisan

lines with Democrats again making the

case that they felt they had no point or

no of course but to bring the country to

this point because they say Trump's

conduct went to the heart of interfering

in free and fair elections in 2020 but

Republicans really spent the day pushing

back on that with familiar talking

points not so much a defense of the

president's conduct rather saying that

Trump did nothing that was impeachable

and arguing largely with the process

that brought us to this point

in fact one Republican member of

Congress suggested that what was

happening to Trump was akin to the

crucifixion of Jesus Christ another

suggested that it was similar to the

attack on Pearl Harbor that really gives

you a sense of the deep partisan divide

but donna at the end of the day as we

sit here right now democrats have the

majority they've been able to push one

of those articles of impeachment through

and the second one is not likely to be

any problem for them either

this was must-see TV in Washington

Jackson but president Trump hopped on a

plane and headed to Michigan for a rally

what's his reaction and what we're

seeing is this incredible split-screen

moment in

history Trump is on stage right now at

that rally with his supporters earlier

he fired off a series of angry tweets as

the impeachment process was going on

despite the White House saying that he

might tune in if he had the spare time

to do so but tonight he's expected to go

on an extended riff about the process

he's been through he's been subjected to

this tarnish on his record he alluded to

that when he stepped out on stage just a

few moments ago remember when I first

started this beautiful trip this

beautiful journey I just said to the

first lady you're so lucky I took you in

this fantastic journey it's so much fun

they want to impeach you they want to do

worse than that by the way by the way

by the way it doesn't really feel like

we're being impeached well he is being

impeached the second vote is about to

happen but we know where this is headed

there's no way out for the president

what happens next though Jackson

bottom-line is headed to a Senate trial

in January that is not likely to result

in Trump's removal from office because

Republicans have the majority the

question then Donna becomes how does

this play out in the 2020 election does

it help Trump or does it help Democrats

and that's the big unknown here some

close to the Trump campaign have been

saying he's relishing this split-screen

moment though a chance to fire back in

real time all right Jackson pros go on a

fascinating moment in history in

Washington thanks well set aside the

heated speeches in the fiery tweets

these are the two charges Trump is being

impeached on the first is abuse of power

it's alleged she asked Ukraine's

President to announce politically

motivated investigations into Democratic

candidate Joe Biden and his son in

exchange for nearly 400 million in

security and military aid that's the

quid pro quo you kept hearing about the

second is obstruction of Congress Trump

is accused of instructing officials in

his administration not to comply with

congressional subpoenas and requests for

documents and witness testimony all of

it his critics say driven by a political

vendetta and a desire to try to hold on

to power at any cost
