it's Rob Thomas when Toronto police

detective Rob Thomas sat down with van

attack suspect out Minassian it appeared

he may not get much out of him but

slowly and very intentionally Thomas

started to gain then twenty

five-year-olds trust I wasn't a very big

boy he begins to share some personal

experiences with with the accused to to

make the accused comfortable former

police officer Paul Nadeau who

specialized in interrogations and

polygraphs says establishing a

connection is key to getting information

people will cooperate with you when they

know you like you and trust you

something Dave Perry who has known

Thomas professionally for 25 years says

he trained for and was brought in to

accomplish detective Rob Thomas is a

very skilled very experienced

interviewer and investigator he's a

calligrapher so he's been working

polygraph for many years they've been

trained in lie detection and also on how

to talk to someone gaining trust through

body language we're seeing a slight

shift both legs are open arms are open

he's actually swiveling a little bit in

his chair as well as deliberate small

talk and even planned furniture

placement there's absolutely no

obstruction between the two of them

there's no table there's there's no

barrier and you don't want a barrier

between you and the person that you're

interrogating so the position of the

chairs are are excellent here all

tactics these experts say led to the

investigators securing a motive to have

the huge speaking the truth in his own

words not being prompted not being

interrogated not being forced to say

anything that you didn't want to say and

eventually what they call a confession I

floor the pedal I speed the van towards

them and I allow the van to collide with

them the detective did an excellent

textbook interrogation he establishes

rapport earlier on he's able to connect

with the accused it's an example of

great police work an interview experts

say they have no doubt will be

admissible in court other tactics

experts say Thomas used was in

shirring Minassian knew that the

detective was his equal adding a suspect

would not have respected the officer

otherwise also based on the suspects

responses I'm told that appears Toronto

police fault all the appropriate

procedures during the arrest and the

booking process
