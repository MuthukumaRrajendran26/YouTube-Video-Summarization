it

for in reciprocal trade agreement we

insist on fairness and we insist on

reciprocal we want reciprocal agreements

from now on because and I'm not just

talking about

good afternoon now had a chance to

review and detail the notes of the call

between the president ID States and the

president of Ukraine as well as the

legal opinion drafted by the Department

of Justice in an effort to prevent the

whistleblower complaint from coming to

our committee and I have to say that I'm

shocked by both the notes of the call

reflect a conversation far more damning

than I or many others had imagined it is

shocking at another level that the White

House would release this these notes and

felt that somehow this would help the

president's case or cause because what

those notes reflect is a classic

mafia-like

shakedown of a foreign leader they

reflect a Ukrainian president who was

desperate for US support for military

support to help that country in a hot

war with Putin's Russia a country that

is still occupied by irregular Russian

forces and in which people face a very

dangerous and continuing and

destabilizing acts

by their aggressive neighbor and at the

same time a president knighted States

who immediately after Ukraine president

expresses the need for further weapons

tells the Ukraine president that he has

a favor to ask president communicates to

his Ukrainian counterpart that the

United States has done a lot for Ukraine

we've done an awful lot for Ukraine more

than the Europeans or anyone else has

done for Ukraine but there's not much

reciprocity here this is how a mafia

boss talks what have you done for us

we've done so much for you but there's

not much reciprocity I have a favor I

want to ask you and what is that favor

of course the favor is to investigate

his political rival to investigate the

Biden's I and it's clear that the

Ukrainian president understands exactly

what is expected of him and is making

every effort to mollify the president

what adds another layer of depravity to

this conversation is the fact that

President States then invokes the

Attorney General of the United States as

well as his personal lawyer as

emissaries in the case of the Attorney

General as an official head of a u.s.

Department the Department of Justice

that he says will be part and parcel of

this now I know the Attorney General is

denying involvement in this but

nonetheless you can see why the

Department of Justice would want this

transcript never to see the light of day

you can see why they have worked so hard

to deprive our Committee of the

whistleblower complaint and in fact the

opinion by the Justice Department is

startling in its own regard because in

that opinion the Department of Justice

advances the absurd claim that the

Director of National Intelligence has no

responsibility over efforts to prevent

foreign interference in our elections

well that will come as news or at least

it should to the Director of National

Intelligence who is charged among other

things with detecting foreign

interference in our

elections and with reporting to Congress

about foreign interference in our

elections but it is apparently the view

of this Justice Department that the

director has no jurisdiction in this

area and it is a sad fact that the

Director of National Intelligence would

agree to be bound by that view that the

Director of National Intelligence would

adopt the view that he had no

jurisdiction over an effort to seek

foreign interference in our election

that will be the subject of our hearing

with the director tomorrow what's more

that Department of Justice opinion

doesn't even preclude the director from

providing that complaint to our

committee and yet he has withheld it and

violation of the law but the fact that

the president states would invoke the

Attorney General sends a further message

to the Ukrainian president that this is

not just me asking this is not just Rudy

Giuliani asking this is the United

States government asking and we plan to

infect effectuate that through the

Department of Justice whether those

steps have taken place yet or not or

whether those steps have now been

prevented by the whistleblower complaint

and all that has followed from that

revolution revelation so here we have

the press in the United States engaged

in a shakedown of a foreign president a

president United States even as he is

withholding vital military support to an

ally asking a favor of that Ally to

investigate his opponent and just by way

of background here so we know what sits

at stake in 1994 we tried to get Ukraine

to give up nuclear weapons it inherited

from the Soviet Union they were

reluctant to do so because those weapons

might be a guarantee against aggression

by their neighbors that is by the Soviet

Union but we and our allies persuaded

the Ukrainians nonetheless to give up

those weapons and we assured Ukraine

that we would help guarantee its

territorial integrity well Russia would

then invade Ukraine and over the years

since that invasion unites

has provided al biet not enough military

support to Ukraine but the most recent

support to Ukraine was held up by this

president hundreds of millions of

dollars for reasons that the president

would not and the secretaries were not

able to communicate even to leaders of

their own party like Mitch McConnell who

said yesterday that he couldn't find out

why this aid was being withheld well I

think we know why the aid was being

withheld notwithstanding the presents

now conflicting explanations well it was

because we wanted them to investigate

corruption no it was because we wanted

Europe to give them more money even

though Europe has given them even more

than we have I think we know why the

president was withholding that

assistance but regardless Ukraine

understood exactly what was being asked

of it Ukraine

understood exactly what they needed from

the United States and that a president

of the United States would interfere

with our national security would

interfere with the national security of

our ally and do so for the illicit

purpose of trying to advance his

election campaign having already sought

foreign help in his first presidential

campaign would now abuse the power of

his office yet again this time to seek

the help of another nation in his

presidential campaign is the most

fundamental betrayal of his oath of

office and I'd be happy to respond to

your questions but one final point about

the whistleblower we still don't have

the complaint now that we have the

Department of Justice opinion I think at

telling that they have released that and

yet not released the Inspector General's

legal analysis that takes issue with it

this is again bill bars Justice

Department trying to put out a

misleading spin in this case in the form

of the department's opinion but

nevertheless that complaint needs to be

provided to our committee it needs to

provide it in its entirety that

whistleblower needs two big instructions

about how to come to our committee and

that whistleblower needs to be given the

complete freedom to report any

allegations of wrongdoing that have come

to that whistleblowers attention we will

not

Brook any kind of interference given how

pervasive this cover-up apparently is

now I'll have to be happy to answer your

questions my response is the present of

Ukraine brought up his country's need

for military assistance and immediately

thereafter the president I'd state said

I have a favor I want to ask of you and

would not let the subject go there was

only one message that that president of

Ukraine got from that call and that was

this is what I need I know what you need

like any mafia boss the president didn't

need to say that's a nice country you

have it'd be a shame if something

happened to it because that was clear

from the conversation there is no quid

pro quo necessary to betray your country

or your oath of office even though many

read this as a quid pro quo I'm not

concerned whether it is a quid pro quo

or not

Ukraine understood what this president

wanted he made it abundantly clear he

made it redundantly clear he had his

emissaries making it clear and Ukraine

needed no new what it needed to do if it

wanted to get military assistance and

that is help the president United States

violate his oath of office well I think

in its most naked form and this is what

our inquiry is going to look into the

president has now admitted the notes of

this call and and we don't even know if

these are the complete notes of that

call indicate the president United

States shaking down a foreign leader

essentially undermining the national

security of this country for a personal

political gain and one that violates his

oath of office so it is very powerful

evidence

of that kind of potential impeachable

offense but we want to get the full

facts before the American people and we

also want to make sure we take

corrective action and I want to thank

the whistleblower we still don't know

whether this is the subject the wish'

blowers complain but I think this single

courageous individual may have had the

effect of forcing the White House to

provide Ukraine with this funding

knowing that these matters were going to

come to light

but this whistleblower has already had a

tremendous impact in exposing wrongdoing

in the president United States and

helping protect our national security in

a way that his or her boss was unwilling

to do and by that I mean the director as

well as the president United States I

don't want to get ahead of ourselves

here

I think what we have learned what has

been admitted and now what we see in

writing is about as damage you can

imagine it will be a decision for us

when we conclude our investigative work

whether to bring this or other matters

in the form of articles to a vote and

we'll cross that bridge when we come to

it but no one should have any illusions

about the seriousness of what is already

uncontested and that is the president

United States has betrayed his oath of

office and sacrificed our national

security in doing so and that I think is

quintessentially what the framers were

concerned about I think is

quintessentially what the framers

thought was the sum and substance of

what might warrant a president's removal

from office so I don't want to under

understate the significance of what's

already been revealed but I also don't

want to get too far ahead of ourselves

do you expect to hear from the

whistleblower as early as this week and

what more do you expect to learn from

him or her or from the full complaint

that you can't already glean from the

memo of this interaction between

President Trump and his Ukrainian

counterpart well I certainly hope to

hear from the whistleblower this week

and perhaps as soon as tomorrow after

the director testifies but that

whistleblower is trying to make sure

that that whistleblower is not subject

to any further retaliation and I say

further because the president has

already retaliated against him or her

retaliated by suggesting that the

whistleblower is disloyal to our country

maybe they're representing some other

country that they're a partisan hack

that they have some hidden bias so

there's already been retaliation by the

President and I would have thought and I

would have hoped that the Director of

National Intelligence would have spoken

out publicly in defense of his employee

or contractor that is someone reliant on

the director to protect them and so I

don't know whether it will happen

tomorrow or not I can tell you the

whistleblower I think is eager to come

and meet with our committee this is

already a month overdue at least a month

overdue and we are determined to make

sure that that whistleblower has an

opportunity what's more that no one is

sitting next to them trying to put a gag

on what they can say

I don't know what the timeline will look

like except that we all feel a sense of

urgency here the Inspector General and

this is by the way not contested in the

Department of Justice sham legal opinion

no one has taken issue with the fact

that this is urgent

now DOJ comes up with this completely

contorted rationalization that the

Director of National Intelligence has no

responsibility over foreign interference

in our elections which is completely

bogus but nevertheless they don't take

issue with the urgency here and I'm not

talking about the statutory definition

the fact that this needs immediate

attention so we need to get to the

bottom of this whistleblower complaint

ASAP

in terms of ultimately how long it's

going to take us to develop the full

facts I don't know I would not have

imagined things would have moved as

swiftly as they did over the last week

but the cascade of Admissions by the

president by Rudy Giuliani who now gives

a bizarre explanation that the State

Department was involved in urging him to

undertake these activities on behalf of

the President to investigate his rival

if he's being truthful there and

obviously that's a huge if there's a

whole separate scandal involving the

State Department which by the way there

probably has given the circumstances of

the firing of the u.s. ambassador to

Ukraine

but but I can't tell you what the

timeline looks like well you know I can

only say that we've heard nothing from

the White House and frankly the fact

that this is decision the White House is

making is a scandal if indeed the

president is the subject of the

whistleblower complaint the idea that

the president can control the subject of

complaint can control whether that

complaint ever gets to its intended

recipient that is the Congress is a

scandal

but nonetheless we've heard nothing

except through the media about White

House intentions in terms of the

directors intentions well yes I guess

we'll find out tomorrow I have to

imagine he's not eager to come before

our committee having still withheld the

complaint now that it's clear the

Department of Justice didn't even say

that he was prohibited from giving it to

us

that he is making that decision on his

own initiative I mean I find it

troubling enough that he would seek an

opinion that can be used as a pretext to

keep this from Congress and the director

understood the contents if it indeed

involves this conversation and just how

how scandalous and what a betrayal of

the president's oath of office that that

those notes not transcript but notes

reflect I can't imagine he's going to

want to come to our committee without

having provided that complaint but

frankly I can't imagine that the

director would have gone along with a

legal interpretation that says that he

has no responsibility over preventing a

foreign nation from interfering in our

election I I'm not going to discuss what

what repercussions will follow if

there's continuing obstruction of

Congress and continuing violation of the

law will make that decision when it

comes to thank you very much

you
