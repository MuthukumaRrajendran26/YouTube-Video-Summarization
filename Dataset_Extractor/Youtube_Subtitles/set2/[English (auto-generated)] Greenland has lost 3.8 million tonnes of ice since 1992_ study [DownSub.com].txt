you can look to Greenland to get an idea

of the urgency to address the climate

crisis this past summer asan historic

ice melt according to a new study by

nearly a hundred scientists from around

the world including Memorial University

in Newfoundland and Labrador Greenland's

ice is melting much faster than it was

three decades ago and as Ross Lord

explains the researchers predict sea

levels will rise even higher than

previously forecast scientists are

calling it the most complete assessment

of Greenland ice loss that's ever been

captured dozens of separate surveys

computed changes in ice mass using data

from 11 different satellite missions the

findings show Greenland has lost three

point eight trillion tonnes of ice since

1992 it says that's enough to push

global sea levels up by ten point six

millimeters the study says there's been

a sevenfold increase in ice loss within

three decades from 33 billion tons a

year in the 1990s to 254 billion tons a

year in the last ten years the

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

Change predicted global sea levels will

rise by 60 centimeters by the year 2100

putting 360 million people at risk of

coastal flooding every year the new

study sides with the IPCC's worst case

scenario a rise of an additional seven

centimeters troubling evidence for all

climate observers it's time for us to

wake up to the reality it's not it's not

going away and it's speeding up it's

gonna get worse this researcher says the

findings are especially worrisome for

coastal regions like Nova Scotia when we

looked at 2100 and said maybe you know

70 to 75 centimeters for Halifax no it's

gonna be a lot more than that because of

where we're at in fact it's going to be

a meter give or take a little bit others

suggest the Greenland study joins a

growing body of research that says

estimates of climate change impacts are

too conservative all the more reason

they say for communities and governments

to accelerate their planning for ways to

adapt Ross Laura Global News Halifax
