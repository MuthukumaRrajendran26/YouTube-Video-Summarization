we had successfully elected members

outside of Greater Montreal but had been

blanked here in Montreal so we made the

decision that it would be in the

interests of Greater Montreal to have a

representative at the cabinet table when

former conservative Prime Minister

Stephen Harper found himself short on

representation in Montreal he appointed

unelected senator Michael Fortier to

cabinet facing the loss of all four MPs

from Alberta and Saskatchewan Liberal

prime minister justin trudeau has

committed to representing the west this

is something that I take very seriously

as a responsibility to ensure that we

are moving forward in ways that benefit

all Canadians and I will be listening

and working with a broad range of people

to ensure that that happens but picking

a senator is not really an option for

Trudeau

he kicked Liberals out of caucus in the

Senate to make it non partisan Trudeau

could take a page from a former Liberal

prime ministers playbook Jean chr√©tien

wanted Quebec star power in his cabinet

after the 1995 referendum so he tapped

to unelected citizens Pierre Pettigrew

and Stephane Dion and he took them out

of Quebec society and placed him right

in his cabinet yeah they eventually got

seats in by-elections but they started

off as non parliamentarian sitting in

cabinet because he recognized he needed

those voices at the cabinet table Forte

says if Trudeau picks someone they

should be well known in western

provinces regardless of how this person

makes it into cabinet people will forget

that very quickly and say well she's

there she's our spokesperson and we want

to deal with her and former chief of

staff to a Conservative government house

leader

Yaroslav Moran says there's another

option available Trudeau could appoint

an advisory council with leadership from

Alberta and Saskatchewan making sure all

and gases at the table but buran says

the first order of business should be to

reach out to conservative premiers he

spent six weeks using them as punching

bags for political purposes or whatever

as politics enough now he's got to do a

u-turn on that the Prime Minister's

Office says Trudeau has spoken with all

premiere since election night on Monday

and he still has time to figure out his

next move

he plans to swear in his new cabinet

however it may look November 20th
