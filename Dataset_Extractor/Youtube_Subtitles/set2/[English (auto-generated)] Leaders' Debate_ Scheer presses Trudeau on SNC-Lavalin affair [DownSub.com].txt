start with conservative leader Andrew

Scheer you may pick any leader of your

choice and ask any question of your

choosing you have 30 seconds

mr. Trudeau you broke ethics laws twice

you interfered in an ongoing criminal

court proceeding you shut down

parliamentary investigations into your

corruption and you fired the only two

people in your caucus who are speaking

out against what you're trying to do

just for telling the truth tell me when

did you decide that the rules don't

apply to you Mr Shearer the role of a

prime minister is to stand up for

Canadians jobs to stand up for the

public interest and that's what I've

done and that's what I will continue to

do every single day the way I have

worked for Canadians is around investing

in them

unlike the vision that you're putting

forward of giving tax breaks that help

people who are making 400,000 K a year

four hundred thousand dollars a year

more than someone making $40,000 a year

you're offering a $50,000 tax break

which is more money than most Canadians

earn to the wealthiest Canadians with

your plan of course we don't entirely

know your plan because you haven't

released your costed platform yet which

i think is a disrespect to every

Canadian right for our cost of our our

our our platform came out weeks ago and

it is worked with that we worked with

the the the Parliamentary Budget Officer

and we have a vision but it is a

different vision than yours because

we're choosing to invest in people

you're choosing just like Doug Ford did

to hide your platform kit from Canadians

and deliver cuts and cuts to services

and cuts to taxes for the wealthy you

know you're making things up again half

of your platform isn't even costed you

are making announcements without any

details and without any numbers and you

aren't telling Canadians how you're

gonna pay if you're the one who are we

thinking your about taxes will go up

under your government if you are real I

mean lower you have to go for the middle

and raise the morale shifts 1% skin you

voted the Canadians in the eye and you

said that the allegations in The Globe

and Mail were false you said Jordy

Wilson rate they were to you you

said you never put pressure on her we

now know that those were all

lies you have failed to tell the truth

is association scam the responsibility

of any Prime Minister is a stand up for

jobs and win just as you would have done

out the CEO oh yeah I should seal

Avalons have you never threatened your

jobs or gonna go on and on are the

headquarters you are making that up

again ik what we have here as mr.

Trudeau Mr Shearer argue about who's

worse for Canada
