making their hack Hackett good afternoon

everyone and thank you all for attending

today my name is Kevin Hackett I'm the

assistant commissioner and criminal

operations officer in charge of federal

investigative services and organized

crime here in British Columbia as per

the commitment made six weeks ago I'm

here today to provide an overview of the

triple homicide investigation in

northern British Columbia and the

subsequent search for the accused

suspects from the time that we received

first the call about the suspicious

deaths of the two individuals south of

lier River Hot Springs on July 15th to

the day we located the two to see

suspects almost 3,000 kilometers away in

Manitoba 23 days later significant work

has been done to answer the many

questions that we the police the

families of the deceased and many

members of the pub

Mehcad over the course of the

investigation and search for the two

accused the BC RCMP dedicated a large

number of resources and specialized

units to this complex fast-moving

investigation they were up to 160 police

officers working extended shifts on this

investigation until the deceased

suspects were ultimately located the

RCMP received over 1500 tips from the

public through the dedicated phone tip

line reports the 911 call centers front

counter reports to police statutes and

Crimestoppers between July 16 2019 and

August 4 2019 19 judicial authorizations

were executed to further this

investigation an extensive amount of

CCTV video was collected during the

investigation and thousands of hours of

recordings were reviewed and analyzed

during the investigation a number of

partner agencies assisted the RCMP this

included American and Australian police

agencies as well the BC prosecution

service the Canada the Canadian Border

Services Agency the coroner services in

British Columbia and Manitoba

conservation officers search and rescue

in the Canadian military and we thank

them all we have taken the totality of

the investigative findings including a

review of the digital and physical

evidence statements tips and forensic

examination reports and have compiled a

public report that we are issuing today

while we have been able to gain greater

clarity on the movements in the actions

of the two accused we respect that the

answers have not reduced the trauma and

the grief experienced by the families of

Lukas Fowler

Chyna DS and Leonard dick we ensured

that the victims families were made

aware of the information that we would

be releasing publicly and we continue to

provide them with support we also

continues port families of the accused

the report does address a number of

areas and specifics in much greater

detail but I would like to highlight and

confirm the following mm-hmm

we uncovered no information that

predicted or forecasted that the

homicides took place in northern BC

there was no indication that these were

were planned or predicted based on the

firearms lab results crime scene

examination timelines of suspects and

suspect recorded admissions we believe

that no other suspects were responsible

for the three homicides or were involved

in any way the murders appear to be

random and crimes of opportunity with no

known motive

the investigative theory is that McLeod

and Miguel ski came across Lucas

Fowler's van and targeted Lucas Fowler

and Chyna DS for unknown reasons they

shot and killed the couple before

continuing up through to the Yukon the

two returned to BC days later because

they were having vehicle issues and came

across mr. Leonard dick outside of DS

Lake and shot and killed him the

suspects then burned their vehicle to

cover up evidence and delay police

before stealing mr. dicks vehicle money

and a number of other personal items

all of which facilitated further escape

ultimately towards Eastern Canada once

they reached Manitoba they burned the

stolen vehicle and attempted to continue

on food it is believed that McCloud shot

Miguel ski before shooting himself in a

suicide pact two rifles were found with

the deceased suspects these rifles were

examined by the Farms lab and were

determined to be the same weapons used

in the Fort Nelson and Dee's Lake

homicides as well as their own deaths

one of the two guns was determined to be

the same gun legally purchased by the

suspects at Cabela's outdoor equipment

store in Nanaimo on July 12th a digital

camera belonging to mr. dick was also

discovered

it contained six videos and three still

images in the videos the suspects took

responsibility for all three murders

they indicated no remorse for their

actions as well as their intentions to

potentially kill others they also

described their intent to commit suicide

and a wish to be cremated these videos

do not contain any information regarding

the motive behind their actions nor do

they provide specifics regarding the

murders while a number of additional

facts and findings are being released

today the RCMP has chosen not to release

the videos that we be that we've

recovered the RCMP Behavioral Analysis

Unit conducted a review of the videos

and was concerned with a behavior called

identification which is considered a

warning behavior in the context of

threat assessments the videos may

influence or aspire inspire other

individuals to carry out a targeted act

of violence essentially creating

copycats in their experience those who

commit mass casualty attacks or similar

acts of violence are heavily inspired by

previous attackers and their behaviors

as believed that the suspects may have

made the video recordings for notoriety

releasing them would not only be

disrespectful to the families of the

deceased who are also concerned about

the impact of the release but it could

sensationalize the actions of the

suspects by not releasing the videos we

want to mitigate the potential for other

individuals being inspired to commit

similar acts of violence for these

reasons the video will not the videos

will not be released by the RCMP I'd

like to thank our RCMP colleagues in

British Columbia Alberta Saskatchewan

Manitoba other law enforcement agencies

assisted us for all the support and

assistance in particular I'd like to

once again acknowledge the RCMP in

Manito

who led an exhaustive and challenging

search in that province I would also

like to thank the public whether it was

the hundreds of individuals who came

forward with information the individuals

businesses or agencies who assisted our

investigators on the ground in northern

BC and the other communities that were

directly impacted would also like to

acknowledge and thank the greater

Canadian public at large who showed

vigilance and patience as we work

diligently to advance this investigation

we know that this file has had impacts

provincially nationally as well as

internationally many many have been

affected but none more so than the

grieving father DS and dick families

we're hopeful that the release of the

public report and our investigative

findings provides greater clarity into

this investigation and subsequent search

reportedly clear as America your code

and arcade four-year-old appears on

solar fire in a rush

affects me FC it will take any questions

that you may have now starting we have

no no evidence that leads us to identify

what the motive was

if there was in fact a motive is gone

with with the accused

obviously we did not have an opportunity

to interview them which is is that that

opportunity at that time where we can

dig into trying to determine what a

motive was but nothing from our

investigation has helped us determine

what the motive was the fact that we had

the video was another opportunity for us

to learn a little bit more about a

potential motive and that did not help

us in that regard either

somewhat again for the reasons why I

don't want to to show the videos and

we've determined not to show the videos

but we're cold

matter of fact their attitude frankly

from from my observations was not

consistent with someone who was

responsible for the type of violence

offenses that they took responsibility

for and that's one of the reasons why we

just don't know and if it is we want to

earn the sight of caution because Public

Safety is absolutely the most important

thing for us and we would not want to

contribute to any other similar acts

yeah I mean you you've sat through about

an hour and a half very detailed

examination timelines of the

investigation and you saw that there was

some pivotal things happening with the

discovery of evidence and information on

July 22nd in particular and where that

transition comes from missing to suspect

it was very fluid and in any

investigation the the police especially

one like this where it's it's complex

it's evolving quickly there is the param

L the parallel need to gain evidence to

support arrest and charge that has to be

done appropriately so we can keep people

in custody of thought so it's warranted

and and have a a successful prosecution

balance with Public Safety we're talking

about several hours overnight from the

22nd to the 23rd when we went public to

to advise that they were now suspect

there was a danger and it's a judgement

call and it is a bit of a balance that

if we solicit the help or the assistance

from the public too quickly that we

could be inundated with potential red

herrings we were satisfied with the

information that we had the fact that we

were drawing in additional information

we needed our resources to be focused

within the law-enforcement community

where they were were trained and skilled

to respond with the information that

we're providing to our law enforcement

partners across the country that that

was the the decision that under all of

the circumstances totality of the

circumstances led us to make the

decision that we would focus on our

police resources looking for them and

then overnight and into the morning

following day is when we went with the

public and solicited their investigation

there their assist in the investigation

again we won't know specifically what

led them to to take their lives but the

examination of the scene and having an

opportunity view the video and speak

with investigators that have relayed the

the scene to me I think it speaks to the

the the work that was done to saturate

the area around Gilliam with police dogs

aircraft armed police officers trained

in searching for subjects like this that

were able to contain them to a certain

area that they were limited to have

access to on one side they had a very

fast-moving River extremely fast living

extremely fast-moving river that they

could not escape cross swim and to their

backs they had a very steep embankment

that they were able to traverse down but

could not get back up so for all intents

and purposes we believe that the

location that where they ended up

stopped them from mobility you know

affected their mobility

we're satisfied that there are no other

victims it is chilling it is one of the

things that I'm sure that that others

will determine these individuals true

intent and and how willing they were to

act on that we will never know

unfortunately or fortunately that it was

never to be realized we can't a question

that we just don't the answer to

in any homicide investigation especially

one that is in a remote area

remember the discovery of their bodies

happened at 7:23

it took three and a half hours from Fort

Fort Nelson police officers to arrive to

the scene an outdoor scene in a remote

area is a difficult one to examine to

get the facts sometimes a homicide scene

will take several days to go through

before you can definitively determine

what has happened there and these are

done meticulously with the intention of

securing small particles of forensic

evidence and until that's done in a in a

proper scientific method determination

about what has happened is is it's just

the normal way of doing police work

there was there was I think at least one

or two videos that were shot prior to

them getting to their final resting spot

while they were mobile

well I mean as serious as the fact that

they've taken responsibility for two

other you know very very three other

violent violent murders in whether or

not and where they where they believed

that they couldn't get out of the

position they were in with in with the

timing of the actual videos we don't

know because the the videos are not date

stamped so we don't know what that

continuum looks like there is no real

clear understanding of why they were

ultimately chosen if that's the word or

targeted or that became the victims

other than the fact that they were at

the side of the roadway would it have

been a different situation if they were

mobile perhaps but they were in a

position that made them likely more

vulnerable than others because they were

pulled off the side of the highway

into detail with the primary

investigator in the team commander not

opportunity a little while ago and I

don't want to misrepresent the I don't

know the details in any great in any

more detail than outlined in the report

that you have I'm sorry I just don't

have that in that detail well again not

not knowing exactly what's in the mind

of the individuals and whether it's some

type of a predetermined planned

escalation what we can say is that there

was that there was a there was a marked

difference in the amount of violence

that was used in in the in the Fowler

Dee's homicides and then the subsequent

killing and mr. dick right

I can't elaborate into much details the

the investigative team will have the

details in the content of the

discussions they had with the family but

I do know that you know the sus the

suspects as they were traveling had

regular contact with family members

providing updates about where they were

what they were doing what their

intentions were again all indicative of

the beginning when you consider that

they had no criminal record no at first

police contact or in regular contact

with the family that led us to the

belief that were young that they had

perhaps been victims themselves yes

that's correct

they did they did indicate to their

their family that they were having some

vehicle issues the primary evidence I

mean I'm not getting get into all the

evidence it's it's pretty well

articulated in that document but the

most significant piece obviously is is

the the weapons the the rounds being

fired the ballistic evidence and then

the seized obviously the fact that we've

recovered weapons that match the

ballistics of both crime scenes the fact

that the individuals were seen in a

vehicle matching mr. dicks vehicle

through the video again we we didn't

have an opportunity to confirm that

until we recovered the burnt vehicle and

examine the vehicle identification

number

good question

I mean and that's something I spoke of

last time is it when we have these

opportunities to to work through files

like this investigations liked it that

don't come across very often thank God

is we plan to look in the near future on

are there lessons learned what can we

cut what can we do differently we know

from this investigation early on because

of the remoteness of it and I think we

alluded to some of that in detail in the

previous technical briefing that you

know when you're trying to ferry up

investigators from the Lower Mainland or

from Prince George you know having

having them have communications

satellite phones computers that can work

because of the the remoteness are all

issues that we struggle with in remote

areas and every jurisdiction will

struggle with that so we'll look at ways

that we can we can ensure that we have

quick access to the tools which I'm not

saying we didn't in this case but it's

something that we will look at to

enhance the communication one of the

things here that we we know as the best

practices that we conducted regular

wellness checks with with our members to

ensure that you know being that far away

from from home and their usual workspace

we we ensured that we had resources that

could come in and provide relief so that

the momentum of the investigation did

not did not fall behind what was

required in something like this what

we're dealing with serious offenses so

those are all things that not a lesson

learned negatively but a lessons learned

to say well that was good and the

feedback from the critical incident

debrief that we've conducted has has

shown that that we need to continue to

do that to have the appropriate number

of resources for relief etc

have you got any on you you know again

it's very difficult as police officers

we follow the evidence we look at the

evidence we have investigative theories

but we always base the theory on the

evidence and this is one of these things

where we talk about a crime of

opportunity to all the factors come

together at a specific time the location

of the accused the location of our

victims and those crosses those lines

crossing and interjecting and this

appears to what we have happened here it

may be frankly more frustrating for the

public it's not uncommon in in law

enforcement or in the policing world and

in homicide investigations that the

motive sometimes is just not known and

that's that's part of it sometimes is

that we can guess what the motive was

sometimes we clearly know what the

motive is even when an accused tells us

what the mode of this that doesn't

necessarily always bear true I think

you'd rather stay away from that so if

you have questions and you want to call

into the teleconference please you can

do so it was on the media advisory thank

you very much we appreciate your coming

here today
