You all come to us young people for hope.
How dare you.

This is the new face of climate-change revolt.

She's young, she's bold and she is angry.

You have stolen my dreams 
and my childhood with your empty words.

...so angry that she has inspired people
across the planet to join her movement...

...especially other kids...all having the 
same message to grown-ups.

I will die of climate change!

The eyes of all future generations are upon you.

And if you choose to fail us, 
I say we will never forgive you.

But there's more than just anger 
driving the movement.

REPORTER: Are you scared?
STUDENT: For my future?

A little bit. Yeah.

I think I'm worried.

These are kids in Canada. 
They're learning not only about 
climate change and Greta's

movement but how they can be part of the solution, 
which seems to be important to

their parents, too. 
Climate change is now up there 
in the top election issues

with health care and affordability.

So we decided to put their brainstorming to the test.

We asked them...

Can I have a moment to think?
REPORTER: Yes!

If I were prime minister, I would try and 
meet the Paris Agreement

and try and create more eco-friendly jobs
such as just planting trees.

I would use fossil fuels less and maybe

work towards using more renewable 
sources of energy like solar panels.

If I was prime minister, 
I'd probably aim at companies...

...to be more strict in business places 
to have more recycling

bins in schools or in businesses or like buildings.

It's an important issue because a lot of things 
are going to change if we don't do

something about it right now.

Although these kids are years away
from being able to vote or run for office,

they do have a message 
for Canada's next prime minister.

I will be affected by it. 
People I know will be affected by it.

Maybe even my parents...
they might be affected by it.

I don't want to see that happening.
