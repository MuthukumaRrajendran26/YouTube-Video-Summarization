Michael grant reports enough how is your

feeling going into training camp 2019-20

compared to this time he requested very

different I think last year I think well

we did this press conference I think I

was sitting with Hawaiian Danny I'm

sitting all alone no no it's our more

excited we're excited about our season

and obviously Hawaii decided to go to to

play with the Clippers and I team I

thought why excited about young players

veteran players and you you continue to

build in this league and I know this

question is coming outside of the back

you know that I can't sit here and trade

tomorrow and then Hawaii leaves us and

we upset because that's just that's just

the nature of the business and we

understand it and we move on as an

organization and I think there are many

bright spots with our team whether it's

our veteran players whether it's our

players coming up and the younger group

that was developing were always going to

be a developing team I think we can see

that with a scarf read norm these young

guys that we've developed so we go in

confident about who we are as a team

were excited about the flexibility that

we're going to have in the future

picks young players and when we go to go

from there

the ciphers are the Toronto Star given

how you're coming off a championship

season and given how you gloss they're

quite as I said what do you consider to

be realistic expectations for this team

going forward and looking at this season

with big decisions potentially on

whether you keep expiring contracts

remove them what do you want to get out

of this season going into the end of the

year

first of all you know I think the

expectations always in sports is to win

we play sports to win there's nothing

else to all the dance we want say

whatever we want

rebuild love of anything you do you play

sports to win it's that simple

and love playing to win you build from

there

you see how your team reacts I think

guys are going to step up I think guys

are up for the challenge and for me the

all the focus always on our team is

always going to be winning we said this

from the beginning when we got here and

we believe in that that this team will

win and I think it rests on my shoulders

to adjust whenever we need to adjust

this team to prepare us for what's

coming in the future

as I done Smith the Toronto Star um we

saw a huge jump from Pascal last year

who do you expect or hope to get that

kind of incremental increase from this

year I think I think Pascal will make

another jump I think I think Freddie's I

think is really coming he showed some

really good leadership in the summer

with development and then I

oh gee had a very unlucky year I think

last year and he's had a very good

summer and pre pre season in in terms of

just training before before today what

we're excited about that more excited

about and chris boucher all the young

players might think like Nick nurse and

coaching staff really do a great job of

taking advantage of the summer and what

how these guys develop and whether it's

physically or skill wise and emphasis on

shooting which I think Nick is very big

on so most of the all of the young guys

were very excited about Pat Macau he had

a little bit of an unlucky year - last

year both of those guys had unfortunate

deaths in their families and and then

very untimely injuries right when they

were on the cusp of gain into

contributing to this team so there's a

refresh on their minds and I think

they'll be in a good place

second row in the middle there by Ryan

McNeal Atholton filter get some time in

Africa this summer mean think back on

your time in Africa this summer were

some Isis to kill for you it was I there

was really a really really unbelievable

journey to go and to visit eight

countries on the continent but I think

the two biggest ones we're going back to

where I grew up the basketball court

that I grew up I think that just to see

people there and and how I how I grew up

and to see where I am and where my

family is today that was that was really

amazing for me to go to Mogadishu I

think was once and Juba in South Sudan

those that was that was really cool to

go that was I was awesome to go and see

those people those people and how they

live and their culture and I try and

give give back a little bit as I

remember that for the rest of my life

and I will go back to those places

Miriam from CBC Hozuki nada do you

expect your guys to be mentors to the

younger newer guys and if so how do you

expect them to be those mentors to them

well I think Kyle surgeon castle really

really showed maturity in the playoffs

last year the rollercoaster that this

this game can bring is is incredible and

I thought those guys showed unbelievable

composure as veteran players and I think

is going to transfer into into this year

you saw the contributions from from all

of them and you saw the camaraderie

between all the players on our team all

the young players look up to these guys

and it's been a journey it is it's come

from experience it's come from spending

time together it's come from trust when

I think I'll mark and Serge have built

that and I think that's one of the

things that makes this team unique that

you speak to them in the summer and

there were times when we were low and

those veteran players where they will

always come they were always confident

and reassuring for the young players

which we really appreciate

as an organization and even as a team

air cream

way back into your left side do you

Bruce asked about the expiring contracts

you might have to make a decision on at

some point in the air do you view Kyle's

situation as any different than anybody

else's just because of sort of his

history with the franchise and what he's

meant over the years no question no

question I think kinda has a incredible

legacy here that I think we all have

underrated I think we've we've had our

ups and downs and bumps and grinds you

know but the inner core of who is as a

player and what he's done in this on his

franchise you know he he definitely

deserves that I think there's there's

legacy status for him in my opinion

somebody does giving it his all

five-time all-star well while we've been

here I think that we could have been a

six-time all-star that first one was a

close shave and we were all disappointed

I remember exactly where I was when when

we when we heard but everything he's

given you know we can say what we want

about Kyle you know he comes and he

gives it his all on on the court and it

would give me a headache once once a

month but that's fine you know like

that's that's our relationship and I

really respect him for that and will

always pay column I think that respect

what he's done for this city for this

ballclub I think is is is remarkable you

all know while sitting here as many of

you here we all know we sat down here

six years ago and we will never write

this script this way in any way any form

of dreams or anything and this is where

it is

I'm proud of him for that in the side

miles Victor CBC sports what do you see

in Pascal that could help him to become

the number one guy he's just become a

diverse player that I think a very

dynamic player that continues to grow

he's gonna have more on his shoulders I

think this year and I think he accepts

that he knows that there is a

responsibility and he's up for the

challenge I think every day we've seen

his game continue to grow and grow and

you have ups and downs and this season

is I think is a good season for him to

to actually grow as a as a player to

potentially get to where we all feel he

can be as a player which I think you

know could be one of the best players in

the league down front into your left

side

there was a lot of movement around the

NBA this summer how would you assess the

contenders to the title that you guys

currently hold who do see if the team's

coming to try and take it away there's a

lot of parody in the league I think by

that's a I think it's a good thing for

for the league lots of teams I think if

you say who's going to come out of the

East I think it's a question I think for

the first time it's a question who is

going to win the NBA championship I

don't think anybody knows I don't think

anybody knows who is going to come out

of the West there are very very strong

teams there and there's good balance

good balance of the players I think

unfortunately with the injuries of Kevin

Durant and and klay Thompson those those

guys are like big-time players but I'm

sure they will be back strong but the

balance of the league I think is is

great and it will be interesting to see

I think people pay attention to more

games this year and then we have been in

the past few years

I was just wondering are there any

players right now in the league that you

have your eyes on can we expect any

surprises this season in terms of

someone you might want to bring on I

can't talk about that publicly we are

always looking everywhere for players

and I can't be giving away no secrets

now mm-hmm

Thank You Emma sighs Scott from CTV News

normally when a team wins a championship

it's a big deal for a city and its fans

obviously last year what you guys did

was big for the country and beyond was

there a moment over the summer where you

realized the enormity of what you and

the team achieved it's really a good

question because I haven't watched

anything I haven't I wouldn't seen

anything I wouldn't rewatched anything

but I would say this my parents are in

town for for their checkups and they

were at the house and they were watching

the parade my wife and the kids and I

was doing stuff around and and then they

watched the highlights kind of the story

the journey on one of the channels of

you I don't know whether it was YouTube

or something and uh I was walking past

and I watched it I stood and watched for

a couple minutes and honestly it just

brought back an incredible feeling you

know like and I can wait

maybe to one day just locked myself in

the basement or something and and watch

it all but I haven't even it the summer

has been so fast and just to see you

know you see those highlights and you

see those guys like sweating and and

Pumpkin Fest and and being so tough and

I actually looked at the screen for that

second and I said to myself I was I was

incredible

no no that was really incredible then

sometimes I I beat I beat myself up for

not really

maybe enjoying it as much and during the

journey but in our positions honestly

you can't

Hey well Yahoo Sports Canada

you mentioned Pascal potentially taking

another leap this coming year how does

that factor into a potential contract

negotiation

an extension we've had conversations

we've had conversations with Pascal's

representation and more excited more

excited whether it's going to be this

fall or whether it's going to be in the

summer is somebody y definitely going to

keep for a long time here and we see we

see what the potential of that could be

so where we've had conversations with

them and we'll see where that takes us

thanks very much everybody

thank you thank you
