food is full of feeling and memories for

chef Tina's Miller and Thomas Norton TN

Banach is more than just a restaurant

it's where the past meets the present

when you say to a friend

let's go for tea and Vanek that means

you're going to sit down like this and

chat

I think the inspiration of this

unbeknownst to me would have been

started back in the 80s sitting in a log

cabin years later we came to Toronto and

we were thinking what could we do that

would be useful and so this came to my

mind just like that

[Music]

in general for people who have never

experienced indigenous cuisine how would

you describe it kind of laid-back

cuisine I mean there's nothing really

spicy but if we let the flavors of the

individual food items come through how

much of you know your childhood and what

you grew up with influenced what goes on

the menu the the experience behind being

able to cook indigenous food is

something that is a new experience for

me I am what you would call one who

walks in both worlds in that I'm part of

the 60 scoop so I've had to catch up

with a lot of my own heritage it's been

a struggle but you know if I have

managed it and to be working here is

it's kind of like you know come full

circle

[Music]

we have Navajo Indian taco wild rice

comes from Manitoba arctic char is

wild-caught from Nunavut what what do

you want people who are hearing about

indigenous food for the first time what

do you want them to know I'd like to

have them experience it and pick up a

little history

I think reconciliation really happens

when you sit down at the table once you

can do that then then you're on the way
