after an icy encounter at a reluctantly

arranged meeting with Turkey's president

the US vice president claimed to have

reached a deal

a week after Turkish forces crossed into

Syria turkey in the United States of

America have agreed to a cease-fire

turkey immediately denied any ceasefire

agreement but says it will give the

Kurds in northern Syria five days to

leave their homes an estimated 150,000

Kurds have already been displaced

ultimately Turkey will gain control of

the territory it wants free of the Kurds

it considers terrorists the Kurds were a

key US ally in the fight against the

so-called Islamic state we've gotten

everything we could have ever dreamed of

back in the u.s. President Trump tried

to take credit for the agreement even

though it was his decision to abandon

the Kurds at Turkey's request that

triggered the crisis the Kurds were

great great day for the Kurds it's

really a great day for civilization

Trump's original decision to withdraw US

forces left the Kurds open to a

slaughter seeming to realize what he had

done

Trump wrote an extraordinary letter to

Turkish president air Dewan imploring

him let's work out a good deal don't be

a tough guy don't be a fool air Dewan

reportedly threw the letter in the trash

Kurdish forces say they will accept the

ceasefire turkey walks away with

everything it wanted while the US

remains shut out of the territory it

abandoned just one week ago
