we have alarming new details tonight

about dangerous lead levels in drinking

water in some Canadian cities Global

News was part of an investigation that

tested drinking water in hundreds of

homes across the country and found some

people are being exposed to dangerously

high lead levels

it's leaching from aging pipes and many

Canadians are completely unaware of the

risk the investigation resulted in the

largest collection of data of its kind

in this country in part one of our

series Heather Eurex West explains what

was found and how concerning it is for

years Liana Peterson and her son drank

water straight from the tap the prince

rupert mother says she always believed

it was safe for her family

the only testing that was done was done

by the journalist that came up here to

do the story Peterson had no idea her

family had been consuming lead at levels

more than three times what health canada

considers safe her water was first

tested in December as part of a

year-long investigation journalists from

nine universities and ten media

organizations including Global News and

the Institute of investigative

journalism knocked on doors and cities

and towns across the country of the 260

homes tested 39 percent had lead levels

exceeding 5 parts per billion the

maximum lead level deemed safe for

consumption by Health Canada oh my lord

it's too high that's a lot that's way

above the guidelines that's a big

difference from what the city gave us

the investigation also analyzed 12,000

municipal tests from 11 Canadian cities

most of which had to be accessed through

Freedom of Information requests one in

three exceeded Canadian safety standards

18% were at least three times the limit

yes we have this right across Canada

because of the absence of regulation to

push the numbers down in these houses

with led service lines we have elevated

lead in 2015 a tainted water crisis in

Flint Michigan made international

headlines the water there had been

contaminated by bacteria as well as lead

but when comparing lead levels alone

some Canadian cities including Montreal

Regina

Saskatoon and Prince Rupert Arkan

spick you ously similar though Prince

Rupert health officials say that because

the city has no lead service lines the

problem is not system-wide like it was

in Flint but due to corroding lead

sources with an older Prince Rupert

Holmes that exposure can be harmful for

all of us but children are particularly

vulnerable children exposed to lead will

have higher rates of heart disease

hypertension cardiovascular disease

early dementia gout anemia I mean the

list goes on it's why dr. hanna-attisha

believes parents need to know if their

children are being exposed but let

testing data in Canada is rarely made

public and in many Canadian

Municipalities

lead testing isn't even required even

though led service lines continue to

supply water to hundreds of thousands of

Canadian residents in many parts of the

country let's not forget that throughout

the years you know science has evolved

even like what governments are deciding

to do evolve in response to this

investigation materials Mayor has

promised immediate change lead-lined

pipes in that city will be replaced and

a searchable database containing lead

testing data will soon be available to

residents online but those changes won't

immediately apply to people like Leona

Peterson and her son who have no choice

but to get their water from other

sources until governments take action to

ensure what comes out of the tap is safe

for everyone how about your ex West

Global News Calgary apart from lead

levels there are plenty of places across

this country that don't have access to

safe clean drinking water

many of them are First Nations

communities the Canadian government says

it hopes to lift all long-term drinking

water advisories on reserves by 2021

since November of 2015

87 have been lifted 57 still remain in

place across the country most of them in

Ontario that's also where Canada's

longest boil water advisory has been in

place since 1995 it's expected to end

next month
