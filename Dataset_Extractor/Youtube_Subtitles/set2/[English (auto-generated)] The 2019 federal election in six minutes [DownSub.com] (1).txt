after a 40-day campaign that has had

some highs and let's face it quite a few

lows it is time to see how Canadians

voted we have our first result in this

is from Newfoundland and Labrador you'll

correct me if I'm wrong because you know

all of these writings a conservative in

the lead the Liberals planning a victory

party hey Mike did you say that they

drove the bus into the room there is

that whatever ID you say yeah yeah I'm

not kidding you I'm not kidding you

enough that they drove Andrew shoes yeah

I mean it's it's just what just to my my

right over here I mean it look it's

there it is if jug meets Singh in

hindsight had known that he was gonna

pull so low in Quebec you think he would

have managed to get back a little bit

differently I can't be the only one

wishing but I wish he would I gone in

with a flamethrower Global News is now

projecting a minority government a

minority government now we're not saying

liberal conservative and Mercedes David

that's because we just don't know at

this point the block and we said this

all night before upsetting the electoral

geography that certainly the Liberals

were counting on to sustain their

majority and maybe upsetting some

electoral geography for conservatives

and for New Democrats really playing

spoiler here Global News is now

projecting a liberal minority government

[Music]

the crowd is quite excited about that

call of a liberal or liberal government

that's what they're excited about here

the crowd is getting bigger now I'll be

honest with you I haven't heard a cheer

in this room in the last 10 minutes it

has been the air has been completely

sucked out of this room

Jane Philpott was and she is in fourth I

present you Alberta and I'm standing in

front of it here it is look at that it

is solid blue what is this going to mean

for the country at this stage I sense he

didn't touch him this whole idea of

feminism and people questioning whether

it was a feminist that didn't seem to

touch a brown place blackface happen the

two planes thing happened and now we're

projecting a liberal minority is Justin

Trudeau made of

fly what clearly happened to me is that

as far as I can see is that the NDP

didn't show up Maxime Bernier is going

to be nowhere to be seen and the

People's Party of Canada we can stick a

fork in it that to me is positive no

matter where you are in the political

spectrum I'm thrilled to see it it's

only the beginning for the People's

Party we want to bring you some news

about Elizabeth May speaking of green

she has been elected to toe baku north i

don't know how kirsty Duncan does it but

she gets elected every time in Etobicoke

north which just happens to be Doug

Ford's riding provincially this was a

huge upset I agree a great campaign and

obviously the writing has changed and

that's okay the people of Milton have

spoken the voter is never incorrect they

always get it right another defeat a

very prominent politician this time a

liberal Ralph Goodell has been defeated

in Regina was gonna throw a lot of

Canadians who tonight are not going to

be happy that how they voted is not

being reflected and who's actually

governing and that comes back to that

whole issue of electoral reform for

Justin Trudeau something he didn't

follow through on because one of the big

complaints and it ironically came more

from the progressives than from the

Conservatives but maybe we'll see that

change tonight the votes were not

accurately represented who's the last

one is the the barbarian hotline

it was the flirting with Islamophobia I

don't even like to discuss it because it

sickens me party that I supported for a

number of years turned on my neighbors

on my brothers my sisters my fellow

Canadians and that's been sorry it's

been difficult see blood come out that

is and you're looking at 32 seats

leading and elected there as he walks

into this room obviously a big victory

for him there's no intensive former

government nor indeed to participate in

a government

blow everyone the bloc québécois

can on a case-by-case basis work with

any government

holy-moly

I want you to know this is always gonna

be our focus when we get back to Ottawa

every single day that we're in

Parliament New Democrats are going to be

working hard to make sure your life is

better so the Canadians life is better

now first and foremost I want to thank

the voters of Regina Capel for once

again electing me as your Member of

Parliament we're all mystified here

because Justin Trudeau has walked up on

the stage and begun to speak at the same

time as Andrew Shearer leaving all of us

wondering who we should listen to and

we've decided simply because Justin

Trudeau 155 seats so more than the

Conservatives we're gonna listen to him

but really this is unprecedented and I

can tell you everyone in this studio is

shocked let's listen to Justin Trudeau I

have heard you my friends you are

sending our liberal team back to work

back to Ottawa with a clear mandate we

will make life more affordable we will

continue to fight climate change we will

get guns off our streets and we will

keep investing in

tonight conservatives have put Justin

Trudeau on notice and mr. Trudeau when

your government Falls conservatives will

be ready and we will win the good news

is Andrew Shearer owes me 50 bucks we we

made a small wager at the end of the

english-language debate in which I

suggested that he wasn't going to be

Prime Minister that turned out to be

prescient it does point to a divided

country this is what we were talking

about from the beginning of the night we

have this popular vote that's different

we have these these look at the seat

count public mood is not good nobody is

going to be happy with this result

tonight all right

well thanks to all of you thanks to all

our viewers and our listeners on radio

everyone and watch this online if you

stuck with us to the bitter end I give

you some applause because thank you it's

been a long seven hours
