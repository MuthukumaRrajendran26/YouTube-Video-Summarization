good morning everyone it is 7:30 3:00 in

the morning you are looking at a live

shot from our global one news helicopter

of Walter dill bridge massive traffic

problems this morning for motorists

trying to get into the downtown core by

Walter Dale bridge a group of climate

activists have shut down the bridge to

traffic that is where are Kendra's

agofsky is she joins us now live this

morning with more

Kendra there have we've seen some very

angry people there this morning yeah

that's right Erin and the group of

protesters stepped on - Walter Dale

bridge just before 7 o'clock this

morning and traffic has been back since

then people are getting upset police

have just arrived on scene and and many

of the commuters who made their way out

of their vehicles because they can't go

anywhere are yelling at police demanding

to know why they are not arresting the

people that are blocking the bridge

they've been begging the protesters to

at least open up one lane of traffic so

people can start funneling through but

these protesters that are part of a

group called extinction rebellion have

not been budging they have been standing

arm in arm here blocking the entire

bridge so nobody could get into the

downtown core you can see here things

are getting heated

[Music]

Michael one-lane I asked you and you

know it

I'll run through everybody and you know

moments earlier we had one man come

straight up to these protesters

screaming at them yelling I have a baby

to feed I need to get to work I'm losing

hours I'm losing pay begging them to let

him through so he can get down to his

work again people are frustrated they

are at a standstill

it is gridlock for kilometres down here

Kendra this is a protest that we're

seeing happen right around the world -

it's not just here in Edmonton that's

right it's an international movement

we've seen it in in Sydney Australia

we've seen it in the UK in London and

even it started out east in Halifax and

earlier this morning there were a row of

bikes that were stationed up here people

were so frustrated they actually grabbed

the bikes threw them over the guardrail

saying these don't belong here either of

course they can't do that with the boat

or the people standing here but tension

is rising people are threatening to use

violence if they have to but so far

luckily we haven't seen anything like

that

police as I mentioned just arriving from

the other side of the bridge we hear

sirens and people have been sitting here

laying on the horns and we've heard from

people yelling what if there is a

medical emergency what if somebody's

having a heart attack in this line and

they can't get through so they are

trying to negotiate police are telling

these frustrated commuters that they are

working with them trying to negotiate

and get a lane open but that hasn't

happened yet and people are angry they

need to get down to work but again the

the climate activists say they have to

do this to send

message but I've been talking to some

people who've been sitting at a

standstill they say this is not helping

the cause we have all these vehicles

idling and it is not helping they're not

making any friends but the people here

say they are sending a message

and obviously that message is being

broadcast and it's affecting a lot of

people trying to get downtown this

morning Erin yeah it is right well

hopefully it remains a peaceful protest

thank you so much Kendra we will check

back in with you shortly
