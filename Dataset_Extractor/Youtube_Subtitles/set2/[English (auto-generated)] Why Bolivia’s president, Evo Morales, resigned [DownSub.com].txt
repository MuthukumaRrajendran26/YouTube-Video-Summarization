weeks of mass protests and pressures

from the military has led Bolivia's

President Evo Morales to resign these

protests started after Morales was

reelected on October 20th with just

enough votes to avoid a runoff against

his opposition but Bolivians questioned

the authenticity of the election in

order to avoid a runoff he had to get

10% higher than the next candidate and

when it looked like he wasn't going to

get that 10% apparently they shut down

the computers and then when the

computers were we're revved up again he

all of a sudden was he had the 10% or

higher so he could avoid a runoff the

Organization of American States was

called to investigate they found

significant irregularities and called

for another election which Morales had

accepted but the disruptions from the

protests had a breaking point military

chief general Williams kay Lehmann asked

Morales to quit Morales the first

indigenous president of Bolivia was in

power for 14 years he ran into trouble

was the fact that he wrote he overrode

the Constitution and ran again and there

was a referendum that and and people

didn't want him running again I mean

they they they thought it was time for a

new leader to come to take his place so

it is possible had he not overridden the

Constitution and had he had he not

decided to run again that perhaps his

movement would have retained a

significantly higher basis of support

and Morales wasn't the only one to

resign his vice president and the Senate

president the only other official listed

as a successor resigned as well it

probably would be more stabilizing if

not everybody at the top had resigned or

not such a large number had resigned

that that's a little worrisome because

you wonder what kind of transitions

alliance is going to be occurring it's

unclear who will succeed Morales or how

his successor will be chosen
