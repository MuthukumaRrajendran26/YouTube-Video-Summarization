very interested in today I'd like to

first of all introduce myself my name is

Brian Rothenberg I'm the director of

public relations for the United Auto

Workers

we just finished a meeting of the UAW GM

council I believe most of you have

gotten some of the highlights that we

have put out today you will be receiving

a press release shortly that the UAW GM

council has voted to recommend for

ratification the contract however they

have also recommended that we remain on

the strike line until the vote on

ratification ratification meetings will

start on Saturday and they are expected

to have their ballots turned in on a

week from Friday or eight days from now

so I need to first of all on behalf of

the UAW think I thank our UAW GM members

and their families who have put in

overwhelmingly sacrifice they have made

an incredible effort at showing what

union is they have stood on the lines

together because they stood up for

things that they felt were important and

continue to do so their leaders are

incredibly grateful I can tell you that

from the meeting and incredibly

profoundly impacted by the overwhelming

support of the community of the

different cities that we are in of this

nation

this strike actually became more than

just a strike for the UAW it was about

the hearts and minds of American workers

in the middle class it was an outpouring

of support that I think president Jones

and vice president did it said they will

never ever forget it was that profound

and we thank people for all the goods

and services that they've given us their

friends and their neighbors for the

outpouring of support as you know we

went on strike over the issues of a path

to permanency for temporary workers job

security fair wages affordable quality

health care and a fair share of the

profits I will go through some of the

highlights that you already have seen

that are on UAW org the contract gives

full-time temporary workers a shortened

path to permanent status and into a

regular status of a job and improves

their paid and unpaid time off for

temporary workers we would hope that

this contract wants our members weigh in

and they are the ultimate authority but

regardless of what this contract ends up

that this issue dealing with permanent

temporary workers is the beginning of

the end of perm attempts not only in

this industry but in this nation there

will be no change to the health care

plan there will be a ratification bonus

of $11,000 for hourly workers and a

ratification bonus of $11,000 for

salaried workers the cap has been lifted

on profit-sharing many of you know that

GM has made 34 billion dollars in

profits over the past three years one of

those years they exceeded 12 billion

dollars in profits and

they were capped so our members could

not share in those profits above twelve

billion dollars

it adds money to their personal savings

of a thousand dollars it provides a

program for all current workers to

$32.32 in four years it shortens the

progression time and all of the current

employees that are regular employees

would be at 3232 it provides wage

increases of three three percent gross

wage increase two years and four percent

lump sums the skilled trades will get a

thousand-dollar tooling allowance the

legal services benefit plan now includes

spouses and additional services vacation

has been enhanced many of our members

would be forced to use what little

vacation they had when they started two

weeks during the shutdown in July they

will now only have one week and they

will have the option with the other time

to use it or go on layoffs where they

can get unemployment and there are

bonuses built in to this contract for

eligible production workers up to 2,000

who retire between December 31st of this

year and February 28th of 2020 so I will

take a few questions at this point in

time I want to emphasize that as you saw

today that UAW is a democratic union our

members will make this decision the

members of General Motors that is the

commitment of Vice President Dennis and

president Jones and that is what will

happen

and understand that it is their contract

it is in their hands and the decision

has been made that they will stay out

until the ratification day and that came

directly from the leadership body

downstairs one other issue while we were

in our meeting today Aramark hit a TA

tentative agreement as usual where

there's an educational session and

there's a boat or will there be

education sessions and boats there's

education sessions that are being

scheduled around the country they start

in the regions that it will also be in

each of the locals the local unions help

set that up and help set up the election

times those are all run by the local

unions and the instruction will be in a

letter that you'll probably see I'm sure

it'll be on Facebook because everything

is these days but I believe there will

be an instruction going out to all the

local unions later today and it will

explain to the local unions how the

process should go and and the one thing

that it will outline is that we with all

the votes and by the 25th so it's an

eight-day vote yes sir

I will have to check on that what I

would say is that this this period

allows for the current temporary workers

it allows most temporary workers to move

up at or out I believe there's it's

almost life-changing for some in the

first year they're gonna move up

directly and then they would also as

they move up in this progression to

become permanent employees they get

credit for their time served the one

issue I would also point out by the way

is that there's a provision that you'll

see in there that that you know has a

30-day provision because there has to be

consecutive days but you do have 30 days

that if you're off or something like

that that it doesn't count toward that I

believe that we've seen that our members

do incredible things I think our members

are incredibly tuned in to this contract

and I don't think that will be a problem

getting in to vote on this contract I'm

sorry although all of our workers will

remain on strike until the ratification

I will say this as you will see in the

highlights we remain strongly opposed to

the decision to unallocated these plants

will continue to make our effort to

fight for these jobs in America I think

our national negotiators and all of us

did everything they could I think that

you will see that we tried to do our

best when we realize the situation for

the workers in those plants by the

assistance package we were able to

negotiate and because the unions exist

we were able to do that I think that

most of our members understand and all

of our leaders understand the reluctance

of what happened and I'm from Ohio I

understand it I'm from around the

valleys I'm gonna take a couple more but

it's basically just sticking to the the

topics that we have in the contract

well some of these aren't even in this

contract or subject to this contract for

instance the battery plant that you've

written about and the stuff about

Lordstown if it even happens all that is

not necessarily in this contract so I'll

leave it at that you know I'm gonna

stick to what's in the contract and

what's in our highlights or today it

takes two people to negotiate I'll just

leave it at that I think everybody

understands how serious that issue is

well I think the structure of it has

changed a little bit too so you know I

mean the problem is not everything is in

here in this contract so I'll leave it

at that

in the highlighter we specifically

talked about product in the highlighter

it's right here on we talked about the

product issue so I they're the locals

we'll set that up I do not because I was

in the GM meeting so I don't know the

details and that's why I sip it and

that's why Vice President did us is not

here right now the local leaders made

the decision that they felt strongly

that they should stay out until the vote

I can't speak for the local leaders

other than tell you they felt strongly

that it was important to them and their

members that they have the opportunity

to vote and make this decision all right

yeah surgeon

Drimmer you don't like to try honey jobs

is that will that be what else is the

company

so as I discussed Jim its some of these

things are not in this contract so I'm

sticking to what's in the contract

that's one of the issues that we have

here but I just want to make it very

clear that I mean you've all read on it

what the investments are it's it's we're

in a different situation here where you

have some things that are not subject to

the master agreement

so with that I'm going to go if you've

ever been in a UAW meeting it's very

democratic and everybody wanted their

chance to talk

Aramark workers right now have hit a tee

a I've got a double check on that but I

believe that they do not have to cross

the picket line so they will probably

remain out usually does not take long

correct it does then next Friday that's

my understanding yes I would wait for I

would wait for Terry's letter it will

instruct the locals and I'm sure you'll

see it on Facebook on how to how to get

these no I'm telling you that no I'm

telling you I'm telling you that some of

these are not subject to the national

agreement because they're not part of

the GM agreement they're up there

they're part of these

well I I will get you more information

on it I have just been in a marathon

meeting myself I will get you more

information on that investment in due

time I think it's up to the members I

would never speak for the members you

know I think that there are days again I

will get you more information and I'm

here to answer what's in the actual

agreement that is here

the best where is this

well I you know look I told you I would

get back to you all on it I will get

back to you on it when we have that

listed out I will tell you that our

folks have been working diligently they

were up all night so but I will also

tell you that some of these investments

are not under the master contract okay I

will let them work that out I believe

they do not have to cross the picket

line so I would anticipate that they

don't have one yet because they just hit

it to you all right thank you
