winds clocked in at almost 200

kilometers an hour neighborhoods

underwater hurricane durian has simply

been battering the Bahamas expected to

move dangerously close to Florida and

all along the u.s. East Coast from

Florida to the Carolinas millions of

people have their eyes on the storm of

course stocking up and really packing up

Jackson proseccos in Daytona Beach with

more on the preparations there

but first Jackson let's talk about the

situation in the Bahamas we saw the

images just how bad was that country hit

yeah good morning to you Antony an

absolutely devastating situation there

to have a category 5 hurricane stalled

over them for several days now it has

been downgraded to a category 3 but the

point is that storm is simply not moving

its forward motion 0 km/h is completely

stationary over the Bahamas delivering

devastating storm surge delivering

really an absolutely apocalyptic scene

they're flattening homes and stripping

trees right down to their bark at least

five deaths now confirmed in the islands

there and the situation not improving

anytime soon because that storm does

remain stalled there so Anthony really a

watching and waiting game before aid can

start to move into that area it's going

to be quite a while and an incredibly

long recovery so let's talk about where

you are right now some of the winds

picking up but what's expected

yeah that's the big question for

residents up and down the coast of

Florida Georgia and the Carolinas this

morning you can look out and see the

waves rolling in the wind has picked up

here but really they're waiting for

Dorian to move off of the Bahamas and

see how long it takes to make its march

up the clothed coast and just how close

it actually gets that's going to

determine what the unsure impacts look

like there are mandatory evacuation

orders now in effect both for places

along the Florida coast including where

I am right now and up to Georgia and the

Carolinas where the interstates have

been reversed we are talking about still

receiving some hurricane or at least

tropical storm force winds on shore but

really it's a matter of how close that

storm gets it seems like the impacts may

be diminishing not as bad as first

feared people here have had plenty of

time to prepare and gather supplies and

anthony worth mentioning that most of

the airports in this part of florida

remain closed today resulting in

thousands of flight cancellations but

that's really the almost the even more

dangerous situation because it's so

difficult to predict isn't it the fact

that it's hovered for so long and what

could happen from this point

that's right and they don't want people

here to get complacent because the final

track is still not firmed up and even

without landfall we're talking about a

storm surge in this area for example of

up to two meters high and wind gusts

well over a hundred and ten hundred and

twenty kilometers per hour so lots for

people here still to watch out for the

threat of serious power outages remains

in play up and down the coast of Florida

Georgia and the Carolinas the bottom

line is they want people to be vigilant

until the storm has passed

just keep very close eye Jaxson Prosecco

in Daytona Beach thank you so much

obviously stay safe and we'll touch base

the moment we can all right thank you so

much
