there is a story just breaking in Time

magazine it says that Justin Trudeau

wore brown face back in 2001 at an

Arabian Nights party when he was

teaching at a private school the Prime

Minister's office has confirmed that

this was mr. Trudeau in the photo they

say it was an arabian night and it was

back in 2001 before he was prime

minister before he was a politician I'm

wondering what you think about this what

your initial reaction is this story in

time well it's troubling and it's really

it's insulting anytime we hear examples

of brown face or black facing it's

really it's it's making a mockery of

someone for what they live and what the

relived experiences are I think he needs

an answer for it he's got to answer the

question why he did that and what does

that say about what he thinks about

people who because of who they are

because of the color of skin face

challenges and barriers and obstacles in

their life racism is real people in this

room have felt it I've heard the stories

I've experienced in my life he's got to

answer those questions Justin Trudeau is

expected to address the media tonight

that are travelling with him on the

election campaign I'm wondering what you

would like to hear from him and what you

think that he should be saying to the

public I think what what this show is is

something that that we've seen some

examples of now it seems to be a pattern

behavior we see one mr. Trudeau in

public that seemed I'll be honest he

seems really nice

right very friendly very warm in public

putting behind closed doors it seems

like it's a different mr. Trudeau behind

closed doors we saw at a private

fundraiser when activists who were

saying that our community is being

poisoned by mercury people from grassy

narrows they put up a sign saying hey

our communities are being poisoned what

are you gonna do about the fact that

people are dying in our community that

are suffering because the mercury poison

he mocked them and said thank you for

your donation while the crowd of wealthy

fundraisers the attendees of the

fundraiser clapped on and jeered these

protesters

I mean on one hand he says that

indigenous communities are are the most

important relationship but then behind

closed doors he mocks people they didn't

attack him they said our people are

suffering from mercury poisoning and he

mocked those people I mean what type of

behavior does that show from a prime

minister who mocks people or saying this

I want to say who is the real mr.

Trudeau is there who we see in public or

the one behind doors that forgives loans

for corporations by makes students pay

three billion dollars who is a real mr.

Trudeau is it the one behind closed

doors the one window the cameras are

turned off and when no one sees is that

the real mr. Trudeau because more and

more that seems like it is
