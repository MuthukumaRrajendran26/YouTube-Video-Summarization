Dorian made landfall early this evening

now racing off towards the Northeast

we're seeing the backside of the storm

so the wind direction has changed but

it's still just as gusty over a hundred

kilometers per hour at times here in

Alif acts and that wind has done a

number on the old trees all around town

they're littered in the streets this one

in particular just fell over those wind

gusts were too much for it all the

foliage still on is obviously not

helping the situation and the very

shallow root system as well and that's

why block after block we see these trees

toppled over onto the powerlines as well

over 350,000 people in the dark tonight

and they don't know when power will be

restored the cleanup efforts begin

tomorrow but first we have to wait for

these winds to subside and they will but

not until later tonight until then more

trees like the one behind me are going

to come down not just here in Halifax

but all across Atlantic Canada that's

the very latest on durian
