good evening everyone our government has

remained a constructive force at the

bargaining table with one mission in

mind keeping students in a safe and

positive learning environment right

across Ontario tonight I'm proud to

confirm that parents can rest easy

knowing that our government has worked

tirelessly to ensure their children will

be in the class tomorrow morning I'm

pleased to confirm that agreement has

been reached between the crown our

government

Kewpie and the school board trustee

associations that keep kids in class

this is most welcome news for families

and students and workers alike that

schools will remain open across our

province but most importantly for me as

Minister and for families across our

province it is good news for our for our

students who remain in class where they

belong I would like to thank kewpie and

the trustees Association for being

willing partners and for ultimately

putting our students first find ago

standing in good faith all parties have

demonstrated that a tentative deal can

be achieved with this government all

parties bargained in good faith late

into the night and over the weekend to

reach a deal that is fair and that is

reasonable and I'm pleased that students

will be back in the class on Monday and

I will continue to focus on landing

deals in good faith that keep your kid

in class that is my mission and that is

our shared focus so that families like

yours could know with coffins that your

child will remain in a positive and safe

learning environment ladies and

gentlemen make no mistake I will fight

day in and day out to ensure that your

children remain in class to ensure they

remain learning and to ensure they have

every opportunity to achieve their

potential our students deserve nothing

less

if global news I am just wondering about

going into these negotiations both sides

seem very far apart I spoke to you on

Friday there was some definite sticking

points when I came to absenteeism and

there were some things that the Union

wanted to see can you tell me a bit

about what concessions the government

made in order to make this deal happen

you know my long-standing position last

Sunday was that we were actually quite

close and I've communicated widely that

we actually you know really got down to

a few issues which we were able to iron

out tonight I think what's important for

families in Ontario to know is that in

good faith we were able to come together

all parties and negotiate the

outstanding items

I'm not going to in substance get into

the details of the agreement while it is

literally just signed tentatively and

must go through ratification but I can

tell you on issues like absenteeism and

others I actually believe that all

parties can leave this deal with a sense

of optimism that it remediated or

achieves some of the priorities of all

parties and we have on that issue just

broadly strengthened the integrity of

the sick leave system in the regime that

governs it while concurrently ensuring

it remains compassionate for workers in

the province that need it and I think

that type of win-win proposition the

fact that all parties can leave the

table knowing they saw some incremental

successes shows that negotiating in good

faith could achieve a result that is

good for our kids and that was our

mission and just to follow up this is

the first of a couple of battles that

you're going to have to fight there are

negotiations that have to take place

with elementary teachers and high school

teachers as well what would the message

be to those unions tonight about their

initiation you know we're gonna continue

negotiate in good faith but I think my

message to everyone is if we put

children in this province first if we

never forget our duty to them to keep

them in the classroom in a positive

sense and I say this job is with

especially to children with

exceptionalities

you know we heard so much especially

even this weekend about many parents who

have had a deep concern and anxiety

particularly for kids with

exceptionality intellectual developed a

disability some autism families it is

for them especially that this was a

victory because their kid

deserve to be in class and all children

deserve to be in class but I think you

know my message in short all the parties

is by making the students the very

center of what we are discussing we can

achieve material successes that both

keep them in class provide that

stability that we all want while

concurrently advancing our shared

priorities I could evening Minister um

there are a lot of parents watching

across the province right now you can

give us a 100% guarantee that all

schools will be open tomorrow if the

short answer is yes schools and the

province of on trail will be open right

across Ontario and north south east and

west English and French that is

certainly my expectation and I believe

all schools will be open it will be a

positive safe learning environment for

students in Ontario tomorrow okay

certainly it seemed like a lot of the

school boards we're looking to get as

much money out of kewpie as possible

because you know the grants per student

needs the money that you are

transferring to those school boards has

been reduced this year how do you how we

are going to be in the exact same

situation with all of the other teachers

unions are we not because the school

boards will be looking for the exact

same savings from all of them just the

grants for soudanese are broadly up

across the ministry in fact we have

increased investments right across the

board particularly for children with

with special education needs but

individual school board saw reductions

in their actual transfers from the

province it will be predicated on

population growth I mean for boards that

have declining population that may be

true certainly for boards with

increasing population the opposite could

be true I think what is important is

overall we're putting more money in the

system and you're right we do have many

more negotiations ago that's why I think

demonstrating a constructive focus on

getting deals is what is important and I

appreciate you know that there could be

a lot of you know difficulty it can be

tough in these rooms and in the

environments that we operate in but the

end the day notwithstanding the

difficult to the adversity of the

process we achieved a result that

families want which is stability and I

think they deserve that

okay I'm sorry

how do I administer um you were

mentioned the handful of negotiations

still to come do you think that the

future negotiations will be as

challenging as this one you know I think

all negotiations come with inherent

challenges you know look for the

government's perspective we're advancing

the interests of students for our

colleagues and partners in the Union

they're advancing the interests of their

members and of course for trustees their

advance the interest of boards we have

sometimes competing but often aligned

interests and I think through this deal

what we demonstrated is if you put

students first like this is not you know

just some platitude it really is it

manifestly demonstrated when we sit down

and look at one of the issues that

divide us quote unquote and remind

ourselves who we serve two million young

people in Ontario that ought to be

learning in a positive modern safe

environment when we do that I think

sobriety sets in and we get back to the

table as we demonstrated this week and

with the parties and good for you to get

a deal so I think there's a pathway

forward for all tables I appreciate

there will be difficulty and the angst

parents felt I think you know really

concerned me you know I really feel for

them that they had to wait to this point

you know I understand for many folks out

there particularly for families one

income families one parent families for

children from underrepresented groups

that may have additional pressure points

you know like I don't want them in this

position at all and I'm just happy that

we were able to provide some

predictability albeit at nine o'clock a

night but provide them with some

certainty that they deserves the child

tomorrow could be in class and that is a

message that I'm sharing with all of our

partners and I look forward to

negotiating continue negotiating with

them in good faith to get deals one of

the main sticking points was the sick

leave policy how much will that cost the

yeah as I mentioned earlier we were able

to build out a plan find common

agreement that maintains the that

actually strengthens provisions in the

integrity of the sick leave system while

concurrently insuring as compassion

those details you know

may come out in the coming days but I

think for today given that we have just

literally the incas draw is not even dry

on the paper that truly I think the

focus is that we've landed a deal we've

done it within our our mandate and I

think for all parties to be fair to the

Union and to the trustees and certainly

for the government we could all leave

this deal knowing we've receive achieved

some incremental success and that is

important for the students of this

province minister of things were so

close yeah I mean you know I've

obviously to my earlier point I

obviously shared that angst that

families felt over the past days you

know what we've said to be fair

including under show that I stand ready

to negotiate at any time last week you

know at the end of the day I mean

opposed to looking to retroactively Lee

at this point we've got a deal and kids

in Ontario are gonna have stability so I

want to look forward to the next deals

and how we can look the lessons learned

from here how we remain focused on kids

how we ensure that their priority and

their health and their safety remains

the singler priority so while I

obviously would have preferred quite

obviously to get a deal before Sunday

evening while I have offered additional

dates last Sunday and prefer we got a

deal then the fact is we got a deal

tonight and I think that is an important

outcome and I know families in Ontario

will certainly be the beneficiaries of

this because they ought to know with

confidence that their child will be

learning today tomorrow and every day

over the coming months and years so

effectively in your answer you're sort

of implying @qp is the reason it took

this long to get to today because you're

saying you were available 24/7 I've

heard you say that time and time

so this is its QP that what I'm simply

noting is that the government stood

ready to negotiate at all at all times

literally 24/7 happy to meet at any day

including last Sunday when we offered

through the mediator additional days but

as I say today is really not about that

pointing fingers I think at the end the

day the mission is to note that the

Union in good faith and the trustees

Association and the government as you

know as different as we may have been

are ideologically or our issues profile

that we cared about came together sat at

a table locked ourselves in a room our

negotiators through the weekend and got

a deal and that is what parents deserve

they deserve to have that predictability

they ought not be in this sort of the

cyclical reality of having that

insecurity every three years and that is

why I felt so compelled to return get a

deal that is good for families and

ultimately keep children in the class of

the province of Ontario and I will take

your final question Thank You Minister I

talked about this on Friday and a lot of

parents probably have this question

because you said they deserve

predictability they don't deserve this

kind of cyclical you know up in the air

and we make lunch to be not make lunch

why do you why are teachers and teacher

unions why are they not considered an

essential service you know what I know

governments across party lines have

contemplated that that is not my focus

today I value educators and education

workers these folks work hard some of

them are my family I know they mean well

but our kids they provide you know just

foundational knowledge when it comes to

nurturing the potential and we respect

them but that is not a policy priority

for the government the priority of this

government and myself and my capacity as

Minister is to land deals to keep them

in the class so that they continue to

learn in a positive space and today

we've achieved that objective minister

transit workers in Toronto are you are

considered an essential service so that

you know riders can get to work in

school and everywhere every single day

without having to worry about that don't

students deserve to be on that same

plane yeah as I say I mean students

deserve to be in class which is where

they're going to be tomorrow and I think

that is a positive

four people on through thank you so much

we all set folks we're pretty excited to

get started as you can imagine some good

evening everyone I'm Laura Walton

president of the Ontario School Board

Council of unions representing 55,000

kewpie education workers thank you for

joining us here tonight I'm joined by

Darcy me Katherine QB school boards

coordinator rod Magee first

vice-president Sylvain Pichet

francophone vice president of the OSB

see you to all the parents and students

who are waiting to know what is

happening tomorrow I would like to

apologize for how long it is taken to be

able to give you this news believe me

this process has taken longer than I

hoped it would I do regret the

disruption to your lives I'm pleased to

tell you that kewpie has reached a

tentative agreement with a Council of

Trustees Association and the province of

Ontario schools will be open tomorrow in

Ontario the full details of the

settlement will not be released until

our members have had the chance to

review them and conduct ratification

votes for now let me give you a few

highlights as you know throughout

negotiations we have been focusing on

securing services for students and our

schools we have been committed to

redressing the erosion of services that

has occurred through cuts in recent

years in the deal we reached we secured

a reinstatement of the local priorities

fund with a new investment of up to 20

million dollars this investment will

improve services in schools by bringing

back jobs that have been lost due to the

cuts we were able to retain our existing

sick leave plan it was critical for us

to provide that to our members and I am

proud that we were able to achieve that

we were also able to achieve modest wage

increases and other things that we will

go over with our

members at their ratification meetings

our members are hardworking members who

are represented here by the bargaining

team standing behind me remain the

lowest paid workers in the education

system doing some of the most critical

work in our schools we still have a lot

of work to do to make up that

fundamental shortfall but we believe

that this deal represents a foundation

on which we can build upon I am so proud

of all of our members and I'm also so

grateful for the support we received

from parents groups allies and the

public I firmly believe that because of

those shows of support the loud ones and

the quiet ones we were able to reach

this deal I think the government knew

that we would not be divided from the

students and families we work with and

care for every day together we defend

I'll take your questions and so then

we'll be able to answer questions in

French

I think the pressure that we applied the

fact that we were going to be going out

on strike a full withdrawal of services

made the difference this weekend it

allowed us to be laser focused on what

we needed to achieve and so we were able

to push back on that sick leave

concession so that there is no change to

our sick leave plan and we were able to

get a new investment of funds on top of

the local priority funds to be able to

ensure that the services that had been

lost have been restored will be

maintained and improved in the future

this deal was done because parents

students families across this province

spoke loudly to say that they supported

us and were defending us for what we

were defending for them this isn't about

a federal election

it's what students and parents need here

in Ontario

such as the landscape of negotiations I

think you know we came in this team has

been so dedicated to keeping their eyes

on the prize which was better services

for our students we quickly were able to

get to work at the sick leave and

tackled what the concerns were were able

to push back on that so that we were

able to maintain that which allowed us

to clear the plate for what I've always

told you folks was our key priority

which is services for our students we

were able to show that there has been

losses and we were able to get to

government to commit to investing more

to return those jobs back to our schools

I would say and I think my team would

agree there's a couple of times we

probably thought we've reached the the

end game I think we're all pretty tired

and you know there's it's an emotional

time when you're sitting there doing

that but it really spoke to the grit and

determination and also the genuine need

that we knew was out there for our

students these people care about

students every day not just when we're

at the bargaining table the parents met

us where they needed to be in order to

get a deal no we didn't give up anything

I would like to have had more sleep

along the way but I think you know what

I never regret anything that we do the

key to negotiations is having good adult

caring conversations unfortunately we

were able to see have the other side see

the points that we were making in

regards to our members and the services

that they provide to the students in

this province so we have a commitment to

get things done by the end of the month

so it's going to be a busy few more

weeks for us

we've got your back just like you had

ours no I think you know we've set some

groundwork for them to have some really

good conversations and get what they

need for their members the key is is

that public that public is supporting

the education system they have seen what

this government has done they have seen

what previous governments have done

they're not happy

definitely so one of the key areas for

us is the return of the community use of

schools funding which allows schools to

have those school gymnasiums auditoriums

school spaces open for community use and

it allows our custodial caretakers to be

on premise when those are open that's

huge because that's ensuring that these

schools remain important parts of their

communities and also insures funding for

special education funding for additional

custodial maintenance and clerical

throughout the schools which are all key

areas that you've heard me speak about

being cut now I think at the end of the

day we were able to achieve something

that the trustees Association can go

back to their communities and be proud

they were part of because we're

returning the services back which will

help them as well I think having the

sick leave removed from the table and

knowing that it was going to remain

status quo gave us the final push that

we needed to ensure that we could get

the services we got that off the table

and we're able to focus on what we

really needed to be they're talking

about which was services for our

students

yes yes so the local priority fund

stays the life of the aggrievement the

additional investment of twenty million

dollars is also the life of the

agreement and we also have a way now to

be looking forward and working with the

school boards to ensure that those

services today and I think the school

boards in the crown have also heard just

how important services are and hopefully

they will be considering that as they

head into budget consult consultations

in this few months I believe that we

said it was between 1300 and 1500 jobs

will be returning back to the province

of Ontario no small potatoes and

something we're really proud of

I know my team was at the table the

entire weekend I haven't seen the

minister yet

I would like to think that the work to

rule and the strike deadline where all

the pressure that this government needed

but I think the added bonus was the

pressure provided by families and the

public even the staff this morning but

throughout this entire process I can't

comment on that I work I work in

provincial schools I that's not anything

that we have ever intended we don't

choose you know we didn't choose the end

date of the collective agreement with

the federal election in mind we stayed

on the task which was important there

was a clear lack of surfaces in our

schools at the same time we were

negotiating a contract that was our goal

we would have liked to have said this

earlier we worked really hard we had set

a deadline for ourselves

unfortunately it sometimes just takes

longer to get things done that need to

be done in order to get to where we are

tonight three years I would say the

students still going to stay I think the

students and Families

we're the victors in this we're just the

people who are supporting those and

allowing them to succeed in their

schools fifty-five thousand yep yeah

yeah so we will have an increase of

permanent jobs in the schools which will

be huge any other questions no problem

thanks for opening the piggy bank and

allowing us to get the services that we

needed for our students they'll thank

you too

we know that there is a new investment

of approximately 20 million dollars but

there are additional monies we haven't

landed the plane on how much that is

that's some of the work that our team

will be going back to do when we're done

here tonight all righty

thanks folks oh do you need him at the

table okay

yeah do you want us to say he can

where's your camera

it's a lot of sitting you gotta

understand

you
