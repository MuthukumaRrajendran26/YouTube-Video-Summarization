let's talk about the impeachment inquiry

is this this phone call to Ukraine's

president is this what America needed

that Muller couldn't produce Muller's

investigation was so weak in the sense

that it produced facts that we already

knew and he was unable to even get an

interview with Trump he couldn't force

Trump to sit down and be questioned Bill

Clinton had to be questioned but Trump

see people laugh at Giuliani and Trump's

lawyers guy named Ty Cobb but they

clearly were geniuses in some weird

sense because they protected Trump from

ever having to answer a question under

oath from the prosecutor and it looked

like he must have felt relieved

the day of Muller's testimony we is all

thought Muller and we had never been

really in front of the cameras or the

microphones during the investigation so

we imagine this mythical character the

strong g-man with the broad shoulders

investigating the the criminal President

Trump and then and then all like The

Wizard of Oz you pull back the curtain

and he's sitting at the table and four

or five times the the members of

Congress had to he couldn't find the

microphone that was right in front of

him it was sad he over a hundred times

said I can't answer that I don't want to

get involved I don't want to Wow

it was shocking and it must have been

shocking to Trump and Trump sat there

and watched that July 24th the phone

call to the president of Ukraine was

July 25th the very next day

Trump wakes up after a breakfast of KFC

he's buoyed he's he's feeling strong he

really beat the g-men he beat them all

and in his arrogance

wasn't you knowing that a dozen people

were listening to the call and were

witnesses just went ahead and and broke

the law and invited a foreign leader to

interfere with our elections

he gonna repeat a victory in 2020 if you

would ask me that question two weeks ago

I would have said yes if the election

were today Trump is going to win now

after he has so brazenly committed and

what I think is an act of treason so

publicly and admitted it I don't even

know if he'll be on the ballot at this

point who is the natural Democratic

candidate to beat him well I think

there's four or five the could be two

but beating Trump is not enough

Hillary beat him beating him isn't what

we have to do you have to crush him I

don't know if it's any of the 19 that

are running so in order to absolutely

crush Trump like if you want to

absolutely make sure that Trump is going

to lose I'd be running a beloved

American and in my mind that person is

Michelle Obama if everybody as soon as I

say that anybody there oh yeah and then

right away they go oh she wouldn't like

she's not going back there do you think

Joe Biden could be your guy I like Joe

Biden I've met him a couple times he's

he's uh he's a good guy we need to

inspire the Democratic base people are

very depressed there is a malaise across

the land and next November third your

from a little over a year from now we

need a person who when you the American

voter wake up in the morning you can't

wait to get out of bed to go vote for

fill in the blank the American

electorate next year seventy percent of

those who are eligible to vote are

either women people of color or young

adults between the ages of 18 and 35

that's the Democratic base so what can

be done to first of all pick a candidate

that's going to inspire women people of

color and young people to not only go to

the polls but from bring five to ten

people with them that's what we should

be thinking about that's the strategy
