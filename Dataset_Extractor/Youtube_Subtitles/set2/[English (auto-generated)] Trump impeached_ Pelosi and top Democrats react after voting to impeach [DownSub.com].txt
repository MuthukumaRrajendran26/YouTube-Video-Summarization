good evening December 18th

a great day to the Constitution of the

United States a sad one for America that

the president's reckless activities

necessitated us are having to if you do

articles of impeachment may I thank our

six chairs for a long period of time had

been legislating investigating and

litigating today that came to a

culmination on the floor of the house

for the Judiciary Committee under the

leadership of Jerry Nadler of New York

and we Intelligence Committee under the

leadership of Adam Schiff of California

brought the articles of impeachment to

the floor to a conclusion where they

have passed I thank them for their

tremendous leadership I thank

congressman chairwoman Maxine Waters of

California Richie unique of the

Financial Services Committee

Richie Neal of Massachusetts the chair

of the Ways and Means Committee carolyn

Maloney the chair of the cupboard for me

with our Oversight Committee and of

course Adam Schiff the chair of the

Intelligence Committee for their great

work over a period of time

I just want to say before yielding to

the Chairman that I could not be prouder

or more inspired

but than by the moral courage of the

House Democrats we never asked one of

them how they were going to vote we

never whipped this boat we saw the boat

well you saw the public statements that

some of them made we saw the result when

everyone else did the statements on the

floor about patriotism and about being

very true to the vision of our founders

and so I do this this day this vote is

something that we do

to honor the vision of our founders to

establish a republic the sacrifice of

our men and women in uniform to defend

our democracy and that Republic and the

aspirations of our children that they

will always live in a democracy

and that we have tried to do everything

we can to make sure that that is their

reality we all hear from our chairman

and then we'll take three questions I'm

now honored to yield with great

appreciation and respect

did you stingless chair of the Judiciary

Committee German madam thank you the

framers reserved the power of

impeachment for the gravest offenses

against our Constitution against our

Liberty and against our democratic

institutions president Trump used the

powers of his office for his own

personal political gain to the detriment

of the national security interests of

the United States that is the very

definition of an impeachable offense

when Congress began to investigate

president Trump's wrongdoing he engaged

in an unprecedented pattern of

obstruction that too is why the

impeachment power exists a president who

subverts both our elections in our

Constitution our constitutional system

of checks and balances puts himself

above the law

and that is Congress duty to hold the

president any president accountable it

gives us no pleasure no pleasure to

stand here today but president Trump's

conduct has put our next election at

risk president Trump's behavior puts the

integrity of our constitutional order at

risk and president Trump's continued

actions put the rule of law at risk the

framers gave us the power of impeachment

for exactly this reason

and then fulfillment of our oath and

obligation to the American people today

we took action to hold president Trump

accountable for the serious and

undisputed risk he poses to our free and

fair elections and to the separation of

powers that safeguards our Liberty a

president must not be allowed to become

a dictator I want to thank

speaker Pelosi chairmanship my fellow

investigative chairs and all of my

colleagues but today defended the

principles upon which our nation was

established today the House of

Representatives did its constitutional

duty today we lived up to our

responsibilities to the American people

by taking action to defend our national

security to preserve our democratic

elections and to show that no one not

even the president is above the law and

now gives me I'm now happy to introduce

the chairman of the Intelligence

Committee Adam Schiff the President of

the United States has been impeached for

now only the third time in history the

president knighted States should be

tried and the question is now whether

Senator McConnell will allow a fair

trial in the Senate whether the majority

leader will allow a trial that involves

witnesses and testimony in documents a

trial that should be fair to the

president yes hmm but should be fair

also to the American people the American

people want to hear from people like

John Bolton American people want to hear

from people like Mick Mulvaney

the American people want to see what's

in those documents that the president

has been hiding at the State Department

in the Office of Management and Budget

in the White House itself we have done

our duty here in the house we have

upheld the Constitution we have done as

the framers would have us do when a

president abuses his office and

obstructs a co-equal branch of

government the question now is with the

Senate uphold its duty well the Senators

uphold their oath do the senators want

to hear from the witnesses do they want

a real trial we have to hope that they

do the reason we undertook this

extraordinary step is because the

president not only abused his office but

threatens to abuse it again threatens to

interfere again by inviting foreign

interference in our election

the remedy isn't complete as long as the

president is free to continue to invite

foreign interference in our affairs I

just want to close by thanking the

speaker for guiding the Congress through

this tumultuous time there's no one I

think who could have guided the Congress

with a steadier hand or with more

insight and intellect than the Speaker

of the House and I also want to thank my

colleagues in particular so many new

members of the House who have displayed

such courage who have shown that they

truly have the courage of their

convictions thank you I just want to add

that one person who isn't with us

physically in this room but I know is

present with president all day for the

deliberations our former our chair of

the gutter for our Oversight Committee

Chair our North Star Elijah Cummings he

said when the history books are written

about this tumultuous era I want them to

show that I was among those of the House

of Representatives who stood up to

lawlessness and tyranny he also said

somewhat presciently

when we were dancing with the angels the

question will be what did you do to make

sure we kept our democracy intact we did

all the code Elijah weave has the two

articles of impeachment the president is

engaged madam Speaker

madam Speaker do you do you do you view

the House's role in this as complete now

or are there steps you might take to try

to ensure as the chairman suggested a

more fair trial in the Senate anymore

Fairchild Mandara contemplating because

we had a very fair process in the House

of Representatives I would go to our I

let me just put it another way we will

we'll have we have legislation approved

by the Rules Committee that will enable

us to decide how we will send over the

articles of impeachment we cannot name

men

until we see what the process is on the

Senate side and I would hope that that

will be soon as we did with our

legislation a resolution 660 to describe

what the process would be so far we

haven't seen anything that looks fair to

us so hopefully it will be fair and when

we see what that is so you would

withhold you would wait to send the

articles until you understand what the

Senate is going to do we'll make the

decision as a group as we always have as

we go along well again we'll decide of

what that dynamic is but we hope that

the resolution of that process will be

soon in the Senate did you have a

question Cheryl yeah

well let me tell you what I don't

consider what I don't consider a fair

trial this is what I don't consider a

trill fair trial that leader McConnell

has stated that he's not an impartial

juror that he's going to take his cues

and quotes from the White House and he

is working in total coordination with

the White House counsel's office let me

just say that obviously Senator

McConnell by that declaration has said

that he is so as in effect the foreman

of the jury is working with the

defendants counsel that's not fair and

we'll have to see what else but that's

certainly an indication of an unfair of

an intention to have an unfair trial

where look it's up to the Senators to

reckon their own decision working

together hopefully in recognition of

their witnesses that the president

withheld from us their documents that

the president withheld from thus and we

would hope that that information would

be there available in a trial to go to

the next step because this that's a

another level in terms of conviction in

terms of this but right now the

president is impeached

we're not having that just stuff and

where we we have done what we have set

out to do the house has acted on a very

sad day to protect and defend the

Constitution of the United States to do

so in a manner that was fair even though

the other side was mischaracterizing it

nonetheless it was there and and

appropriate and urgent and urgent so we

always we will make our decision as to

when we're going to send it when we see

what they're doing on the Senate side

but that's a decision that we will make

jointly you're starting to act like

another country don't shout okay who's

not going to shout no question yes sir

I'm not that would have been our

intention but we'll see what what

happens over there then it's not you're

asking me are we all going to go out and

play in the snow

this thing has not been part of our

conversation that has not been part of

our conversation excuse me what I'm

sorry you know I've never raised the

prospect you asked the question I never

raised the process I said we're not

sending it tonight because it's

difficult to determine who the managers

would be until we see the arena in which

we will be participating that's all I

said I never raised the prospect well

we'll see what they when they come

forward at the it's up to the center to

set this and say what what their rules

will be my colleagues do you want to say

anything about this because it is yo

this is a serious matter even though the

majority leader in the United States

Senate says it's okay for the foreman of

the

or to become cahoots with the lawyers of

the accused that doesn't sound right to

us but let's see when they understand

what we have acted and now want they'll

understand what their responsibilities

are and we'll see what that is but I

never raised that possibility but anyway

let me again thank our Chairman all six

of them and our darling Elijah they did

a remarkable job and I think you

probably hopefully will be inspired by

the moral courage of our caucus

especially as the distinguished chairman

recognized our freshman members who came

here revealed the reviewed the facts

understood the Constitution made their

decision again to honor their oath of

office

[Music]

you
