hurricane durian pummeled them for two

days with near 300 kill meter per hour

winds and six meter high waves leaving

dozens dead in 70,000 people homeless

and now Bohemians are crossing their

collective fingers they can avoid a

direct hit from tropical storm Umberto

if it stays in that past and we would

not have a great impact as one

anticipated but considering what's left

150 millimeters of rain and 100

kilometer per hour winds can damage

homes that are lacking roofs and turn

Dorian's debris into projectiles Umberto

will also make the recovery of bodies

difficult and that's still a massive

undertaking the government has released

a more precise number for those missing

1,300 as a Friday and it's only after

workers combed through the mountain of

debris that used to be neighborhoods

that the Bahamas can begin planning for

the future which the UN says it can't do

alone the financial cost of the damage

caused by durian is not clear but it

will be in the billions of dollars and

the Bahamas cannot be expected to foot

this bill alone the one thing durian

didn't take was the resilience of those

that live in the islands with the school

year underway officials have begun

registering over 10,000 students

displaced by the storm life as they say

in the Bahamas goes on keep moving

pick up the pieces of what bit-by-bit

one day out of time they just hope they

can do that without fear of another
