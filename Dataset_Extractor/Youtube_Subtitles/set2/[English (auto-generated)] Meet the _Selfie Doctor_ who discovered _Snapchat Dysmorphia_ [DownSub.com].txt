many people know me for coining the

phrase snapchat dysmorphia or selfie

dysmorphia and it was a phenomenon I

described which I noticed first in my

clinic but when I started speaking to

more and more of my colleagues they were

noticing the same thing within their

practices and this wasn't just within

the UK this end up being worldwide what

I was noticing was usually before way

back patients would bring in pictures of

celebrities in you know we're talking

about ten years ago of what they wanted

to look like and really this was to help

them articulate what they liked so it

may be Angelina Jolie's jawline or

someone else's nose and it helped him

give him a way of describing what he

needed to the physician which was okay

what then I started noticing where

people were using altered and filtered

versions of themselves which again in a

way if it's just to give a starting

point or way to articulate what they

could have then that's okay because it

acts as a reference point but for a

small percentage of patients I sign

noticing they wanted to look exactly

like that image and that image is an

unrealistic image to be attainable and

was good concern and in many ways had

ideals with many mental health disorders

that you do see within the NHS and the

private sector when looking at someone

if they do or do not have selfie

dysmorphia the key characteristic I

think is that they do prefer one how

they look on social platforms rather

than in real life too they are obtaining

treatments to make them look like they

do and appear in their filtered or

altered images that they do when they

use these platforms and free that

they're not aware that this is an

unrealistic expectation and they're

continually going to get these

treatments often disappointed because no

doctor no physician will be able to

produce that image that they're trying

to obtain when I see a patient that

comes in and I'm very concerned or they

have red flags that look like to me like

snapchat dysmorphia or selfie dysmorphia

one of the key things is to try and

counsel that patient one to explain why

by these images or what they want to

achieve is unrealistic and also to delve

further in their past medical history of

any previous problems of any mental

health problems or histories that are

related to that the key part from that

is hopefully an agreement which leads on

to counseling because for that type of

patient what they want is not gonna be

found at the end of a needle a laser or

scalpel

it's gonna be found by the right counsel

and so it's gonna be found by the right

counseling by the right arm of the

practitioner some of the requests that

relate to people wanting to look like

this snapchat filters or altered images

sometimes within the realms of normal so

I want really great skin or I want

bigger lips but one of the strangest I

had was a patient really wanted bigger

eyes like the actual filter had given it

was impossible to give her bigger eyes

and I tried to explain many times why

surgically and non surgically this could

not happen and that outpatient luckily

there was a realization that this was

something that could be achieved but a

concern was that you know in that moment

they wanted to do anything possible to

achieve it

I think Olli hopefully by identifying

this trend and then having more more

people research has seen the reason

behind

therefore we can look at solutions to

treat in this just as we treat other

mental health disorders
