every one of you he knows I'm qualified

you then you go to jail I don't give up

don't let me through let me go buy me

that one rain we'll have to let us get

through okay we'll let one leg through

so we can go to work that one's a

medical condition they might need

medicines might be bringing medicine to

people and it was the fall you don't

open up one lane I'm gonna get every

in Hope in prayer before you find

ourselves here in hope a friend we're

right here

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

we shall not be moved

save my forest we shall not be moved

it's like a tree holding together all in

yarn together we shut up
