I think beyond related to her question

exactly I cannot speak for procurement

of other departments but I can reassure

that in my new role I take how we do

procurement with who and how we will

manage those contracts extremely

seriously

here are been CERN in London some

militants and veterans are eligible for

free travel and dead the veterans good

secretary travel scheme are in Greater

Manchester all service veterans don't

have the benefit of travelling free on

public transport all year round

transport in default power and after

years of service I believe our veterans

should be afforded gold standard of

treatment on our transport network what

discussions have the minister had with

the mayor of Greater Manchester on this

verse Thank You mr. speaker I've not had

any discussions with the mayor of

Greater Manchester on this issues

transports devolved to the great amounts

to authorities for them to decide

however as the support of the Armed

Forces covenant transport from Greater

Manchester provides free travel on

Metrolink for our veterans on important

days such as Remembrance Sunday but I am

of course happy to meet the mayor to

discuss this further mrs. Ellen Goodman

speaker I met some veterans from the Far

East in the 1950 days and they impressed

upon me the grace unfairness of the fact

that some of them would serve for 15

years well the government changed the

rule against people who served before

1975 after circa

22 years to get support pension so in

respect of pensions pre 1975 it's been a

long-standing convention that lies with

the Treasury and it is simply we simply

do not have the resources to backdate

that previously as has always been the

case with pensions across the Bible it

sector you mr. speaker the recent attack

on the Saudi oil facility was carried

out using small pilotless drones capable

of flying hundreds of miles can the

minister tell the house what defense the

UK has against such similar attacks

Minister well within the United Kingdom

the Home Office has responsibility for

counter drone activity the mo D has a

layered air defense capability and we

are happy to allow other departments to

use that capability when they

specifically request so to end in 2020

I thank her for me to meet with me on

Wednesday but ahead of that meeting

please which we consider all suitable be

a emod contracts and what pressure can

be put on bae to insist that some of

those are manufactured in brass i've

Ridley met the union's from brough over

the years and not only because I

represent a site in Lancashire that also

represents BAE workers the key for BAE

is for us to support them getting more

exports bids and also at the same time

invest in the next generation of fighter

and with that we will make sure that

with our money and your taxpayers money

comes a commitment from BAE that the

jobs there is much based here throughout

the country as they've always been but

good work Thank You mr. speaker my own

will friend from Chelmsford mentioned

connects in the community but the cadet

expansion programme is about

establishing 500 new cadet units in

state schools what assessment says my

right honourable friend made the value

of cadet units to some of our most

disadvantaged children and some of our

most challenging schools Minister

University of North Hampton is research

into the social impact of cadet forces

which includes those in state schools

suggests that membership can increase

social mobility and help children reach

their potential because the activity

they undertake and this is precisely why

this has been such a successful process

karamaneh

the Secretary of State will be aware of

reports that of the use of white

phosphorus by Turkey

in northern Syria what is he doing to

assist nitu allies in the investigation

into this the white phosphorus is only

permitted for using as smut as signals

and markers it is not allowed by Geneva

Convention to be used as a weapon a

number of people are collecting evidence

about that incident and many other

incidents one that evidence is presented

either to me or indeed to OPCW or the UN

then I think we will consider together

what the next step should be finally

because he mustn't miss out ranoji a

warden ah Thank You mr. Speaker I

welcome what the Minister has just said

and what the Prime Minister has said

repeatedly in March in July and last

week that we mustn't let politics trump

justice I trust that legislation is

coming to stop vexatious prosecutions

but when so the the department has

completed a consultation that closed

only last week brought forward by the

previous sexual state around enhanced

legal protections we're now collecting

those responses and we'll look forward

to bring forward a bill in early at the

new year

I wish to make a statement to the house

on Saturday last at column six five

eight the leader of the house rose on a

point of order to announce the

government's intention to bring forward

a motion today under Section thirteen

one B of the European Union withdrawal

Act 2018

unfortunately the point of order did not

prove to be a prelude to an emergency

business statement on which colleagues

could question probe and scrutinize the

leader rather for approximately an hour

thirty points of order were raised by no

fewer than 24 colleagues with me

expressing disquiet and consternation

that the government intended to require

the house to consider again on Monday

the same matter which it had decided 48

hours earlier on the immediately

preceding sitting day it was my

privilege to listen and respond to the

views of colleagues I then undertook to

reflect further on what members had said

and to give a ruling this afternoon

which I shall now do there are two

issues one of substance and the other of

circumstances to consider I shall

address each in turn first

I have to judge whether the motion

tabled under Section 13 1 B of the 2018

Act for debate today is the same in

substance as that which was decided on

Saturday page 397 of erskine may is

clear that such a motion may not be

brought forward again during that same

session it is equally clear that

Dudek ation of cases is a matter for the

chair I invoked erskine May and ruled on

this issue as recently as March the 18th

this year

Saturday's motion sought approval for

the withdrawal agreement the political

declaration on the future relationship

between the EU and the UK and the

declaration concerning the operation of

the Democratic consent in Northern

Ireland provision today's motion seeks

approval for the withdrawal agreement

the political declaration on the future

relationship between the EU and the UK

and the declaration concerning the

operation of the Democratic consent in

Northern Ireland provision it is clear

that the motions are in substance the

same however this matter was decided

fewer than 49 hours ago after more than

three hours of debate the House voted by

322 to 306 for sir Oliver let Huan's

Amendment which stated that and I quote

this house has considered the matter but

with holds approval unless and until

implementing legislation is passed

unquote the second matter for me to

consider was whether there had been any

change of circumstances that would

justify asking the house to reconsider

on Monday what it had decided on

Saturday on the face of it unless an

event or development external to the

house had interceded it is hard to see a

significant change of circumstances that

would warrant a reconsideration on the

next sitting day in this case

so reconsideration pre-announced by the

leader of the house just under 21

minutes after the result of the division

was announced however the government

might argue though to date it hasn't put

forward any argument or explanation at

all that the change of circumstances is

the Prime Minister's application on

Saturday night for an extension of

article 50 this is not persuasive the

application is this is not persuasive

the application is part of a process

rather than a significant event in

itself

in summary today's motion is

extraordinarily grateful to the

Honorable geography bears directly with

fortitude I shall complete my statement

in summary today's motion is in

substance the same as saturday's motion

and the house has decided the matter

today's circumstances are in substance

the same as saturday's circumstances my

ruling is therefore that the motion will

not be debated today as it would be

repetitive and disorderly to do so

for the benefits of colleagues not

closely familiar with the so-called same

question convention which is very strong

and dates back to 1604 I will summarize

the rationale for it in a sentence it is

a necessary rule to ensure the sensible

use of the houses time and proper

respect for the decisions that it takes

if it is not legitimate for the motion

to be taken today

what is it legitimate for the government

to do the answer is that as the Prime

Minister himself signaled in his point

of order

on Saturday at column six five three and

in his letter to members that evening

the government can introduce its EU

withdrawal and implementation bill

indeed it has done just that

presenting the bill for its first

reading today I have no doubt that the

leader will offer further details of the

intended timetable for the bill when he

makes a business statement later today

meanwhile I hope that this ruling and

explanation are helpful to the house yes

point of order mr. Peter Berg Thank You

mr. Speaker I entirely follow the logic

of your argument but what weight did you

give to the point that when we were

debating on Saturday nobody knew whether

the Prime Minister was going to send a

letter or not

and since that has happened whilst you

are quite correct sir to say that the

motion is the same an event outside has

dramatically changed it and given that

the motion on Saturday is very clear

that final approval can't be done until

the deal has gone through in legislation

would it not be as you've always said to

let the house decide on this matter

notwithstanding the fact that the

previous motion is clear what actually

is going to happen it would give the

country the opportunity to know whether

this house of crews or disapproval of

the Prime Minister still be grateful to

the honourable gentleman for his point

of order

my response is as follows I did not

consider in reaching a judgement on this

matter whether a letter would be sent

the letter was sent on Saturday evening

more widely however the question of

whether it would be a material

consideration for the chair whether a

minister of the crown would obey the law

the honest answer to the honorable

gentleman is that that consideration had

not entered my mind as pertinent to my

reflection on the matter I note the

wider point that the Honourable

gentleman makes and I respect the fact

that it is a point of view and I intend

no discourtesy to the Honourable

gentleman when I say that I think I have

made the argument for and explained the

rationale behind the judgment that I

have made I'm not seeking to rubbish the

honourable gentleman I'm simply making

no I'm not seeking to rubbish the

honourable gentleman I'm simply making

the point that having reflected on all

of the considerations and the interests

of the house I have reached the

conclusion I have reached and it is

important that colleagues here all parts

of it and the honourable gentleman

didn't like part of it as he's politely

explained in his point of order but he

will also have heard me say what is open

to the government

to do and the government can introduce

its bill and the government can propose

a program motion for it

and the government can proceed with the

support of the house between now and the

end of the month as collectively

Parliament prescribes and that seems to

me to be entirely proper

I will come to other colleagues yes I'll

come to other globe particularly the

illustrious chair of the European

scrutiny committee but first of all a

point of order mr. Kevin Brennan Thank

You mr. speaker as you'll recall on

Saturday afternoon I was the Honourable

member who raised the issue that the

leader of the house should have been

making an emergency business statement

at that time rather relying on the

device of a point of order to try to

change the business today I described it

at the time as low rent jiggery-pokery

isn't it time mr. speaker that the

government instead of playing games with

the business of this house actually

subscribe to the usual practices inform

the opposition of their intentions and

indeed inform the speaker of this

accident of their intentions in advance

so that we can all get on and with the

important business we have to conduct

well I'm grateful to the honourable

gentleman look let's focus on the

arguments and the issues as somebody a

very long serving member of this house

once said sadly no longer with us it's

not about politics it's about policies

it's not about personalities it's not

about personalities about policies and

so I don't want to get into the

personalities of it I know that the

leader of the house disapproves of

jiggery-pokery because I've heard him

say so in the past if memory serves me

correctly on March the 26th 2015 in the

chamber he made that very point that he

deprecated the use of jiggery-pokery I

don't want to get into that what I

suppose what I want to say is this there

are precedents for changes in business

being announced on points of order it's

not the norm but there are precedents

and I don't want to

scribe any improper motive to the leader

of the house whose personal courtesy to

me over the years has been and remains

unfailing I hope I have reciprocated it

he made the judgment he made there was

very little notice that he was going to

say what he said but that was really

perhaps a product of the circumstances

the Honorable gentleman might think the

circumstance could have been anticipated

and some advance notice would have been

helpful but we were where we were and I

don't complain about having to respond

to points of order the leader didn't

stay for all the points water he stayed

for some of them but I feel certain that

he will since have familiarized himself

with all of them

we will hear from the leader of the

house later and I'm sure we look forward

to that yes of course yes well first of

all but point of audits William cache

I'm most grateful mr. speaker on the

point of order which I made a couple of

days ago I made the point that the law

of the land is that set out in Section

one of the withdrawal Act 2018 and that

Quitely unequivocally states that the

European communities act is repealed on

exit day which is the 31st of October

the Ben Act has not done anything yet

other than the respects of the letter to

change the repeal the 1972 act therefore

I would simply argue and I've put it to

you that the question of whether or not

as you mentioned in your statement there

are issues relating to whether or not

the law is being obeyed is not an issue

at this stage in the proceedings for

that reason I simply say to you if I may

would it be possible for you to

reconsider your decision

because I'm afraid that the reality is

that the law of the land

means as I've said loss last Friday I'm

extremely grateful to the honorable

gentleman whose experience in these

matters and whose prowess as a lawyer I

readily acknowledge I hope he won't take

it amiss

but if he does it's a regrettable

inevitability when I say that the

Honorable gentleman has put on the

record his understanding of the legal

position and he aesthetic with crystal

clarity this afternoon as on previous

occasions other people have a different

view about the legal position and the

significance of the so called been act

if memory serves me correctly I did not

dwell in my statement on adherence to

the law I touched on that matter only in

response to the point of order from the

Honorable gentleman

the member for Wellingborough I totally

understand what the Honorable gentleman

thinks and why moreover I made clear in

the statement the option open to the

government and I reiterated it in

response to the Honourable member for

Wellingborough the amendment I remind

not just members but those attending our

proceedings in the name of Sir Oliver

let win explicitly specified that the

legislation should come first

suddenly to have at the next sitting day

a debate on the same matter upon which

an explicit conclusion was reached on

Saturday would seem very unusual and I

have made the judgment I have made

colleagues I'm stating the obvious but

when you make a judgment on these

matters manifestly

some people if it's controversial are

pleased and other people are displeased

that is in the nature of the

responsibilities I have simply sought to

discharge my obligations and to do what

I believe to be right

and that is what the speaker has to do

yes let's point water and Terrigal of

course I'll come to the Honourable lady

Thank You mr. speaker my point of order

is about the nature of this power in the

chair to prevent Parliament being asked

to vote again and again and again on the

same thing surely this is to prevent an

over powerful executive attempting to

demand the Honourable gentleman I can't

quite read his lips but I think he's

saying if only yes I think he's saying

if only but but but the Honourable lady

must be heard anton regal speaker it's

an attempt to prevent an executive from

browbeating parliament and making

certain that it votes again and again

and again on the same thing until it

gets it right now surely mr. speaker

this is an important defense of freedom

in our democracy and does he agree with

me that when we have a government which

is attempting to browbeat Parliament and

set up a parliament versus the people

false narrative that this is even more

important

the short answer than the Honourable

lady is yes I sort colleagues to frame

my statement in factual terms and it was

whether people agree with it or not

closely argued and I did not go in for

adjectives of excess on this occasion it

is however part of the thinking of the

chair that the house should not be

continually bombarded with a requirement

to consider the same matter over and

over and over again

and there are people who are concerned

about such a prospect the possibility of

being browbeaten or harassed or

intimidated and in the context of the

March the 18th statement that I made to

the house I was very aware of commentary

in the public square along the lines of

well we'll bring it back 26 times if

necessary until we get the outcome and

that was a factor in my judgement that

our ruling from the chair

needed to be given absence of speaker

intervention on this matter on the same

question can mention since 1920 or there

abouts is attributable colleagues not to

the discontinuation of the Convention

but rather to general compliance with it

and it is for the protection of the

house and we also don't want

contradictory and conflicting judgments

to be reached in very short order and

what could be shorter order than the

next sitting day after the last judgment

was made it may not appeal to everybody

but that is the rationale for the

perfectly reasonable judgment that I

have made point of order mr. Berner

Jenkins Saburo Jenkins who mr. speaker I

kind imagined that if you didn't enjoy

being bombarded you wouldn't enjoy such

there's so much sitting in that chair

and I note the dilemmas you face mean

that on occasion you will sometimes have

to please some and not others but it is

becoming remarkable how often you please

one lot and not the other

I would also

I would also remark I would also remark

mr. speaker that you have invade against

most unusual things happening in this

house which you did not like and I would

say it is most unusual for a speaker so

often to prevent the government having

debated the matters which the government

wished to put before the house and it

has also been one of your mantras mr.

speaker that the house should be

permitted to express its view even when

it comes to changing the meaning of

standing orders and yet to have denied

the opportunity of the house to express

its view on this matter because this

motion is this motion was never voted on

on Saturday

[Applause]

want the honourable gentleman to be

heard as he must be fully and without

fear or favor and then I know he will

allow me the courtesy of an

uninterrupted response it's a burner

Jenkin but because this motion was never

voted upon it ceased to exist it ceased

to exist as soon as it was amended and I

am I confess mr. speaker surprised that

the reason for my right honourable

friends amendment my right will phone

for South Dorset's amendment being

tabled failed to enter your head because

the reason was there was an anxiety that

the law was not going to be complied

with him the letter would not be sent so

the circumstances have changed in that

respect

and can I just alert that you and the

house mr. speaker to the fact that my

committee will be holding a hearing on

the role of the speaker

somewhat somewhat in the light of the

experience of recent months first of all

let me say I'm grateful to the

honourable gentleman for his

multifaceted point of order it was

multifaceted there were several features

to it and that's important secondly I

say to the Honourable gentleman that I

hear what he says about his committee

conducting inquiry into the role of the

speaker and that's absolutely proper and

I think he said something from a

sedentary position about tomorrow and

evidence being taken on witnesses being

heard and that's absolutely right I

don't know what he expects me to deduce

from that I wouldn't dream of seeking to

comment adversely still less to trespass

which would be quite improper to seek to

do upon the legitimate autonomy of any

Select Committee of this house and it's

perfectly proper for his committee do

that I'm entirely untroubled by it and

it's a reflection of his

conscientiousness that he should

undertake such an inquiry thirdly what I

say to the Honourable gentleman and

there are people in this chamber who

know very well the truth of what I say

to the honourable gentleman with respect

to how unfortunate that one side seems

to be disadvantaged by judgments from

the chair let me say to the honourable

gentleman I haven't got off the top of

my head a count of the number of times

that I have granted in the past urgent

questions and in some cases though they

were less fashionable at the time

emergency debates to people of what was

then called the Euroskeptic disposition

and would now be called a brexit ear

disposition and the Honourable gentleman

was one of them

and when I was granting the honorable

gentleman and as some of his honorable

and right honorable friends the

opportunity to challenge to question to

probe to scrutinize in some cases to

expose what they thought were the errors

of omission or Commission of the

government of the day I don't recall the

Honorable gentleman complaining that I

was giving him too many opportunities to

make his point and it wasn't a fair use

of the house this time it was very

unfair on his party and it was a

violation of the rights of his

government now it may be that SATA voci

he was somehow making this point but if

so I didn't hear it

and I remind the Honorable gentleman

additionally and I think fourthly that

yes and I will make the point because

it's an important point to make that

he's honorable friend the member for

Basildon and Billericay tabled an

amendment to the Queen's Speech in 2013

on the case for a referendum on UK

membership of the European Union a most

unusual though perfectly proper thing

for a government back-bencher to do and

I selected that amendment and I did so

because I thought that it was well

supported and there was a compelling

case for it to be considered so what I'm

saying to the honourable gentleman is

that when he was getting the decisions

in his favor he wasn't grumbling he's

grumbling now because he doesn't like

the judgment but the judgment I've made

is an honorable and fair one and I'm

afraid if the Honorable gentleman

doesn't like it there's not much I can

do about that I'm trying to do the right

thing for the house as a whole of my

last point yes my last point to the

honourable gentleman is this and it's

very important not just for members or

even particularly for members in the

house but for those observing our

proceedings noting in what I have said

in any way impinges upon the opportunity

for the government to secure approval of

its deal and the passage of the

appropriate ledges

elation by the end of the month if the

government have got the numbers the

government can have their way and it's

not for the speaker to interfere the

judgement I've made is about the

importance of upholding a very long

standing and overwhelmingly observed

convention of this house that is what

I've done and I make absolutely no

apology for it whatsoever

point of order Caroline Flint thank you

very much mr. speaker

I'm seeking clarification on the

implications of the Fen Act to the

proceedings over the next week or so and

I'm happy to put it in writing if that's

helpful and I'm sorry for not having

done so already the been act as the

speaker knows was amended by the

amendment put forward by my own real

friend the member for a Bravo and if you

recall in the debate mr. speaker my

right on my friend the member for birkin

had asked my right honorable friend the

member for Leeds Central why there was

no purpose to his bill to which the

latter Member of Parliament said we

don't want a purpose on this bill and

the implication was to keep it

open-ended clearly the amendment that

they must then passed by this house

included the amendment by my honourable

friend the member for a Burin which

stated very clearly that there could be

no extension beyond the 31st of October

unless it was to secure a deal so could

I have maybe some clarification from the

speaker or maybe in writing tomorrow

that when amendments come forward over

the next few days or the next few weeks

only amendments that are pertinent to

securing the deal in relation to the

essence of that deal rather than

revoking article 50 or have a second

referendum will be the ones that will be

taken

the right honorable lady is twofold

first of all it's not for the chair to

interpret the Act people will make their

own assessment of that that doesn't fall

to me secondly if the right honorable

lady wishes to engage with me on that

matter in correspondence I'm not

promising to come back to her tomorrow I

will study any letter from her and

respond in as timely aware as I can

compatible with a substantive response

being provided and I should be very

delighted to try to oblige the right

honorable lady in that regard yes yes of

course

point of order mr. Steve Baker mr.

speaker would it not be better to save

consideration of these matters until the

business statement so that we can hear

from the leader of the House of Commons

that's perfectly possible for that to be

the case the self-denying ordinance is

required on the part of people who

otherwise wish to raise points brought

up with me but I know what the Honorable

gentleman has said and colleagues either

will be guided by him or not as the case

may be a point of order dr. Sara

Wollaston mr. speaker could I make a

helpful suggestion that you send a

photocopier Bursk in May to members of

the government but on a more serious

point well it's true the government

keeps insisting that the members of this

house should have the opportunity to

change their mind isn't it time they

extend the same courtesy to the British

people well I know what the Honourable

lady has said the second point is a

political one to which I won't respond

in relation to erskine may it is

available free online in relation to the

same question convention I simply make

the point that when I pronounced on the

same question convention on the 18th of

March one of the early responses came

from an honourable member who said may I

say how delighted I am that you have

decided to follow precedent which is

something I am greatly in favor of and

he went on to make other supporting

points the person who responded in that

way was none other than the right

honourable gentleman the member for

North East Somerset the leader of the

house so the leader of the house was

very much with me at that time on the

same question convention I take the same

view seven months later and it is for

him to explain whether he does

their point of order citizens way

however unfashionable it might be Mr

Speaker I believe you're quite right and

by the same token is quite wrong to

expect the voters to have to ask the

answer the second the same question a

second time

look I've known the right honourable

gentleman before new forests west for 22

years I like him so much that I don't

want to ruin a burgeoning political

career as he's only probably a quarter

of the way through his but one of the

great merits of the right honourable

gentleman member for New Forest West is

that he is a model of consistency

principle and fair-mindedness point

aboard

Sir Robert Sims thank you very much mr.

speaker

the meaningful vote process was a

process which Parliament insisted that

the government adhere to and all the

government are trying to do is to stick

to a process set out by Paula and

clearly on Saturday things were amended

now we can have a clean vote because I

think there is an appetite among the

country if not this Parliament I mean

we're not exactly the empty benches here

to try and get a view on what the Prime

Minister's deal is about the fact the

matter is I agree with Sir Desmond Swain

I think your ruling is probably right

except that we are prone unlike most of

us in May to the EU Constitution and the

EU Constitution means at the moment we

leave at the end of this month which

means that a limited time so we're going

to be treated to the spectacle empty

benches in this house as we go home at

some point and maybe sitting late or

sitting at weekends in order to try and

get government legislation on the

statute book and I'm not sure the

British people will understand that just

say to the other gentleman I genuinely

apologize to him if I have misunderstood

any part of his point but I am reacting

on the hoof whether the were the debates

today or not the government requires the

passage of the requisite legislation the

for insofar as the right honorable

gentleman is concerned about the time

required for the legislation the program

motion for it the sitting hours entailed

by it the inconvenience that might flow

from it those considerations would apply

whether we had the debate today or not

the issue is do we make a pragmatic

judgment and allow for the breach of a

long-standing convention or do we make a

principled judgment and I have made a

principled judgment and there is every

opportunity for the government with the

support of the house not only to have it

say but to get its way by the end of

October and I don't think I need to add

anything to that it is dependent on

parliamentary opinion I will come to the

point of order mr. Chrisman Blount Thank

You mr. speaker but before you reflect

on and I acknowledge we have known each

other for over 30 years and in many ways

our personal political lives seem to

have gone off in very different

directions and the court in the course

of that time and I acknowledge the kind

remarks he made to me on another

occasion outside his house last last

week but I am one of the members who has

formally recorded by anxiety about your

partiality in in the chair and I think

it's the right way to do that is to is

to do it formally but having done that

like my honourable friend for New Forest

West um and having no tea the narrow

terms in which you gave your ruling

today I think those terms are reasonable

in you coming to your judgment however

is a sufficient change of circumstances

are snowing what the response so the

letter imposed upon the government by

this house to request an extension then

for you to reconsider that the

conclusions you came to today no general

rule no repetition is not a novel

phenomenon in the House of Commons

including when perpetrated by me

I have made the point often and forgive

me but I make it again that I tend to

subscribe to the dictum of the late Lord

white law in these matters he famously

used to say personally I think it is

better to cross bridges only when I come

to them it's a hypothetical question I

would have to reflect on it and make a

judgment in the circumstances of the

time I don't want to fall out of the

Honorable gentleman and I appreciate his

courteous opening remarks he won't be

surprised to know though I absolutely

defend his right to his opinion that I

don't accept his characterization of my

speakership I have tried to do the right

thing by Parliament sometimes people

like it when it goes their way and

sometimes they don't when it doesn't but

that is my honest approach if he

disapproves of it I am sorry about that

because I've known him a long time but I

will live with that and I don't mean

that in any discourteous or patronizing

way I will live with that it is one

verdict and there will be others that

I've made the judgment I've made and

let's wait and see how events develop

yes indeed point about a hurry up all

win genuine point of order and my

understanding of the earth in May is

that the repeat question applies to a

session of Parliament so the fact that

we've had a prorogation since the 29th

of March might mean that the government

are not saying they wanted it if they

could bring back the same question as

they asked the house on the 29th of

March and secondly would they be able to

ask a variance of the motion on the

order paper today

that included subsections 1 and 3 for

example the Honourable lady and it is a

genuine point of order and my response

to it is as follows first when I

referred and I did mean this impolitely

not to the 29th of March but to the 18th

of March I was not referring to a motion

on that day which was indeed in the last

session I was referring to the statement

or ruling that

gave at the time on the same question

convention the ruling on the same

question convention has not just

survived from one session to another it

has in fact survived for the last four

hundred and fifteen years so I do think

we need trouble ourselves unduly on that

matter secondly I very specifically was

making the point that the matter has

been treated of as recently a Saturday

with a very clear decision reached by

the house

on the amendment to the motion and

therefore it would not be appropriate to

consider that matter today thirdly when

she inquires about whether a different

formulation of words or section or

subsection would render it open such a

motion to a different judgment on the

same question convention I hope she'll

understand when I say I can't possibly

pronounce upon that until I know the

circumstances I would have to see the

particulars I'm grateful for the rather

vigorous nodding of the head of the

right honourable gentleman member for

Woking I'm at least on that point seems

to agree with me point of order mr. Davy

TC Davis well thank you mr. speaker in

citing your ruling just now you spoke of

the importance of precedent and

convention and yet earlier on this year

when you allowed a motion that everyone

thought was under mandible to be amended

you said sir I'm not in the business of

invoking precedent nor am i under any

obligation to do so if we were guided

only by precedent nothing would ever

change

can you understand sir in the light of

your comments why some people perceived

perhaps incorrectly that's the only

consistency one can find in your rulings

is that they always seem to favor one

side of the argument and never the

government's who are trying their best

to carry out the mandate given to them

by the British people in 2016

on to the honorable gentleman and I mean

it's very sincerely for his point of

order and in particular in the best

traditions of the honorable gentleman's

parliamentary service for his explicit

direct challenge I respect that

no whispering behind his hands or

muttering into his soup or anything like

that he's challenging me directly I

don't agree with him

I think the consistent thread is that I

tried to do what I think is right by the

House of Commons including by in many

cases minorities whose voices need to be

heard but what I said when I allowed the

amendment in the name of the right

honourable and then if gentlemen the

member for Bekins field on if memory

serves me correctly the 9th of January

this year was that the will of the house

should be tested it may well be that it

had not been the norm for such motions

to be amended but I felt the

circumstances were different very

specifically I sensed that there was a

very strong appetite for that amendment

amongst several parties in the house and

a resistance to it by a very much

smaller number of parties and I thought

the will of the house should be tested

it is true that we are guided not only

by precedent but what I would say to the

Honorable gentleman is that just because

we're not guided only by precedent

doesn't mean that we're not guided at

all by precedent what one has to do is

to make a balanced judgment about what

best serves the interests of the house

and all I would say to the Honorable

gentleman is that as recently as

Saturday at the insistence of the

government and I think

with the support of the house the house

met on Saturday to deliberate on this

very matter simply to allow the matter

to be reconsidered two days later and

the very next sitting day seems to me to

be entirely unreasonable and nothing

that I have said by way of conclusion

today flies in the face of country

expert advice that I have received I

have consulted I have taken advice I

have listened to people expert in these

matters and I have not been counseled

that what I have said today is wrong I

have not been counseled that what I have

said today is wrong and I have a very

strong sense that there is a pretty wide

acceptance that on this matter my

judgment however inconvenient and person

to some people has the advantage of

being procedurally right a point of

order mr. Robert Halfon I respect your

judgment and I share your love of

precedent but given what you have said

and given that there have already been a

number of votes in this house for a

second referendum and voted against will

you apply the same questions about

having repetitive votes and when you

consider in your deliberations

if amendments are put forward for second

a second referendum for the Honorable

general what he said and the principle

that I have enunciated has wider

application we are in a new session we

are in a new session the same question

convention applies to consideration of

the same matter in the same session I

very gently say to the right honourable

gentleman that we are in a new session a

point that is in fact so blindingly

obvious that I'm sure it won't have

escaped the right honourable gentleman

is very clever fellow for a moment if

yes indeed point of order dr. Caroline

Johnson

have written to me today concerned that

the reason that the vote has not been

allowed is because the result would go

in the governments favor and I'm sure

they like it I've heard that usually

you've given I've heard that you've

given a reason for it but on a Saturday

the amendment was brought forward by a

advisement of a member member West

Dorset he has said himself that were the

amendment were the bill to be brought

forward folks who work for now that he

would not amend it to gays and that he

would support the government's

legislation to come forward so is there

not a sign that actually something has

changed since Saturday Johnson that I

don't recall every single word that the

right honourable general member for West

Dorset has said though I am familiar

with the thrust of his argumentation on

these matters it is a matter of record

that the right honourable gentleman West

Dorset has voted for the withdrawal

agreement three times and it is a matter

of record that he has expressed support

for the government's latest deal with

the European Union causing him therefore

to be inclined to vote for the

legislation now the right honourable

gentleman can vote for the legislation

if he wishes and I have every

expectation on the strength of what he

said that he will do so but the right

honourable gentleman doesn't determine

what the judgment is about the same

question convention I mean he could if

he were the speaker of the house and if

the Honorable lady he's going to make a

belated attempt to persuade the right

honourable gentleman to abandon his

retirement plans and to seek election to

the chair she may have success with him

or she may not I didn't know he doesn't

seem to be offering me any encouragement

in that matter but I've made the

judgment I've aid and I think it's the

right judgment to make point of order

mr. Greg Davis Lord

the allowed to see the cream thought he

had five weeks to write her Queen speech

but then she was just given a few days

and she's waiting intently to know what

the response of the houses on the Queen

speech but instead the leader house is

put down a motion which is basically a

copycat of the motion on Saturday in

breach severe skin may and predictably

I've got to say mr. speaker you ruled an

out of order

isn't this a discourtesy term that her

majesty and reason that the leader

should reconsider his position visioning

confidence I'm very grateful really

honorable gentleman I think we should

get ahead of ourselves I certainly am

not accusing the leader of discourtesy

I'm not doing so at all in fact I

celebrated his unfailing courtesy to me

and I think you will acknowledge mine to

him we are going to hear from the leader

of the house with the business statement

and if the honorable gentleman wants to

question the leader of the house on that

business statement and to express his

indignation I very much doubt any force

on earth will stop him doing so if any

exhaust the appetite for now of

colleagues to raise points water we and

I'm very grateful to colleagues for what

they've said and for the courtesy with

which they've expressed themselves

whether they agree with my ruling or not

we come now to the first of our urgent

questions urgent question the leader of

the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn

Thank You mr. speaker I'd like to ask an

urgent question namely to ask the Prime

Minister to make a statement on the

publication of the European Union

withdrawal agreement bill and his letter

of the 19th of October to the European

Council seeking an extension to the

period provided under Article 50 the

secretary

exiting the European Union secretary

Stephen Baldwin notice of the withdrawal

agreement bill was given to the house on

Saturday the bill was handed to the

house yesterday as agreed with the house

authorities it will be introduced for

first reading at the start of main

business today the publication of the

withdrawal of the agreement bill is

therefore now being delayed by the

leader of the Opposition because he has

tabled an urgent question requesting the

publication of the withdrawal agreement

bill

genius

we draw the Bema Bell could knock mr.

speaker be finalized until the European

Council on Thursday the 17th of October

and then follows a historic meeting of

this house on Saturday the 19th of

October it has then been introduced on

the following sitting day and as you

said just a moment ago mr. speaking we

response to a point of order what could

be shorter than the next sitting day the

sooner this urgent question and the next

urgent question are concluded the sooner

it will be available to members in

respect to the Prime Minister's letter

to president tusk of the 19th of October

this was sent in compliance with section

1 of the been act the president of the

European Council has accepted a request

as valid and indicated he is considering

it and consulting with Member States

Jeremy Corbyn give Mr Speaker I do

admire the secretary of state for

keeping a straight face while he gave

that answer and I'm very grateful to

this I'm very grateful to this urgent

question being granted mr. speaker the

Prime Minister has not deign to grace us

with his presence today but I'm

reassured mr. speaker that despite his

pledge he's not to be found anywhere in

a ditch

I would however like to welcome that I

would like to welcome the fact that

Prime Minister has sent a letter over

the weekend to the EU President Donald

Tusk to comply with the EU withdrawal

number to act missus mr. speaker as

we've come to expect with this Prime

Minister this has been done with

posturing and attempts to distract but

despite having told the British public

over and over again he would never do it

the letter has in fact been sent the

request is not only legally necessary

and prevents us crashing out of the EU

with no deal but the extension allows

this house the space to scrutinize the

Prime Minister's brexit deal I want to

pay tribute to all those members who've

worked hard to ensure a no deal brexit

is ruled out and I will continue to work

across the house to ensure that this

continues to be the case mr. speaker the

European Commission has confirmed today

that Brussels is now considering the

terms of an extension can the Secretary

of State tell the house when he expects

any extension to be granted and can he

categorically rule out to the absolutely

ridiculous reports yesterday the

Conservative MPs are trying to amend the

law to jail members of Parliament's

alleged to have colluded with foreign

powers does he like me fear that for the

Honourable member of his Shrewsbury an

action who is telling everyone he will

listen that he is trying to collude with

the polish and Hungarian governments to

veto any possibility of article 50

extensions mr. speaker this type of

nonsense is doing nobody any good at all

if the Prime Minister wants to get his

deals through he should bring forward

the withdrawal agreement built for

scrutiny will he also and will he also

bring forward an economic impact

assessment which has since has so far

not seen the light of day and will he

allow this house ample time to

scrutinize what this deal means to the

communities that we all represent well I

can tell the house what has been ditched

and it is the Honourable gentleman's

manifesto which he has ditched from the

commitment he gave to respect the

referendum result to warm which is now

characterized by dither and delay

he says that he questions the letter

from the Prime Minister what the Prime

Minister made clear is that we would

abide by the law and what Lord Panik has

confirmed amongst many others is that

the Prime Minister has done so so there

is no question as to the commitment from

the Prime Minister but of course he

disagrees with the action and it won't

surprise any members either of this

house or of the European Council as to

what the position of the Prime Minister

is and his commitment to leaving on the

31st of October the honourable gentleman

talks about collusion we in this house

mr. speaker want seclude with the

British public to respect the referendum

result and to get Gregg seat done and

when he talks about delay he should

answer this question if he wants a

second referendum we know the shadow

brexit secretary wants to show but their

second best random but if he wants a

second referendum how long is that going

to take

how long will the primary legislation

take how long were the electoral

commission requirements take how long is

he going to leave the house in purgatory

he gave a commitment that if we went

past the 31st of October there would be

a general election and yet on the more

program on Sunday the shadow bricks its

secretary said he wanted further delay

in order to have a second referendum so

when is he going to accept the Prime

Minister's challenge when is he going to

have it your election or are we going to

have as the shadow business brexit

secretary said more dither more delay

and more shirking of his

responsibilities

mr. Kenneth claw mr. speaker could my

right number friend try to ensure the

government stops giving this sort of

sacred quality to the date of October

the 31st which is a really rather silly

point which is intruded into the

extremely complicated arguments we're

having on this whole issue although I

personally would be quite happy if we

could control conclude in withdraw

agreement along the lines the Prime

Minister proposing by 31st of October if

we could do it properly but the date was

not selected by the British public or

the British government it was a

compromise in the EU between president

mackerel and the rest and was plucked

out of the air so will he agree with me

that what matters is we get the right

withdrawal agreement carried with the

tenuous majority of the government may

have through second readings and third

reading so form is actually settled and

then we can proceed in a way which

future generations if we get it right or

we forget it wrong we'll regard as much

more important than whether we actually

made it for a particular day in October

2009 tea but the reality mr. speakers

the date was set by the previous

European Council and it is not a

unilateral decision for the UK

Parliament as to whether that date is

changed though previously in this house

the father of the house has said what

mattered was avoiding No Deal the Prime

Minister has secured a deal that does

that

so what not matters now is that we end

the uncertainty the uncertainty for

businesses the uncertainty for citizens

and actually deliver on the deal the

Prime Minister has negotiated one agreed

by the eu27 as well and we get Gregg's

it done

SRIA blackbird Thank You mr. speaker and

can I congratulate the leader of the

Opposition for launching this question

but of course it's a question to the

prime minister and it's a question about

the Prime Minister's behavior where is

he where is the respect that the Prime

Minister is showing to this house mr.

speaker the Prime Minister is utterly

humiliated by his defeat on Saturday a

defeat that saw this house reject his

unfair anti-democratic deal he defeat

mr. speaker that has forced the Prime

Minister to send a letter to the

European Union Council requesting a deal

but what did the Prime Minister do he

sent a letter not on headed paper and

unsigned can I ask if the Prime Minister

is used to sending unsigned letters in

his capacity as Prime Minister and if so

how many and I want the direct answer to

that question anonymously but I think we

know the answer because his behavior

lacks dignity

it lacks respect it is not becoming of

any Prime Minister once again the Prime

Minister has shown himself to be

unworthy of the office he holds Mr

Speaker I have with me a copy of a joint

letter sent from the First Minister's of

Scotland and Wales to President tusk

properly addressed with their official

letter heads and Julie side

the Prime Minister should take note that

is a lesson on how to behave because his

actions don't just show disrespect to

this house but to the court in Scotland

but the president tusk himself despite

the Prime Minister's childish games of

sending a confit later of course the SNP

is pleased to see that the girl up some

room namely the European Council are now

considering the extension an extension

that must be secured to protect our

interests from the economic oblivion if

we were to exit the European Union on a

new deal great said Mr Speaker I join

with the leader of the Opposition to

express the SNP is outraged that the

Prime Minister has instructed his

government to publish the withdrawal

bill without securing adequate time for

parliamentary debate and scrutiny once

again this Conservative government is

showing disregard for democracy it is

absolutely imperative that

representatives here are able to do our

jobs and scrutinize the legislation

given the magnitude of the implication

so I say to the Prime Minister through

the secretary that's here if he's not

afraid of democratic debate secure the

extension and let's give the time for

full scrutiny of the bill and let me ask

this if he's so sure that the people are

with him will he confirm today that he

will seek support for this bill from the

Scottish Parliament who must give

consent first

well the the crooks the issue is the

Prime Minister has complied with the law

but it is right that alongside that he

sets out his well-known views and that

should not come as a surprise to the

right honourable gentleman anymore than

it should to any other member of this

house but what is unworthy Mr Speaker is

to have referendums and to ignore the

resort which is the position or the

right oh no gentlemen not just in terms

of the referendum in 2014 but also in

terms of referendum in 2016 after more

than 1,200 days since the referendum the

one thing I don't in this house has

lacked is opportunity to debate the

issues contained in the ritual agreement

bill and the ritual bill will be

published it is with the house in order

for that debate to happen so it's time

for the house to get on to that date to

battle the bill to get Driggs it done

and to get on to the domestic priorities

of record investment in our health

service the extra 20,000 police officers

there were recruiting and leveling up

all parts of the United Kingdom as part

of a strong economic delivery

so John redwood I'm glad the government

wishes to base our future relationship

with the EU on comprehensive free trade

agreements so will the government get on

on table one and show urgency in trying

to get one because the sooner we can get

one the more reassuring it will be in

Northern Ireland and the public who are

heartily sick of all this don't want to

waste another 15 months a mr. speaker

may I personally thank you for avoiding

Groundhog Day today I heard all the

arguments on Saturday I don't think I

need to hear them again when I agree

with my right honourable friend we need

to get on to the future relationship the

House has been debating endlessly the

winding down provisions which is what is

contained in withdrawal agreement bill

and what the political declaration sets

out is a clear framework for a

best-in-class free-trade agreement and

we need to pass the bill in order to get

on to doing that Joe Spencer mr. speaker

the Prime Minister was withering in his

criticism of the first breaks that deal

and yet he voted for it

he said that no conservative PM should

ever accept a border down the Irish Sea

and yet he has and he said he would

never ask for an extension of article 50

and yet he sent the letter doing just

that if the Prime Minister is allowed to

change his mind

surely the government should give the

public the opportunity to do the same by

putting their brakes that deal to a

people's vote

I think it's somewhat ironic to have a

question about changing minds from the

Liberal Democrats who were the first

party to call for an in/out referendum

and who now wants a people's vote on the

basis of ignoring the people's vote that

we've had sodium cache you mr. speaker

the the urgent question was introduced

by the leader of the Opposition which is

somewhat unusual may I refer my right

honourable friend to a bill which was

introduced in 1997 in the name of the

leader of the Opposition with the right

honourable Tony Benn which says that the

sections 2 & 3 of the European

communities that 972 are hereby repealed

though the European Court of Justice

shall have no effect in the United

Kingdom and would he also recall the

number of times

Palestine concern was in deathless when

the Oliver right honorable lead of the

opposition went to the lobby with me on

every single occasion relating to

European matters does he accept that

this really does demonstrate a

monumental not only mere u-turn but a

monumental degree of lack of memory and

a lack of understanding of what the

withdrawal bill is all the facts on the

referendum itself my writeable friend

has always stuck to his principles the

reality is the leader of the Opposition

cannot even stick to his own manifesto

Angella regal mr. speaker doesn't leave

brexit simply agree with me that the

Prime Minister has a problem with

veracity he told us that he would rather

be dead in a ditch than signed the

letter and signed the letter he told us

that there would be no border in the

Irish Sea and then he negotiated the

border in the Irish Sea why on earth

should we ever believe a single thing

that this Prime Minister says well the

Prime Minister didn't sign the letter so

I think the issue with veracity was

actually in the question

geometry Gail would my right friend

agree that what the recipient of the

letter and are the EU member-states and

indeed the country want to know is

whether or not the agreement that they

have reached with the Prime Minister

commands no majority support of this

house and how does he propose to explain

to them but now on a second day of the

House of Commons meeting we are still

unable to discover that very much sure

my rights all my friends frustration not

exactly is the question that will be

posed in capitals they have reached a

deal with the government they want to

see the UK leave in a smooth and orderly

way that is what their citizens want to

see is what UK citizens in Europe want

to happen and the sooner we get on do it

the better in revenge

thank you very much mr. speaker it's

reported that the Secretary of State

this morning told the House of Lords

Select Committee that under this

agreement Goods leaving Northern Ireland

for the rest of the United Kingdom will

require an exit summary declaration to

be submitted can he confirm for the

house that such declarations have to be

made when Goods leave the customs

territory of the European Union if so

how does that square with article 4 of

the protocol which says that Northern

Ireland is part of the customs territory

of the United Kingdom

it's either part of the European Union

or the United Kingdom it can't be both

well what I was referring to in those

remarks was in line with international

obligations some practical information

will be needed to provide it

electronically on the movement of goods

from west to east however the government

will be considering the process during

the implementation period

grade McKinley mr. speaker can I just

say on the floor of this house now I

have zero and absolutely no respect for

the bend surrender act I have no respect

by the means by which it was brought to

the house and the order paid was taken

over I have no respect that it had four

hours debate with one day's notice I

have no respect there mr. speaker you

were not in the chair that afternoon but

the met the manner in which manuscript

amendments were being debated before

they're available this was a shambolic

act brought by those who do not want to

respect brexit the government should be

in control of the order paper and if

others don't want that they can lay a

vote of no confidence that they will not

do i really wonder mr. speaker what is

this urgent question for is it an

argument that somehow the government

should have delivered a letter that was

gold-trimmed on a on a sort of a

sequined velvet cushion to the

Commission said the secretary of state

secret that the let has obviously been

treated as genuine and is being dealt

with in the appropriate way by the

Council of Ministers much as I would

have preferred that the government and

the Prime Minister had ignored this

shambolic been act but the deven

legislation as he well knows was

designed to prevent a No Deal exit the

Prime Minister was told that changing

the backstop was impossible he delivered

it he was told the withdrawal agreement

sets couldn't be changed he did so we

now have a deal that the house can pass

I hope members across the house will do

so with the withdraw agreement bill in

order that we can leave on the 31st of

October as citizens of businesses around

the country want us to do and to get on

with it Sperry Sherman

Mr Speaker I hope the Minister realizes

that I could never get angry with him

he's always been he and I have always

had very good relation

so nice I trust him a very long way but

can I ask you can't bacon to talk to the

Prime Minister about this whole sort of

folks it's almost a philosophy of get on

with it no we must get this done get on

with it would you agree with me it's our

sacred duty not just to get on with it

to make sure of what the deal is the

quality of it actually serves our

constituents because they depend on on

us for their health their welfare their

future their prosperity so we must take

this take this business seriously and

slowly get on with it is enough Steve

joy stop it well personally can I thank

the Honorable gentleman for the kind

words we which he prefaced his question

and I very much have always enjoyed

working with him on that basis in terms

of the detail he's right we do need to

get that detail right but we also need

to be clear as to what the scope of the

withdrawal agreement bill is it is to

implement the deal the international

treaty that has been reached it is not

to determine the future of relationship

which the house through the withdrawal

agreement bill will have a lot of

opportunity in terms of the negotiation

mandate to discuss and get right so we

need to implement the treaty we need to

do that through well has been agreed

with the EU in the form of the

withdrawal agreement bill and then get

on to the debates which I look forward

to having with him on the terms of a

free trade agreement as we move forward

with that deal

there's my concern that two members of

opposition from bench parties now have

said it's not good enough simply to

police the Prime Minister's actions

through the courts they now also want to

police his thoughts and opinions as well

I think that's quite a cinema a sinister

preview of what my life might be like

under a Labour government god if it were

to happen

confirmed my understanding of the

process for the following week and the

legislation perhaps my constituents

clarity that if members opposite bring

forward amendments that are not

compatible with the agreement that we've

made with the European Union all that

will achieve is not to have the outcome

of those amendments it will just

frustrate and prevent us from passing a

deal in leaving on time well on the

detail in terms of the next steps my

right my friend the leader the house

will make a business statement after the

urgent questions and I would not want to

fee on that but on the wider point he's

absolutely right the Prime Minister has

met his legal obligation that has been

recognized by the President of the

European Court at the European Union and

what we now need to do is implement the

withdrawal agreement will get dregg's it

done and get on to the free-trade

agreement which the Honourable gentleman

referred to earlier Jerry I welcome the

fact that despite all the malarkey and

green-ink letters and spin on Saturday

night the European Union have accepted

the request an extension but does it

concern the Secretary of State that in

the court action raised in Scotland in

which I acknowledge the support of deal

Venice despite the fact that the Prime

Minister the Attorney General and the

Advocate General have all assured the

courts that the Prime Minister will obey

the ban Act and ask the court to dismiss

the action despite those promises and

assurances the court have seen fit to

continue the action to make sure that

the Prime Minister keeps his promises

occur well it's not for a minister of

the crown to comment on any live court

proceedings but to follow the lexicon of

the Honourable lady what would be

malarkey is for claimants to send

letters before the publication of the

correspondence that address the issue

that was sought in the earlier judgement

[Music]

neo Bryan didn't return to the house

after two weeks paternity leave

following the birth of my son my

beautiful son earth I have returned to

find even better that you Primus has

secured a wonderful breaks a deal which

I look forward to to voting name water

dead language are awesome

[Music]

[Applause]

can my around will friend reassure me

that he will now crack on and get the

legislation through so that we can get

Briggs it done and not be still talking

about this when Arthur is old enough to

drive me be the first to congratulate

the honorable gentleman on the birth of

Arthur and we wish him a long and happy

and healthy life and I had noticed the

absence of the Honorable gentleman and

it's very good to welcome him back to

the general safety of state well the

mayor being delays in getting Brick City

delivered but I'm delighted that Arthur

has been delivered and I'm sure I speak

for the whole house in both offering our

congratulations and also with wishing

author every success for the future he's

absolutely right I think over now in the

country there is huge frustration both

amongst our constituents but also with

businesses that want an end to the

uncertainty want to see a deal reach

recognize it's in the country's interest

to leave in a smooth an orderly way and

see that the Prime Minister has agreed a

deal that is brought to the house it's

now for the house to pass the

legislation to enable us to move forward

and to get on to the other priorities we

want to do yen Murray Thank You mr.

speaker I have received thousands of

emails since the prime minister brought

back his deal on Thursday from

constituents who are asking me to tell

them what the impact of this deal will

be on their jobs livelihoods and future

prosperity for the communities in which

they live I'm unable to do so because

the government are refusing to publish

an economic impact assessment what is

the answer to them well GDP go down well

jobs and unemployment go up what is the

answer

well they the answer is to listen to the

Bank of England governor who says that

getting this deal pass will be a boost

to our economy because there's a huge

amount of investment ready to be

released into the economy if we get this

deal passed the voices of business up

and down the country want a decision

want the UK to move forward in a smooth

and orderly way and the best way of

addressing the concerns of his

constituents is to get drugs it done

Donyell fake mr. speaker at the Dover

frontline that we have long been ready

for any eventuality Deal or No Deal to

leave the European Union but what we now

need is certainty because uncertainty

and it's dragging on is becoming

economically damaging so has he having

any representations and party opposite

about how they'll assist we're getting

on with brexit or has he only ever heard

as I have heard that they simply want to

cancel brexit and defy the British

people yesterday absolutely agree with

my honourable friend that what we need

is certainty and what the Prime

Minister's deal office is exactly that

and what we have from the bench is often

opposite is more differ more delay a

desire for a second referendum and yet

no clarity as to how long that sec of

referendum would take those they found

the minister's political reasons for the

reluctance around the Ben Act but it is

the law of the land and it's important

because I'm worried from what he said

that he seems to give the impression

it's only about sending a letter it's

more than that section one subsection 4

of the Ben Act requires that the Prime

Minister quote must seek to obtain an

extension so it's not just a matter of

sending a letter must seek to obtain

that extension and that involves using

the Prime Minister's best in Devon

endeavours his good faith in trying in

trying to it must there's a duty on the

Prime Minister Mr Speaker that he must

seek to obtain an extension so will the

Minister acknowledged that the legal

duties on the Prime Minister are not

simply about sending an unsigned letter

well the reality is this is Parliament's

letter and the Prime Minister has sent

Parliament's letter but he's been clear

that he will comply with the law

he has complied with the law that is

reflected in the comments of figures

such as Lord Panik

but he is also entitled to express his

views and that's exactly what he's done

Andrew Percy you mr. speaker can I say

that

lots of my constituents in Eastern North

Lincolnshire think about what happened

on Saturday was a Westminster Bubble

smartypants little stitch up to stop us

leaving the European Union October 31st

and you know what mr. speaker that's

exactly what it was and can I say to him

the reason why October the 31st is so

important is because so many people in

this country particularly across the

north of England have figured out what's

going on in here

there is an attempt to play for time to

delay delay and delay with the one and

simple aim which is to overturn the

referendum result that people in here

never accepting and never had any

intention of accepting

really my honourable friend he's

absolutely right

the house said that it didn't believe

the Prime Minister would get a deal he

did get a deal they said they wanted a

meaningful vote then when the

opportunity is presented to have a

meaningful vote they make it meaningless

his time for those games to stop was to

get a deal through and the opportunity

to do so is the sport that we draw an

agreement bill that legislates on the

deal the Prime Minister has reached

Kevin McDonald the Chancellor has

responded to the Treasury Select

Committee's request of three months ago

asking for updated economic analysis of

the free trade agreement that the

government

this is the primary audio circuit for

the Reuters lives

this is the primary audio circuit for

the Reuters lives

this is the primary audio circuit for

the Reuters lives

this is the primary audio circuit for

the Reuters live

the new leadership II I have to consider

what actions the UK government would

take in response it have to model what

would happen elsewhere in the in the

world for example in terms of China and

the US so the reality is one can't do a

focused on these things but it's right

that the house will have an opportunity

to negotiate these and to discuss these

as part of shaping the Monday for the

future Boone Thank You mr. speaker I

think the leader of the Opposition was

slightly wrong in his question when he

said the letter takes no deal off the

table that's impossible because it's up

to the other nations of the European

Union where they grant an exception

extension or not the only way sir you

can definitely take no deal off the

table is as someone else once said his

vote for this deal and that's exactly

what this house should do to the second

degree

I've my own will friend and I'm grateful

to him for his support for the deal and

the reality is as he says this is

Parliament's letter but any extension

would require the agreement of all 27

member states and that is something that

is outside of Parliament's control I'm

not quite sure from her expression

whether the right honourable lady of the

member from Maidenhead is welcoming the

Honorable gentleman's belated support or

regretting the fact that it wasn't on

offer at a rather earlier stage

both Thank You mr. Steven Doughty Thank

You mr. speaker

and one of the reasons why bleed for the

government and wanted to try and bounces

on saxing wants to bounces again was

actually to hide some of the content and

some of the revelations that will come

out in the bill which we will see

published shortly and I think they'll be

great concerns not only on this side of

house

but indeed from others who take a very

different from position for me on greg's

it but I want to take the secretary back

to the question that my rattled friend

is now not in his place the chair of the

committee asked about customs

declarations export decorations between

Northern Ireland and the UK will he

confirm that what he said to Lord would

in the other place was that export

declaration paperwork would be happy to

carry out and therefore essentially

firms in Northern Ireland will be having

to carry out paperwork and whether

digital or otherwise to trade within

their own country within the United

Kingdom and will he also confirm whether

that will apply going back in the

opposite direction or not as I said in

response to the earlier question I'm

very happy to confirm that it is the

case that in respect of some

international obligations then there

will be occasions where informations

needed electronically for the movement

of goods and that is in the Corden's

with international obligations but the

reality is he taught us about balancing

decision maker we've already had two

extensions

the house has a debated these issues

endlessly the withdrawal agreement the

first version of withdrawal agreement

was published as long ago as last

November the reality is is he doesn't

want any brexit he wants a second

referendum he wants to remain and he

will do everything he can to frustrate

breaks it happening

mr. robot Hal Vaughn thank you very much

mr. speaker

can we write another letter to the

European Union saying that we utterly

oppose having a second referendum but

does my writer Hawke when not agree that

a second referendum is a betrayal offer

many thousands of harlow voters who

voted and even thousand millions of

working people across the country we

should respect him obviously and

implement the result 2016 but I

absolutely agree with my honourable

friend the second referendum would

simply take us back to square one it

would create huge uncertainty huge delay

and prolong the paralysis of this

Parliament when we need a general

election and to let the people decide

just in matters mr. Speaker I want to

return to the issue of the economic

impact assessment because the effects of

all this on manufacturing leave my

constituents in particular is absolutely

critical so I don't know whether the

government are unwilling or unable to

release any information they've got on

this but surely the Minister can see how

important is that we have all this

information before we make any decisions

after all he wouldn't buy a house

without looking at the deeds would he

but the point that is missing is the

free trade agreement is still to be

negotiated and what is causing damage to

businesses in his constituency and

elsewhere he's reflected in for example

the comments of people like Lord Rose

who was a leader of the remain campaign

who now recognizes that what is damaging

to business is the own going uncertainty

we need to bring that uncertain to an

end and it is his continued refusal to

vote both for a deal that whilst also

opposed in No Deal which is prolonging

the uncertainty and damaging the

interests of businesses in his

constituency here mr. speaker I don't

know if used
