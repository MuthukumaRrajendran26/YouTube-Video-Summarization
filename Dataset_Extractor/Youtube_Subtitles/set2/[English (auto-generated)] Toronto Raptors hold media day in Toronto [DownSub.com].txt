cost a kowai as you said what do you

consider to be realistic expectations

for this team going forward and looking

at this season with big decisions

potentially on whether you keep expiring

contracts or move them what do you want

to get out of this season going into the

end of the year in 2020 first of all you

know I think the expectations always in

sports is to win we play sports to win

there's nothing else I can do all the

dance we want say whatever we want to

rebuild blah blah blah anything you do

you play sports to win it's that simple

and we're playing to win you build from

there you see how your team reacts I

think guys are going to step up I think

guys are up for the challenge and for me

the oh the focus always on our team is

always going to be winning we said this

from the beginning when we got here and

we believe in that that this team will

win and I think it rests on my shoulders

to adjust whenever we need to adjust

this team to prepare us for what's

coming in the future Doug Smith the

Toronto Star um we saw a huge jump from

Pascal last year who do you expect or

hope to get that kind of incremental

increase from this year I think I think

Pascal will make another jump I think I

think Freddie's I think is really coming

he showed us some really good leadership

in the summer with development and then

I am oh gee had a very unlucky year I

think last year and he's had a very good

summer and pre preseason in in terms of

just training before

before today why are we excited about

that more excited about em chris boucher

all the young players I think Nick nurse

and coaching staff really do a great job

of taking advantage of the summer and

what how these guys develop and whether

it's physically or skill wise and

emphasis on shooting which I think Nick

is very big on so most of you all of the

young guys were very excited about Pat

macao he had a little bit of an unlucky

year to last year both of those guys had

unfortunate deaths in their families and

and then very untimely injuries right

when they were on the cusp of gaining to

contributing to this team so there's a

refresh on their minds and I think

they'll be in a good place in the middle

hey Messiah Ryan McNeal outfit

unfiltered you had some time in Africa

this summer I mean think back on your

time in Africa this summer what are some

highs at stake held for you it was I

there was really a really really

unbelievable journey to go and to visit

eight countries on the continent but I

think the two biggest ones were going

back to where I grew up the basketball

court that I grew up I think that just

to see people there and and how I how I

grew up and to see where I am and where

my family is today that was that was

really amazing for me to go to Mogadishu

I think was answered and Juba in South

Sudan those that was that was really

cool to go with that was that was

awesome to go and see

those people those people and how they

live and their culture and trying give

give back a little bit as I remember

that for the rest of my life and I'll go

back to those places Miriam from CBC

Hozuki nada do you expect your guys to

be mentors to the younger newer guys and

if so how do you expect them to be those

mentors to them well I think Kyle

surgeon go so really really showed

maturity in the playoffs last year the

roller coaster that this this game can

bring is incredible and I thought those

guys showed unbelievable composure as

veteran players and I think is going to

transfer into into this year you saw the

contributions from from all of them and

you saw the camaraderie between all the

players on our team all the young

players look up to these guys and it's

been a journey it's it's it's um it's

come from experience it's come from

spending time together it's come from

trust and I think Kyle mark and Serge

have built that and I think that's one

of the things that makes this team

unique that you speak to them in the

summer and there were times when we were

low and those veteran players where they

will always come they were always

confident and reassuring for the young

players which we really appreciate them

as an organization and even as a team to

Eric Green who was about three-quarters

the way back into your left Meza inside

do you Bruce asked about the expiring

contracts you might have to make a

decision on at some point in the air do

you view Kyle's situation as any

different than anybody else's just

because of sort of his history with the

franchise and

what he's meant over there's no question

no question I think Carl has a

incredible legacy here that I think we

all have underrated I think we've we've

had our ups and downs and bumps and

grinds you know but the inner core of

who he is as a player and what he's done

in this on in this franchise you know he

he definitely deserves that I think

there's there's legacy status for him in

my opinion somebody does giving it his

all five-time all-star well well we've

been here I think that we could have

been a six-time all-star that first one

was a close shave and we were all

disappointed I remember exactly where I

was when when we when we heard but

everything he's given you know we can

say what we want about Kyle you know he

comes and he gives it his all on on the

court and it would give me a headache

once once a month but that's fine you

know like that's that's our relationship

and I really respect him for that and

will always pay Kyle em I think that

respect what he's done for this city for

this ballclub I think is is is

remarkable you all know while sitting

here as many of you here we all know we

sat down here six years ago and we will

never write this script this way in any

way any form of dreams or anything and

this is where it is and I'm proud of him

for that

miles Victor CBC sports what do you see

in Pascal that could help him become the

number one guy he's just become a

diverse player that I think a very

dynamic player that continues to grow

he's gonna have more on his shoulders I

think this year and I think he accepts

that he knows that

there is a responsibility and he's up

for the challenge I think every day

we've seen his game continue to grow and

grow and be you have ups and downs and

this season is I think is a good season

for him to to actually grow as a as a

player to potentially get to where we

all feel he can be as a player which I

think you know could be one of the best

players in the league there was a lot of

movement around the NBA this summer how

would you assess the contenders to the

title that you guys currently hold who

do you see as the team's coming to try

and take it away there's a lot of parody

in the league I think by that's a I

think it's a good thing for for the

league lots of teams I think if you say

who's going to come out of the East I

think it's a question I think for the

first time it's a question who is going

to win the NBA championship I don't

think anybody knows I don't think

anybody knows who's going to come out of

the West there are very very strong

teams there and there's good balance

good balance of the players I think

unfortunately with the injuries of Kevin

Durant and and klay Thompson those those

guys are like big-time players but I'm

sure they will be back strong but the

balance of the league I think is is

great and it will be interesting to see

I think people pay attention to more

games this year and then we have been in

the past few years I know from CBC News

I was just wondering are there any

players right now in the league that you

have your eyes on can we expect any

surprises this season in terms of

someone you might want to bring on I

can't talk about that publicly we are

always looking everywhere for players

and I can't be giving away no secrets

now

Scott thank you

hey massage Scott from CTV News normally

when a team wins a championship it's a

big deal for a city and its fans

obviously last year what you guys did

was big for the country and beyond was

there a moment over the summer where you

realized the enormity of what you and

the team achieved it's really a good

question because I haven't watched

anything I haven't I haven't seen

anything

Marvin rewatched anything but I would

say this my parents are in town for for

their checkups and they were at the

house and they were watching the parade

with my wife and the kids and I was

doing stuff around and and then they

watched the highlights kind of the story

the journey on one of the channels of

you I don't know whether I was youtube

or something and I was walking past and

I watched it a student and watched for a

couple minutes and honestly just brought

back an incredible feeling you know like

and I can't wait maybe to one day just

lock myself in the basement or something

and and watch it all but I haven't even

it the summer has been so fast and just

to see you know you see those highlights

and you see those guys like sweating and

and bumping face and and being so tough

and I actually looked at the screen for

that second and I said to myself that

was I was incredible no that was that

was really incredible then sometimes I I

beat I beat myself up for not really

maybe enjoying it as much during the

journey but in our position is honestly

you can't hey

well Yahoo Sports Canada you mentioned

Pascal potentially taking another leap

this coming year how does that factor

into

a potential contract negotiation and

extension we've had conversations we've

had conversations with Pascal's

representation and we're excited we're

excited whether it's going to be this

fall or whether it's going to be I mean

the summer

he's somebody was definitely going to

keep for a long time here and we see we

see what the potential of that could be

so where we've had conversations with

them and we'll see where that takes us

questions I know thanks very much

everybody thank you thank you

we are ready coach morning everybody

coach nurse is here again we will take

questions via the mic so we've got Emma

to my right to solid to the left so just

wave at them first questions anyone

thank you Doug

down to your left BIC Doug Smith the

Toronto Star going into this season with

championship defending a championship

what's different for you and how do you

sort of ramp yourself up again having

gone through such a long year last year

yeah I'm just done I think opportunity

abounds right I think it's it's a new

season I feel almost exactly the same as

I felt a year ago and the expectations

are the same that I had we're gonna

we're gonna try to play a style that we

play play a lot of people prove some

guys play defense move the ball you know

all those things that we we want to do

try out a lot of things and try to grow

this thing from starting tomorrow you

know first day a practice and and try to

get these guys that are that are here to

play a to their capabilities and be

extraordinary basketball air-crane the

athletic given how much last year was

about integrating Kauai and how big of a

part he was in the offense this year

without them is there

almost more room to experiment for you

as a coach or as you said you felt the

same does that sort of spread over yeah

I mean I think you know this time of

year ago I thought there was a pretty

blank sheet of we didn't really know

where we were heading right I mean you

think he you got a bunch of ideas out

there and you got to try a bunch of them

out and you got a slot things in and I

see similar I mean I

think I think you guys are you know as

you look at our roster and players you

realize there's a couple couple starters

missing right from that team and you

realize there's some guys that are our

guys that have been here a while some

some of these guys you know the Fred's

and norms the pascal's og now coming

into his third year there's there's

opportunities for those guys to maybe

either take on new identities certainly

expand roles maybe even take on new

roles and I think that's where we're

probably that that that sheet of paper

still blank and the ideas are up around

the corners they're about how we're

gonna do and we got to figure out how

that all comes together but again it

feels very similar to the feeling I had

last year at this time how is it all

going to piece together and who's going

to move where and all that kind of stuff

hi emiram from HUDs account of the CBC

following on where you just said do you

expect the players that you have that

you know that you built a relationship

with to be part of your structure when

it comes to the team and these new guys

coming in well there's certainly um you

know a lot of experienced guys back

right with this team and they they got a

year to know me right so you're talking

about that relationship that we have we

both you know have had a year to grow

that I would imagine and hopefully that

that they'll be again accepting as they

were a year ago of my tinkering a little

bit or our staffs tinkering you know

like again I can see a lot of options

out there right I again and I think

we've eventually found a lot of them

like for example you know are we gonna

play

Ibaka at the fore with Gasol some at the

five yeah we find we finally figured out

about midway through the Philadelphia

series that that was a pretty good

combination and it is on certain nights

against certain people will we play a

balk at the five yeah probably a lot you

know soccer Willie

for yes it's where he has a lot of

success will he play some three yes he

will this year you know there's that

there's a spot there to play I think

guys I think guys will move up and down

the the so called numerical positions

quite a bit and and that takes some

open-mindedness from the team and that

takes some acceptance for them to try it

and and not panic if it doesn't work not

not try to make a decision after four

minutes you know of playing time

together you know and and that was a

thing that our guys would did

exceptionally well last year they were

open-minded they they took new ideas and

took him to the floor and tried him out

and and there was a lot of good feedback

with those relationships with those guys

so those guys that are coming back those

experienced guys will be will be again

will asked to lead the charge on that

stuff hey Mikey Andrews the Toronto Sun

hey doing good list this time last year

we did a lot or we were talking a lot

about the summer that Pascal was coming

off of and obviously it paid paid

dividends is there any indication

already about the summers that you've

seen from any of your about any of the

other players yeah you know I think

Pascal is again had I had a super

focused summer with with a great deal of

work done right he just again continues

to look like a more mature player a more

well-rounded player just his tempo looks

different right he's he's he's gonna

have a great year and and and the other

guy that looks great and you guys will

see that tomorrow is og like there's a

guy that's gonna have a good year he's

he's really in good shape his body looks

great

he's healthy I like his mindset seems to

be really free and clear and and happy

you know like he's kind of out there

playing with a little bit more of a

smile on his face and the pickup games

that I saw here in the last few weeks

and and he's gonna have a great year

- Vivek who is on your right three down

the Jacob Yahoo Sports Canada Nick last

year you had Kawhi as the primary scorer

and Pascal emerged as that secondary guy

with moving Pascal to that primary role

is there someone you're looking to to

take that secondary role or do you think

it can be you know Kyle one night mark

another surge another and so on and so

forth

yeah I think again I'm not sure sitting

here last year any of us would have said

okay here's our peers our pecking order

of scoring it's gonna be quiet and

Pascal I think I think even into the

playoffs I was if I remember right you

guys somebody I was saying somebody had

Pascal down was our third or fourth

option I think that is like you Mayer

couple low you guys the third third

anyway back again listen I think that

one of our big successes a year ago and

you guys were all there to watch it is

there was so many huge impactful

offensive moments from every single one

of those guys from Fred from Kyle from a

mark from Serge from me you know at

tyent norm I mean there was there was

there was moments when they'd all had

monster nights in the playoffs and I

think I don't know I don't really know

if I believe in a primary secondary

third Derry

scorer and just see how it unfolds and

and move the ball and get get everybody

going I just want to play open and free

and I want to play sharing the ball and

assisted baskets and with great

confidence and we have enough enough

guys to do that right here Nick Lewis

afternoon Raptors Republic last year

during the playoffs in reference to a

lot of questions you had to draw on

experiences from England from the G

League what do you think it adds to your

mindset what you bring to the team that

now going forward you have you know that

championship stories to draw on well I

don't know I guess I've got a

remains to be seen really if that comes

to be it to be a factor one thing I do

know is this is that our guys learn that

how hard you have to play in the NBA

Finals and that to me I mean there are

two things that is an invaluable thing

that I don't think I mean that that's

gonna that's gonna take you a long way

that is that is a level of play for

every possession over every game home or

away that that is super special that our

guys experienced in and have that now in

their hip pocket which is what I'm

talking about the other thing is is you

know we got two months of playoff

basketball that's a lot of practice

films games situations that we got to

work on last year and that most of those

guys are back this year right here will

rebus EFE news the starting point this

year is very different to the starting

point last year what is the mood of the

team right now especially when you

compare it with the mood of the team

last year at the start of the season um

let's see I think it feels again pretty

similar um I've loved our our our vibe

in the gym you know just with these with

these workouts we've had the last few

weeks it's been super focused super

hard-working super energetic lots of

smiles on guys's faces you know enjoying

they're enjoying their work and enjoying

going to work and and a level of hard

play right for sometimes you think about

pickup basketball in September and and

sometimes not very good and it was

pretty it was pretty good it was pretty

good right there was guys there were

guys getting down and competing that's

what we like to see so the vibe right

now feels really good coach at the very

back to your left

Enoch miles Victor CBC sports what is it

you see from Pascal maybe from an off

the court perspective that could help

him take another leap this season I

don't see him too much off the court but

I just think I mean my answer to that

would be I think he's maturing right and

I just he's got a sense of calmness he's

got a sense of confidence maturity those

are three pretty good words to attribute

to a to a young player and and at all I

think temple might be another one I'd

say in there I think I think he's been a

guy that's kind of played you know I had

to do everything with with speed and

fast and and I see him maybe slowing

down ish a bit at times at the right

times you know not everything can be

fast or done fast let's see you know I

think he's I think he's gonna be given a

great chance here there's a great

opportunity here for him to to really

expand his role in his game and they're

gonna be lots of opportunity for him to

have the ball a lot of chances you know

opportunity of the ball in his hands and

and I think it's gonna be fun to watch

and I will loo from Yahoo Sports Canada

take me through the decision to bring

fab onto the coaching staff and just you

know that your history with him well

he's on first of all he played for me he

actually uh he was part of a touring

team that I took over to England in 1995

you think he was playing to make McNeese

State and I didn't know him and I put

this touring team together and his one

of his assistant coaches called me up so

you need to take this kid with you and

he ended up on the touring team with me

and anyway I brought him not that year

but the following year I brought him to

England to play for my team in berming

Birmingham England and he's been there

ever since he went to put a bunch of

years at Birmingham in 17 years at

Newcastle isn't he's just a got

extremely high character works extremely

hard I mean I brought him because he

played so

hard right he's he's in my top three of

guys that I've ever that have played for

me he's in my top three of how hard he

played all right

remind me asked me about the other two

some time and he's coached right he's

coached for a lot of years as a head

coach I know he was a player coach for

most of that but he coached he learned

he'd always was was trying to learn over

the years call me send me this come to

summer league come back for training

camp come to summer league come back for

playoff games get out on the court and

then we had a couple spots open up with

Phil and Jeremy leave so it was time to

time to bring him and Mark Tyndale in

you're gonna like him you're gonna like

both those guys great thanks everybody

Thank You coach thank you enjoy training

camp

you

let's do questions in English first and

then French to follow if that's okay so

where are we starting

start with Bruce down front it's already

so good Mike this is cool man Bruce

Arthur from the Toronto Star you had a

shorter summer than you're used to what

did you work on this summer and what

kind of where do you feel you are coming

into a season where you're expected to

be a true centerpiece player I think for

me it's just looking back at last season

and I'm looking at things that I didn't

I didn't do so well

um just working on every facet of my

game trying to be a complete player and

for me I think that that's you know ball

handling obviously with more opportunity

that means having the ball more so I'm

taking care of the ball and be able to

be a playmaker it's gonna help obviously

shooting and mid-range and be able to

handle the ball and so for me that's

mostly that like being able to handle

the ball and and obviously shooting

which we know about Mike and Ron son

along the same lines is what Bruce just

asked but your summers I mean we talked

so much about what you did last summer

how did the two compare I mean was were

you able to put in as much time as you'd

were a year ago and um yeah obviously

shorter and yeah like a lot of trips

going here and there and but I think you

know we I had a good amount of time to

focus on my game and and um and just and

just walk I wanted what I wanted to work

on so it wasn't as long but but I think

you know just in terms of what I worked

on an efficiency I think I think we'd I

did a pretty decent job on your score

Pascal I know you mentioned a lot of the

different things that you worked on in

this summer but last year as the year

went on and you started seeing more

defensive pressure guys were game

planning for you even in the playoffs

you know it was more geared towards you

than in past years obviously was there

something that stuck out to you that you

maybe saw it as okay this is the one

thing that I need to get better to be

the number one guy if I'm gonna have

defenses focusing on me I think like I

just said I think I think in the

mid-range probably is going to be

something that I will have to do and

obviously when you're being guarded far

by taller players and and just um be

able to take whatever I get the defense

gives you if that's it three or meetings

or all you know I'll be able to drop by

anybody so just just working on every

level

CHCH news I was wondering what your

reaction is to being ranked the 22nd

best player and though in the league

according to ESPN yeah look our rankings

what was our ring last year yeah I don't

look our rankings CBC News so we're

doing a story about basketball shoes I

want to know how you think your shoes

help your performance on the floor I

think for me it's mostly about just

comfort like whoever I feel comfortable

in um yeah like I was PJ Tucker I mean

I'm like I don't think I can do what he

does like playing with all these

different shoes and and um yeah that's

the timing whatever he does with it all

but for me it's just about comfort

whatever is comfortable for me and um be

able to move and stuff like that's what

I really go for what do you think this

team is capable of this season I think

you know this we have a lot of a lot of

our pieces back from last year um it's

definitely exciting time and I think

Fred said it somewhere was like you know

all the the band wagons and all the

people that came after Kauai and kind of

went away and and it's kind of like back

to us and and just you know continue to

grind and and and be you know who we are

like the Toronto Raptors is always known

to be that team that you know everyone

kind of like don't look at and so it

definitely puts a chip on our shoulders

and then and we want to continue to

grind and and and shadow no on the

standard I consider BB we are man

and and work hard and that's what we

always done so I'm gonna go to Ryan and

then we'll take the last English

questions and move on to Friendship

that's okay

Pascal did you get a day with the Larry

O'Brien trophy and if so would you do

with that trophy that day um I I didn't

get a day but I think Messiah wants a

Giants of Africa in Cameroon and um I

was there at the same time so I had an

opportunity to kind of have a trophy for

a little bit but um I didn't really have

like a day with it other things like

that yeah like I just had a little

moment I mean for me it's just like like

we wanted alright so it's like it's my

mind

I only need a day with the trophy and

then to the other Ryan who's to your

left

Pascal Ryan whilst at Toronto Sun a lot

of people are talking about how og is

looked what do you think he's capable of

and some people are saying you know with

the leap you took last year maybe he's

capable of doing something similar I

mean I think you know I think it's not

it's not fair to him you know just like

you know I think we gotta let LG you

know continue to grow and do what he's

got to do I mean og works and extremely

hard and and I think I've seen him work

a lot you know and coming to James team

early and work on his game I just think

you know we just just gotta you know let

him be himself and again continue to

grow and and and and and I'm sure he's

excited about the season after you know

last season with a lot everything is

when he went through last season and it

was definitely tough year for him just

not like just mentally also so I think

he's excited about the season man and

I'm excited for him and you know can't

wait to see my eternal Corey Pascal Lamy

you

[Music]

you

one but thank you for putting me in that

spot you know here I think we had a

buildup we had three days to build up so

we had over three and a half million

people on the streets and the parade was

over six hours long that gives you a lot

of time to do a lot of things in a in a

parade in Spain we flew overnight we got

in you know laid we went to see the king

we went to see the the president and

then we pretty much you know let the

present house and drove down you know so

it's not comparable we don't have

another of a buildup but I had a great

time in both so can't be one buddy sorry

to Ryan who's just in the middle on your

right here

you mentioned the celebrations the past

six months but just for you personally

and professionally these past six months

keep trying explain how much they meant

to you yeah it's been great to just to

be in that position of being part of a

of a team that it has a chance to win it

obviously I think the MBA the grind that

you go through the year you know how I

got here

laid adapting to a new team a new role a

new city a new country everything was

you know a new challenge in and I was

just happy to to adapt to anything that

was thrown at me then from series to

series I thought that team grew a lot

we never I think I said that said that

last year I just loved how we never

pointed fingers at one another we always

you know attacked it as a team as a unit

we face challenges without a doubt we

made mistakes life is about making

mistakes but how you react to those

mistakes a thing is what defines and I

think every mistake that we made we

reacted accordingly and and we made

adjustment the coaching staff was

amazing so

you know that process of making mistakes

and fixing Mexican mistakes and fixing

it

you know to cuss to win a championship

so I think that that feeling that that

that's what I like you know that that

feeling of a fulfillment that you get is

like okay you adapted to every challenge

was thrown at you and and eventually you

want it so I don't know what will makes

me more happy is just you know winning

it or how you win it so I know it's down

front to your left

Bruce Arthur from the Toronto Star Marc

how do you view this team without Kawhi

and without Danny as in terms of the

project of going forward and what you

can work you can kind of expect from

these Raptors um if I had to do is

private as one word I would say hungry I

think is a very hungry team you know we

all understand what y-you know meant to

the team and and how well he played in

the playoffs but we also understand you

know with how we how good we can be as a

team and we are going to invest

everything in it to be that team so I'm

not worried I'm just excited about

starting training cam and I start

working and on that chemistry you know

when when you spend the time the summer

apart you know chemistry kind of

separates a little bit now you you bring

it all together again you're gonna do

all the little things again because if

not you're just not gonna win it no

matter who's on your team so um I just I

just like the character of the team the

mindset of the team

obviously we're fortunate to have the

same coaching staff so that's that's

great CBC sports winning the NBA

championship and then the world

championship how does that change your

outlook going into this season it

doesn't it doesn't I think you know as a

player you varies

short-sighted when you lose you know you

reprogram and you go into a next

challenge when you win is sort of the

same thing the only part is obviously

you you have you spend made weeks with

the national team over the summer you

haven't you know you haven't had that

much time to build all you wanted to

build to be ahead of in the season but

being the the medical staff and the

coaches to have have a great plan and

and I'm you know I'm excited I'm just

you know mentally really really

energized to face another season so that

that I think if your mind wants it and

it's ready for it and the rest will

follow good Asha who's down front on

your right I'm with CBC News Marketplace

we're doing a story about basketball

shoes so I want to know how you think

your shoes give you an edge when you're

playing on the court well you keep me

grounded that's for sure see me grounded

at all times

it's not because I'm not athletic it's

because the shoes so now you want to

feel comfortable and to give you a lot

of support especially for a big guy I

don't care much about the looks but you

want to kind of look at them apart but I

don't know I don't you know Nike always

does a great job I've always been with

the same brand for for all my career

since since I was you know started being

professional so you know I've been very

fortunate to be negative whole time they

always do a good job of throwing new

stuff and new products and technology

has been you know so progressive that

you know it's hard to catch up but you

want them to be supportive that's all

you want from the shoes at least for me

any other English questions because

we'll move on to Spanish sorry Joseph so

we'll finish with you and then go on to

Spanish questions

Joseph azshara the score mark you

mentioned hungry as a word that comes to

mind coming off of the summer you've had

how much of that is just now knowing

what it feels like to be on top and not

wanting to come down and how much of

that is maybe you guys hearing some of

the doubt that's out there about this

team in the absence of Kauai I think we

all been through it I think you look at

the roster with

you know all the players that make this

team at some point I think your ears

they've been overlooked so for us it's

nothing new we just got to do the little

things that we need to do in order to

become that team again obviously you

take why you take the anyway that's

that's not going to change but that void

is going to be filled you know by the

team not just we can expect one guy to

do all the other work we all gonna have

our part in and we all have to chip in

but always having the team as the main

you know thing we can just want one guy

just because I won the 20 hour we won

the 20 that are missing with 25 shots

for us to win and the game and as many

games as possible so move on to Spanish

you

Bruce down front and to the story Mike I

didn't see your hand up there I

apologize

Kyle Bruce Arthur from the Toronto Star

after last season after the championship

after your summer what are you looking

to get out of this season with this team

another championship I mean it's always

the same goal for me you know I'm

motivated even more another ever now we

get to taste of it you always want it

you know you get a little bit of taste

of it you want to continue to grow and

continue to get it and you want to

continue through that feeling it's an

unexplainable feeling but you want it

Michael Grange from Sports Net how are

you I'm good how are you I'm good thanks

when Masai was here he was talking about

your free agency and and and said you

have a legacy here and that it would be

different than then and another player

entering a contract here well when you

what does that mean to you and and how

are you gonna approach this contract

here you know I think you know it's it's

been a long time I've been here the

longest now you know I've been through

the ups downs I was able to help bring a

championship here you know from the

sounds whenever take talking about

tanking for certain players so I mean

I'm not saying I'm the sole reason but I

feel like I have a big part of it you

know and now we're really worried about

the free agency thing you know my

representation have been talking to them

about doing something and you know

nothing's been you know you know

obviously not taking care of but you

know it's the only long conversation but

for me it's just going on here and doing

my job like I always do be a true

professional and lead to the best I can

I think I've always done hey Kyle

Lindsey with City TV I'm gonna quote you

from last year so don't sass me on this

but you called yourself old and said

that you're but you're worried more now

but you're recovering and bounce back

you've had a shorter offseason and you

get a little procedure how are you

feeling um feel great I'm not where I

want to be you know it took a long time

mr. long season we you you know you go

that far and

you know kudos to the team that do it

back-to-back years and you know

hopefully I'm another player and the

same question happens to me next year

but I'm not where I want to be

physically mentally you know still

working progress everything for me has

been pushed back a month so but I feel

good I'm in you know I'm in solid shape

where I need to not where I need to be

but I need to where I am right now is

where I can be where I am right now

but yes this isn't be a process it's

going to be you know I'm not going to go

balls to the wall I'm a slow roll a

little bit and my let's say balls to the

wall how long I mean I really don't care

but but yeah I'm slow rolling and make

sure you know that I'm fully ready to go

when the times you know time ago okay

what what does it mean to you for this

team to be hosting a game on Christmas

Day this season I've never been to one

to like trial and anything sharp when I

say but this be great it'd be awesome

you know have an opportunity to for the

fans to see having a chance to play on

Christmas at that time it's awesome

shorter day for me I won't be able to

celebrate it as much but you know it'd

be fun you know especially but the good

thing is having at 12 o clock you have

the full day to kind of celebrate it and

yeah be fun so going to asha who's down

front into your right eye are you I'm

good how are you

I should table messin with CBC News

Marketplace we're doing a story about

basketball shoes so I want to know how

you think your shoes help your

performance on the court

Oh adidas the crazy brand out there

shout their dudas keep the chest stomach

yeah suppose that there you go right

there it is the greatest brand ever to

help me perform at a high level with

their creators shoes I was hey Kyle

Lewis at ceman Raptors republic the team

is really young now a lot of young guys

especially in training camp people have

talked about you today as a mentor has

there been anybody in particular you've

clicked with really how to bond with um

meaning like right now today

no no I mean I'm honestly I've this is

my first day being here you know I have

a long year to get to know these guys

and mr. process I haven't had a chance

to really honestly I literally haven't

had a chance so it's day one you know

everyone knows Freddie Freddie's my guy

you know that's my guy so if you

I guess Freddie but that's you know if

any Hong Kong for years now and yeah

figured out as we go hey Kyle miles

Victor CBC sports what do you see from

Pascal that could help him take another

leap this season I think just the the

consistency of shooting at you know jump

shot with you know defenders on him and

you know when defenders back off him

because they're gonna back off him

because it's his talent his speed his

skill at the basket they're gonna back

off him I think that jump shot that

taken that shot that mid-range that

three consistently and just taking it in

and being consistent with it will will

help him take the next leap you know I

think just as more his playmaking

abilities and he's only in year four you

got is his growth pattern it's

continuing to grow and it's gonna keep

continue those upwards so I'm is just

about you know him getting better

confident comfortable we're doing

everything even more and just doing it

so Mike who's standing up on your right

here oh hey hey go I don't my gain

eternal son um just NBA champions are

you getting the respect that past

champions have got do you feel and or do

you even care I don't care but you know

I think it's more so about the you know

you're you're you're you it's it's about

the whole oh sorry I was thinking but

I'm not completely blacked out um I'm a

don't worry about the respect I think

you know from our our counterparts

everywhere I've gone you know guys are

so happy for you know our team and for

me and you know it's our peers and for

the peers that you know I've seen this

summer you know it's just about the

respect about us I don't care what you

know other people who say in

whoever says what you know we know we've

accomplished and who cares what other

people think but we know we've

accomplished in our pairs you know

understand you know the work that

they're gone and that has one into it

and one more from Ian who's down into

your right last question you say oh cool

make it a good one that's right I want

to know what if anything you've thought

about what it will feel like on October

22nd when you watch a banner unfurl and

slip on a championship ring I was a good

one

I think um I think that's when it's

gonna finally hitting you know I still

haven't kind of let it sink sink in as

much but I think when a banner rises and

rings come on I think that's where you

kind of really feel it thank you

you

you

that's more we know that the cost of

taking a ferry is a lot and it's

difficult for a lot of families the BC

government has taken some strong

measures to make life easier by reducing

the costs by making it easier for

seniors but we want to take it a bit

further so we're announcing a 30 million

dollar investment to boost investments

into the current existing agreement with

BC in the ferries we know this will help

with more service

you

and a good basketball shoe ah most

important for me I always you know when

I wear basketball shoes I always worry

about my ankle

you know when I when I was young I used

to twist a lot of ink or every time I

was playing I didn't know why but you

know since that you know I really be

paying attention shoes especially if

he's high high top or low top so just a

comfortable of that of the ink oh and

make sure you know it's high top and I

think that's that's the most reported

look on the shoes they search welcome

back era Kareem the athletic obviously

some notable changes about the team what

do you view how do you view this team

and what it can accomplish this year I

think you know a lot of people I heard a

lot of people be saying you know we've

all the change we made all the team made

and you know it's gonna be different and

you know we're not gonna even make a

playoff you know at this it sometimes I

smile because it's not true

you know you know we lost Kauai we lost

Danny but we still have a same group of

Champions you know and those who did it

wasn't the only champion you know we got

guys you know as a champion and now we

have the mentality of the champion and

we know how what it take to be a

champion and then the good thing about

it too

we have the new guys all new guys you

know and they you know they're hungry

they're ready to learn and and to you

know to have the team and we're gonna

from how experienced we gonna you know

we're gonna make sure we help them so we

can all be in the same boat and how good

is the same you know how gross em just

last year and this year is gonna be the

same no matter what the situation is

just in front of him Ryan hey Serge you

worked so hard to be an NBA champion for

so many years how has that changed

things just in your life as a player

heading into the season how has it

changed it well uh it did show nothing

you know and uh like you say I walk my

whole life to be where I'm one now but

it did change me

because my I'm Siddha I'm still have the

same goal and I was hungry I I want more

you know so I always wanted more and I'm

gonna I'm always gonna have that me

that's not gonna change he's gonna

change my personality I was gonna I'm

gonna relax or I'm not gonna stay the

same serge ibaka you know and then you

know the only thing is gonna I just the

only different I think now is a more

much of it now because now I know how to

take to win championship and now I'm

more motivated and to you know and

hungry to for more that's I think that's

really different I want more now you

know because before they have nothing my

focus my goal was just to win one now my

first one now one more so that's already

different no other English questions

we'll move on to French and Spanish so

how

let's start with Miriam down front

thanks Emma fronting to your right

hi Norman welcome back

emiram from CBC Gazoo Canada a lot of

people have been talking about one

specific word that you're wearing on

your shirt the grind how do you feel

that will illustrate this year with this

new team new players adjustments I think

it goes together perfectly you know

having to take advantage of

opportunities given to us on what

happened and this offseason with Kawhi

and Danny leaving we got a lot of new

guys on the team learning what this

team's about the the floor the offense

and what we expect so it's gonna be a

grind you know it's gonna be a lot of

work put in and making sure you know

we're at the same level we were at back

in June when we won the championship you

know starting off on a strong no so it's

gonna be very important for us to be

able to to focus in and the training

camps coming up and get ready for this

season it's gonna be a lot of fun

especially with the new guys like I said

before and we still got the core team so

getting those guys I can made it and on

the same page he knows it's gonna be fun

so I feel like my model really fits into

this team really well in or miles Victor

CBC sports how does the team dynamic

change with yourself and Fred and Pascal

sort of one year further into your

Raptors career and no longer viewed as

you know the young guys I think we like

that so long we have used as young guys

and now we're like young vets pretty

much because we still got Serge and Kyle

and Mark guys has been through it so

we're just a tear below them so young

vets was still hoping the new guys get

adjusted to what Nick once you know we

got our little mini camp heading into

training camp and being a part of that

playing pickle with them talking to them

still doing the stuff in the summer with

them so I think going in this year is

gonna be a lot of fun you know it's a

time an opportunity for us to take a

huge step forward in the opportunity in

front of us

so I know talking to frightened Pascal

we've all been very excited about that

we all joke about that and we're just

looking forward to get out there and

competing I'm just looking ahead a

little bit Christmas Day games have

become such a big staple a big spotlight

for the NBA what does it mean to you and

this team to be hosting a game on

Christmas Day this season it means

everything for me personally you know

growing up I always look forward to the

Christmas day games watching a the NBA

after I opened up gifts and presents I

know everybody's really tied and locked

into those games and just being here in

Toronto the past couple years everybody

being upset that you know we we didn't

get a Christmas Day game in previous

years and to be able to be a part of

that now I know everybody in Toronto and

in a and in Canada he's gonna be really

excited so I expect the ratings for TV

gonna be insane and the game to be sold

out for sure so it's a it's a big moment

it's a big chance for us to go out there

and perform on Christmas

Stephen lung Sports Net hey Norman

welcome back thank you you have with

Hawaiian Danny gone now there's

obviously a lot more opportunity at the

wing position has there been any talk of

like an expanded role for you for this

season yeah definitely you know an exit

meeting we talked about opportunities

that going forward and what my focus

should be man my focus has been that I'm

I've prepared myself for this you know I

might put the timing up with the work in

and focusing on all areas of my game not

just one specific thing I feel like in

previous years I was try to focus and

improve on certain areas and now I had a

chance to improve on everything and

really look into what this team is gonna

need and what's available for the taking

and I've done that you know and I'm very

confident in the work that I put in and

you know I'm just gonna go out there and

and lay it all on the line let the work

show and and go from there you know I

put the timing up with the work and so

now it's just about believing in myself

and believing in my ability

and going out there and letting this

show and having fun standing up to your

right here Greg hey I'm Greg strong CP I

was looking at the Vegas odds earlier

and they list the Raptors is 33 to one

picks to win the championship 11 teams

are favored to win ahead of you I'm

curious whether you think this version

of the Raptors is getting enough respect

as defending champions honestly uh I

don't and we don't I can answer that as

a collective unit like we don't pay

attention to that we really don't care

what the odds are what people are saying

I mean it's been like that since I first

came to this team as a rookie we've

always been the least favored to win to

make it out the first round to play off

the east whatever it is you know we've

always had that on us you know and I

think nothing changes our focus is still

the same we know what we're capable of

we know what the team what this team can

do with the players that we've had we've

had the core group of the guys returning

so it doesn't really matter what they

say is all that matters is if we go out

there and play together and play the way

we should and get gently at the right

time and get back to where we can you

know we all have the belief that we can

run it back and we're gonna go to with

that despite what's being written or

talked about you know with the way Nick

coach is are you expecting kind of a

starting lineup to be a fluid situation

again kind of this year depending on

like matchups that sort of thing we'll

see you know I know uh Nicky likes to

change the don't line up a lot based on

the matchups and I think we're gonna see

a little bit of that just to see just to

get a fill of everybody what the players

can do how they how they flow together

the chemistry with the different guys in

different lineups because we have such a

versatile team and we have so many

players that can play different

positions and spots so I think training

camp and a pre-season you're gonna see a

lot of change in lineups maybe the

started a game started a half different

guys maybe in different spots just to

see what really works and what really

goes so it's gonna be interesting you

know I know he likes to keep the

opposing team on their toes and changeup

defensive flow of the game different

things like that so I think this thing's

gonna still be the same just because we

have so many different guys I complained

uh different positions last one from Ian

down front hey Norma just did in in

terms of looking around player movement

over the summer specifically with the

East who do you see perhaps as the main

challenger to your guys crown as

Conference champs here I think I mean

Milwaukee is still a team they've kept

pretty much the whole team together I

know they lost Brogdon

they have some good additions Philly had

some good additions I feel like the East

is is his balance possible Bricklin wit

with Kyrie to change his would uh

Charlotte and uh Boston you know they

still got their their their core guys

and Kimball going to Boston it's really

big for them so I think that the East is

really balanced you know and uh it's

been balanced probably last year as well

you know the game separating for the

teams that were in the playoffs and not

in the playoffs was half a game a game

so I think it's gonna be a good tight

fought race this year in the east and I

don't see too much separation between a

team on any given night I feel like any

team can be anybody so you got to be on

your a-game every night thanks everybody

I'm gonna bring Fred in right after this

you

you

it was hurt me um tell them what to

expect and then at the end of the day

they got to go to it themselves so I did

when I got here I had some good vests

that that looked out for me and she told

me the way told me the way and then you

got to go out there and bump your head

and learn learn just like anybody else

so there's no shortcuts in this thing um

but uh we got some good young guys and

you know the future is bright for them

same Road just at the end read to your

left

Lois hey Fred Lewis that's Minh Republic

welcome back hope you had a good summer

Terrence Davis took a similar route to

Toronto as you took which is relatively

rare have you guys had a chance to chat

about that have you given him any words

of wisdom yeah we talked we talked all

summer you know that was something I was

brought up to me but as he signed was

you know here's this kid who undrafted I

think he got added to summer league late

so I must have I think I missed him in

summer league but I got a chance to take

him out for dinner and learn more about

his story and just we got to chop it up

and I got to give him some game and just

tell him you know that he's on the right

path he's a talented guy and like I said

there's no shortcut so he's got to go

through the ringer just like everybody

else

I joke with him that his sallies a

little bit hard and mine was three years

ago due to the cap and the way is going

up but other than that man he's a heck

of a player and you know hopefully he

can be one of the guys that can help us

off the bench this year a show with CBC

News Marketplace we're doing a story

about basketball shoes so I want to know

what do you look for in a good

basketball shoe to help you on the court

for me he's got to be low top just the

way my feet work it's got to be sturdy a

little bit light I'm not the fastest guy

in the world so any type of a little uh

advantage I can get hopefully they're

light and comfortable but more so than

that it's got to be something that can

take the load of my body and the way I

move and keep me injury free so I'll

shuffle around I found a couple that I

like and once I find one I stick to it

so we're at the back on the left hey

Fred miles Victor CBC sports as somebody

who's sort of grown up with Pascal on

the raptors what do you see from him

that he could make another leap this

season

oh I mean what there's nothing you can't

do so I don't know that's up to him the

sky's the limit Pascal was the only one

who can tell us what to expect from him

he's gonna keep adding he's gonna keep

growing keep evolving last year was a

tremendous jump for him I don't see why

there can't be another jump from him

this year and if he's anything close to

how good he was last year we'll be in

good shape so just look to be there to

support them and and you know keep

helping and keep growing and we're all

in this thing together two questions

down front on your left so Bruce and

then Mike afraid you talked about when

kawaii if kawaii left you were just

gonna have to go kick his ass

when you look at this team I think

you're you're ranked I'll think 11th and

the betting odds for a championship how

do you view this season as defending

champions but without Kawhi and without

Danny you know we were ranked last year

no neither okay yeah I don't know

same way I looked at it last year you

know obviously we're not favourites I

think if Kawhi woulda came back and

Danny would have came back with the same

team we could have been favourites to

win it but I'm not sure how much that

stuff matters I think you got to go out

there got lace them up you gotta put a

lot of work in you got to stay really

good and grow throughout the year and

towards the end of the year you got to

be playing some of your better

basketball and then there's two months

from April to the end and there's gonna

be ups and downs we've got blown out we

blew teams out we had injuries you know

there's a lot of stuff along the way

that goes into winning championships so

it's not as cut and dry as people want

to make a scene oh no you guys got a

righteous stories but it's a journey and

I mean every word of that it's a journey

and I'm just looking forward to being on

this journey with this team that we have

an attacking net and trying to go win

another one right next to Mike red

michael grange from Sportsnet are you

yeah

what was your has been maybe your

favorite moment as an NBA champion if

there's been one so far and about when

did you kind of flip the switch and say

that's done now it's time to move on I

think probably the two moment stick out

to me is

the process of from Game one to Game six

of this light being on the floor playing

well winning and saying okay like we're

gonna do this we know we're gonna do

this there's nothing gonna stop us from

winning this and then winning it and

then the after-effects of that right the

parade's

you know I'll go back home and get a

parade everywhere you go you're the

biggest thing in the world so you you

soak all that up as you should we put a

lot of blood sweat and tears into that

literally and you know you got to reap

the rewards of that and then ten days

went by I didn't do anything and I

started getting bored and I started back

lifting and put my plan together of like

getting ready for the new season and

started thinking about how I can become

a better player and you know here we are

getting ready to go to camp and just

like I said I super excited you know for

what lies ahead

thanks very much alright thank you in

the scrum area and that's probably about

ten minutes

you

you
