start with the second part snow I can't

tell you anything about what we took off

the site you'll appreciate that we're

gonna exploit that and we expect it to

help us as we go forward so now about

Baghdadi's last moments I can tell you

this he crawled into a hole with two

small children and blew himself up I was

while his people stayed on the grounds

you can deduce what kind of person it is

based on that activity so that would be

just my empirical observation of what he

did I'm not able to confirm anything

else about his last second so I just

can't confirm that one way or another

when capture at the hands of US forces

was imminent Baghdady detonated a bomb

he wore killing himself and two young

children that were with him the number

two is a change we originally thought

there were three children with him and

this is the number we originally

reported up the chain of command we now

know the number to be two based on

subsequent debriefing a total of six

Isis members died on the objective four

were women and there were two men

including Baghdady

this is in additional in addition to the

two children killed by Baghdady

as he blew himself up let me emphasize

again that 11 children were protected by

the assault force and two men on the

objective were detained by the assault

force and they were extracted with the

force
