once upon a time computing looked like

this the computer can be made to carry

them out almost automatically now meet

Sycamore a quantum computer processor

google claims this has done what other

classical computers have never been able

to do solving a really hard like really

hard problem in three minutes

google says it would take ten thousand

years for today's fastest supercomputer

to do almost the same thing but one of

their biggest competitors IBM says this

is an exaggeration nonetheless Google is

calling their experiment quantum

supremacy very valuable step and very

important for the field and they should

be applauded let's look at the

difference between a quantum and a

regular computer your average model uses

bits while a quantum computer uses

qubits which can make more powerful

calculations instead of taking one path

to do something quantum computers look

at all the possible paths to solve the

problem faster so what does quantum

computing mean for the future google

says it can be used to design new

materials including lightweight

batteries for cars and planes but will

the average person be able to use a

quantum computer anytime soon probably

not Google has one iBM has one these

things typically are kept at an

extremely cold temperature it's not

something that we can put in a plastic

box and ship to the public a lot of

people are making progress but it's

really something that will happen in the

future
