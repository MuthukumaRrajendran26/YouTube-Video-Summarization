on this Tuesday night bc's polarizing

pipeline protests spread across Canada

the BC legislature gets blocked but not

all First Nations are opposed to this

pipeline will tell you why more

Canadians back home and under quarantine

while hundreds more remain confined to

cruise ships counting the days

terrifying bus ride and the teenagers

who will live to tell the tale

plus discovering the Reaper of death the

Tyrannosaurus

terrorized Alberta

global national with Donna freezin

good evening and thanks for joining us

we begin with protests that have popped

up across this country disrupting travel

and trade there a show of solidarity for

a small group of hereditary chiefs in

northern British Columbia who don't want

a natural gas pipeline crossing their

land even though it has the support of

20 elected band councils along the route

[Applause]

in Victoria protestors blocked entrances

to the provincial legislature hours

before the spring session was due to

start and in Toronto they obstructed a

major intersection bringing traffic to a

standstill and protesters are crippling

rail lines - via rail says it's been

forced to cancel 157 passenger trains

because of protests on the tracks

disrupting travel for 24,000 people and

today CN Rail said it's been forced to

shut down parts of its network of

freight trains it is actually also

illegal because it it infringes on the

railway safety act for obvious reasons

it's dangerous - to actually block the

rail rails when that is happening and so

we're very concerned about it from that

point of view the Transport Minister

says it's up to the provinces to get

injunctions to remove the protesters

what started as a blockade on a remote

forest access road in northern BC has

now become a rallying cry for supporters

across the country who were using the

hashtag-- shut down Canada we'll take

you to northern BC in just a moment but

we begin with Erik Sorensen on what the

protesters want more than 3,000

kilometers from the proposed gas

pipeline in northern BC the Tyendinaga

Mohawk have taken a stand in eastern

ontario via rail forced to cancel dozens

of passenger trains through the most

populated rail corridor in the country

CN says the impact is being felt beyond

Canada's borders and is harming the

country's reputation as a stable and

viable supply chain partner the dispute

centers on the proposed coastal gas link

pipeline in northern BC several wet

solet's and bands along the route

supported but hereditary leaders by and

large do not and several protesters who

set up

blockades were arrested sparking

protests across the country here's the

issue the pipeline would deliver natural

gas for export from near Dawson Creek

670 kilometers to the Pacific coast at

Kitimat but the route bisects the wet so

'it and traditional territory the

protests began near Houston BC but after

the Mounties made arrests the protests

began to spread to the Port of Vancouver

in the BC Legislature and cities across

the country some one-day protests others

involve ongoing blockades of rail lines

CN lines in northern BC and in Eastern

Ontario and a CP rail line near Montreal

a small blockade is all it takes on the

counter walk a reserve outside Montreal

the snow-covered tracks tell the story

the trains aren't running protests in

response began last week in BC including

one outside the Port of Vancouver today

at the container terminal in Halifax a

demonstration by Mick mah first nations

showing coast-to-coast solidarity enough

is enough we want Canada to wake up this

is not what reconciliation is it's not

what reconciliation should look like one

protest brought the dispute right into

the Toronto offices of the Federal

Minister of crown indigenous relations

Carolyn Bennett the minister would not

comment publicly but clearly doesn't

want to be drawn into this dispute

issuing a statement that the coastal Gas

Link project falls under provincial

jurisdiction and that no order of

government can direct the RCMP but

others say it's not just about a

pipeline it's about indigenous rights

that Ottawa and the provinces cannot

sidestep this is about native

sovereignty native law and the right to

make decisions - what happens to them

their nations and their lands

indigenous and other protesters are

relatively small in number but they're

showing the potential for disruption

exists all over the country

Eric Sorenson Global News Toronto the

natural gas pipeline at the heart of

this has the support of 20 elected band

councils along the route all of them

have signed benefit agreements with

coastal gas link they believe it will

help communities become less reliant on

federal funding it's a few its own

hereditary chiefs and their supporters

who are blocking construction of it and

who the RCMP have been arresting global

Sarah MacDonald is near the site in

northern BC tonight Sarah Donna court

appearances today for those arrested

here in northern BC on Monday where that

lucrative pipeline project is deeply

divisive 7 arrests said the

longest-standing holdout in what's so at

a nation outside of Houston BC on Monday

marked the end of the enforcement of the

injunction 28 people opposed to that

natural gas pipeline have now been

arrested for refusing to leave the

unceded territory that pipeline is

slated to run through but many members

of that same First Nation want the

pipeline built it's an initiative

promising jobs and funding to indigenous

communities in exchange for access to

their resources it may be lucrative but

still it's also polarizing drawing a

deep wedge between those for and against

it the benefits of our people working

out there that they have gainful

employment and if they cannot provide

for their families I've not heard

anybody who said I love this pipeline am

so happy it's going ahead what people

have said is I want the job I want a

good-paying job the livelihoods of many

British Columbians in this region depend

on that injunction remaining impactful

and the road to their worksite remaining

clear of obstructions the question is

how long it will stay that way with work

expected to resume this week Donna all

right Sarah McDonald and Smithers BC

thanks progress is being made getting

stranded Canadians out of the corona

virus outbreak zone

a second government chartered plane

touched down this morning at CFB Trenton

after flying overnight from China and

making a refueling stop in Vancouver the

188 passengers on board have now joined

more than 200 others in a two-week

quarantine in China the outbreak has

reached a grim milestone according to

Chinese media more than 1,100 people

have now died and the virus is still

spreading there are now more than 44,000

confirmed cases most of them in China at

the heart of the outbreak in the city of

Wuhan millions of people are still under

quarantine information on what's

happening on the ground there is limited

state-run media is posting video like

this patience dancing at a makeshift

hospital trying to show that people are

staying positive the situation in the

region though remains bleak public

frustration is building over how the

outbreak has been handled today it was

reported several senior Chinese

officials have been punished they were

removed from their positions for

dereliction of duty the World Health

Organization has finally come up with an

official name for this strain of the

virus it's now called Kovan 19 the head

of the whu-oh says the name purposefully

does not refer to any people place or

animals that's to avoid any stigma

he describes the virus as public enemy

number one and calls on the world to

tackle the threat a virus can have more

powerful consequences than any terrorist

action we have to use the current window

of opportunity to hit hard and stand in

unison to fight this virus in every

corner public health officials in Canada

say the risk to Canadians is low but as

Michael Couture reports they're taking

no chances with those people returning

from the epicenter of the outbreak the

second and likely last Canadian

government evacuation flight from Wuhan

China touched down at CFB Trenton in

Ontario early Tuesday morning 130

Canadians and 58 accompanying family

members were on board hundreds of

Canadians registered with global affairs

remain in who by province it's unclear

if those people want to

but it's unlikely that the government

will go get them each situation is

different and we're assessing what kinds

of supports are needed and whether or

not more people want to come back from

Hawaii the ones who just returned will

go through the same 14-day quarantine as

the others who arrived home last week

but this latest group will be in a less

modern facility as a result those housed

at Hastings Hall will have to share

bathrooms according to Canada's chief

Public Health Officer elsewhere on the

base we're getting a sense of daily life

through the lens of Joanna Wu which

includes people walking around in hazmat

suits the Vancouver native has been

posting videos on YouTube documenting

each day from when she left Wuhan to the

meals she's eating in Trenton I actually

went out yesterday to try to test the

two meter rule because we're supposed to

stay away from people like at least two

meter but then I walked around yesterday

it seems like that was in a very strict

like you could stand next to someone the

quarantine passengers on the diamond

Princess cruise ship are settling into a

routine BC man Nigel Cole says he and

his husband are allowed brief walks on

the promenade deck as they try to pass

the time we're counting the days it's

not marking marks on the wall yet but as

they do in the movies we might couple

that it goes beyond the 19th that's when

the quarantine should end and that's

when Cole and thousands of others on

board hope they'll finally be able to

head home

Michael accretor global news Ottawa and

Japanese public health officials now say

39 more people on board the diamond

princess have tested positive for the

virus that brings the total on board

that ship to 174 and there's trouble now

for another cruise ship stranded at sea

because of the corona virus the Wester

dam owned by Holland America has been

turned away from yet another port the

cruise ship left from Hong Kong on

February 1st with more than 2,200 people

on board including 271 Canadians it was

supposed to be a 14 day trip with stops

in Japan and Taiwan but Japan refused to

let the ship dock because of the

coronavirus Taiwan the Philippines and

the u.s. territory of Guam

also barred its entry it appeared

yesterday the nightmare might end when

the company announced it was headed for

Bangkok Thailand

but now Thai officials say they won't

let passengers off the ship either the

company says it's trying to sort out the

problem and it's spanking passengers for

their patients there's a big shake-up to

health care in Atlantic Canada New

Brunswick's government says it has no

choice but to cut back emergency

departments in some rural communities

critics fear people could die as a

result

as Ross Lord reports managing a

struggling health care system isn't a

problem unique to that part of Canada

with the New Brunswick health care

system itself falling ill the province

has decided it's time for a radical

remedy we believe these changes will

help address the lack of staff resources

our system is experiencing the toughest

medicine closing emergency departments

overnight in six hospitals but those

hospitals are being promised additional

mental health services and 120 acute

care beds are being converted to

long-term chronic care beds mostly for

seniors awaiting nursing homes the

government says the emergency

departments are only seeing a handful of

patients overnight many of them not

actual emergencies underutilize capacity

when you can see at times two patients

at night when you can see 22 in the day

I think that's a good thing

not so according to people in Sackville

near New Brunswick's border with Nova

Scotia our biggest concern is deaths a

petition opposing the overnight closures

at the Sackville Hospital is growing

with signatures rapidly outnumbering the

town's population we feel blindsided our

government officials feel blindsided our

representatives and the public is just

floored finding better ways to deliver

healthcare is urgent here in Atlantic

Canada which has the oldest population

in the country but researchers say other

parts of Canada should be paying

attention the structure of healthcare is

such that is going to affect all

provinces and in fact most provinces

have to deal with these kinds of issues

health authorities say they've been

asking for these changes for many

years with more than one-third of the

provinces doctors and nurses eligible to

retire within five years they say

changing the structure of healthcare

makes perfect sense

Ross Lord Global News Halifax

there's more turmoil for the royal

family and it involves a Canadian autumn

Philips is divorcing the eldest grandson

of Queen Elizabeth Peter Phillips after

12 years of marriage in a statement the

couple says the separation is sad but

amicable they plan to share custody of

their two daughters the couple met in

her hometown of Montreal while attending

the Grand Prix in 2003 five years later

she became the first Canadian to marry

into the royal family a frightening

moment of impact caught on camera

coming up the ride to school these

students will never forget

this distressing video shows the moment

a school bus crashed and flipped on its

side sending students flying it happened

in December and despite how bad it looks

no one was critically injured eight of

the 25 students though and the 74 year

old driver did go to the hospital the

collision happened when another vehicle

failed to stop at a red light police say

the driver of that vehicle was driving

with a suspended license it is a big

night in New Hampshire the polls are now

closed and voters in one of America's

smallest states are hoping to make a big

impact in the Democratic presidential

race Bernie Sanders is leading right now

and Joe Biden is running way behind the

field of candidates got a bit smaller

tonight Andrew yang announced he has

dropped out of the race as Jackson

prosecco reports from New Hampshire

momentum for the remaining Democratic

candidates now is crucial the only thing

certain about the first-in-the-nation

primary is the uncertainty felt by

voters at the ballot box this year has

been so difficult to decide why is that

because they were all over the place I

think a lot of the Democratic candidates

are great and I probably could have

voted for five of them but it really

just came down to who who I really

agreed with many Democrats remained

undecided up until the last moment

overwhelmed by a crowded field of

candidates and the desire to defeat

Donald Trump I'm praying that he doesn't

get in in November so who's the person

to beat him it's got to be Biden or

Sanders somebody within the party

but joe biden's campaign appears to be

faltering early down in the polls and

reportedly low on cash we're still

mildly hopeful here in New Hampshire and

we'll see what happens all right bye

left New Hampshire before the results

were known to rally with supporters in

South Carolina where he hopes to turn

things around

Pete Buda jabs the young former mayor of

South Bend Indiana has grabbed many of

Biden's voters can you pull off the big

success and it feels like it's taping up

well positioning himself as a moderate

and electable alongside senator Amy

Klobuchar who too has seen her number

surged she won two of New Hampshire's

small precincts overnight but it's the

progressive wing of the party led by

Bernie Sanders that could be on the path

to a statewide victory buoyed by a

strong showing in Iowa and legions of

grassroots supporters nationwide the guy

is stuck to his roots from beginning to

end

Jackson all the polls closed now what

are the early results well Donna with

about a quarter of the results in Bernie

Sanders is in the lead no surprise he's

from the neighborhood

p-goon a judge in second but the

breakout star of the night seems to be

Amy Klobuchar she was fifth after Iowa

right now she's in a very strong third

place position a massive increase in

numbers for her and so Donna leaving the

state she may be one to watch while

candidates like Joe Biden try to salvage

their campaigns

all right wants to still watch for

Jackson and New Hampshire things still

ahead the snowfall of a decade that is

melting hearts it's not often you can

have a snowball fight in Baghdad this is

just the second time in a century Iraq's

capital has seen snow the last time was

2008 this wintery wonder is mostly

melted now but the snow brought a

welcome moment of delight a former

dictator may finally face justice

Sudan's Omar al-bashir may finally

appear before the International Criminal

Court where he's charged with war crimes

crimes against humanity and genocide

Bashir was ousted from power last April

after nearly three decades of ruling the

country with an iron fist in a dramatic

shift Sudan's new government has

promised to send anyone facing an ICC

warrant to the hague to face trial the

court issued warrants for Basheer's

arrest in 2009 and 2010 he's accused of

masterminding a scorched earth campaign

in the Darfur region that killed 300,000

people and forced nearly 3 million

people from their homes

I'm Heather Eurex West in Drumheller

Alberta where paleontologists have

discovered a new species of Tyrannosaur

13 million years older than t-rex that

story ahead on global national

and there you have it a Canadian record

for the Toronto Raptors they beat the

Minnesota Timberwolves in Toronto last

night giving them the longest winning

streak in a single season by a major

professional team based in Canada the

Calgary Stampeders held the record until

now after 14 straight wins back in 2016

well it's not a raptor but it is

Canadian and it's making headlines

around the world a new dinosaur species

has been discovered in Alberta it's

thought to be the oldest member of the

t-rex family and just its name is enough

to make you shudder Heather York's West

explains how the Reaper of death was

found there's a reason why this Monster

is known as the king the fierce t-rex

has inspired movies and captured our

imagination for more than 100 years but

UFC researchers have now discovered

another Tyrannosaur roamed the earth

millions of years before the mighty

t-rex hunted its prey Senado thristy

comes from a time period that's roughly

seventy nine point five million years

old so that's a rock layer which is the

oldest point in Canada where we start

getting dinosaur fossils the fossilized

skull fragments were first discovered in

southern Alberta 10 years ago but it

wasn't until PhD student Jared Morris

began studying the bones that he

realized how special they were I came by

looking at it and noticed that's when I

started noticing the features that kind

of made it distinct a new species of

Tyrannosaur much older than canadian

scientists had ever seen before

I think that's really important with

this particular specimen is that it is

the oldest Tyrannosaur known from sort

of northerly North America which is

really exciting because it tells us

about a period of time that we know very

little about dinosaur ecosystems

paleontologists only know of two other

dinosaurs from this period of time a

duckbill and a horned dinosaur but as a

vicious carnivore Thanatos would have

been at the top of the food chain the

animal would have been a typical

Tyrannosaurus this means it's a

two-legged animal with very short four

limbs only two fingers on its hand and

the big massive skulls with big fat

teeth Thanatos was smaller than t-rex

illustrating to scientists

that as the species evolved tyrannosaurs

grew Thanatos also looked a little

different it had a series of ornamental

bumps on its snout of course researchers

are still trying to figure out why it

lived here who else was around

Morris hopes to find those answers as he

continues his career right now though

he's focused on finishing that PhD

Heather Eurex West Global News

Drumheller Alberta and that is global

national for this Tuesday I'm Donna

Friesen tonight's your Canada is this

coyote hanging out in Calgary we'd love
