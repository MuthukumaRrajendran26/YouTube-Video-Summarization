federal opposition parties are figuring

out their strategies after last week's

election and there's been much

speculation about the future of

conservative party leader Andrew Shearer

a former Tory cabinet minister added to

that speculation today our Michael

Couture is following that for us tonight

Mike O'Donnell we've been speaking to

conservatives who have been standing

behind leader Andrew Shearer in the

campaign that they ran but there's been

one nagging question namely how is it

that Shearer was unable to defeat a

prime minister who is facing the SNC

lavell a controversy two breaches of the

ethics laws and the blackface brownface

story a few people have addressed that

publicly until today when it came from

the man who's been rumored to have

strong interest in running to take over

the leadership of the party Peter MacKay

was in Washington DC at the Kennedy

Institute at the Wilson Center he's

participating in a panel discussion on

the Canadian election and he put the

conservative failure very bluntly what

I'm gonna do is just ask you the

question that everyone's thinking is

what exactly happened yeah they use a

good Canadian analogy it was like having

a breakaway on an open net and missing

the net you you sort of gave a litany of

some of the issues that were dogging

Prime Minister Trudeau heading into the

election you left out his trip to India

and the SNC lavell an affair which is a

much more serious issue that is still a

live issue and Donna the conservative

leadership group has been meeting in

Ottawa over what went wrong but the

really tough questions will be coming

from those outgoing and returning MPs

next week on Wednesday when the

Conservatives hold their caucus meeting

on Parliament Hill all right Michael

Couture in Ottawa fakes
