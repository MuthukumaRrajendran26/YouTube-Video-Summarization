in June 1961 East Germany's leader Volta

Obrist was asked if the rumors were true

the city would be split in two nobody

has the intention of building a wall he

said two months later the soft city

border was closed up the last route for

East Germans to escape communism was

gone over nice families friends and

neighbors were separated and over years

and decades one city became to accept it

you just had to accept the wall says

former East Berliner Dagmar sim Dorn in

some ways the wall was the end of the

world she says Angelika bondic lived a

stone's throw away on the western side

near a section that remains preserved my

husband used to drink a beer out here

he'd raise a glass to the guards but

they just stare back she says it was

easier for West Berliners to laugh they

could visit the east but the so-called

Ozzie's were locked in on November 9th

1989 each hammer blow was filled with 28

years of emotion and when Sim Doren saw

the first hole in the wall it barely

seemed real it was almost like Alice in

Wonderland she says he just stood there

with an open mouth Canadian Prime

Minister Brian Mulroney was the first

Western leader to visit Soviet premier

Mikhail Gorbachev after the wall came

down there's been a revolution this

taken place in thinking and in the lives

of Nations in the last month the by then

unstoppable process led to the end of

the Soviet Union and the Cold War today

the Berlin Wall is as much about tourism

as it is a lesson of history where you

can buy an authentic piece of the wall

at your own risk for some visitors 30

years is more than a lifetime ago

I guess it's quite shocking to see how

it would have split communities

and also I don't know to me at the

moment I'm thinking more places where

there still are wolf this art

installation is part of the effort to

keep reminding the world of the scars

and the spirit of this reunited city
