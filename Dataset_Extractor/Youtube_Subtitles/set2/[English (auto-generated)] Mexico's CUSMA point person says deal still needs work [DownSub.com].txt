I've been very pleased to hear all the

advances we go we know there's still a

little more work to do that little more

work on see us ma Prime Minister Trudeau

is talking about is on labor reform

Friday Mexico's point man on the new

NAFTA hey-zeus say a day admitted

there's been pressure for reform from

Canada and the US

buddy points out Mexico is willing to

change under the new government so this

is a really nice convergence it's a

convergence but not quite a consensus

labor leaders in Canada and particularly

the US have been leery of Mexico's

willingness to enforce higher labor

standards that my American friends have

been insisting they have to be able to

be able to inspect those félicité

facilities if there's the complaint in

regard to adherence to the commitment

that Mexico has made here and that is a

red line for the Mexicans we would not

accept this long ranger inspectors being

called in 12 hours later wouldn't they -

to see a factory where this is seen

being permitted that's not that's where

Canada comes in Canada and Mexico have

for a while now been working closely on

supporting Mexico's very ambitious work

on labor reform a Canada is sharing best

practices on labor administration for

instance ensuring unionized workers in

Mexico of basic rights like voting for

what union they want to join and the key

is if Mexico doesn't follow through I

hope that there is some penalties to say

if you don't live up to your obligation

you're gonna have some very difficulty

is exporting your products into the

Canadian the US market and it's unclear

if that will make it into the final text

in time for the US Congress to pass the

new NAFTA before Christmas then it'll be

up to our government to reintroduce a

ratification bill because the previous

one died when the election was called so

although ratification is getting closer

there's still no firm timeline for when

that my

happen michael--ah cooter global news
