again I love you as a person and I don't

wish anything bad on you I don't know if

this is possible but okay can I give her

a hug please

speak for myself I I forgive you and I

know if you go to God and ask him he

will forgive you

and I don't think anyone could sit again

I'm speaking for myself not even bad for

my family but I love you just like

anyone else and I'm not gonna say I hope

you rot and die it's just like my

brother did but I see I I personally

want the best for you and I wasn't gonna

ever say this in front of my family or

anyone but I don't even want you to go

to jail

I want the best for you because I know

that's what that's exactly what both one

would want you to do and the best would

be gave your life to Christ thank you

you all may be seated

I'm sorry mr. Rogers and miss miss

dagger which police they have the jury

having reached a verdict I will now

announce it we the jury find you nan we

the jury find unanimously that the

defendant did not cause the death of

both of Jon while under the immediate

influence of sudden passion arising from

an adequate cost and assess the

defendants punishment at ten years

imprisonment in the Texas Department of

Criminal Justice in addition we assessed

a fine of $0 and it's signed by the

presiding juror would you like to have

the jury pause okay is there any legal

reason why this sentence should not now

be imposed it is therefore the order

judgment decree of the court that you be

taken by the sheriff of Dallas County

and safely transported by her to an

agent or representative of the texas

department of criminal justice and there

you shall be confined until your

sentence is discharged your sentence

will begin today and you will receive

credit for any back time that you had

September 6 2018 changed my life change

my family's life change my country

change my church and I know that there

are many people who stood with me and my

family

throughout this tumultuous journey

yesterday we saw the conviction of amber

Geiger and today we heard the sentence

of 10 years in prison that 10 years in

prison is 10 years for her reflection

and for her to change her life but there

is much more to be done by the city of

Dallas the corruption that we saw during

this process must stop and it must stop

for you because after now I leave Dallas

but you live in Dallas and it must stop

for everyone the contamination of a

crime scene that we saw coming out of

this case is one that must never happen

again the poor training or the poor use

of what should have been training is

what we see coming out of this case that

should never ever happen again and if

this was applied in the way that it

ought to have been taught my son would

have been alive today if Amber Geiger

was trained not to shoot in the heart my

son would be standing here today he was

no threat to her he had no reason to

pose a threat to her because he was in

his own apartment

in his sanctuary in the a lot of money

to be
