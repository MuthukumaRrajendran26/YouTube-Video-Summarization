some of Trudeau's political opponents

say what he did reflect who he really is

privileged and not as enlightened as he

pretends to be we'll get to the

conservative leader in just a moment but

we begin with NDP leader Judd neat Singh

he is the first person of color to lead

a federal party in Canada and his

reaction is focused on the impact the

images might have on people of color

especially kids

Abigail Beeman is covering the NDP

leaders campaign Abigail what was jug

meetings first reaction to the images

Donna was raw and emotional but also

measured Singh saying he felt compelled

to speak out thinking of all those

affected by racism who can't speak out a

campaign source tells me while they had

a team meeting beforehand what you're

about to hear wasn't rehearsed

no one knew exactly what Singh was going

to say when I was growing up I fought

racists I dealt with them myself and I

fought back but I got a message from a

friend who reminded me that there's a

lot of people out there they couldn't do

that they couldn't fight back they

didn't have the ability to do that this

is very painful for a lot of people then

today a different less emotional tone

but the same message I asked saying

whether he thought Trudeau should have

owned up to the video obtained by Global

News before the story broke owned up to

all instances where he wore racist

makeup yes I think Canadians would

expected that you had mentioned whenever

it happened however this turns out for

the Liberals aside the way Singh handled

this very much feels like a turning

point in the third place NDP campaign

Ontario Andrew Shearer in the

conservative campaign R in Quebec taking

direct aim at Justin Trudeau no support

for the Liberal leader remains an

obstacle for Shearer even after the

bombshell revelations of the last 24

hours

sheers main message at every rally on

this campaign has centered on how

Canadians just can't trust Trudeau

attacking his ethics and personal

judgment as a leader as sheer attacked

Trudeau again today for initially giving

the impression that he had gone racist

makeup twice when it was in fact more

that lapse playing right into the hands

of the

as they try to paint Trudeau as someone

who was insincere and doesn't think the

rules apply to him he indicated that

there's only one other incidents and now

we know that there was at least three so

once again we see with Justin Trudeau a

one set of rules for himself and one set

of rules for the rest of us Shearer

isn't asking for Justin Trudeau to step

down as Prime Minister but he says the

Liberal leader has embarrassed Canada

and no longer has the moral authority to

govern this country
