on this Tuesday night a new suspected

case of the corona virus in Canada what

we know about the latest patient and

what about the Canadians under lockdown

in Wuhan China who want out we're

looking at all options plus balancing

fear with facts I asked an expert in

infectious disease about whether trying

to contain it is working the UK says yes

to some Huawei 5g technology defying the

US what will Canada do backlash to

president Trump's Middle East peace plan

why critics say Israel is pulling all

the strings and taking a perilous plunge

in Antarctica this place is under threat

one man's call to action while braving

bone-chilling waters

global national with Donna freezin

good evening and thanks for joining us

we are continuing to monitor the

outbreak of the mysterious new corona

virus tonight the number of confirmed

cases in China keeps soaring nearly a

week into the biggest quarantine in

history and another presumptive case has

been identified here in Canada a man in

British Columbia who is in his 40s and

regularly goes to China to work as

isolated himself and is waiting for test

results there are two confirmed cases of

the corona virus in Ontario a husband

and wife both in their 50s who recently

came back from Wuhan the center of the

outbreak the virus has now spread to

Japan and Germany and in both cases

authorities say the people who are ill

did not travel to China themselves but

were in contact with someone who had the

German Ministry of Health now says four

people were infected after attending a

company training event last week with a

colleague from Shanghai as many as 40

people may have come in contact with the

woman in China there are now about 6,000

confirmed cases and at least 132 people

have died most of them in Wuhan the US

and the UK are sending passenger planes

to Wuhan to repatriate their citizens

there are 250 Canadians registered in

the region Foreign Affairs says 126 have

contacted the consulate asking for help

to get home but at this point Canada is

not sending a plane to get them we're

trying to contact everyone assess their

specific need for assisted repatriation

we're at the same time consulting with

their allies and and looking at the

different options that people are

considering the US and the UK have now

upgraded their travel warnings advising

citizens to avoid non-essential travel

to all of mainland China and several

Airlines are cutting back on flights to

China at this point Canada has not

expanded its Travel Warning and is still

advising people to avoid the Wuhan

region and who Bay province Redman

Shannon has our top story tonight as if

further evidence were needed that these

are extraordinary times young younger

son Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam wearing

a face mask an item she banned last year

during the pro-democracy protests Lam

announcing that visitor permits

and most travel from the mainland will

be limited after Thursday night Casillas

Hongkongers like this man think it's too

little too late

eight cases have already been reported

in Hong Kong in Beijing the head of the

World Health Organization met with

Chinese President Xi Jinping they agreed

for a w-h-o team to join the 6,000

Chinese medical staff who've been sent

to the affected region the organization

says the emergency remains confined to

China but the global risk is high so far

it's going back with travelers to two

foreign countries where as the home

country of somebody or travel as such

it's not wildly spreading outside of

China but again we have to be prepared

for in case it would in Wuhan stay TV

shows the much-hyped

building of a special new hospital some

prefabricated rooms already in place

most people living in the city remain

holed up at home mani shouting

encouragement to each other from

apartment windows we are not really sure

if they are reporting the truth or like

if they're under reporting the actual

numbers I think you're just like not

knowing what's actually going on and how

long it's gonna last it like gets them

more scary apart and cities near the

affected who Bay Province are increasing

checks to anyone arriving those with

high temperatures sent to hospital

immediately

and more than a thousand kilometers away

in Beijing some empty shelves and long

lineups as the first death from the

virus is confirmed in the capital

Redmond Shannon global news London now

to what we know about the cases here in

Canada here's Heather Eurex West

health officials say Canada's third

presumed case of novel coronavirus

did everything right this is a gentleman

who was well aware of what was going on

in China and when he returned he went

home and he voluntarily self isolated

the man had recently traveled to Wuhan

China but did not have an

symptoms until more than 24 hours after

he returned this person was not

symptomatic on his flight there's no

risk to people who aren't who are in

contact with somebody with no symptoms

but there are questions within the

global medical community around whether

or not that statement is true normally

with a corona virus we see more viral

shedding and more transmission when a

person is more symptomatic China has

reported there may be evidence of a

symptomatic transmission all of these

questions must and will be answered in

order to provide a proper risk

assessment the Chinese Embassy in Canada

is advising all Chinese nationals

returning from Wuhan to isolate

themselves for 14 days at home so far

all cases across North America have been

traced back to China

the coming days and weeks are likely to

bring more confirmed cases here and

around the world including the

possibility of some person to person

spread Studies on the new corona virus

show that on average one sick person can

infect between 1.5 and 3.5 other people

that makes it a bit more infectious than

most seasonal flu strains in which sick

people can infect between 1 and 1.5

others but less infectious than SARS

which spreads from one to two to five

others it's why public health officials

are doing all they can to prevent an

outbreak isolating and testing anyone

who traveled to WHO by province and has

now become ill we need to be very

vigilant there are people who have

travelled who are here who might be

incubating this virus who might be

becoming sick in the next couple of

weeks and that's why it's so critical

that we maintain our focus because the

success of their efforts will be

measured in the days ahead

hether your ex West Global News Calgary

as this story keeps evolving there are

many questions and it's important to

balance fear with facts so to help us do

that I'm joined again by dr. Michael

guard him he's an infectious disease

specialist and chief of staff at Humber

River Hospital in Toronto dr. garden

let's start with the news of the

confirmed cases in Germany and Japan in

both cases the people had not traveled

to China the man in Germany was in

contact with a woman who had come from

Wuhan but apparently did not have any

symptoms until she was on the flight

back there does that

raise alarm bells for you about the

virus spreading and possibly spreading

when people don't have symptoms well you

know certainly seeing cases that are

occurring in places where this has been

imported where somebody who travelled

has given it to somebody else we've been

we've been looking for that the whole

time along so that isn't the big

surprise the issue here is how

contagious is this virus when people

have mild symptoms and honestly it's

really hard to sort of set world wide

policy on one case right so we really

need to be cautious saying that the

virus is highly infectious in that

setting

typically with viruses people are mildly

contagious if they have minimal symptoms

and they're much more contagious if they

have a lot of symptoms so it's it's

possible it can certainly transmit if

people have mild disease or maybe even

no symptoms but it's certainly less

likely than if they're sick so is it too

early than to be definitive about the

transmissibility of this virus when

people are contagious and it how exactly

it's spreading absolutely I mean we need

to take a step back I mean typically

with other viruses what we've done is

we've looked at people where we we have

a good idea when they got infected and

then we're doing serial swabbing on them

to see at what point they start to shed

the virus at what point that they start

to develop symptoms none of that has

been done with this particular virus so

I think we are too early to get very

definitive about how it is transmitted

if we take a big step back though and

look at the epidemiology the spread

seems to be similar to what we saw

during SARS which is that people who are

sick are the most likely ones who are

actually spreading it well given the

unknowns and given what you just said

should people who have been to the wuhan

region B style self isolating as a

precaution right now that's not

recommended I mean it's a very good

question right now what we're looking at

is people who have who have symptoms

that may change over time but you can

imagine if we start to broaden that case

definition we're now anybody who comes

from Wuhan is isolated or take it even

further a lot of calls I've been getting

today is why are we isolating every

person who's even been in China you can

imagine that very quickly overwhelms the

Public Health System so early on we have

to be very sort of surgical in what

we're doing and if necessary we start to

move out

we have to remember the area that's been

locked down we're talking 35 and some

million people so the vast majority of

people from that region do not have this

virus okay

well watch and wait and hopefully speak

with you again dr. garden thank you

thanks for having me

two other news tonight the u.s. says it

is disappointed the UK government has

given Huawei the go-ahead to build parts

of its new 5g network president Donald

Trump claims the Chinese tech giant

can't be trusted and is a threat to

national security but it is the world

leader in 5g technology and as Abigail

Beeman reports Canada too is on the cusp

of making a big decision about it

British ministers meeting at 10 Downing

Street to discuss Huawei deciding to

allow the company to be part of a future

5g network with restrictions so-called

high risk vendor involvement is capped

at 35 percent and they're not allowed to

be part of the core we're sensitive

personal data is kept we would never

take decisions that threaten our

national security or the security of our

five eyes partners the decision goes

against what the US wanted they're

worried about Chinese influence and it

leaves Canada as the only member of the

five eyes intelligence network yet to

make a huawei decision Australia and New

Zealand banned it we know how important

it is to make sure that there is both

competitiveness in the Canadian industry

but also security for Canadian users

that's why we're working with our five

eyes allies working with international

partners looking at the security

concerns doesn't seem to me that it's in

our interests to to accept that risk

you don't think Canada's own former head

of CSIS Wardell Cox says Canada is in a

different situation from the Brits they

probably can push the envelope more than

we can we have a communication system

which was integrated which is integrated

with the American system I think that

makes our problem harder than it is for

the British we're very respectful of

that process we're participating in that

process and all we've ever asked and I

think it's fair for Canadians to expect

this is that any decision on Huawei in

Canada is made based on cybersecurity

and technology and not based on politics

of course there is a broader context to

Canadians detained in China and Huawei

executor

moong Wong Jo in the middle of an

extradition case under house arrest in

Vancouver I think it's very important

that we get to Mike respect but it's not

directly tied to that decision is it

holding back you see the Public Safety

Minister wouldn't answer he says they're

working on a made in Canada solution

while experts save the decision is

likely to be a no they don't expect it

to come anytime soon

given the high stakes with China Abigail

Beeman Global News Ottawa if the federal

government decides not to go with Huawei

then what Rogers is the only big telecom

company to begin rolling out a

fifth-generation Network in Canada it's

partnered with Swedish supplier Ericsson

to provide the technology BCE Bell

Canada enterprises and Telus have yet to

select a vendor they're awaiting a

decision from Ottawa nokia could be a

big contender the federal government

announced 40 million dollars in funding

to the Finnish telecom giant last year

to conduct research on 5g wireless

technology in Canada and Samsung is also

a major player it's already secured a

deal to supply equipment to Quebec's

Videotron the case against Cameron ortus

was back in court today in Ottawa he's

the high ranking civilian intelligence

official with the RCMP accused of

violating Canada's secrecy laws charges

laid against artists were moved to the

Superior Court by the Crown prosecutor

to speed up the trial his lawyers says

he's having issues communicating with

his client because of concerns they

might breach the security of Information

in 2015 his bail was revoked in November

and he's being in custody ever since we

now know the full cost of the failed

prosecution of retired Vice Admiral Marc

Norman the federal government spent more

than 1.4 million dollars on the breach

of trust case new documents tabled in

the House of Commons don't reveal the

breakdown of those costs in 2015 norman

about a federal shipbuilding contract

worth nearly 700 million dollars Norman

cheri after reaching an undisclosed

financial settlement with the federal

government Palestinians are furious

tonight at the American president

coming up why Trump's plan for peace has

ignited protests

President Trump has unveiled his plan

for Middle East peace he calls it the

deal of the century but one party to it

the Palestinians were nowhere in sight

today Israel's Prime Minister was though

Benjamin Netanyahu who was indicted at

home today on charges of bribery fraud

and breach of trust was by Donald

Trump's side critics say that's the

problem that this plan cannot possibly

lead to peace because it's an Israeli

plan wrapped in an American envelope

Jackson prosecco explains believing he

can defy history President Donald Trump

revealed his plan to bring peace to the

Middle East all prior administration's

from President Lyndon Johnson have tried

and bitterly failed but I was not

elected to do small things or shy away

from big problems the 80 page proposal

strongly favors Israel it was drafted by

Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and is

already backed by Israeli Prime Minister

Benjamin Netanyahu it addresses the root

cause of the conflict the incident by

insisting that the Palestinians will

finally have to recognize Israel as the

Jewish state the plan would redraw the

map creating a Palestinian state with

limited sovereignty Israeli settlements

in the West Bank would remain Israel

would also keep control over Jerusalem's

holy sites under this vision Jerusalem

will remain Israel's undivided very

important undivided capital almost

immediately protests erupted in Jordan

while Palestinian leaders who were not

at the table branded the plan as a

conspiracy it just looks like Trump with

all of his strong support of Israel from

the get-go is yet one more time try to

do a favor for his friends in Jerusalem

and Tel Aviv that's what it feels like

to most people previous American

presidents have tried to bring the two

sides together to negotiate that too

ended in failure

Trump's plan was likely dead the moment

it was announced but it's already being

used as a road map by Netanyahu who

plans to move ahead to annex West Bank

settlements in the coming days

Jackson proce co Global News Washington

I had the surprised protest against a

controversial tennis player

in California investigators from the

National Transportation Safety Board say

the helicopter that NBA legend Kobe

Bryant was on descended suddenly at

2,000 feet a minute and described the

crash as a high-energy impact

investigators spent all day documenting

the crash scene the remains of the

chopper and all the bodies have now been

removed the crash killed Bryant his 13

year old daughter and all seven others

on board it was foggy at the time and

the pilot had received special

permission to fly in low visibility

conditions the helicopter did not have a

terrain awareness warning system on

board

despite the NTSB recommending the FAA

make it mandatory on all helicopters

like the one Bryant was on it helps

prevent unintentional impacts with the

ground to tennis greats are using the

Australian Open as a platform to protest

the legacy of a well-known Australian

player there's only one thing longer

than the list of Margaret courts tennis

achievements it's her list of offensive

and homophobic statements that's John

McEnroe he's criticizing the Australian

Open for honoring Margaret Court on the

50th anniversary of her grand slam she

holds the record for Grand Slam singles

titles and she's been widely criticized

for her homophobic and racist views

today Martina Navratilova grabbed the

mic at Melbourne's Margaret Court arena

to demand the name of that arena be

changed the live feed was cut off as she

tried to address the crowd the two

tennis stars then unfurled a banner to

rename the arena after indigenous

champion Evonne Goolagong Cawley next

why a swimmer took a Polar Plunge

through Antarctica's ice glaciers it's

been two centuries since Antarctica was

discovered and the anniversary is being

marked by a sobering world record an

Englishman known as the human polar bear

has completed the first ever swim under

the Antarctic Ice Sheet it's part of his

campaign to raise awareness about the

impact of climate change and the

region's dire need for political

protection

Geoff Semple explains

the world's coldest continent is both

perilous and peaceful Antarctica's icy

landmass twice the size of Australia

remained hidden untouched by humans

until 200 years ago now we've been down

there all the world was on the charts

was ice that was that was it so he went

actually off the charts this Russian

naval officer was the first person known

to have laid eyes on Antarctica's ice

shelf in 1820 that discovery sparked a

rush of hunters and other explorers

seeking to plant their flag and lay

their claim to Earth's final frontier

countries for example went to great

lengths to put their Antarctic stations

all over Antarctica and to raise

national flags to say we're here we're

busy this is ours some countries such as

Argentina even transported a pregnant

woman to give birth on the frozen

continent hoping to strengthen their

claim today those territorial tensions

are mostly kept at bay thanks to a

global treaty of more than 50 countries

including Canada to promote scientific

cooperation but the continent now faces

a much greater existential threat

Antarctica has been frozen for millions

of years at the end of the last ice age

the continents Ice Sheet was shrinking

at a rate of around one meter per year

but scientists warn that process is

accelerating the ice melting six times

faster as climate change turns up the

heat Lewis Pugh has seen the impact of

rising sea levels up close the British

endurance swimmer nicknamed the human

polar bear just became the first person

to swim beneath an Antarctica ice sheet

to show the world what it's about to

lose

anything as beautiful Issus scientists

recently revealed that underwater

glacial melting is happening up to a

hundred times faster than they thought

this place needs protecting it needs

protecting because all our futures

depend on it

view is now calling on those same

countries who agreed to share this

continent to also help ensure it doesn't

look much different 200 years from now

Geoff sample global news and that's

global national for this Tuesday I'm

donor freezin tighter Canada is an

update on those two as M bony drivers

who use their homemade Zamboni to clear

their backyard rink in vernon bc there

they are the vancouver canucks invited
