for months every year Haitians fill port

apprentices dry riverbeds with garbage

when the rainy season comes a torrent of

plastic gets washed out to sea it's not

dissimilar to what's happening in the

rest of the world 8 million tons of

plastic is getting dumped in our

waterways every year and by 2050 it's

estimated there will be more plastic in

the ocean than fish getting to our

breaks down plastics into micro plastics

which never decompose those bits float

around until fish consumed them the rest

deepest areas of the oceans so who's to

blame for our plastic woes the biggest

polluting countries are all in Asia with

China by far contributing the most by

volume Indonesia the Philippines Vietnam

and Sri Lanka round out the top five

but when you consider the amount of

waste created per capita number two is

the US and number one Canada so the

solution is never going to be a silver

bullet in the form of a single

technology or single waste management or

recycling decision the solution is going

to be on the part of many people that

can step up to the plate and take action

this is about this is not about the

blame game now it's more about a call

for drastic action stop the plastic

getting in the water at the source and

get to the existing garbage patches

before they degrade and sink a group

calling itself the ocean cleanup has put

millions into developing giant

parachute-like devices that capture

waste caught in the currents but it's

not yet ready to be deployed and

for four more but realistically neither

micro plastic crisis is getting worse

unchecked we could soon be consuming

pieces of the problem we created
