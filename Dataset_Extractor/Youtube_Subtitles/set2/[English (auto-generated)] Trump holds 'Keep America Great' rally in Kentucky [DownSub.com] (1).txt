original Lee Greenwood thank you thank

you man

great guy

well I just want to say a very big hello

Kentucky

it's great to be here in the home of a a

group called the wild catch ever hear

the Kentucky

and by the way they play at a very big

arena this place look at this Wow hello

up there

[Music]

this is incredible with thousands of

proud hard-working freedom-loving

american patriots which is what you are

tomorrow the people of Kentucky will

head to the polls and you will vote to

reelect you're terrific Republican

governor Matt Bevin he's done a

fantastic job

a fantastic job and we're sending a

signal by doing that to the rest of the

country to the rest of the world that

the Republican Party you know what we

stand for but you see what's happening

with the Democrats they have gone crazy

to do nothing Democrats and then not

getting it done under Republican

leadership the economy is booming wages

are rising confidence is soaring

Kentucky is thriving like never ever

before and America is stronger than ever

before

[Applause]

Kentucky's unemployment rate has reached

the lowest point in the history of our

country that's not fair

and I want to just tell you that you

have incredible representatives and the

job that Matt Bevin has done as governor

he's had to do some things that you had

to do and he's done them unbelievably

well and it sets you up to be a rocket

ship in the future you had to do it so I

just want to thank him for having the

courage to do what he had to do but you

have the best numbers you've ever had in

the history of the state and with the

help of your Senate Majority Leader

Mitch McConnell

we have confirmed 157 judges to follow

the Constitution as written

and we're supporting our police we're

rebuilding our military with defeating

radical Islamic terrorists like never

before

the monstrous animal known as

al-baghdadi is dead

and the man that took his place is dead

also

[Applause]

American Special Forces gave the world's

number one terrorist a one-way ticket to

hell

no enemy on earth stands a chance

against the awesome power of the United

States military which is now stronger

than ever before we've rebuilt it and it

was all made in America and our country

is winning again and our country is

highly respected again

but while we are creating jobs and

killing terrorists the Radical Democrats

are going totally insane

they want to obliterate the rule of law

drive out faith from the public square

saya and you know this silence you

online confiscate your guns

[Music]

[Applause]

you better be careful

the Second Amendment very very important

very precious they are after your Second

Amendment with us

nobody is touching our Second Amendment

and that includes the gentleman that's

running against Matt they're after your

Second Amendment we can't let that

happen

they want to indoctrinate your children

you know this destroy anyone who holds

traditional American values all you have

to do is ask the boys from Covington

Catholic High School

some of whom are here tonight the

far-left wants to impose their

authoritative ideology on the nation

telling you what to think what to

believe and how you should live

they want to erase our traditions our

culture our history and our heroes they

want to subjugate you and break you to

their will but Kentucky will never be

broken

Kentucky can't be broken you're too

strong and you're too smart in their

crazed thirst for power the Democrats

are trying to tear our country apart

first Democrats engineered the Russia

hoax the most egregious fraud ever

foisted upon the American people the

Russian house then they did the Muller

scam you remember that the Muller scan

two years and they said nothing and then

mr. Muller testified that was a

wonderful day for being

and you remember last week I don't know

tulsi gabbard but Hillary Clinton said

that tulsi gabbard is a Russian agent

I don't know Jill Stein she's a greenie

and that's fine

she's a greenie Jill Stein but Jill

Stein was an agent of Russia also these

people are crazy

now corrupt politicians Nancy Pelosi of

Adam Schiff

they are corrupt and Nancy

unlike Kentucky which is doing great

Nancy oughta stop wasting time go back

to her district in San Francisco help

the homeless get rid of the drugs get

rid of the needles that are lying all

over the street and all of the things

that are washing into the ocean through

their storm sewer system what's happened

to San Francisco and what's happened to

so many other places run by the radical

left Democrats

it's unbelievable Los Angeles you take a

look at Los Angeles looks like a

third-world city but go back to Nancy's

area look at what's happened there's

been no place in the country

that's gone down like the area that

Nancy Pelosi represents and she's

wasting all overtime and you know what

it's backfiring you say it but the media

and the Democrats have launched an even

more brazen assault in our nation with a

deranged type of partisan impeachment

wicked impeach

so today we just hit the highest number

in the history of the stock market and

that's hundreds of

so last week think of this in the

history of our country it's never done

better and by the way this that rich

that's that poor that's for everybody

your 401 k s-- how you doing pretty good

right pretty good people tell me that

their wives their husbands all of a

sudden they've been running the 401 KS

for years and they totally lost respect

for let's say the husband totally lost

respect now they think he's a financial

genius because he's a 74 percent she

says darling I love you you are the most

incredible brilliant financial mind and

you know what if the Democrats get in

that's not going down by 50% that's

going down to nothing it's gonna be

worthless gonna be worthless you'll have

it depression the likes of which you've

never seen

mark my words but hopefully we don't

have to even think about it

and that was going to happen here when

we took over that was going down in the

wrong direction and don't forget that

was zero interest we're paying interest

in other words people are now getting

interest on their money but that was

with zero inches real easy with zero

interest last week the Democrats voted

to try and nullify the ballots of tens

of millions of Americans to be exact 63

million people disgracing themselves and

bringing shame upon the House of

Representatives

they've been plotting to overthrow the

election since the first hour that we

won and actually before we won they were

plotting to overthrow this election

before we 119 minutes after I took the

oath of office that disgusting

Washington Post look at all these people

back there look

fake news media it's the fake news look

at all of them

[Applause]

what they don't know is that when we

hang it up in five years or nine years

or 13 years or maybe 17 years

or maybe if I still have this strength

21 years

see now they're going crazy but now

their sakes see I told you he was a

dictator he wants to take charge in

control of our country these people are

crazy

yeah if you have one nut job on

television he's sitting down doing an

interview recently and he looks at the

person he's interviewing and he goes

like he's in total depression total

depression and he goes he good fans up

there thank you

he goes you know he's going to win don't

you

you know he's going to win like like

deficit the guy goes well we're gonna

fight to the Wigan no no he's going to

win you know he's never leaving office

don't you he's never going to leave

often these people are crazy

but that disgusting newspaper that's

right there The Washington Post declared

the campaign to impeach President Trump

has just begun

all right you can get them out

be gentle be gentle be very gentle you

know every time I say get him out of

here I end up getting sued he says you

know they say og here at my arm all

right so be very gentle please I don't

want to get sued plea virgin very urgent

he's gone home to mom

argue

by the way do we love our law

enforcement

and in the whole world even on a Monday

night you know I like the Monday nights

because I think we're 58 and oh that's a

good record even for the Wildcats that's

a good

we're 58 and all but even on a Monday

night

is there anything cooler than being at a

trump rally

nothing with last week's vote the far

left has declared war on American

democracy itself these people are

lunatics in the face of these attacks

Republicans are the most unified that

I've ever seen and I've been watching

them and been a big part of them for a

long time and the Democrats have never

witnessed anything like it and they know

they're not gonna win in 2020 so let's

see what can we do to win but that's not

working too well you'll see the American

people are fed up with Democrat lives

hoaxes slander the Democrats outrageous

conduct has created an angry majority

that will vote that do-nothing Democrats

the hell out of office soon

[Applause]

tomorrow Kentucky as a chance to send

the radical Democrats a message you will

vote to reject the Democrats extremism

socialism and corruption and you will

vote to reelect Kentucky governor Matt

Bevin boost on a great job

Matt's a veteran he's a patriot

he's done it all he's been a very very

successful business leader he put his

whole life at stake to help this state

and the job he's done is incredible

under his leadership Kentucky has

created over 57,000 new jobs but I

helped also we work together now he is

difficult I have to say you know maybe

it goes of the election but it's okay

here look he's such a pain when he needs

something for Kentucky like money like

aid like he wants me to call one of the

many manufacturers now that are coming

into Kentucky could you call the head of

some company in Japan please

I say Matt do I have to do it please

please but isn't that really what you

wanted a governor

that's what you want he's such a pain in

the ass but that's what you want

[Applause]

and the job he's done one of the best in

the country not the best he's been an

incredible Mathers strong one crime and

tough on illegal immigration thank you

he's Pro work pro life and 100%

pro-second amendment

and by the way you're gonna lose your

second Amendment if you voted Democrat

you think I'm kidding I see what they're

saying I watch what they're doing

they're calling me all the time you will

lose your second Amendment as soon I'm

telling you as sure as you're standing

here is anybody sitting nobody ever sits

you can sit if you what now do you stand

you know what they say the fake news

look you've been standing nobody sat I

don't know it's is that exciting that

nobody said you know they say no you

know what they say they say Trump only

got one standing ovation because they

stood at the beginning and they never

sat down but they don't save the second

part

that's great great great spirit you know

why you love our country and you see

what's happening we have turned this big

monster ship we have turned it around

and we need so badly you know it's like

you plant the tree it takes a look we

have to get those roots to hold we have

the best unemployment numbers in the

history of our country so many things so

many things the best employment numbers

we have the best of everything and I

think I'm gonna count but I think it's

like a hundred and eighteen I told you

we have a record stock market today I

think about a hunt I'm gonna have to

check it because you know with the fake

news if I'm off by a half a point if

it's if it's 117 and not 180 even if I

go under they report it they say he

didn't tell the truth it was really 119

but I like a lot over a hundred where we

had the highest stock market in our

history think of that that's incredible

but Matt Bevin has made record

investments and education spending for

Kentucky students education is so

important to him Matt Bevin will defend

your Kentucky values

he loves his state from an all-out

assault being waged in you from the

extreme left not good I can't even

imagine how can you vote for somebody

from the extreme left you know this guy

Beshear is a major lefty you know that

right why are we even wait let's just

have a good time are you sure we need an

election tomorrow Matt I don't know how

does Kentucky vote for a person I'm

telling you he will always vote for

Pelosi and Schumer and shifty shifty how

about this guy how about Jeff he makes

up a conversation

he gets up before the United States

Congress he repeats my conversation with

the head of the Ukraine the new

president a good guy repeats it I said I

never said that

he made a horrible statement it was a

total lie and then I actually wanted to

release the actual conversation and you

haven't heard about the whistleblower

after that have you because the

whistleblower said lots of things that

were so good folks you're going to find

out but these are very dishonest people

shifty Schiff but Matt's running against

these people and we have to send them a

sign because they're dangerous the

radical left named Andy Beshear who

rejects everything Kentucky stands for

that's who they want to win

Basheer is openly pledged to stop the

policies of donald trump what are the

policies take care of our vets take care

of our military we want jobs we want

companies to stop leaving us they're not

leaving anymore you see companies aren't

leaving anymore

have you noticed remember years ago

before I ever thought of doing this I

mean when I said let's do this I said

they are great now first lady I said

Melania let's give it a shot and then

one by one we were doing good and what

we've done if you remember before we ran

companies were leaving Kentucky they

were leaving they were going to Mexico

they were going to China Japan they were

going all over any place but Kentucky

you don't read about that at all now

they're all coming back they're all

coming back but Beshear wants to shut

down your coal shut down your energy

raise your taxes and take a giant

wrecking ball to the greatest economy in

the history of the state of Kentucky the

greatest economy you've ever had he's

going to destroy it and it won't be long

it'll go very quickly you know you're

all sitting there everybody has good

jobs you don't like it you go find

another job it's like the choice I got

for military I got you choice to if you

don't like your job you find another

when you tell the boss say I'm getting

out of here like this guy you go get a

better job for more money Beshear

doesn't represent you he represents the

Washington swamp and he's backed by the

same people trying to overthrow the last

election

Basheer supported crooked Hillary

Clinton and he's funded by the

pro-abortion lobbying and open borders

fanatics open borders let every one poor

writer let of all poor right in but she

wants to bring sanctuary cities to

Kentucky think of that one

[Applause]

releasing violent criminals and aliens

to terrorize innocent Kentucky families

he wants sanctuary cities he hasn't

learned what's happened you know we had

a great election a couple of weeks ago

in North Carolina we won two House seats

we were supposed to lose probably both

of them and we want them by a lot we

want to buy a lot and I think we want

them because of the second amendment

because it's under assault from

Democrats but I think we won also

because of sanctuary cities because some

bad news came out of sanctuary cities

really bad and I think that was a reason

we won both House seats by a lot Beshear

is too liberal too extreme and too

dangerous for the state of Kentucky

tomorrow everybody needs to vote

Republican we got to go Republican all

the way and I want to bring up a man and

I'm I'm serious about this this guy

worked so hard he's a a great natural

talent in business which you needed and

he straightened it out and I'll tell you

what he will be one of the truly great

in the history and maybe the greatest in

the history of this state Matt Bevin

come on up Matt

how do you like having President Trump

in Rupp Arena

this is better this is better than the

final four I'll tell you what in terms

of energy this is extraordinary Thank

You Kentucky it is critical that we go

top to bottom run the slate vote

straight Republican but do your civic

duty let's get out and vote let's send a

message to Washington to the other

states to the United States of America

the Kentucky is leading the way and that

we support the President of the United

States Donald J Trump

so we're also joined tonight by a very

powerful man in Washington your great

senator Mitch McConnell

nobody works harder for Kentucky than

Mitch I will tell you nobody works

harder and frankly maybe more

importantly nobody works smarter it's up

here I know a lot of people that work

hard he worked smart when the Democrat

arsonists and washing tried to destroy

an innocent man named Brett Kavanaugh

now justice Brett Kavanaugh Mitch

refused to cave to the left-wing mob and

that's what it was it was a mob there

has never been a man treated so badly in

Washington as Judge Cavanaugh previously

judged now justice we got a man and he's

been great and he will be great

Mitch confront two tremendous Supreme

Court justices which helped deliver the

largest ever investment in our military

and pass VA choice and VA accountability

for our amazing veterans

now I know bitch's opponent because they

came here do you remember last year

slightly different location and that's

okay it was still the great state of

Kentucky because Andy Barr had Amy

McGrath and extreme liberal against him

and Andy Barr is here with us tonight

and we're gonna introduce him but we

beat her so she said to herself well you

know I failed in Congress now let's go

for the Senate she wanted to go to the

house now she wants to go it's not gonna

work that way extreme liberal anti-gun

lots of different things

Amy McGrath compared my election think

of this one it's so insulting

I shouldn't say yeah why not no it's so

insulting you know you worked so hard

you love your country so much and they

get up to say things she compared it to

9/11 they slander upon our nation

she wants open borders she supports the

impeachment hoax witch-hunt like nobody

and she wants to get rid of me she

wasn't too happy with me last year we

came in Andy and we did a job on her and

this is gonna be easy

and she was caught telling donors

Democrats that she is further left than

anyone in the history of the state of

Kentucky is that what you want

so next November the state needs to

defend its values and vote for

rock-ribbed Kentucky conservative Mitch

McConnell but we're gonna get back to

that later we'll be back many times

we'll be back here many times Mitch

[Applause]

well thank you mr. president for making

America great again

and Matt Bevin is making Kentucky great

again thanks to your help tonight and

working together we're changing the

federal courts forever nobody's done

more to change the court system in the

history of our country than Donald Trump

and mr. president we're gonna keep on

doing it my motto is leave no vacancy

behind

[Applause]

so President Obama left Mitch and me and

Rand and all of us he left a hundred and

forty two openings for judges you're not

supposed to allow any you don't do that

you know they say the most important

thing a president can do is federal

judges right including the Supreme Court

obviously and I came in and I said how

many do we have and they said how many

what sir

I said judge openings and I thought

they'd say none or one or two he said

sir we have 142 I said what I said tell

me again said we have a hundred and

forty two so Mitch and I and Rand would

like to thank very much President Obama

because nobody has ever been so generous

also with us tonight is a great warrior

and a great guy smart strong loves your

state and he's really become a good

friend of mine and I'll tell you he's a

little bit different it's okay but

whenever I've needed him whenever I

needed him he was always there it's true

I mean sometimes like I'd say I don't

need your vote ran good then he'll vote

his own way let's get that little

libertarian touch that's okay

that's okay

but whenever we need and I'm not talking

about me I'm talking about we we need a

vote he's so incredible and he's become

a really good friend and I want to have

him come up for a second Rand Paul your

senator a great warrior president Trump

has great courage he faces down the fake

media every day

but Congress needs to step up and have

equal courage to defend the president

Hunter Biden made $50,000 a month that's

the definition of corruption we know he

got it only because of his family

connections we also now know the name of

the whistleblower the whistleblower

needs to come before Congress as a

material witness because he worked for

Joe Biden at the same time hunter Biden

was getting money from corrupt oligarchs

I say tonight to the media do your job

and print his name

[Applause]

and I say this to my fellow colleagues

in Congress to every Republican in

Washington step up and subpoena hunter

Biden and subpoena the whistleblower

and I say to my colleagues if shifty

ship will not let hunter Biden come and

if you will not bring the whistleblower

for every Republican in Congress should

take a walk and say this is a farce

Wow that was excellent

thank you

thank you very great job he's a warrior

he's a warrior I've always said it also

with us tonight are representatives from

your state that are a fantastic couple

from outside your staple will welcome

them also right but these are also great

fighters great warriors Hal Rogers Brett

Guthrie

Thomas Massie

man we just spoke about one a great

grace Andy Barr

James calmer

great and from an incredible state that

we won 2016 that crooked Hillary said

she's going to win that state didn't

come to close at winning that state it's

a great state and we love the people of

North Carolina congressman mark meadows

along with some of your local great

politicians and a person that's done a

really spectacular job you know in

Michigan a woman she just kept going she

just kept going reminded me by the way

of your governor from the standpoint she

never quit now Republicans hadn't won

Michigan in many many years

she called could you come again could

you do it again could you come make

another speech please I say alright this

is the last well no no no how about a

couple of more and then Bill Clinton

actually told Hillary Clinton you better

get going something's going on in

Michigan you didn't lose Michigan you

better start going no no no the polls

say everything's good and we won the

great state of Michigan for the first

time in many ways and I said when it

came time to pick in the Republican

party chair head of the RNC I said I

gotta get the woman from Michigan Ronna

McDaniel to head it out

and when they were saying how

sophisticated Hillary Clinton's campaign

was you know we're not sophisticated

great

I don't think still remember you're all

doing the catwalk she's got the finest

computer technology in the world yeah

she paid she paid for it but she didn't

get it she has really fantastic geniuses

but I had somebody that was a lot better

than the people that she had and his

name was read parse Cal that he's here

with us campaign what a great job and

our numbers are looking very good but

they give it we're one day short of a

year now can you believe it

less than a year it begins November 3rd

this time we had that great great date

boy November 8th remember was there ever

a day like that in television history

and they have no idea because when we do

hang it up they're all out of business

they know that that's why I think that

we will get I expect to get a full

hearty unbelievable endorsement very

soon from the fairly New York Times and

from the Amazon Washington Post

[Applause]

you know before the elections started

about a month before I announced that I

was gonna do this I said I've never

become a politician I can't believe it

I'm gonna become a politician but I

looked at the New York Times that it was

like a little leaflet that you hand out

at a grocery store right

the wind would blow it away it was dead

I call it the failing New York Times

only because eventually it will fail but

we built it up they do stories in my

entire life I had a few stories on the

front page of the New York Times and now

if I have three or four a day it's like

why are they not covering me anymore and

they're all bad they only they can take

what we did two weeks ago with the

number one terrorist in the world and

they make it look as bad as possible in

fact I love dogs but they gave the dog

full credit they didn't give me any

credit that's okay

the dog got the credit and the dog will

be coming very shortly by the way to the

White House

but they'll be endorsing us and you know

all of these crazy like CNN with its bad

ratings there goes it's read life it

just went off the red light just went

off see it well it's hard look put

yourself in their position they have it

on their covering and now they know

they're ready to get hit so they turn it

off I bet I can't blame no the red light

just went on no but put yourself in

CNN's position without us you know cable

was not supposed to be a good business

then we came along it's not me it's we

they came from the valleys they came

from everywhere the cities they came

from places they're still trying to

figure out where the hell did all those

people come from

a great senator from Tennessee they have

early voting and I was in Pennsylvania

making his speech and he saw me because

he had a couple of great congressman

friends from Pennsylvania and he said

you know in Tennessee we have very early

voting and I just left and I've been

doing this for 24 years and I got to be

honest with you I've never seen so many

people vote and these are people they

love our country they're incredible they

work hard but they never liked what they

were voting for so they really wouldn't

vote sounds terrible but they didn't

like anything that they saw they say

sure I'm seeing people and he said this

come out from the valleys come out from

the mountains come out from areas that

they've never come out we have lines

that are five blocks long at every

voting booth and parlor

and he said I can't speak for the rest

of the country but of the rest of the

countries like Tennessee you're gonna

have the greatest victory in the history

of our nation and that's what happened

that was a great statement that was a

great statement from people from a great

state also tomorrow you must elect the

entire Republican ticket from Governor

on down including your next lieutenant

governor Ralph Alvarado Ralph Alvarado

Adams

auditor Mark Harmon thank you Mark

Treasurer Allison ball

commissioner Ryan Quarles

with the help of everyone here America

is the hottest economy anywhere in the

world by far foreign leaders come in to

see me congratulations on your economy

China's doing poorly as you know but

they're paying us billions and billions

and billions of dollars and they've

never given us ten cents before billions

of dollars I gave a lot of that money to

our farmers who got targeted but no

longer they're back buying from our

farmers but we've created 6.7 million

new jobs since the election and if I

would have ever said that during the

campaign the fake news back there would

have never let me hear the end of it

think of that six point seven and today

just today a record 158 million

Americans are now employed the highest

level of employment in our country's

history

african-american unemployment just

dropped to the lowest level ever

recorded in the history of our country

Hispanic American and Asian American

unemployment rates have also reached the

all-time historic lows the history of

our country hourly earnings listen to

this are up nine percent since the

election nobody ever thought that was

going to be happening

under the previous two administrations

we lost 60,000 factories I thought that

was a typo

I said outta hell can you lose 60,000 it

turned out to be right and you know how

I know because I've been saying it for

two years and they never corrected me

two years

I get a call sometimes from the people

on the campaign sure sir we have an

emergency what's the emergency

somebody's calling from the media the

fakeness

did you put a comma in the wrong

location sir because they consider it to

be a front-page story okay under my

administration we've added nearly 10,000

new factories and many many more

thousands of factories are coming into

our country we reversed it to get relief

to working families we pass massive tax

cuts massive

to lift up the stress communities our

tax law created opportunities owns Tim

Scott of South Carolina was so involved

including 144 designated by your great

governor by the way the other governor I

don't think not gonna do so well he'll

be calling for a meeting and I won't be

able to see him because I don't like

them very much but I like this one very

much and we're gonna help we slashed a

record number of job-killing regulations

we ended the war on American energy

we're now the largest producer of energy

anywhere in the world by far and we

ended the war on beautiful clean coal I

announced the withdrawal of the United

States from the horrible costly

one-sided Paris climate Accord

[Applause]

ask them how they're doing in Paris with

it

not too good I cancelled the so-called

clean power plan and repealed Obama's

federal coal moratorium we're putting

our great miners back to work on trade

we're starting to set records every week

we're reversing decades of Washington

disloyalty stupidity and corruption past

administrations did nothing as China

looted our factors and stole up to 500

billion dollars of American dollars by

the way people can't even believe it not

500 million that's a lot if you lost 500

million that's a lot I thought that was

another typo 500 billion dollars they

would take a year from us we rebuilt

China and I give them a lot of credit by

the way I give China what I don't give

credit to is Obama and past

administrations beyond Obama I don't

give them credit because they let it

happen they should have never let it

happened but now we're taking in tens of

billions and billions and billions of

dollars just recently very slow slippy

Joe Biden that is said of China's piracy

and plunder

they're not that bad folks he owes use

the word folks I watched him today he's

the word folks hi folks

hi my time is up I gotta leave

makes a mistake every time he speaks oh

handlers like they use their horses the

handlers right all right get him off now

stage but he said about sleepy Joe about

China they're not that bad folks they're

not really competition for us no they're

not 500 billion a year right he did

nothing in eight years him in Obama fact

I'm here because of them when you think

about it right I'm here because of them

Kelly and Conway stand up Kelly

another warrior I just saw Kelly and I

said no but think of it somebody saying

that now look the 1.5 billion dollars

that hunter who got thrown out of the

Navy for what no experienced who had not

anything got a lot of money from Ukraine

but he got 1.5 billion from China I

gotta tell you I've been negotiating

with China they're very tough that is

not the same group of Chinese people

that I've been negotiating with they

gave 1.5 billion he'll make millions and

millions with that and how about saying

by the way mr. president would you

please take over the negotiations that

President Trump is no longer handling

guess what you would be sold down the

tube so fast and we're so close China

wants to make a deal so badly I think

they'd love to see another president I

think would they like they would like to

see another president more than crooked

Hillary would okay can you imagine if

they ever took over negotiations of this

deal which going to be one of the

greatest deals ever made has to be

because we started down here and they

were up there has to be can you imagine

if they ever took over negotiations this

is what China would love more than

anything else it's not gonna happen

folks because we can't let our country

go back to hell we can't do it we can't

let it happen

because the Biden's got rich while

America was robbed and let me tell you

the fake news will not put it in I

watched the last debate and this

weakling named Anderson Cooper saying

while it's totally unsubstantiated mr.

Biden totally answer

what's unsubstantiated he is on tape

doing a real quid pro quo sir it's

totally unsubstantiated sir I've never

seen anything like it could you imagine

if I did what he did could you imagine

if Don jr. or Eric Trump walked out of

China while I was let's say vice

president or president let's say they

walked out of China with 1.5 billion do

you think the press would be saying well

it's unsubstantiated now it's something

let me just tell you something these

people are not all of them but these

people are very dishonest people okay

very very dishonest

but under this administration the great

betrayal is over America is not for sale

and we're more determined than ever to

drain the swamp and that's what we're

doing with these crazy people a lot of

bad things happened and a lot of bad

things I think are gonna be revealed

because there's no way we can allow them

to get away with what they would have

with a normal person gotten away with

let's face it these are bad people

thanks to my tariffs we will soon have

over a hundred billion dollars from a

country that didn't want to do anything

with us and I'll tell you they started

buying our farm product you see that

they started buying a lot of our product

even before the deals I died last year I

got our farmers 16 billion dollars

because they were targeted and the year

before I got a twelve million dollars I

just took him out of the tariff so we

had a lot left over and I said

congratulations farmers I love you I

love our farmers they love me that's why

they did they targeted our farm I said

congratulations that's compliments of

China and they do they want to make a

deal so badly frankly honestly they want

to make a deal a lot more than I want to

make a deal that's the way it is because

we're doing very well right now with

China we're replacing the NAFTA disaster

with the US Mexico Canada agreement a

huge win for Kentucky farmers for

Kentucky Auto Workers for Kentucky

manufacturers

unfortunately Nancy Pelosi so far and

the do-nothing Democrats don't want to

give the people of our country a victory

it's really let it be a bipartisan deal

I don't care it's such an incredible

deal for this country and NAFTA was one

of the worst deals ever made Democrats

need to pass the u.s. MCA we need their

votes otherwise you can't pass it and

it's up to Pelosi who has to put it

forward but she's too busy wasting their

time

so either pass it or go back to San

Francisco and clean up your mess

the obama-biden administration's

trans-pacific partnership would have

dealt the deathblow to the American auto

industry that would have been one of the

great catastrophes my first week in

office I canceled that job-killing

travesty you know all about under our

policies just days ago Ford and the UAW

announced a 1 billion dollar investment

in Louisville 1 billion before my

election our leaders used the great

American middle class as a piggy bank to

fund their delusional global projects

they would globalists I was elected to

be President of the United States not

President of the globe

they decimated American manufacturing to

promote economic growth in foreign

countries tell me how is that good that

try and convince you it's good I was a

very good student that we're very like

we're all smart we sit back we listen

and I say these people are something

wrong with them they only in Kentucky

can somebody be so precise you're right

about you are right about they deployed

our military to protect immensely

wealthy nations subsidizing their

welfare states with your money the money

we spend on other countries militaries

but it's coming down and I'm telling

other countries I'm sorry you're gonna

have to pay now I'm sorry pay hey hey

you gotta pay and they poured precious

American blood and treasure into the

Middle East while our great cities fell

into decay and disrepair we go in for

Internet we want rural we'll bring it in

and we're bringing 5g into places like

Kentucky that haven't been properly

served we're bringing it in all over the

Middle West all over the country and

we're really ahead of schedule we're

doing really well people will be very

surprised soon when some numbers come

out but we're doing very well but you

were very much underserved for years and

yet we're investing billions and

billions of dollars in places you've

never even heard of does it make sense

does it but after years of rebuilding

other nations we are finally rebuilding

our nation we are finally putting

America first

yet the deep state and the failed ruling

class are trying to resist any changes

to their failed policies of the past

they believe it is their right to rule

over you and to redistribute your wealth

all around the world no thank you no

thank you

that's why we ended the Paris Accord

that's why we would we've ended over I

don't even want to tell you but the

sellout of the American nation ended the

day I took the oath of office and you

understand that past leaders transform

faraway nations into chaotic war zones

then they demanded that America accept

unlimited migration from those terror

afflicted regions take the people take

the people we defeated Isis we when I

took over three years ago when we took

over when I took over Isis was all over

I defeated Isis you know I didn't even

know to what extent I was watching the

other night the great Lou Dobbs and he

said when Trump took over President

Trump he used to say Trump is a great

president then he said Trump is the

greatest president since Ronald Reagan

then he said then he said no no Trump is

an even better president than Ronald

Reagan

and now he's got me down as the greatest

president in the history of our country

including George Washington and Abraham

Lincoln thank you

we love you too

but we didn't fight them over there only

to invite them over here we didn't do

that we're not doing that you see what

we're going and you see what we're doing

and you see it's never easy because I

get hit by this swamp 15 different ways

but it doesn't matter we're doing the

right thing to protect our communities

my administration implemented the travel

ban on some of the world's most

dangerous countries a lot of people were

against it they said isn't that terrible

countries that have crime rates that are

so high you wouldn't even believe it's

possible and we have a travel ban now we

don't take people from those countries

I'm sorry and we want a historic victory

on the travel ban in the United States

Supreme Court ruled a totally

constitutional or no issue have

Democrats more totally betrayed you than

on immigration Democrats want open

borders they want to give illegal aliens

free health care free education more

advantages than our own citizens have

and more benefits than our own military

gets in the Republican Party we believe

taking care of our own citizens first is

paramount

thanks to our tireless efforts to secure

our southern border illegal crossings

have dropped 60% since May the wall is

being built it's going up rapidly it's

got a big impact and I want to thank

Mexico we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers

on our border policing our border

because the Democrats will not do

anything to end loopholes it would take

us 15 minutes so we could end the

loopholes think of the word loopholes

they don't want to end a loophole if you

want to keep violent criminal aliens out

of your communities you have only one

choice tomorrow and that's to vote for

Matt Bevin

Democrats are becoming more extreme and

militant by the day the Democrats plan

government takeover of health care would

obliterate Medicare what are they doing

I will always protect Medicare for our

nation's seniors it's going to be

protected what they're doing is crazy

and we will always protect patients with

pre-existing conditions and we will also

protect you with pre-existing physicians

how about that pre-existing physicians

first time I've ever said that just out

of that true because under their plan

you don't get your own doctor you know

what you get whatever the hell you get

that's what you get oh great doc fix me

up doc you mean you want to work on my

heart who are you doc I don't think so

thanks to our campaign to combat the

opioid epidemic with your governor's

help we have seen a 17% drop in overdose

deaths in Kentucky which is a record

Democrats have also waged an unrelenting

assault against people of faith anybody

in here a person of faith great people

the last administration threatened

adoption and foster care agencies purely

for their religious beliefs

last week my administration took action

to stop that Obama era assault it was an

assault and governor Matt Bevin is a

national leader on behalf of vulnerable

children and is no better leader than

him what he has done and together we're

fighting for American orphans foster

families and the sacred rights of

religious believers and he's done a

fantastic

virtually every top Democrat also now

supports late term abortion ripping baby

straight from their mothers womb right

up until the moment of birth

and that's why I've asked Congress to

prohibit extreme late term abortion

because Republicans believe that every

child is a sacred gift from God

Democrats are now the party of high

taxes high crime open borders late term

abortion socialism and blatant

corruption the Republican Party is the

party of the American worker

the American family the American Dream

and it's the party of the great Abraham

Lincoln we forgot that Abraham the

incredible rebuilding of our military

includes over 100 billion dollar

investments all across the state of

Kentucky I would draw our nation from

the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal

it's not the same country when I came in

that country there were an 18 different

sites of confliction sites of

confliction they called it and now

they're a little different a little

different we'll see what happens with

Iran and I recognize Israel's true

capital and opened the American Embassy

in Jerusalem

for years you watched as your

politicians apologize for America

remember hey go round oh thank you so

much

he wouldn't apologize to you but he

apologized to others now you have a

president who is standing up for America

and we are standing up for the people of

Kentucky the next step to victory begins

tomorrow and it begins with all of you

you have to do this look maybe you'll be

late for work

maybe you'll be late for whatever I

don't want to know everything okay some

things I don't want to know but you have

to just put it off you have to go vote

it's so important tomorrow and so

because you know beyond even the

governorship and it's so important

because you see again your state is

setting records in the history of your

state you've never done this well

economically job wise unemployment

employment factories moving in new

factories open expansion of your car

plants you've never done this well but

you're sending that big message to the

rest of the country it's so important

you got to get your friends you got a

vote because if you lose it sends a

really bad message just sends a bid and

they will build it up here's the story

if you win they're gonna make it like

ho-hum and if you lose they gonna say

Trump suffered the greatest defeat in

the history of the world this was the

greatest you can't let that happen to me

and you know what you can't let that

happen - you're incredible state

Kentucky you can't let that happen that

would be a disaster for USA because

you'd be losing an incredible governor

but you're gonna have a great victory

tomorrow with your support you have to

go out of it we will show the corrupt

Democrats that the American people are

not backing down and we will never ever

back down so tomorrow we need you to go

out and get your friends get your family

get your neighbors get out and vote for

Governor Matt Bevin and all of these

great Republicans tonight with your help

we will lift millions more of our

citizens from welfare to work dependence

to independence and poverty to

prosperity together we will elect a

Republican Congress 2020 we're going to

elect because of their stupidity these

people are on the run and I will

campaign in every one of those states

that were so corrupt if they raise their

hand

and don't forget out of 194 we got 194

not one Republican left us last week and

two Republicans think of that and the

other three couldn't get there because

of it but they were votes they said they

were totally versed Airport problems I

said you can't do that

Airport problems but then we had the

Democrats we picked up two Democrats so

we had bipartisan support that's unusual

I always say because they're lousy

politicians they've got lousy policy but

they do stick together that's about it

we will elect a Republican Congress in

2020 and we'll have a great Speaker of

the House in Kevin we're going to create

a fair safe sane and lawful system of

immigration will enact trade deals that

result in more products proudly stamped

with those beautiful words made in the

USA

we will achieve new breakthroughs in

science and medicine finding new cures

for childhood cancer and ending listen

to this the AIDS epidemic in America

within less than 10 years we've already

started who would have felt we could

have done that we've started and the

past administration toward the end we

had certain things that we could have

done they didn't do anything they didn't

do anything but we did we have it all

funded and we started think of that age

within 10 years we'll be out of this

country nobody would have thought that

was possible we will end it great great

they came into my office they were

telling me about the breakthroughs that

have been made it's incredible what

they're doing and don't forget write to

try by the way where somebody who's

terminally ill can now use our medicines

which they were never allowed to in the

past so instead of traveling to Asia and

Europe and all over the world or going

home hopeless and dying they can now use

what we call right to try we have the

greatest doctors the greatest drugs

greatest labs in the world they can now

go and try and we are having

unbelievable success unbelievable right

to try we will chart a new year of

discovery in space and someday soon we

will land on Believe It or Not the

surface of the Moon

only to go to Mars you know I said we've

done the moon no they say sir we land on

the moon to go to Mars and that's what

we're doing with the moon and we are

really really advanced it's moving along

rapidly we will defend privacy free

speech free assembly religious liberty

and the right to keep and bear arms

and above all we will never stop

fighting for the cherished values that

bind us together as one America we

support protect and defend the

Constitution of the United States we

stand with the incredible heroes and

warriors of law enforcement we believe

in the dignity of work and the sanctity

of life we believe that faith and family

not government and bureaucracy are the

true American Way we believe that

children should be taught to love our

country honor our history and always

respect our great American flag

loyal citizens like you helped build

this country and together we are taking

back our country we are returning power

state of Kentucky was settled by some of

the most devoted and courageous people

pioneer women braved the wilderness and

defied the danger to build a life and to

build a home they didn't have a lot of

money they didn't have a lot of luxury

but they all had one thing in common
