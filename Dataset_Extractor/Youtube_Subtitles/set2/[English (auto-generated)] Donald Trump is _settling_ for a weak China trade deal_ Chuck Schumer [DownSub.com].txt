tomorrow the united states will compete

we'll complete a signing ceremony for

the so called phase 1 trade agreement

with china after 18 months of

negotiations the phase 1 deal is

remarkable for how little it achieves at

an enormous price president Trump has

agreed to scale back some tariffs on

Chinese goods in exchange for temporary

assurances that China will increase its

purchase of US exports over the next few

years particularly in agriculture for

all the effort and turmoil over the past

few years the deal that President Trump

will sign tomorrow

hardly seems to advance the United

States past square one American farmers

have already lost billions in over the

last two years watch their markets

disappear and too many American farms

have gone bankrupt in the time that it

took president Trump to reach this deal

now I publicly praised the president

when he's tough on China at some

political cost I've said he's had better

instincts on China than previous

administrations few politicians have

been talking about securing real reforms

to China's economic policies longer than

I have but I fear with an election down

around the corner the president's taking

the easy way out

settling for a weak deal that will cost

American businesses American farmers and

American workers for years and years to

come
