as temperatures slowly rise and the

threats from climate change become more

obvious I'm surrounded by fire the

leadership of a once dominant force on

the world stage is eroding so we're

getting out President Trump has

officially started the process of

leaving the non-binding treaty a pact

that nearly the entire globe remains a

part of he's walked away from our allies

and left chaos and confusion in his wake

thank you it takes a full year to bow

out and that gives president Trump

something to take on the campaign trail

the Paris Accord would have been

shutting down American producers with

excessive regulatory restrictions like

you would not believe the president

attacks on climate change often fly in

the face of individual states attempts

to tackle it he revoked California's

right to set pollution limits on cars

the Environmental Protection Agency

wants to roll back regulations on how

waste from coal fire power plants is

stored and disposed of Trump's

environmental policy even includes an

attack on energy-efficient light bulbs

it is a gap and worse than a gap in

terms of not having a federal government

on side right now an American absence in

the treaty places a burden on the rest

of the planet to help developing nations

reach their targets for greenhouse gas

reductions but it also opens the door to

large polluters to benefit financially

it certainly gives a country like China

an economic opportunity to step in where

the United States is not and to be the

one that is producing the electric

vehicles and the renewable energies of

the future that girl the signing of the

Accord was seen as a win for future

generations and with the 2020 election

less than a year away a shift at the

White House could redirect the climate

focus with re-entry to the agreement

allowed at any point in the future

despite the president's intent to leave

the treaty American officials will

attend a major climate conference in

Spain later this year and will remain

active in ongoing negotiations
