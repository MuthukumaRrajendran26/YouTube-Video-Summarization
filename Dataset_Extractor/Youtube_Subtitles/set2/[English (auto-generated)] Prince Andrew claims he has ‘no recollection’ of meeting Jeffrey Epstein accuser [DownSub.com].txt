one of Epstein's accusers virginia

roberts has made allegations against you

she says she met you in 2001 she says

she dined with you danced with you at

tramp nightclub in London she went on to

have sex with you in a house in

Belgravia belonging to girl and Maxwell

your friend your response I have no

recollection of ever meeting this lady

you don't remember meeting cousin but

you were staying at the house I was

convicted sex offender it was a

convenient place to stay there's I mean

I mean I've gone through this in my mind

so many times at the end of the day with

the benefit of all the hindsight that

one could have it was definitely the

wrong thing to do but at the time I felt

it was it was the honorable and right

thing to do and I admit fully that that

my judgment was probably colored by my

tendency to be too honorable but that's

just the way it is I think that last

night was a PR disaster there's been so

much criticism in the newspapers today

from all sides lots of criticism on

social media we really saw a man there

last night who didn't think he did

anything wrong he said that the reason

why he went to see and stay with Jeffrey

Epstein was that he was too honorable he

also talked about he didn't notice the

people the women in the apartments in

the houses because they were just like

staff and it was really very striking

that there was no sympathy at all

expressed for the victims there wasn't a

single word saying clearly there were

terrible things went on in these houses

and I feel such sympathy for these women

these young girls who were trafficked

not a word I think last night was

detrimental to public perception and I

think that what we also saw was no clear

answer to some of the key questions

including when Emily Maitlis said so

when you were given massages at these

houses in Florida do you think

those women were trafficked and he

didn't say he hadn't received massages

he started to say how many times he been

to Florida or not and also they were

really a rather almost paper-thin alibi

for the night in which Virginia Roberts

said they were together he said he was

at Pizza Express with his daughter and I

mean simply we all know that a teenage

girl's birthday party if that's what it

was

finishes very early and so he could have

got to tramp later so there was no real

answer to the question of what did you

see did you engage with these women and

what did you think was going on in these

houses this is not going to go away I

think he felt that this was going to

draw a line under it absolutely no way

this has reignited a lot of the

speculation and indeed I was reading

this morning that sources were saying he

won't be going to America anytime soon

because the FBI really want to interview

him and now of course they have this as

evidence that certainly he did stay and

he knew and he was there and he saw a

woman around so really I think that

Prince Andrew what was he thinking when

he agreed to this interview because this

interview has really exposed the mindset

I think that allow people like Jeffrey

Epstein to get away with it we

understand from news night and Prince

Andrew that the say-so for this

interview came right from the top so all

members of the war family and the

household they were appraised acquainted

with this and really I expect that they

listened to Andrew and when he said this

will draw a line under it this will end

the speculation this will mean as he

said last night he said or now I can get

on with things with all my usual work I

mean that's not going to happen

this really is very very problematic or

household today will be in damage

control mode trying to work out and

minimize their damage that has come from

this and you know I think it's very

difficult I think that all they can do

is really take Andrea away from public

life no amount of charity work no amount

of opening hospitals or anything like

that is going to work I feel after

addressing the damage from this

interview he has to go quietly retire

away and the royal family have to

because on the good work they do through

other members simply last night was

really a burning of the bridges I think

in footprints and ring
