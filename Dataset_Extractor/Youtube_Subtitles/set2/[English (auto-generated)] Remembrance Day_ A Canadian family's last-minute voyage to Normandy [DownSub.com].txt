seventy-five years after the death of

Louisville Magua the village of on

gurney renamed its school after the

Canadian soldier the New Brunswick

private was shot and killed here on

d-day defending his regiment this is

awful the mayor said it was important to

choose a regular soldier rather than an

officer but vamos family story is far

from normal

he initially lied about his age to join

the war effort

despite the concerns of his parents that

decision cost him his life and

devastated his family back in Keswick

New Brunswick when we at Global News

first found out about the school

dedication we wanted to see if any of

valmont's descendants would be attending

we were introduced to an amateur

genealogist in Keswick a community of

just one thousand people Sylvio do God

didn't just know of the family he grew

up with him the family came to

graduation

in the 1940s Brannan was the youngest

one and Shannon was came to school with

me in the same class so a new version in

their will is done a week before the

ceremony we contacted Jeanine to talk to

her about her big brother

she told us she wasn't going to the

ceremony but only because no one had

told her about it right I didn't know at

all I couldn't understand what was going

on because I didn't even know about the

ceremonies we actually had to convince

her our calls weren't part of an

elaborate phone scam once Jeanine knew

it was real she knew even at age 84 what

had to happen next initially we were

talking about you going to Fredericton

yes during our conversation you went

yeah

and I had decided I was holding her own

her children had doubts but Janine had

conviction so it was decided one of her

sons and nephew Val Moll never met would

join her said no you're not going there

alone what happens if you're far and

finally they decided what was the one

that was one of them that was kind of a

last-minute preparation from Edmundston

june to my trio from montreal get the

tickets to this it was a rush just days

to prepare for a moment 75 years in the

making

Janine and her son Paul late additions

as guests of honor in the village they

even stayed in the mayor's home no no I

had no coming so I'm glad I came

I'll be back see the friends I have made

discovery Redmond Shannon global news on
