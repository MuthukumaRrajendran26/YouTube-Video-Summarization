so you're dreaming yes I James po tuck

front from the flight from the flight

I go by Potok Philippe I'm an artist

you're an artist yes okay so can I just

ask you generally what your

interpretation of what happened I fly to

Jamaica five times a year one time

couple trips ago I did a similar thing I

pulled my phone out I made a viral video

I got up I said can have your attention

can I have your attention everyone

stopped and looked and I said Lil

Wayne's new album just dropped everybody

go get it no problem with that sat back

down landed everybody got off no issue

seemed to me like this was in poor taste

in retrospect what I did I stood up I

said can I have everybody's attention I

just came back from Hunan Province how's

it why did you why would you say that

well I had my camera with me I was

looking to to get a viral video I was

looking to get it up on all the social

media platforms I figured it would

invoke some type of reaction not on the

plane more people seeing on social media

going wow this kid's got some balls or

this kid is crazy whatever it is so you

were looking for some sort of promotion

or viral video I was looking to to

create a video yes that was that would

go viral yeah for what purpose no to go

violin artists any publicity for myself

as good publicity and what do you think

now about what happened what I did was

wrong I ruined the flights for two

hundred and some-odd people I ruined

their flight and it is there any

repercussions from this that you know

they just showed up and knocked yeah

your dad yes can I ask you what are the

repercussions or what do you think

they've charged me criminally and yeah I

of court to go to there's all types of

positions people that people that are

happy people that are upset but in the

end I've ruined the people on the planes

trip so I'm extremely apologetic
