anny bear can do little with the water

flowing from her kitchen tap we don't

use the tap water for drinking or

brushing our teeth or anything like that

testing by Concordia journalism students

revealed it's contaminated with lead

levels five times the federal guideline

of five parts per billion as a renter

aver has made the choice to drink

bottled water instead I didn't want to

take any chances I have both my kids are

athletes one in hockey one in

synchronized swimming they compete at a

high level they drink enormous amounts

of water per day it is not easy for 10a

to force their landlords to change the

pipes but they do have rights under the

the different rental acts you know to

insist that they have a unit that is fit

for habitation and that includes safe

drinking water but there are no specific

municipal provincial or federal laws

that require landlords disclose the

presence of lead pipes or plumbing

fixtures and even if that lead is

discovered there are no laws that

require landlords to make a change as a

renter you feel like a little bit

helpless in this with six kids it's kind

of hard to keep up with a water supply

of bottle bottle water on a consistent

basis it's why some Canadian cities

including Saskatoon and Montreal have

decided to force all property owners to

have let pipes replaced the reality that

60% of people or tenants here landlords

and house owner needs to take their

responsibilities they do have to take

their responsibilities Montreal mayor

Valeri plant says she's a landlord

herself and only recently discovered the

properties she rents are getting their

water through that pipes ensuring all

pipes are changed she says is the only

way to ensure tenants like a bear can

trust what comes out of their taps
