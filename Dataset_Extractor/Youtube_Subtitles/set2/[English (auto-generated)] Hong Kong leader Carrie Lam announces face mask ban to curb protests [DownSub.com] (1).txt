as the current situation has clearly

given rise to a state of serious public

danger the chief executive in council

decided at a special meeting this

morning to invoke the power under the

emergency regulations ordinance and make

a new regulation in the name of

prohibition or face covering regulation

which is essentially an anti mask law it

is essential for us to stop violence and

restore calmness in society as soon as

possible we hope that the new

legislation can help us to achieve this

objective this regulation targets

riotous or those resort to violence

that's why the regulation contains

defense and exemptions to cater for

legitimate needs to wear a mask and

belief we believe that by so doing we

have struck the necessary balance
