and it's arrogance that makes people

make mistakes and do stupid things cruel

things like what Narendra Modi has done

it's sheer arrogance and it's arrogance

that has blinded him from the fact that

what is going to happen when the curfew

was lifted has he thought about it this

hasn't been thought through the world

hasn't done anything look what is going

to happen when the curfews lifted will

be a bloodbath the people will come out

there nine hundred thousand troops there

they haven't come to as Narendra Modi

says he's done this to for Prosperity of

Kashmir this is supposed to be for the

development these nine hundred thousand

troops what are they going to do when

the devil when they come out there'll be

a bloodbath

has he thought it through what happens

then mr. president

has anyone thought that what happens

when there is a bloodbath what do you

think the impact will have on people of

Kashmir and we will fight and when

and when and when and when a

nuclear-armed country fights to the end

it will have consequences far beyond the

borders it will have consequences for

the world which is why I repeat I'm here

because I'm warning you it's not a

threat it's a fair worry that where are

we headed

and it I've come here to tell the UN

you've got to this is a test for the

United Nations you are the one who

guaranteed the people of Kashmir the

right of self-determination
