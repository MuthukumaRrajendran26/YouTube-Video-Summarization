I want to begin by saying a few words

directly to racialized Canadians who

face discrimination every single day in

their lives even in a country like

Canada what I did hurt them hurt people

who shouldn't have to face intolerance

and discrimination because of their

identity this is something that I deeply

deeply regret darkening your face

regardless of the context of the

circumstances is always unacceptable

because of the racist history of

blackface I should have understood that

then and I never should have done it

see news last night on the plane when we

asked you if that the picture that

emerged in the time report was the only

time you had done this you left us with

the impression there was only one other

incident and since then Global News has

released the video which seems to show

that there was at least a third incident

so exactly how many times have you

darkened your skin with makeup in an act

that you have yourself described as

racist I shared the moments that I

recollected but I recognize that it is

something absolutely unacceptable to do

and yeah I appreciate calling it makeup

but it was blackface and that is just

not right it is something that people

who live with the kind of discrimination

that far too many people do because of

the color of their skin or their history

or their origins or their language or

their religion face on a regular basis

and I didn't see that from the layers of

privilege that I have and for that I am

deeply sorry and I apologize okay

how many times is it just the three that

we know about or other more incidents

because you know people are looking for

them and if a candidate were to come

forward now with this in their history

would you allow them to run for the

Liberals in this election I think that's

a that's a that's a question that we

would look at every step of the way

I think examining the case-by-case

situation examining the actions that

someone has taken

I am certainly conscious that in my

political career

as leader and indeed as Prime Minister

we've taken many concrete actions to

fight against racism to fight against

intolerance to fight against anti black

racism specifically to recognize

unconscious bias and systemic

discrimination that exists in Canada and

elsewhere to work to overcome and

recognize intersectionalities that

people live within it in a way that so

many of us simply cannot understand or

appreciate the microaggressions and the

challenges being faced so even though

we've moved forward in significant ways

as a government what I did the choices I

made hurt people hurt people who thought

I was an ally I am an ally but this is

something that obviously I deeply regret

and I never should have done

Larry coach Winnipeg Free Press mr.

Trudeau yesterday you said that you

didn't just realize in 2001 that it was

wrong to put on brown face but now you

do realize it is wrong and I'm wondering

when did dawned on you that it is wrong

I think it's difficult to become a

politician

where you spend as much time as you will

do working hard to represent people

working hard to getting to know a

community like the community I have the

honor of representing Papineau where

there is extraordinary diversity

extraordinary challenges and yes

extraordinary intolerance even in a city

like Montreal in a country like Canada

that people live with every day and as

I've learned to not just represent

people but to fight for them and to try

and build a better community in a better

society I've learned everyday that it is

unacceptable to to engage in this sort

of behavior what okay can't oh no no no

I'm wondering if you thought enough

about this issue that you volunteered

you ever declare that this had happened

I I never talked about this quite

be and it was really embarrassing I was

afternoon mr. Trudeau Theresa right from

The Canadian Press he said just a few

minutes ago that you told us last night

on the plane that you were that of all

of the different instances that you

recalled

have you since been made aware or

remembered of other instances and if so

how many I think it is obvious that this

is something that was deeply regrettable

I am weary of being definitive about

this because the recent pictures that

came out I had not remembered and I

think the question is how can you not

remember that the fact is I I didn't

understand how hurtful

this is to people who live with

discrimination every single day I have

always acknowledged that I come from a

place of privilege but I now need to

acknowledge that that comes with a

massive blind spot I have dedicated my

leadership and my service to Canada to

try and counter intolerance and racism

everywhere I can but this has been a

personally a moment where I've had to

reflect on the fact that wanting to do

good and wanting to do better simply

isn't good enough and you need to take

responsibility for mistakes that hurt

people who thought it was an ally who

hopefully many of them still consider me

in a lie even though this was a terrible

to answer a very basic question you've

done this all obviously more than more

than two times why I think when we

recognize when we reflect on mistakes we

made in the past that's a question that

we're always going to be asking why did

we do that why did we think it was okay

why did we think it was a good idea at

the time it wasn't a good idea it was a

terrible idea it was something that

minimizes and takes advantage of a

reality that I have not had to live with

of being discriminated against of being

marginalized of being judged for the

color of my skin for my language my

background I come from a place of

privilege and I have endeavored in my

life to put the advantages and the

opportunities I've been given to serve

this country to fight for people's

rights and I have to recognize that I

let a lot of people down with that

choice and I stand here today to reflect

on that and to ask for forgiveness

Glenn McGregor CTV News mr. Trudeau

there's been confusion about the

timeline of all of this I'm just

wondering when you first told your

campaign staff that there are these

images of you out there that could be

embarrassing if they were to come out in

an election campaign did you know about

this in 2015

did you know about this before then did

you when did when did you tell those

people as as I said I was embarrassed

particularly given the person that I've

become and the leader I try to be that

fights for people's rights and defends

people against intolerance and racism

and I didn't want to talk about it with

anyone because I'm not that person

anymore I'm someone who understands the

deep hurt caused by actions like that to

people who live with discrimination

every single day when we found out that

Time magazine was looking for a picture

of that event I told my staff but

ultimately the call is mine on when to

talk to people when to act on things and

the buck stops with me and I take

responsibility you had a bit of

privileged upbringing you went to good

schools

your father was prime minister and an

internationalist and I'm wondering if he

knew that you were doing this in high

school

appearing in blackface and what he

thought about it and if he if he didn't

know what do you think he would have

thought about it huh hi my father raised

me to try and defend people's rights one

of our family motto has always been

provide counterweights it was the reason

he gave for why he chose to go to Ottawa

in 1965 when all the power tended to

accrue

towards Quebec City in the quiet

revolution and Quebecers becoming strong

and staying in Quebec he said no we need

to provide counterweights and if you're

strong you need to go where your

strength is most needed that is the way

he raised me and I certainly have tried

to use the privilege that you talked

about the opportunities that I've had in

my life to put them in service of people

who didn't have the kinds of

opportunities that I have that's the

kind of leader and the kind of prime

minister I've tried to be the kind of

man I've tried to be certainly the kind

of parent I've tried to be and in my

conversations with my kids a difficult

conversation I had this morning about

taking responsibility for your actions

and learning from your mistakes this is

certainly something and I think my

father wouldn't be pleased with how I

behaved but perhaps would feel that

taking responsibility for things is

important when I think of the

conversations I had with my kids this

morning I also recognize that there are

far too many Canadians who this morning

had to explain to their kids what those

pictures were of their prime minister

and what kind of society we live in and

what kind of world we need to live in

and how things have evolved but at the

same time I regret deeply parents who

had to have difficult conversations with

their kids that were uncomfortable and

hurtful because of my actions

Michelle's olio with The Globe and Mail

in 2001 students were being expelled for

wearing black face and and brown face

from schools there was also a spike

spike Lee movie about it in 2001 when

did you realize that blackface was

racist

as I've said the privilege of

representing the community of Papineau a

extraordinarily multicultural community

where any given crowd looks a lot like

this crowd here in Winnipeg have people

every different background every

different origin and the responsibility

of not just sticking up for people of

all different backgrounds but but

fighting for them and defending them is

something that made it very very clear

to me that minimizing or further

marginalizing people by dressing up that

way is absolutely unacceptable follow-up

international media including the BBC

New York Times and al-jazeera have

published stories about this are you

concerned that your behavior including

you know not talking about this for 18

years publicly has damaged Canada's

reputation and if so what will you do

about it I think we all need to

recognize it even in an incredible

country like Canada there's still a lot

of more work to do people are still

facing discrimination and

marginalization every single day anti

black racism unconscious bias systemic

discrimination they still exist systemic

discrimination still exists in our

schools in our universities in our

workplaces in our communities racialized

Canadians everyday face extra barriers

extra comments disparaging remarks that

they have learned to live with as the

reality of their day-to-day lives and we

must all in Canada and everywhere around

the world pledge ourselves to make sure

we are fighting to make it better

there's lots of things we can and must

do that includes recognizing terrible

mistakes of the past that's what I am

doing that is what I have tried to do as

as Prime Minister

in many occasions and that's why we're

going to continue to recognize that

still indigenous peoples in this country

face unacceptable living situations

fewer opportunities these people who

were promised shared partnership and

stewardship of the land and respect were

treated with everything but for

centuries and we are beginning on the

road of reconciliation now but there is

still a long way to go

Canadians of who come from different

parts of the world whether they're first

generation or fifth generation continue

to face intolerance and marginalization

we have much more to do and I am not

afraid of standing up in front of the

world and saying you know Canada is a

pretty great country Canada's the best

country in the world but we have a lot

more work to do all of us and that is

something that I will continue to pledge

every single day I have to doing Britney

Hobson abt on national news I'm going to

switch gears a little bit earlier this

week children that child advocates from

across the country came together to say

that the federal government is not doing

enough to address youth suicides

if the Liberals are reelected will you

implement a national suicide strategy

prevention plan and if so when would you

implement that and what would it look

like

we've made significant moves forward on

this terrible tragedy there are far too

many communities across the country

where children are taking their lives

where suicidal ideation where lack of

opportunities societal and

intergenerational inequities have led to

unacceptable rates of youth suicides

and tremendous tragedies for families

for communities

we need to do a better job of addressing

and yes we continue to move forward on

things like national strategies to

prevent youth suicide but it takes more

than just strategies it takes concrete

investments which is why we've made

investments in mental health service

workers in a hotline to help out for

indigenous communities in investments in

education and in new schools and in new

health centers and investments in

indigenous languages and culture

recognizing that someone who is proud of

their identity and their language and

can use their language is far less

likely to fall victim to suicidal

ideation and suicides but the problem

continues we need to do much much more

and we will continue to do much much

more if we get that opportunity also

this week a new report was released in

Manitoba showing that the rate that

First Nations people are dying at

younger rates than non-indigenous people

but we know that that's happening across

the board in Canada and this continues

to happen since the Liberals have been

in power for the past four years

if reelected what are you gonna do to

change that we have made significant

progress over the past four years on

tangible things like lifting boil water

advisories we've lifted 87 long-term

boil water advisories in indigenous

communities but there's still more than

50 to go although we feel we are on

track to lifting all those that remain

by the five-year mark in the spring of

2021 that we had committed to we are

investing in new schools we're investing

in new health centers we are investing

in better partnerships in in support for

First Nations and and indigenous

post-secondary education we're working

directly with the maytee Nation on

economic development and investments

we're moving forward on an indigent

herbin and indigenous strategy as well

to recognize all those indigenous

peoples who face real challenges in our

urban environments there is so much

more to do we have taken meaningful

steps forward that have made a

significant significant difference in

the lives of many indigenous people

we're the first to recognize there is

still a long way to go what took

generations and indeed centuries to

break it's going to take time to fix and

I am impatient but I also know the only

way to move forward properly is in full

partnership with indigenous peoples is

empowering indigenous communities

themselves to determine the right path

forward for them

and that sometimes takes a little bit

longer because in many cases these

communities have never been asked what

it is that they want before so we will

work with them and be there to respect

them to empower them and to build the

future that they choose not the future

that we think from Ottawa would be the

right future for them that takes a

little longer

I will admit and every day longer we

take means more kids struggling for

longer but we have to get this right and

we have to do it in the full spirit of

respect and partnership and that is what

our government has been focused on and

will continue to be focused on David

akin from Global News good morning good

afternoon master I know there'll be a

lot of people here today of all races

who will be very happy to hear you

denounce racism in all this form in your

earlier behavior but the prime minister

job was not created so you could work

through your issues maybe it's time that

you realize you're not the indispensable

man as the leader of the Liberal Party

as the Prime Minister you have very many

capable leaders in your party that

perhaps you should step aside for some

reflection for some more understanding

and discussion

have you considered asking someone else

to lead the party in this election I

spent the morning speaking with

candidates with fellow liberals with

allies with leaders within racialized

communities across the

and I will continue to do the work that

is necessary to keep us moving forward

in the right way

Canadians have an important choice to

make Canadians have an important choice

to make on October 21st and I trust

Canadians to make that right choice I

certainly hope that they will continue

to support us in the work that we're

doing but they might not and I know that

that is something that all Canadians get

to decide and they get to bring in all

sorts of different factors because every

Canadian is a different way of looking

at what matters to them and all I hope

for is that Canadians take very

seriously this responsibility and this

choice that we will make as a country on

October 21st and until then I will

continue to put forward the very best

team the very best approach that I can

to talk about how we're gonna build a

better future for Canadians I'd like to

just follow up on the tone now of the

campaign it had a different tone until

yesterday and that tone was largely

involved with your party finding lots of

very questionable yers from many of your

opponents one of them right here in

Winnipeg and Winnipeg north can you tell

us how the tone is going to change as we

start talking about things is it going

to be so important to be digging up

people's social media posts of the last

two three four years are you gonna be

focused on that or your party pardon me

gonna be focused on that over the past

three days we have put forward

significant policy announcements on how

we will continue to do the work that we

laid out over the past four years work

that resulted in creating over a million

jobs and lifting 900,000 people out of

poverty we talked about raising the

Canada child benefit for kids under 1 to

make sure that more parents have the

ability to give all the opportunities to

their kids we talked about doubling our

investments in child care so that there

is better help for after school and

before school care for parents who need

it and we've talked about supporting our

seniors by increasing the old age

security by

percent for seniors once they reach 75

because we recognize that costs continue

to go up we're going to continue to make

contrasts with our opponents and we're

going to continue to put forward strong

pieces of policy that will demonstrate

how we believe that investing in

Canadians is the right path forward but

we will always and continue to do that

in a way that pushes back against

intolerance and tolerance and racism

every step of the way mr. Trudeau the

next time you're in a monster temple how

can you look at those people and tell

them that you fully understand what

they're going through that is a question

I've had to answer from the very first

time I had the opportunity to walk into

a good whare or a Mandor or a mosque in

my writing and across the country when

people see someone who came from a place

of privilege asking for the opportunity

to represent them in the House of

Commons asking them for the opportunity

to be their voice even though obviously

I'm someone who has had tremendous

opportunities and advantages in my life

and that conversation I had that started

over 10 years ago when I started my

journey to being a politician is a

conversation I need to continue to have

every single day whenever I meet a voter

whenever I meet a Canadian whenever I

meet someone who is looking to me to

serve them to defend them to represent

them and to build a better future with

them and I look forward to continuing

these conversations that I get to have

with Canadians from coast to coast to

coast every single day as I travel

across this country

you've apologized but what policies and

there's people who have been affected by

this indeed we were the first Canadian

government to recognize the deck the UN

were the first government to

specifically put forward 25 million

dollars over the coming years for the

black community to support grassroots

community organizations to create

opportunities for black youth we put

forward a national anti-racism strategy

that talks about anti black racism that

talks about anti-semitism talks about

Islamophobia

we have moved forward in a significant

way in partnership with a broad range of

Canadians of all sorts of diversities

and their groups but we recognize as you

point out there is always much more to

do and we will keep doing it the choices

we make on building a better future for

all Canadians

continues to be something that we are

very much focused on as a country as a

government and as a party and we will

continue to focus on that messy

[Applause]
