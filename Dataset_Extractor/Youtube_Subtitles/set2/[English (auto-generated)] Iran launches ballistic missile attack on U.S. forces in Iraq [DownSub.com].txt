Donna we know from the Pentagon that

this attack began about three hours ago

it involved more than a dozen missiles

being fired from inside Iran targeting

those air bases in Iraq as you mentioned

that house US troops this is the exact

scenario that the US had been preparing

for and essentially that Iran had warned

that it would carry out in retaliation

for the killing of general Soleimani the

Iranians had made it clear that they

would launch direct attacks in response

and wouldn't rely on their proxies and

the Americans came to believe that those

direct attacks would be on US forces in

the region so they were prepared for

this likely hunkered down as you

mentioned there are early reports of

Iraqi casualties the Pentagon says it is

still carrying out a damage assessment

at those bases and is still waiting to

see exactly how much damage there is

before determining what kind of response

there will be as we understand it there

have been at least two waves of

ballistic missile attacks from Iran

tonight but again the details still

unfolding at this hour it's going to be

a very tricky and delicate situation for

the White House at this hour we

understand that President Trump is

monitoring the situation from the White

House Situation Room the ball is

effectively now in his court he has to

decide if or how he responds to this

attack obviously that will depend on the

magnitude of the damage and the attack

itself earlier today though he issued a

stern warning from the Oval Office that

any Iranian retaliation would be met

with a full-throated American response

perhaps there is some room to dial

things back here you heard the president

make reference to cultural sites today

and how he might try and avoid him that

is a change in tone from earlier this

week when he said he would target

Iranian cultural sites that would

violate international law so Donna

perhaps if he's willing to step back

their all-out war can be avoided it's

all going to unfold very rapidly and

we'll be watching closely over the next

few hours
