so this is a sad and somber time in the

history of the United States of America

for the fourth time in our history we

are compelled by elegant allegations of

presidential wrongdoing so serious that

we are engaged in an impeachment inquiry

well none of us ran for office to

impeach a president everyone on this

stage agrees that we have put into place

a fair series of procedures to govern

how this process moves forward these

procedures are guided by the precedent

Congress said under previous impeachment

they guarantee protections for the

president and his counsel that were not

explicitly provided during prior

impeachments and they lay out a clear

path forward so that the American people

can hear firsthand the serious and

alarming allegations about president

Trump's abuse of power I'm proud of the

resolution we put together I believe

that it will withstand the test of time

I'm proud of the work of the Rules

Committee and and even though it gets

somewhat contentious last night I want

to say I'm probably the way all members

Democrats and Republicans conducted

themselves there was no live streaming

and narration during the mark-up nobody

stormed the committee nobody sees the

microphone people behaved I think in a

way that is respectful of this

institution I appreciate the cooperation

of ranking member Tom Cole and the other

Republicans as well I want to thank all

the committee chairs here for their hard

work to uncover the truth on behalf of

the American people this vote is a

victory not for not this vote is a

victory not not for any of us but on

behalf of the constituents who sent us

here and who demand that we follow the

facts and uphold our oath I also want to

thank the courageous civil servants who

have come forward to testify so far many

in contradiction of this

administration's attempts to silence

them and at great risk to their own

career let me conclude with this I truly

believe that a hundred years from now

historians will look back at this moment

and judge us by the decisions we are

making here today at the end of the day

this risen this resolution isn't about

Donald Trump it isn't about any of us

it's about our Constitution and it's

about our country and now I'm happy to

yield to the distinguished chair of the

Select Committee on Intelligence Adam

chef

I think the gentleman for yielding this

is a solemn day in the history of our

country when the president's misconduct

has compelled us to continue to move

forward with an impeachment inquiry the

resolution today sets out the procedures

going forward with that impeachment

process the founding fathers understood

that a leader might take hold of the

Oval Office who would sacrifice the

national security who would fail to

defend the Constitution who would place

his personal or political interests

above the interests of the country they

understood that might happen and they

provided a mechanism to deal with it and

that mechanism is called impeachment we

take no joy in having to move down this

road and proceed with the impeachment

inquiry but neither do we shrink from it

the resolution from the perspective of

the Intelligence Committee sets out

important procedures for how we may

conduct our open hearings during the

depositions that we've conducted thus

for we've used a format that we believe

very conducive to the fact-finding

process those procedures now will be

incorporated into the open earrings in

which staff counsel will be permitted

for lengthy periods of time to do

sustained questioning for up to 25

minutes per side followed by member

questioning we've used this I think to

great success for both parties during

the course of the depositions wherein

the depositions we have alternated one

hour for the majority one hour for the

minority 45 minutes from the majority 45

minutes for the minority in those

depositions over a hundred members have

been eligible to participate I should

tell you that notwithstanding those that

have complained about lack of access to

the depositions most of the members who

have been permitted to attend have

failed to attend have not made use of

the availability of attending each and

every deposition but those that have on

both sides of the aisle have had an

equal opportunity to question the

witnesses and indeed when we move into

open session both parties will have an

equal opportunity to

question any witnesses that are called

the resident resolution will also permit

me as the chair to release to begin

releasing the transcripts of the

depositions and I think that you will

see when those are released

just what Equal Opportunity members of

both parties have had we recognize the

seriousness of this undertaking we

recognize that we have been compelled by

the circumstances to move forward when a

president abuses his or her office when

a president sacrifices the national

interest when a president refuses to

defend the Constitution and does so for

the purpose of advancing a personal or

political agenda

the founders provided the remedy I make

no prejudgment as to whether that remedy

will be warranted when we finish these

hearings I will wait until all the facts

are put forward we will undertake this

duty with the seriousness it deserves

and to the best of our ability we just

had a vote in March of this year speaker

Pelosi said this impeachment is so

divisive to the country that unless

there's something so compelling and

overwhelming and bipartisan I don't

think we should go down that path

because

the country today the country just

witnessed the only bipartisan vote on

that floor was against the question to

the speaker are the same questions I

provided in a letter about the unfair

process that we have what has changed

since March in all the hearings there's

nothing compelling nothing overwhelming

so the speaker should follow her own

words on what bipartisan vote on that

floor and in the Sham that we've been

putting this country through this night

that's exactly what this vote shows

today I want to call up our wiggly's

thank you Kevin and when we talk about

the vote I think it's important to note

when you see that not only did every

single Republican reject this

soviet-style payment process but we were

even joined by Democrats in the state if

you look clearly there are people that

we serve with that don't like the

results in the 2016 election that's our

prerogative but the country next year

will be deciding who our president is

going to be it should not be Nancy

Pelosi in a small group of people that

she selects but I can't determine who's

going to be our president if you look at

the resolution today they talk about

fairness now if they really think that

they can talk people it's fair that only

the Chairman gets to decide who the

witnesses are and they give us an

opportunity to call witnesses but if the

chair says that they don't like the

witnesses the witnesses don't come

forward they allow the president to have

legal counsel in the room unless the

chair decides that

it's legal counsel in the room that's

never happened before with the Clinton

impeachment with the Nixon impeachment

Republican and Democrat alike both sides

were treated equally both sides with all

witnesses president's legal counsel was

in the room not at the discretion of the

chair but because it's fair and so when

you look at this soviet-style process it

shows you that they don't really want to

get to the truth they want to remove a

sitting president in fact the author of

the articles of impeachment said if they

don't appease the president he will get

reelected now that's not why we have

impeachment Alexander Hamilton made it

very clear his concern when they were

trying to promote the Constitution was

that he didn't want to see impeachment

used for political purposes yet that's

what happened today he predicted and it

happened today it's a sham it shouldn't

have happened it's a tainted process

that has just been conducting that

neither like one day can duck the house

deserves better the people in this

country who deserve better we should be

tackling real problems we can have

little prescription drug prices today

but Pelosi won't bring those bills to

the floor because she's infatuated with

impeachment our troops can be properly

elevated

but a Pelosi is infatuated with

impeachment in fact we can have fair

trade relations with Canada and Mexico

and create a hundred and sixty thousand

new jobs today but Melissa's infatuated

with appeasement we deserve better

very and then I think you heard members

up here being very clear the question

that Adam Schiff brought forth to us

after he lied the first time and put

America through the nightmare of the

bollard investigation was now that the

administration was holding the support

but there was a phone call that there

was quid pro quo

now unheard of you had a president

released the transcript or phone call we

now found after the fact that I'm

actually the only person in this

Congress

[Music]

the only person who's withholding the

whistleblower from coming forward is a -

if we look at the phone call for quid

pro quo somebody has to take an action

for another there's nothing in that

phone call that is wrong

I repeat if you had the transcripts that

we've been going for more than three

weeks no one's been able to read you

would again go for visit wondering why

this is beautiful no one is fine for

standing down there has ever said there

was

Pirlo for the same fear that Hamilton's

say a high more than 200 years ago is

what watch for today so this isn't about

the Republican Party this is about the

Republic no one should ever we believe

in the rule of law but unfortunately the

Nancy's house
