we're breaking news now from Ottawa the

ethics commissioner has determined the

Prime Minister the breach of a

conflict-of-interest Act by attempting

to interfere in the so-called S&C

levelin affair we have our odigo bureau

chief and host of the West block

Mercedes Stevenson here with more on

this I'm so happy you're here to break

this down for us I'm the news him June

Mercedes first what does the ethics

commissioner say the Prime Minister did

that was improper

he says the Prime Minister put pressure

on Jodi Wilson rayful were able to

overrule the decision of the Public

Prosecution Office not to cut essencial

Avalanna deal and that would be called

the deferred prosecution something we

heard a lot about it allows a company to

avoid a criminal conviction and to pay a

fine instead and that is something that

Jodi Wilson rables had said was

inappropriate political pressure and

essentially that is what is found in

this ethics commissioners report he says

that the Prime Minister did intervene

that he did try to use his authority to

inappropriately pressure the former

attorney general and that he also

directed his staff to do the same that

this took place over a number of months

and that he was asking the former

attorney general to consider what would

be partisan political interests and he

goes on to say that that is contrary to

Canadian constitutional principles that

have been observed since the founding of

this country including things like

prosecutorial independence which means

that you don't have politicians

interfering in criminal prosecutions and

also the rule of law furthermore he says

that if SNC lavalla were to have gotten

a deal as a result of that pressure they

would have benefited financially so this

is all very interesting because these

are a lot of the allegations that Jodi

Wilson Raybould

made that are now being reiterated in a

report from the Independent Ethics

Commissioner in fact he used to be a

liberal partisan so this is not somebody

who has conservative sympathies some

thought maybe he wouldn't go that hurt

on the Liberals this is pretty

no-holds-barred and extensive and

potentially equally is damaging he's

talking about how difficult it was to

get information from the government

about what happened and that's something

that was really dogging the government

during the course of this scandal

because they have presented themselves

as open and transparent that they are

the government of sunny ways and

suddenly they shut down lockdown and

were accused of trying to put pressure

on the first indigenous minister to sit

in cabinet as a woman as the Attorney

General

so certainly this is going to be a

report that you're going to see a lot of

throughout the election and the

opposition are gearing up as we speak to

respond to it so as Jodi Wilson Reybold

I spoke to her before we came on the air

she says she needs to read the full

report before she comments on it and

it's over 60 pages long so that could

take some time yeah certainly know the

Prime Minister has a media availability

in niagara-on-the-lake in just a few

hours a couple hours what can we expect

from that Mercedes what do think it's

gonna say well I think he's gonna be

asked first of all for a reaction to it

secondly he has said that the

allegations that were made by Jodi

Wilson Raybould weren't true that he did

not direct her any point that he does

not direct his staff at any point so

what does he say now that there is an

independent investigation by the ethics

commissioner who's saying well yes

actually that is what happened that is

what the ethics commissioner believes

happened in his reporting did he ask her

to inappropriately consider partisan

political interests will the government

still consider giving SNC lavalla a

break considering what is being said in

this report and I can tell you we're

trying to track down the Justice

Minister right now because that's his

file but his office has told us they

won't comment on whether or not this is

still on the table at this point so

they're not saying well in light of this

report we're going to no longer consider

whether or not we should be giving them

a break he insists he is not being

pressured by the prime minister's office

and he said that in the past and that he

is making his own decision the other big

factor here the Prime Minister is going

to be asked about this is the second

time that he is found to have been

breaking ethics rules in a single

mandate and obviously that is going to

raise some significant questions

election what more just over two months

away so yeah this is definitely gonna

gonna be part of this campaign and we're

gonna be hearing a lot more about it I

look forward to your full report this

evening on the news thanks so much thank

you
