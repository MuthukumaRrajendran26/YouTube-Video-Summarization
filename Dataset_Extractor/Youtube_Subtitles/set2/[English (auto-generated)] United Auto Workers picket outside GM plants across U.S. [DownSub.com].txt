well you know nobody wants to be a

little sprite you know everybody is

unhappy because corporation they're made

a whole lot of money you know no we're

not asking for a whole lot you know we

have a lot of young families in there

well we have temporary workers they

don't know from day-to-day week-to-week

whether they have a job and that's no

way to live

[Music]

I've been telling them for a year

contracts coming get ready

you'd rather be prepared and not neither

did not be prepared need it so we plan

for the worst hope for the best

[Applause]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Applause]

we have major sticking points that they

refuse to continue to come to the table

and meet with us and try to get resolved

you can always hope I mean we don't want

to strike but as a last resort you do

that when you're not close enough

together you have to do something

you

the only thing less than the four

that we're supporting out here is that

Jim just come back to the table

you know we supported you guys when

using bankruptcy and you know the only

thing we're asking is for a fair

contract and we just want you guys come

back to the table and support us like we

supported you
