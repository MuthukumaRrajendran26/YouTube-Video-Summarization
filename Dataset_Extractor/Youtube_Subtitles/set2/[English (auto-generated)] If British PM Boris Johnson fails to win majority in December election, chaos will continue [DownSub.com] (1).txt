I am Michael cooter and this is the West

block politics perspectives and players

now in December 12th voters in the UK

will cast their ballot will Briggs at

opponents secure enough votes to stop

brexit going ahead at the end of January

and if not what will the present brexit

deal mean for the UK and for the

European Union joining me now is David

Jeffrey professor of British politics at

the University of Liverpool thanks very

much for joining us let's start with the

election calm the opposition pushed for

this election in December what are they

hoping to accomplish and well the main

push for the election came not from the

main opposition Labour Party but the SNP

the Scottish National Party and the Lib

Dems and Liberal Democrats both of whom

hoped to increase their seat share

because they're doing quite well in the

polls against the divided labour party

and amongst their remain voters so

they're hoping to win more seats right

now though recent polls are suggesting

that Prime Minister Boris Johnson will

win in December so if that doesn't hold

true does that change anything in terms

of brexit oh it would change everything

there'd be no more if Boris Johnson got

a majority reflecting what the polls are

showing now he will be completely able

to deliver his deal to deliver brexit

and avoid the log jams that be happening

in the House of Commons at the moment it

would change everything and for people

who maybe don't know it I mean what is

his plan that he can finally put into

place if he has that majority so Boris

Johnson's plan essentially takes the

whole of the United Kingdom out of the

customs union which allows it to strike

trade deals with other countries across

the world it takes the UK as a whole out

of all of the organizations of the EU

which is obviously the kind of the

purpose of brexit as a whole but what it

also does is it removes the backstop

agreements between norther between the

UK and the EU specifically the republic

of adam which will keep northern ireland

in the EU customs territory and in the

single market and it was completely

hated by conservatives and the

Democratic Unionist Party of Northern

Ireland

and how essential is that to removing

the Irish backstop that was that was an

achievement that allowed Horace Junction

to take the deal back to his

parliamentary party and to win over most

of the hardliners within the party those

who voted against Ariza Mays deal so it

was significant from a party discipline

perspective but by at that point that

conservatives lost their majority with

the DUP now how do you think this will

play out for the Scottish National Party

we're already talking about separating

and holding their own referendum to do

that how do you see this playing out

there and what is likely to happen is

the SNP will probably increase their

seizure within Scotland and that will

give them a greater legitimacy to demand

a second independence referendum and

despite the fact that the last one held

in 2014 was supposed to be once in a

generation

however Nicola Sturgeon the leader of

the SNP has said that she won't have a

referendum extra constitutionally so she

will follow the rules and so that would

required requesting a referendum from

the government the national government

and so the ball will be in Boris

Johnson's Court but also how does that

play out in Scotland I mean that just

adds this whole other dimension to all

of this doesn't it yeah it does but that

dimension is already present now so

Scottish politics isn't a competition

between leave and remaining left and

right it's a basically a competition

between do you want to be independent or

do you want to remain are to be that's

how their party like remain part of the

UK that's how their party system

structure at the moment anyway so it's

just part and parcel of what's going on

with now the EU has agreed to a brexit

extension until January 31st of next

year can you walk us through that

agreement for right now and what does

all of that mean that we do have that

extension so that extension is

essentially the longest the UK can

remain within you without requesting

another extension yeah you know after

this election there is a vote on odd on

the Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement

and we can go to the EU

and say we've got an agreement you've

agreed to reverse Parliament ratified it

we are now ready we are now in a

position to meet you

but if we get to the 31st we believe a

crash out with Oh No Deal grexit or we

will have to request another extension

so what if Johnson doesn't increase this

see total and where does that leave us

after that December election if our

attention doesn't win this election and

essentially have an outright majority in

the House of Commons what is likely to

happen is the Labour Party will provide

the government with minority support

from the SNP for more liberal parties

essentially including Lib Dems but one

of the policies which will be a

referendum on membership at the Union so

if Paula Johnson does Boris Johnson

needs to win a healthy majority to avoid

that whereas in order to get a second

referendum remain parties only have to

if they don't have to win themselves

they just have to deprive Boris Johnson

live in the dark now what is this doing

to politics in the UK right now I mean

what kind of chaos is all this causing

I'm trying to help Canadians here

understand it well essentially there's

two things one is that it's it's ripping

parties apart it's the main two parties

of the seats because we've been labor

there's debates between whether you want

a second referendum or you want to enact

the first referendum it's split the

Conservative Party much too little

you've seen upon Prime Minister but most

importantly from a kind of governance

perspective is you can't do anything

else

major pieces of legislation over the

last three years have been held up

because the apparatus of government is

focused towards trying to deliver brac

see if there's a significant cost of the

public to the public purse in terms of

money spent or also time spent so

there's basically three years of

essentially paralysis and four people on

the ground I mean people who have either

voted for or any of these parties what

are they feeling about how their

government is basically crippled by all

of this yeah so and what what we see is

broadly speaking people's opinions

haven't changed there's been a slight

sway

to remain or not a massive swing that

would suggest the British public as a

whole of have changed their minds as a

nation on this question we are divided

and they will the idea that once we

leave the EU these divisions will heal I

think is quite optimistic and so a

society government and also individuals

will have to do more to cut the old $4

bridges and among people who disagree

quite fiercely than this question I mean

so in essence the real work comes after

all of this yes

so if or when this deals passed that

would just be the end of the beginning

we'd still have to negotiate what our

relationship with the EU on a day to day

basis would look like what's our

relationship with what countries would

look like and also tear in and look at

ourselves and look as a country what do

we need to do next to heal division

within society I want to also ask you

because this is three delays on Briggs

it this year so far we do have a new

date of January but you know can it

again be delayed I mean what happens if

it is delayed again

so if Johnson wins this majority it is

all malarkey that we lost for another

extension because you only need one

we've got an agreement that the EU is to

be with and that the government's happy

with and so on and needs to be passed by

the House of Commons if Boris Johnson

doesn't win the likelihood is that we

will request another extension under a

new government in order to give the

fifth time to hold a second referendum

on EU membership and then if that

referendum is also a majority believe

but we don't know what would happen then

because we would have a government is

opposed to leaving me you having to

deliver leaving EU so that would be that

will be a potential catastrophe down the

road addition policies it's a

catastrophe on top of the chaos that we

already have yeah yeah yeah this one was

us well thank you very much David

Jeffrey for joining us today and that's

all the time we have thank you for

joining us for the West block I'm
