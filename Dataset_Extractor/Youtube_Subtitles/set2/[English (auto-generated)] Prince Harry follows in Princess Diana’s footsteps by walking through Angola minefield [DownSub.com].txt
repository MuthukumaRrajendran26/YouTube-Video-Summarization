22 years ago my mother visited Angola

there are still more than 1,000

minefields in this beautiful country

that remains to be cleared the Angolan

people have led by example and

reaffirmed their commitment to be mine

impact free by 2025 and there is so much

work already underway here to achieve

this goal
