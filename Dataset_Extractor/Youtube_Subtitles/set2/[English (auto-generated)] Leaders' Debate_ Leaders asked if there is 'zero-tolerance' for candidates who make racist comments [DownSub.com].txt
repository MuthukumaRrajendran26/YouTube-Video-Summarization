debar open debate now I'm going to ask

you a question and then that's up to you

to respond it's in a crisis situation

that you can measure the judgment and

transparency of a leader you've forgiven

some candidates or let them go

embarrassing candidates so from now on

can you tell us that there will be zero

tolerance for any candidate or MP who

would make any racist comments mr.

Boucher first I understand why this

question is asked tonight any of the

candidate had refused to apologize

explicitly they were not be a candidate

of this look tonight because I can state

I'm sure that the fact that I was that I

wrote in newspapers that was on TV

before I know that everybody's looked

into that would a fine-tooth comb for my

colleagues on stage tonight what is

essential for me in an election campaign

is that people choose for whom they'll

vote based on the values they put forth

and we will debate for examples of

people what we had to forgive you and

mr. Trudeau Mr Shearer as well I can say

is that there is one candidate who did

not serve what meets our policy among

that is a Cal a candidate who breached

ethics guidelines twice who lied about

many things in their life and that is

the liberal popular candidate Rudy

ologies are important but intentions and

values and concrete measures that are

taken are important as well and we will

always judge on values and actions taken

by everyone it's a part of the election

and a choice before people are people

representing their values we'll be there

to defend them and people know that for

four years I have been defending them

and we will continue to move forward

defending

values together I'm not all the

candidates has made mistakes that they

take ownership and there are do we just

need to ensure that they share Canadian

values of tolerance acceptance freedom

our party has been founded personal

responsibility freedom to live by those

that's a question of authenticity if a

person apologizes but doesn't commit to

change in the future there's no strong

commitment to do things differently so

in that case it would be I know but if a

person says their story and commits to

change if they share our values they can

stay in our party our value is to work

for people not for the wealthy our value

is to defend human rights we want to

advance social justice and fight the

climate crisis we can do this together

and that's exactly the type of

candidates and team we have and we need

our democracy I have a number of people

who asked me why would someone run for a

party in an election in our democracy

because there are always things that are

embarrassing but to me it's an issue of

the level of their comments we have zero

tolerance for racism anti-semitism

sexism we have zero tolerance that's

clear but we have to think about this

because in the last few weeks in this

election we have spent an awful lot of

time on a small politics not to try to

find a way to work together to fight the

climate emergency and I my last

I will try to stop the climate need to

work together we need to make the right

choice we need to move forward to fight

against climate change and we will

continue to move forward thank you Mr

Shearer mr. baracs a and M o conclusion

this the choice for this election is

clear four more years of tax hikes more

expensive lives or a Conservative

government that will make life more

affordable for everyone will be in the

House Commons we will vote in favour

when it's good for Quebec against what

is not good for conviction thank you

ladies and gentlemen thank you
