my fellow Americans I greet you this

morning from the White House to announce

a major breakthrough toward achieving a

better future for Syria and for the

Middle East it's been a long time over

the last five days you have seen that a

ceasefire that we established along

Syria's border has held and it's held

very well beyond most expectations early

this morning the government of Turkey

informed my administration that they

would be stopping combat and their

offensive in Syria and making the

ceasefire permanent and it will indeed

be permanent however you would also

define the word permanent in that part

of the world as somewhat questionable we

all understand that but I do believe it

will be permanent

I've therefore instructed the Secretary

of the Treasury to lift all sanctions

imposed on October 14th in response to

Turkey's original offensive moves

against the Kurds in Syria's northeast

border region should turkey failed to

honor its obligations including the

protection of religious and ethnic

minorities which I truly believe they

will do we reserve the right to reimpose

crippling sanctions including

substantially increased tariffs on steel

and all other products coming out of

Turkey we are now an economic powerhouse

like never before and very importantly

like no other our economic might is

stronger than it's ever been and our

competitors are not doing very well we

also expect Turkey to abide by its

commitment regarding Isis as they backup

to the Kurds watching over them should

something happen

turkey is there to grab them
