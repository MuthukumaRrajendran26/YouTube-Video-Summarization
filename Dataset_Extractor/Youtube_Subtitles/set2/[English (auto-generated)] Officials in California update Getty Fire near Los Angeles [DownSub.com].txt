affected areas goes as smoothly as

possible on behalf of the entire

department I want to thank all of the

impacted communities for your

cooperation and your willingness to

quickly quickly work with us to work on

the mandatory evacuation zones gathering

up just those basic belongings and

helping to move to evacuation centers

that have been established through our

emergency operation center we have arms

a hockey and here today as well to

ensure that your safety is of our

paramount concern so please as you see

LAPD officers both on motorcycles on

foot and in vehicles encouraging you to

leave the area please comply as we're

working to maintain order and to keep

you safe so please let know that we are

here to support you in every way

possible thank you so much thank you

sister chief Kamala next I'm going to

ask council member Mike Bonin who

represents this area west of the 405 to

six some words about evacuation centers

and the resources the city is providing

also with our partners with the Red

Cross as we just did in recent weeks

councilmember bonnet Thank You mr. mayor

first of all god bless LAFD and our

first responders and thank them for

everything they've been doing over the

past few hours and thanks to those who

so willingly cooperate it under very

confusing and trying circumstances in

evacuating if you are getting directions

from LAFD or LAPD please follow them if

they say evacuate evacuate if they say

shelter in place

please shelter in place if you are in

the areas for a potential evacuation get

ready

get set and if you want to go go now we

have a number of different evacuation

centers set up throughout the area we

have at stoner Park Rec Center in West

LA at Westwood Rec Center at the

Palisades rec center at Cheviot Hills

Rec Center and at the Van Nuys Sherman

Oaks rec center the Red Cross is

available at all of those places

there are services and a place to be and

we encourage folks who are evacuating to

head there and you will be well taken

care of

thank you finally councilman Paul Koretz

represents just to the east this has not

spread to the east side of the 405

though we're keeping careful eye and we

have resources to protect it from

jumping over luckily the winds are

blowing the other direction here towards

the southwest so far but he also chairs

our committee that oversees our Animal

Services and maybe we'll can give us

some information - about what to do for

our animals as well

well Thank You mr. mayor and I also want

to thank our first responders our

amazing LA Fire Department LAPD and I

also want to echo the message if you're

in the mandatory evacuation zone and

you're still there watching this you're

an idiot

get the hell out it's way too dangerous

people that stay behind are just

endangering themselves and not healthy I

want to echo what the mayor said about

my community which is the 405 in east if

you're in bel-air

because of the wind conditions we don't

expect you to be in danger however if it

were me and I know the department isn't

asking I would on the ready-set-go

system I would be ready I would at least

get my papers than anything else I was

planning on taking together and I would

have my my animals at least I wouldn't

want to know where they are and you

should know I believe the closest place

for your animals to shelter your small

animals is the West LA Animal Shelter so

please be aware of that keep an eye on

your animals and if you need to move as

soon as you get an evacuation order

follow it and move thank you Thank You

councilmember Koretz also the West

Valley Animal Shelter is available to

take folks pets and for large animals

Hanson Dam people don't think of West LA

as having that but there are some horses

that are in both Brentwood and Pacific

Palisades and some of the canyons I'll

say a couple things in Spanish real

quick and then we'll take any questions

finalmente in al freeway the cuatro

cientos cinco SC arado direction the

sewer and Trey Mulholland he'll freeway

TS without happy to answer any questions

or have our fire department so anywhere

yes

absolutely it's a great point please

don't think about yourself right now if

you're trying to get around cones or go

places where roads or freeways are

closed those lanes that are closed

remain closed those exits remain closed

for a reason if this fire jumps we have

to surge vehicles immediately where they

need to be and the last thing you want

to do is be in the way of them so please

let them do their job let them protect

imagine that's your home imagine this is

your neighborhood and do the right thing

my understanding is it's from Mulholland

is that correct

okay yes we do have confirmation it's

Valley Vista to sunset so

so right now I was just up there there's

power on in those areas and obviously

these things have their own power so we

used the technology of Talde Weah sake

and it's here who's our general manager

emergency management department we go

door-to-door we have people who've

signed up for notified LA and then we

push out I was up there I was getting

you know seven or eight of them even

that firefighters saying but I got to

get to the messages but they keep

getting pushed on here so we know that

those messages are going out a lot of

people were asleep though and we

recognized that so they might be waking

up some people who are deep sleepers and

saying what the heck's going on it's a

good time to get out don't panic again

there's not fire that is overtaking

structures or homes right now but it's

really important that people get out

find shelter go to a friend or family's

house if you don't you can obviously go

to the recreation centers and thanks to

the American Red Cross we have resources

we'll feed you will shelter you and as

the chief said and I think he still

confirms that this is not going to be

over today this is going to be a couple

days at least

no way no no no este Incendia

no es el resultado de en camper Mentos

or the Indian taste in este área para

una investigación I'm ass information

durante el día para nosotros podemos

confirm our no es el resultado esto I

saw five personally and I looked over

the ridge where I think there's two or

three when chief said it may be more I

want to caution people that doesn't mean

there's a bunch that are about to be

overtaken shift of the wind could

obviously affect that but right now it

looked like it was probably around eight

maybe seven five for sure it could be it

could be on the other side I saw those

five on Tiger Tail and over on the other

side it looked like two or three but it

could be maybe four or five but not much

more than that okay great thanks

everybody we'll be back for briefing

later today thank you we have PIOs

available to do individual interviews in

English and in Spanish if anybody wants

to stick around we'll let you know when

the next briefing will be we encourage

everybody to visit LAFD org and just

information for any new and and and news
