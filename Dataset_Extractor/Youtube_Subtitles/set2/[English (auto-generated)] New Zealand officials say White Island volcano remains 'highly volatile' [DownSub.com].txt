I'm Clinton or dia I'm the group

controller for the Bay of Plenty Civil

Defence Emergency Management Group and

I'm leading this response to the

tiny events the tragic events of Monday

when Ari why to Ireland I'm

joined today by Judy Turner mayor

attorney District Council Nikifor

Fournier Jimmy's science has been based

just since the Monday monitoring the

activity on the island in Deputy

Commissioner Mike lemons from New

Zealand police firstly I'd like to give

you a review updates from the emergency

Coordination Center the Bay of Plenty

civil defense Emergency Management Group

has been focused on providing welfare

support to victims survivors and their

families

we've established a civil defense

Information Center at four Commerce

Street adjacent to the council

facilities where we operating support

from we're expecting more families to

start arriving in fact attorney today

we're currently focused on ensuring

families of those that are injured and

deceased or supported on arrival New

Zealand so we are coordinating across

New Zealand and working in various

agencies to give you an overview of the

multi-agency response involved here some

of the agencies that are critical to

this and involved our so defence

coordinating the welfare support to as I

said the families the National Emergency

Management Agency has also issued an all

a government fact sheet for public use

and the details have been provided for

where people can access support and

information this is on the website of

the National Emergency Management Agency

just like Tala today we're not providing

an update on the health status of those

in hospital they will provide it at a

later point in the course of today

I'm going to now hand over to and we'll

hand over to the next speakers and then

we'll take some questions at the end

thank you so invite me Judy Turner also

I'm here today representing the very

clear messaging that I'm getting from my

community regarding all that is

happening I need to make it clear that

while we fully appreciate the need for

the safety of any recovery team going on

to Pocari white island to retrieve our

loved ones there we are now living with

a growing sense of desperation to bring

home those that we know are there and

those we love the frustration of those

families most affected is completely

understandable and so the need for

regular updates is now absolutely

essential they're asking for messages to

be confirmed to them what has been

planned who will be involved how well

they will be equipped and how responsive

those teams can be once clear and as

clearance is given that is a priority

for them no news is not good news for

people in this situation I am grateful

and so are the families to the police

for including a local person with local

knowledge of the island to take out on

to the recovery team this person knows

exactly where the bodies are so we'll be

able to help the recovery team and this

should mean that once they are on the

island they're clear knowledge of where

to look will save a lot of time and

improve safety I am now going to hand

over to our gns science reporter Nicole

for it really good mind everyone first

and foremost our thoughts are with the

families of all involved I think it's a

tragedy and we are really working hard

to twine us is the operations here so

that we can bring closure to the

families and we've been working with the

responding agencies for since day one

and both here in fact sunny but also in

Topo in Wellington and we're trying to

get as much real-time information to

support the operations as an update on

activity at folk re-what highlands the

situation is pretty much the same as it

was yesterday night there is still an

increase in activity and increase in

pressure inside the volcano we believe

that there is shallow magma the molten

rocks which is driving the activity of

the under the under the surface and this

is portrayed by one of our main

indicators which is the level of tremor

that is increasing and it's keep

increasing and we speak as well the

consequence of those processes is that

the situation remains highly volatile

and all our combined data are actually

suggesting that to that extent this is

the most active that fuckery white

island has been since 2016 and probably

going back to quite a few years as well

so it is really a high level of unrest

in this volcano what we're doing at the

moment all our monitoring equipment that

we rely on it is still operating on

Islands so we are able to get 24/7

monitoring of the of the activity both

by our scientists and by the 20u

National Interior has its monitoring

sensor bays in Wellington we're doing

also some flights around the volcano at

a reasonable distance to try to get an

idea about the amount of gas emitted by

this volcano this is not for health

impact on the ground this is just as an

indicator of the this magma coming up

from the volcano so very much along the

same line that the tremor what we doing

to try to assist the operations is to

provide an idea about the likelihood of

an eruption over the next 24 hours and I

just got the latest numbers and they are

still the same as yesterday's so to the

to our knowledge at the moment our best

estimate is that the likelihood of an

eruption over the next 24 hours that

would affect the area potentially where

the rescue team would be is still

between 40 and 60% so this is a highly

risk operation because the volcano is

not currently erupting and the other

level is raised down to two but this is

just portraying that is currently not

erupting it doesn't mean that it can't

erupted and the eruption probability is

still very high and so again the focus

right now is on keeping providing in

real-time support to the rescue

operations

providing the blocky hood of an eruption

and the risk that with those teams take

on the ground and who has this to rescue

and bring closure to the families and

finally I'd just like to reiterate that

we'd like to bring up basically all our

thoughts are with the family of those

intros and affected by the eruptions

thank you Kirikou my Clement for people

who don't know me on the Deputy

Commissioner National Operations based

in Police national headquarters but the

local controller from a police

perspective is of yesterday I just to

want to acknowledge grieving families in

New Zealand and abroad

in in particular grieving community

locally here in folk attorney Eastern

Bay of Plenty more broadly across New

Zealand I can tell you that there is no

greater priority and New Zealand Police

and I think I confidently speak for all

of the agencies who stand alongside US

foreign emergency health officials

Defence Force and mines rescue so we are

all equally committed to finding a

solution that safely gets us onto the

island so that we can recover the people

we believe to be deceased on that island

and return those people after a TVI

process to the Afar know so that is the

highest priority for us I can assure you

that everybody is equally committed to

that function so what are we doing

currently you've just heard the context

with regard to the rust on the island no

one can ignore that particularly us

who've got responsibilities for all of

our people to doing that as safely as we

can and context with the function that

we've been asked to perform so we have

that in the forefront of our thinking so

we have a group of people who are

committed locked away in a room just

downtown here who are working and that's

a group of agencies that I just

referenced a few months ago a group of

agencies who are working a way of

developing options for me given that

risk profile that Niko has just outlined

to you that could change tomorrow and so

the options would include if the

situation on the island changed in terms

of that interpretation is to risk then

our options would change with it so as

we are proceeding on the basis that's

number one the risk is about the likely

of another eruption and Nico has

outlined that in the second dimension to

the risk profile that we have to take

into consideration there's the presence

of guesses on the island and that can

have a lot to do with the environmental

factors including winter there's the

winter taking the gas away from the area

in which we'd have to be working to

recover those bodies so without further

ado is just going to take any questions

from you I just want to acknowledge the

fact that a group of pilots in people

who operators from what Island tours who

went onto the island to recover those

who are living and the immediate

aftermath of the eruption have rightly

deserved praise from New Zealanders and

those abroad and I met with some of

those not all of those operators but

some of those operators last night and I

listened to their stories and I'm sure

that the media is listening to some of

those stories too and they put

themselves well out in the in the front

of their own in their own thoughts with

regard their own safety and and the

interests of saving those that were

alive on the island they too went

through a risk assessment they might

have not done it in a formalized way as

we must but they too went through our

risk assessment in their own minds with

regard to how long they could stay in

that environment and I believe that they

made the right decision in with regard

to coming off the island in taking a

s--t off with regard to next steps so

I'm full of admiration for what they did

it happens often here and elsewhere and

I think they're heroes your questions

are going to be will we recognize them

as heroes I'm very confident we'll do

that in the fullness of time in the

meantime we are working with that group

of people and we've asked for two of

those people to work very closely with

us as we develop the plan with regard to

going on to white island to recover the

bodies

part of me sorry well I don't think I'd

call ignoring the advice but you know

when I got here last night it's clearly

that I've got a story to tell so the

people that we are talking about that I

said was representing those

organizations foreign emergency mines

rescue police and defense probably

amongst them there's not a person who's

been on what on what Island I imagine I

don't know for sure there might be just

by chance the reality is what we did

this last night was listen to them

because I've got incredible experience

some of them decades with regard to

going on to white island and so we need

to make sure that we factor that in

terms of the plan we develop this regard

to going back on there and may or may

not involve them directly but it

certainly will involve taking their

thoughts with regard their experience of

the island

well you just heard about their coming

the reality is we can do anything but as

a as a is the officer in charge here on

locally in and FAC attorney

am I going to do that given the risk

that you've just had detailed to you

not without a clear plan that's agreed

by all of those agencies who have

responsibility for their people to do it

safely or in a way that's in context

with the tasks that we've been given

debtors to recover people we believe to

be deceased so could we go on and do it

today yes we could but you've just heard

Niko outline the risk that exists on the

island so at no time in the last two

years probably longer is the risk of

further eruption been greater so I think

you can all stand here and appreciate

the thought sorts of things that as an

organization or as a lead with regard to

the recovery that I've got to consider

in that regard so the answer is could I

yes I could but I the real question is

can I do that in context with the risk

in with my obligation to keep our people

safe well what you asked me for an

answer right the second I would say no

because I don't have a plan that

satisfies me that the risk is able to be

mitigated to the extent that I need it

to be mitigated to keep those people

safe given that profile that Niko is

outlined to you so I think everybody can

appreciate right we've got a level of

activity on the island with regard to

the potential for further

option that is unprecedented in the last

couple of years potentially longer and

I'd simply can't ignore that I'm pretty

confident everybody listening a new folk

will understand the reason for that can

I indicate who's coming next otherwise

well I don't think we we don't approach

this on the basis of mitigating down to

zero so don't so I'm not being

ridiculous about it so at the end of the

day what I have to do is plan for a

range of options at the moment the risk

of an eruption you've heard Niko say to

you is from the range of 40 to 60% at

the moment and this we can mitigate and

that's what the options development is

attempting to achieve down to a level

where I think that I've got a degree of

comfort is the person making the call

with regard to what we do next then we

can't make that call there's going to be

a time frame of when those bodies can be

recovered because as time passes by so I

understand all of the factors with

regard to what we're playing up against

here so number one I can't give an

assurance around a timeline because the

reality is I don't control all of the

factors yet so you've had the risk

outlined to you I don't control what the

what the volcano is doing in terms of

eruption so until I can get us a really

clear sense of what the risk is worth

regard for the likelihood of eruption

and context with the plans that we are

developing you know I can't make a

commitment to these families lit look

like this is core to policing is

making sure that the people who are

nearest and dearest to those that are

impacted particularly those that are

left on the island there's in the

forefront of our thinking of us what

drives all of us there won't be a person

in the room that has got

more passion about going onto that

Island than police stuff we are all

deeply passionate about getting onto the

island to recover those bodies I'd give

that commitment to this community to

those far know whether they are in New

Zealand or abroad I know everybody is

watching I have conversations with

colleagues and other jurisdictions about

the approach that they might take and we

are all burdened with the very same

challenge when it comes to the decisions

that we have to make I understand

completely

I will make myself available to all of

you folk to family to answer their

questions we're pushing hard with regard

to what we call family liaison officers

flows by another definition so each of

those farno has family liaison officers

associated with them but bear in mind

and we see this play out time and time

again we've got a real challenge with

regard to that because some of the near

the next of kin are right here and using

than alongside us with regard to that

and some of them are abroad right so

they're not all here some of them are

traveling to New Zealand so there's

quite a challenge in terms of being able

to meet the expectation of the people

who are here in New Zealand here in this

community and who are abroad and who are

very closely related to those who are

impacted how we'll be able to right

after midday but I've got a sense of

them so I think you know that the

options are always all the way from if

we had to act now how do I get a sense

as that person making the calls regard

to that that I can mitigate the risk to

the satisfaction of those agencies

because while I can speak for police

personnel each of their chief executives

of the agencies that are involved

whereas fins or New Zealand Defence

Force or mines rescue or police have

each got the same obligation and

potentially they will make up the teams

that go onto the island so it may not be

all police police doesn't necessarily

possess all of the skills against some

of the options that might be developed

so the options will be in the range of

get in quick lift up lift the bodies and

get out as quickly as you can now that

makes sense to everybody right but

there's a there's a consequence or a

trade-off for that because one of the

disciplines associated with uplifting to

see two people on a mass casualty

situation like this is preserving the

evidence that might lead to identity and

the more time we can spend with the body

when we are left

from the circumstances in which they've

died the more likelihood that we can

preserve that evidence so there's a

trade-off if we get in and do that fast

and bring them out this is planning for

a scenario where we're going to bow to

spend more time at the scene with those

bodies preserving that evidence so is

that we're able to take identification

evidence to the coroner he signs off in

terms of identity because we'll get no

thanks whatsoever if we reach a

situation at the end of this we were not

able to sign off on identity that would

be an absolute poor outcome for us we

aim to repatriate all of the deceased to

their families and do so in a way that

there is conclusive proof to the

satisfaction of the coroner with regard

to identity so that all trade war

situations that's my job is to consider

the options given that scenario

yeah well that's that's the reality of

it I mean people do things in the moment

and they'd think that act of bravery

bravery no one's going to try and unpack

you know so they went through the very

same risk assessment but not in the way

in which I'm doing it and currently I've

got an obligation I've got to do it in a

certain way I mean otherwise a number

one I'm putting my people in the people

and other agencies at risk but that

doesn't say that people who don't go

through that same process aren't going

to intervene so if you put it into a

scenario where someone sees something

violent happening on the street say an

assault and they intervene in that I'm

sure they don't go through a long and

detailed risk assessment they probably

just pile into I didn't think I need to

stop this because I don't like seeing

what I'm seeing

but the reality is and the fullness of

time so once having made a decision that

the people were able were alive were

able to be saved we're saved and those

that weren't able to be saved are still

on the island

they've reached their own that

conclusion themselves so I understand

why people will say that you you're

Christian well why don't you just take

the same approach they talk I mean they

managed to get on at the island and

recover those pod

and they didn't come to any harm the

reality is that happened in the moment I

don't have that moment I can't go back

and reinvent that moment absolutely

that's that's all on the max with regard

to so what are we trying to achieve here

because of the you know and Paul's

question you know in the first instance

like race onto the island click them

there and take the risk that you do

versus all the way through to you know

the scenario might be that you mitigate

this thing down to zero it's three weeks

later so much activity has happened

potentially with regard to what happens

to the volcano but also decomposition

that the end up not having a sure so if

we had an eruption again tomorrow or

today or when people were on Islands it

would be exposed to range of hazards and

this is what killed unfortunately the

people and a few earlier in in a week

kind of hazards that you would be

affected by would be basically very fast

and ballistics so we're talking blocks

rocks going at incredibly high speeds

and that would be one source of casualty

basically we'd be pummeled to death

effectively the ash would probably be

quite high it depends on how much magma

is actually involved in the eruption so

it could go from a few hundred degrees

Celsius to the higher temperatures so

we're talking about very high speed high

impact high temperature impact on people

I think it's important to stress that

right now what is preventing the rescue

operations on Ireland is really the risk

of the eruption this is really what is

really putting people at risk to life

safety the awesome has associated with

with environmental hazards and those are

being

worked on to actually meet EBT Medicaid

precede them is there any indication so

what we had a bit earlier this week was

possibly a frantic eruption we're still

trying to work out what happened exactly

but all the evidence we're having from

our monitoring information monitoring

data is pointing out magma being present

at shadow level so what this means it

means that the next eruption could

actually involve magma being hotter

possibly be more powerful as well yes so

we're doing a lot of quantitative

estimates of probabilities so we're not

just popping that member out of back

pockets so we're going through a very

rigorous process and it's about asking

teams of experts to give the best

estimate based on the current situation

and the data that we're recording in

real time so what the mulling is the

output of that modeling it's basically

the numbers we have been producing which

is the probability of an eruption over

the next 24 hours affecting the area

where the people would be walking so

effect ly the 40 to 60% numbers are

coming from quite a rigorous process

that has been peer reviewed by

international experts and so on

so we can't really do predictions there

what we can do is really try we could

give a wider and we do give why the time

windows but really it's not really

helping that much is not providing more

accuracy later down the line right now

we're focusing on the time window that

is relevant and useful for the rescue

operations right now it's 24 hours

because the volatility of the other

system is quite high so going much

beyond that probably would be very

uncertain so I can talk very briefly and

perhaps asking others to comment there

in a nutshell I think the working

operations with probably 300 meters plus

from the from the active event which is

very close from the activity Police

Commissioner instrument so it's in an

area of about 200 square meters so about

Aptus I suppose a maximum of 300 meters

from the shoreline and there are you

know imagine though in sort of clusters

of small groups so they are all

reasonably accessible to each other

they're not over a vast area

whoa so on between the shoreline in the

crater Oh

[Music]

broadly speaking within an area about

200 square meters

yeah so I think most of you appreciate

the problem we've got was regard to

identifying so we we don't identify

people that's the role of the coroner

and have a very graphic coroner if I

said to you that we had made

identifications outside of that process

what we've what experience tells us is

that people want to know and people who

already do so there's people out in the

community who can do their own

reconciliation because there's 47 people

went onto the island there's a group of

people are in hospital and so they work

out of course just like you will there's

a group of people some of whom we've got

the identities for who are missing

presumed to be dead so that's why we've

put up the list so there's 16 in that

category 8 people who have deceased who

either brought back who are brought back

to the island right back on the island

and some of them were already a deceased

instance 3 more have died in hospital it

makes a total of 8 and we believe there

to be but we need to confirm this by

going on to beyond and collecting the

bodies but having debriefed the people

who are on the island who took them

there and who went to the island

immediately afterwards we believe

there's eight but that is subject to

final confirmation so the group of so I

just need to answer the question because

I think there's a bit of confusion about

the nine so how do I get how do you get

16 8 and 18 equals 16 so how'd you get

to 9 so the 8 we can say that I'm

listening with a reasonable amount of

confidence confidence because we can't

reconcile those 8 names with the people

who are in hospital who have been

discharged right the ninth as a pip is

the person that we don't have enough

detail to be working with the next of

kin to say that we are confident that

we've got an identity subject to

confirmation by the coroner so that's

why there are 9 people in the 8 on the

island and one of those who since died

in the hospital making a total of 9 out

of the 16 total does that make sense

because we understand it so the problem

we've got is with is a process underway

with the coroner so the 9 there is no

process underway so with that the

terminology is important here is missing

police is not not the role of police to

name them as deceased what we're saying

is they have missing we there's a

process underway that's now in the hands

of the coroner to work through a DVI

process to name them after the coroner

is confident having gone through a

post-mortem and identification process

to name them we're not we're not at

liberty to do that so what we tried to

do is reach an accommodation the sayers

of the people that are not in their

process yet that we will name them as

missing it's the nine who are named as

missing as the process works through

with regard to the other seven as my

mess right someone tell me so we've got

eight who have died to having reached

the mainland so as that process

continues and the chorus signs all from

those identification processes then

those names will be released as

confirmed identities in the meantime

we've got a problem

naming those that are already in the mix

we are working with the next of kin so

whoever raised the point with regard to

their that is right so the next of kin

will know that we are confident that we

are working with their next of kin who

is deceased but the decision about

putting the name up on the website is

not ours

it's got to go through a cranial process

two minutes you've heard or entities to

get out game playing we've just like to

get back to these

will not be able to recover it because

I'm worried I'm like everybody else

worried that we don't get out there to

recover those bodies and it's my job to

make sure that I push the planning team

to ensure that doesn't happen but I

don't control everything at play here

okay so I'm into the questions of Russ

before if they if the science is it's

predicting that an eruption has got a

channeler 40 to 60% chance of hip

reoccurring and that happens and before

I've been able to commit and mitigate

that risk to a satisfactory standard to

better get people on the island to

recover those bodies then of course that

worries me that would be a scenario that

I wouldn't want to contemplate and I'm

sure that would go for everybody well

that's the best of what I have to be

convinced by my team who's going to be

talking to me with those options in the

two local operators at at midday today

so midday they will come back to me and

say here's the risk in terms of what's

happening on the island we're on the

mountain and the environmental factors

here's our options development and I've

got to go through a process of saying

the very thing that you've just asked

that's the job well we wouldn't be

foregoing it we would just be taking

away some of the indicators of lead to

identity so I mean I personally I think

that's a trade off for the option that

will be presented to me I'm confident at

midday is to say well okay if one of the

options you want bosses to get in and

get those people off the island quickly

then I'm telling you now you run a risk

that we lose some of the identification

opportunities I'll I'll buy that

probably I think and the interests that

we're all thinking here is wouldn't it

be better to have the body and an estate

that's acceptable in four go now that's

easy for me to say and you

nod but if you're the next of kin and we

don't give an identification as a

consequence of taking that process they

are not going to be happy and I would

understand that and so would you that's

a possibility that we would do that we

would go to them and say this could be a

consequence and I need to know how sure

that is I mean there's not just one

factor that we consider when it comes to

identification as fingerprints as DNA

there's visuals all their visuals lists

reliable particularly in these

circumstances as a range of factors you

know so I don't think we're going to die

in a ditch over a process it's globally

practiced and inconsistent because the

reality is we have to play they're up

against two circumstances and no one

controls the circumstances so you know I

get the seats in the room and it sits

with me also is that get in get those

people off and then deal with the

trade-off

there is a little bit back here so we at

the moment we provide those updates to

the rescue operations and really the aim

is to provide as much you know as

precise information as we can give as

accurate information as we can to all of

those guys to make the right decision

for their for their stuff so this is not

a conversation I think to have with me I

think what we provide is information

with through the adult level and through

this kind of updates and we've been

providing those over the past few weeks

effectively then the decision of

bringing people online and it's not mine

and not mine to comment to be filled

in scientists or volcano eruption of

yeah the old members the ol numbers

there are probably won't get into

details there they are basically much

lower than what we've got right now

effectively so the level of risk right

now is far too high for sending one of

our stuff out there the level of risk is

one part of the conversation the

acceptability of risk is another one and

of course this changes you wouldn't jump

in a car which is engulfed in flame if

nothing you know you've got nothing in

there if it's your child you will so

that acceptability of risk is the

important conversations and it's not the

same for a scientist for response

agencies and everybody's one at that

thank you ladies and gentlemen can I

thank you for your talk we will be back

with more briefings for you if you could

just excuse us we really like to get

back we've got a problem I did not give

it
