of this person but if I left you with

anything it wouldn't be what we're going

to do forward I would ask you to to

think of the 20 lives that were lost

those were persons in our community and

we will miss them and all of the all of

the victims who either sir flirt

physical and emotional impact from what

happened we are just not a community

that that really this is not us we are

like the like the bright sunshine today

that is us we are a really good and

loving community but we will hold him

accountable thank you my name is John

bash on the United States Attorney for

the Western District of Texas which

covers El Paso my grandmother has lived

here for 50 years she's 91 since it was

a much smaller community I don't think

she's ever seen anything like this in

this community my mom grew up here my

dad went to college here

I looked here I was very young it's been

devastating for the community I've been

unbelievably impressed by our first

responders by the DA's office fire

police FBI in the work they've conducted

we had a very long night last night work

in this case I've been in close

consultation with attorney general barb

we are conducting a methodical

investigation with our partners a

careful investigation but with a view

towards bringing federal hate crimes

charges under 18 USC 249 and federal

firearms charges which carry a penalty

of death we are seriously considering

those charges we're going to conduct a

methodical and careful investigation

with a few towards those charges

we are also treating this as a domestic

terrorist case there's a statutory

definition of domestic terrorism at 18

USC 2 3 3 1 this meets it it appears to

be designed to intimidate a civilian

population to say the least we are

treating it as a domestic terrorism case

and we're going to do what we do to

terrorists in this country which is

deliver Swift and certain justice

with that I think we'll turn it over for

questions so I failed to recognize

everyone in the room the commander with

the Department of Public Safety and my

name is Tommy Gonzales city manager I'd

like to send a message to the families

and that is that our first responders

are working diligently to unify the

families and get the bodies back to them

as quickly as possible

we're not we're expending all resources

in order to make that happen

and we'll open it up for questions now

basically from the manifesto that we

first saw we have to attribute that

manifesto directly to him based on that

information in that manifesto that's

where that came from

and so we're going down that road that's

beginning to look more solid laid like

that is the case

we've got a reunification center that's

turned into a grieving center over in

the central area where the event took

place pretty much and as a matter of

fact on that I'd like to ask the media

to be respectful of the families right

now we've been getting complaints that

the media have been over burdening them

with the questions when naturally

they're more concerned about finding out

about their loved ones so we ask you to

respectfully to abide by their wishes

but with that being said we're looking

at all responders and everyone who has

been on the ground participating in this

event with providing them references to

alleviate their suffering yes he asked

there's not words you can place to say

something like that you know you have to

see it for yourself

when I first got into this job I never

knew there was an odor to blood but

there is and until you firsthand see

that my description of it as far as

horrific will be uncertain as far as

what that scene looks not so I can't

tell you what that means other than for

the normal individual that doesn't have

to deal with that on a day-to-day basis

it will leave an impression that you

will never forget I'll just leave it at

that

well I can't get into the details of

that again we have to be respectful of

the fact that this person still has his

rights and even though he's cooperating

we still have to keep that in play to

make sure the investigation goes forward

successfully

I'm sorry sir not at this time I'm sure

we'll find that out later with the help

of more federal authorities but right

now Bulls are particulars about the

investigation that I think that we need

to maintain within our purview I'm sorry

easy what that's a liability of Texas

yes technically of course a normal

individual seeing that type of weapon

might be alarmed but technically it was

in the realm of the law I'm sorry well a

protein or responding officers I believe

in Texas Department Public Safety was

involved in that particular arrest when

he saw the officers approaching the

scene where he was at

he basically surrendered and that was

over on the farther west side from the

local student site I believe he was how

you can't confirm that as a matter of

fact the dog that's why I believe he was

they occurred in the Dallas area where

the individual in question is from and I

believe there was some media coverage of

those residents when we did it so again

we continue to do that investigation is

not going to give any particular detail

as to what was found and things like

that but a lot can transpire in 24 hours

and as we continue to investigation to

gather information yes he was

forthcoming with information he

basically didn't hold anything back

particular questions were asked and he

responded and what it need to be

answered

well there's a statutory definition of

domestic terrorism under federal law

you'll hear me there's a statutory

definition of domestic terrorism under

federal law that I mentioned earlier 18

USC 23 31 and that definition matters

for a variety of purposes it has factors

I won't go through all of them but the

key factor here is it appears to be an

intent to coerce or intimidate a

civilian population that's met here at

the attack from what we know in the

public record certainly appears to the

intimidate intended to intimidate or

coerce a civilian population so we're

treating it as a domestic terrorism case

as the FBI special agent in charge said

they have activated the domestic

terrorist fusion cell at the FBI and so

we're going to breed it that way going
