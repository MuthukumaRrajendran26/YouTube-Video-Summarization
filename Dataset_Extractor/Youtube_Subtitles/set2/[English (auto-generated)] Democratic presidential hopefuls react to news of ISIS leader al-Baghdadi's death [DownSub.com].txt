and but I want to make a comment at the

beginning here because I you know we

have the finest warriors in the history

of the world that's not hyperbole we in

fact do and what not withstanding all

they all don't characterize and the

things that the president has done

relative to Syria I just want to make a

point that we're in a situation where we

have the bravery and the courage it took

for the double force and our Special

Forces to do what they did is enormous

it really is it really really is we owe

them a debt of gratitude they literally

are no hyperbole the finest fighting

force in history of the world the best

trained in the world and we pray to God

we don't have to use them that often but

when we do they do their job like nobody

else does and I don't know a state that

has a higher percentage of veterans and

military people in this state every

everybody in this state who was in the

military raise your hand in this

audience thank you thank you thank you

folks

al Baghdadi's death was good news to the

United States and people around the

world but you know his corrosive message

really hurt but here's the point I want

to make Isis remains a threat to the

United the American people our allies

and we have to keep the pressure on we

can't walk away we can't walk away from

our friends we can't walk away from

those people by the way the courage gave

10,000 lives to end that Kaila fight and

we owe them we've had to be a keep our

word

my understanding interestingly enough is

that that mission was accomplished with

information supplied by the Kurds and as

we know Trump has turned this back and

betrayed the curt's something that I

think will have a negative impact not

only in that region of the world but in

terms of our relationship with allies

from one end of this planet to the other

but clearly any victory against a this

octave group like a terrible terrorist

group like Isis here's something that is

possible

I commend our men and women in our armed

forces and our intelligence community

for their work in tracking him down and

making sure that our world is safer

because of his demise I don't think that

the president should be taking credit

for the work of the men and women in

uniform and these intelligence agencies

that he routinely

lambaste but all of that aside I think

you know that we can be pleased that

somebody who dedicated so much of his

time and his effort in his life to

trying to harm others is no longer going

to be able to do that clearly this is a

real blow against Isis and a positive

step in the fight against stateless

terrorism and credit should go to all

who were involved and I think it's an

example of what our special operations

and intelligence personnel are capable

of around the world and all credit goes

to our Special Forces to our

intelligence community I work with them

there on a consistent basis in the

course of my belief my role

and they do extraordinary work most of

the time without any recognition of

their sacrifice and their hard work and

professionalism this is obviously good

news this is something I'm learning

about and looking forward to getting

more information and hopefully get a

briefing on once we get back to

Washington but this is positive news in

furthering us closer towards the defeat

of Isis
