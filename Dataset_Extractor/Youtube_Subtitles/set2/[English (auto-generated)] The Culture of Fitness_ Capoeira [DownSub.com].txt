Fitness looks different around the world

how do exercise regimens from different

cultures compared to a traditional gym

routines this is the culture of fitness

first we had to South America

well metaphorically to try out capoeira

it's an afro-brazilian martial art that

was created by the slaves in Brazil over

400 years ago and it's a combination of

martial arts acrobatics dance and music

who is the addition of music and dance

to the martial art that disguise

capoeira's true purpose people from

different tribes create a form of

self-defense but they had to hide it

their slave owners didn't want them

practicing something that could

potentially be deadly to them so they

mask the skies that in a form of dance

to make it look innocent and just like a

playful celebration but all of that

celebration takes a lot of work you're

never standing still you're always

moving you literally move every single

part of your body from your toes to your

pinky you go upside down so you're gonna

be using all the little muscles in your

hand your upper body your arms the basic

stance of capoeira is called the Ginga

you're always in a low grounded position

which is an amazing workout for your

legs what you need a little bit more

there is the the rhythm of a dense right

so you can't go through them rhythm is

gonna be my issue you're always moving

yes doing capoeira so you're always

going to kind of keep that heart rate

the connection between two players is a

little bit like improv you react to each

other's moves one two three we are

demonstrating the the agility and the

the control of the movements by coming

very close to the to our opponent

without hitting them at a beginner level

we just keep the distance a little bit

further

as much as possible watch yourself in

the mirror watch myself in the mire

yourself in the mirror no problem there

two and three looking forward oh there

we go there you go

I feel like I got it that's that man

when you're in the holder the energy of

the music and the instruments it's much

more than just something that you do

physical you really got to give yourself

your whole emotion in your soul
