people what we do here I also want to

acknowledge the leadership of madam

chair let Cheerilee house Administration

Committee Zoe Lofgren she is a champion

of a brilliant legal mind that we call

upon in many arenas areas here and a

champion of securing our elections we're

gonna be here with our freshmen now the

freshman class going to campaign about 1

year ago they sent a letter signed by a

hundred of candidates many of them many

of whom like 6 to 7 or someone who

became members of Congress stating that

HR 1 was of the highest priority

cleaning of government our agenda in the

last election was for the people voting

from the words that brilliant words of

our founders at the start of our

Constitution We the People Constitution

begins We the People we are acting for

the people and with us today our

representative malinovski of New Jersey

representative booths of Colorado

represent a papist of New Hampshire

representative Holland of New Mexico and

many more members of my freshman class

who have been leaders on this issue but

I'm proud to be standing with those who

you'll and you'll be hearing from no one

would care we we sent this legislation

over to Z Senate Majority Leader Mitch

McConnell and it's been sitting there

and his grim reaper rolled but we're

saying to him the American you may think

this is dead over there Grim Reaper but

a nice thing to say about yourself but

it is alive and well in the public and

the people know that went and they will

no more get you a hole

this up it's important to note that

Mitch McConnell has said the problem is

not that there's too much money in

politics the problem is that there isn't

enough money in politics

well there's ever a declaration of lack

of values in terms of our democracy with

stiff competition that stands as a

prominent one I'm now very pleased to

yield to the distinguished chair of our

task force a leader and restoring

confidence in government and increasing

the role of the people for the people in

government Congressman John Sarbanes

thank you thank you madam Speaker

yeah here we are 200 days since we first

introduced HR 1 for the people Act

Mitch McConnell still will not bring it

to the floor of the United States Senate

this bill was crafted in response to

what we were hearing from the American

public and the freshman members of

Congress who are standing behind me we

will hear from in a moment carried that

message loud and clear to this chamber

our speaker heard that message and she

leaned in on day one and he introduced

this as soon as we put our hands down

I'm taking the oath of office HR 1 for

the people Act was introduced with the

leadership of Speaker Pelosi but with

the championing that came from the

freshman class and the message that was

heard from the American public that we

took to heart and we put into the the

soul of HR 1 was number one they were

saying to us you shouldn't have to run

an obstacle course to get to the ballot

box in America so we need to strengthen

voting and registration and push back on

voter suppression across the country the

second thing that they said listen that

that was coming that we heard loud and

clear was when you go to Washington you

should behave yourself you should act

ethically you should abide by the rules

conflict of interest rules and so forth

so we built a part of HR one that would

address ethics and accountability and

the third thing the third message

that was coming to members of Congress

from the American people was when you

get to Washington don't get tangled up

in the money remember who sent you there

don't work for the insiders and then

PACs and the super PACs and the

lobbyists and the special interest work

for us the American people and that was

embody and reforms that create

transparency about where the big money

comes from builds a new system for

powering campaigns that makes small

donors the most important people out

there and strengthens the enforcement

tools that we have here to catch people

that are breaking the law on campaign

finance in real time that was all put

into HR 1 in the House Democrats heard

those messages from the American people

and we immediately translated it into a

blueprint a framework for democracy

reform which was HR 1 Mitch McConnell

apparently is not listening the way

we're listening because for 200 days

he's kept HR 1 on the Senate side

without bringing it to the floor we're

asking him bring this landmark

legislation that can fix our democracy

to the Senate floor so the people can

have a vote and it's my privilege now to

introduce really the person who made

sure we got this gun in terms of regular

order in the House of Representatives

and that's so Lofgren who is the chair

of the House Administration Committee

where all of this was pulled together

and were able to get it over the finish

line in the House of Representatives

said well you know I am in addition to

the elements outlined so well by mr.

sarbanes there was a provision in HR 1

to secure our voting systems all 50

states were targeted in the attacks the

cyber attacks

in 2016 and we know that the attackers

will be back just yesterday the Acting

Director of National Intelligence said

this quote I think the greatest

challenge that we have is to make sure

we maintain the integrity of our

election system we know right now that

there are foreign powers that are trying

to get us to question the validity of

whether or not our elections are valid

he went on to say protecting the

sanctity of our elections within the

United States whether it be national

state local is perhaps the most

important job we have with the

intelligence community so for the fact

passed 200 days we have been pressing

the Senate to take up HR 1 for the

reasons outlined by mr. sarbanes but we

have also provided a billion dollars for

states to upgrade the security of their

voting systems across the country by

replacing outdated vulnerable voting

machines with paper ballot voting

systems 175 million for ongoing funds

for states to respond to evolving

threats 20 million dollars for states to

implement risk limiting audits a

regulation of elective election vendors

to make sure they follow cybersecurity

best practices you know it seems to me

that securing our election system should

not be a partisan issue every American

should know that when they cast their

ballot it's going to be counted just as

they cast it that is not a democratic

issue it's not a Republican issue it's

not an independent issue it's an

American issue it's time for Mitch

McConnell and the Senate to act on HR 1

and secure our democracy I'd like to

introduce now someone who has been such

a standout in the freshman classes

expertise in the State Department his

keen intelligence his integrity beyond

question that is mr. Malinowski please

come for

hey thank you everybody

madam Speaker you mentioned that letter

that that we all sent it seems like

years ago when we were just starting our

campaigns I I put my name on that letter

because I spent much of my career

fighting corruption around the world and

one reason I ran for Congress is because

I want the United States to be able to

hold its head up high and to be a leader

on these issues and I was elected like

so many of the freshmen in a district

that is evenly divided between

Republicans Democrats independents and

my approach our approach has been for

Congress to focus on issues focus on

passing legislation that can be unifying

with the American people and there is

nothing more unifying there is nothing

more bipartisan when it comes to the

American people than opposition to

corruption I talked to folks back in my

district Republicans Democrats it does

not matter I keep I do not meet a single

person who is happy with the idea that

people and corporations can spend an

unlimited amount of money in secret to

influence our elections I don't need

anybody who wants epics rules to be

weaker rather than stronger I don't mean

anybody who believes that partisan

gerrymandering is a good idea and I

certainly don't mean anybody who

believes that we should open our

political system to foreign interference

now we know what's happening in the US

Senate

we're realistic about Mitch McConnell he

has some arguments against campaign

finance reform they're bad arguments but

at least he has an argument he has

absolutely no argument for holding up

legislation to protect the security of

our ballot box he has made absolutely no

argument I can think of no more stark

example a pudding party over country

than this it is literally exposing

America to further attack to promote the

interests of one

action of one political party in this

country the American people are very

clear about what they want again it may

be partisan here it is completely

bipartisan when it comes to the American

people and that's why despite the

difficulties we are facing I am a

hundred percent confident that the US

Senate will pass HR 1 either this Senate

were a Senate that will be elected by

candidates who run with candidates who

run on this issue I'm absolutely

confident that HR 1 will be signed into

law by the President of the United

States either by this president or by a

president who was elected by running on

this area thank you very much and now

I'm very very happy to introduce my good

friend congressman the goose of Colorado

well thank you representative Malinowski

and he has certainly tough back to

follow I also want to say thank you to

congressman sarbanes and to our speaker

for their leadership and as congressman

sarbanes mentioned they heard the

freshman class loud and clear and it is

thanks to their leadership of course

with chairwoman Lockhart as well but HR

1 really became the centerpiece of the

for the people agenda and that it was

one of the the centerpiece bills that

this caucus has passed in the house over

the course of last nine months I just

want to talk about one aspect of the

bill that is critically important to me

and that is what the bill does to

protect the right to vote the right to

vote really is foundational to our

democracy to our Republic and over the

better part of the last 10 15 years

you've seen state after state work to

curb the right to vote voter ID laws

many other efforts this law changes that

this law brings the power back to the

people by adopting some of the most

transformative forward-thinking reforms

for our election system in a generation

many of these reforms are

that we've adopted in Colorado mail

ballots automatic voter registration

because we know that the more people who

are eligible to participate the more

that they do the better our democracy is

for it there's you know one experience

every week when I come back to

Washington that I try I make sure to do

every fly-in day as we call them when I

come into the house and that's to greet

mr. Lewis to remind myself that me and

my colleagues in the freshman class have

this incredible honor to serve with

someone who fought to protect that

foundational right so that someone like

me could now serve in this incredible

chamber we owe it to mr. Lewis and to

the many folks who fought in the civil

rights struggle 50 years ago to honor

their service by passing HR 1 now I will

also tell you that someone who is new to

Washington like many of my freshmen

colleagues my understanding of the

legislative process it was fairly

straightforward you introduce a bill you

attract co-sponsors you have regular

order a markup and ultimately hearings

and finally a vote on the floor and that

has certainly been the case in the house

thanks to the incredible leadership of

our speaker the same cannot be said of

the United States Senate and I it's hard

for me as I struggle to understand why

the Senate Majority Leader refuses to

give HR 1 a hearing much less a vote I

will say this the speaker is right the

people understand the freshmen

colleagues that I've spoken to over the

course of the last recess as we were

back home holding more town halls than

any freshman class has ever held in the

history of the Congress I might add as

we were speaking with constituents I

think they understand that's certainly

my sense that the Senate has become a

legislative graveyard

and that the house is doing the people's

work and that it is long past time

Senate to do the same so I would implore

my senator senators from Colorado to

take this issue this bill up and to push

it through regular order so that the

American people have a chance to weigh

in and I know that here in the house

we're going to continue to keep building

the pressure so that as the speaker

often implores us to do to keep it too

hot to handle which i think is certainly

going to be the case and i know one of

the people who is certainly working

towards that end is my distinguished

colleague from the great state of New

Mexico who made history in her own right

it's becoming the first one of the first

two Native American women to serve in

the United States Congress and that's my

colleague Devin thank you thank you so

much Joe and I'm I'm honored to be here

and thank you mr. nigga's for raising

the issue about civil rights because as

a Native American woman from New Mexico

a 30 fifth-generation New Mexican Native

Americans didn't have the right to vote

in New Mexico until 1948 and when we

celebrated earlier the women's the

hundredth anniversary of the women's

right to vote we were reminded over and

over again that not all women had the

right to vote women of color did not

have the right to vote and so it's these

things that drive some of us to make

sure that every single person can vote

unencumbered before I was elected to

Congress I spent nearly two decades to

decades organizing to make sure all

Americans have access to our democracy

that includes people who live in

hard-to-reach areas and people who have

traditionally been excluded from

politics such as Native Americans and

other underrepresented groups a little

over 200 days ago House Democrats made

history with HR 1 our once in a

generation effort to clean up Washington

and return us to a government by and for

the people HR 1 does three simple things

first it expands and protects access to

the ballot box for all voters regardless

of zip

code race party or income this includes

making it easier for people to register

to vote through measures like my

same-day voter registration act which is

part of HR one second it ends the era of

big money in politics and third it uh

sure Zin a new culture of ethics and

accountability across all three branches

of government it's time to deliver on

our promise to the American people to

clean up corruption in Washington and no

one not even Senator McConnell can stand

in our way

and I'm very proud now to turn this over

to my colleague representative well

thank you my colleagues thank you as

well to the speaker to sheryl mcglochlin

and congressman sarbanes for their

incredible leadership on this issue and

helping facilitate bringing forward an

incredible idea that the freshman class

has been so passionate about you know

I'd like to say that the freshman in

Congress have proximity to the people

and also to the values of this nation

and we understand fundamentally that if

we're gonna make progress on climate

change on gun violence on delivering

affordable health care to every American

popular ideas if we're going to be able

to reflect the sentiments of the

American people then we need to first

shore up our democracy and that's why

this was priority number one for this

House of Representatives you know it's

not too often then you go back home

inside a bill number and get cheers from

your constituents but that's what HR 1

elicits and the constituents in my

district and because they understand

that this is foundational that we're

going to be able to move forward as a

nation we've got to make sure that we

make it easier not harder to vote that

we end the culture of corruption in

Washington DC and that we end the

influence that big money has in our

system that skews the playing field in

one direction in favor of the big

corporations and special interests that

have their finger prints over way too

many policy outcomes here in Washington

so protecting that right to vote is

absolutely foundational and that's why

it's a centerpiece of HR 1 included in

this bill are certain provisions like

automatic voter registration removing

barriers to access the ballot box

promoting and

Riddhi in our elections to make sure

that we don't see the type of abuses

we've seen in states from Ohio to

Georgia and other places around this

country we've seen communities targeted

in the United States with voter

suppression efforts and whether it's

students or communities of color those

efforts are wrong and you'll see some of

these architects come out and they'll

actually admit what they're doing

they'll say we're trying to rape these

elections in our favor this is an effort

designed to allow politicians to pick

their voters and not the other way

around and that's why we've moved

forward this legislation to help shore

up our democracy if we're going to be

successful

it's going to require all of us to be

participating in that effort and that's

why the freshman class is so eager to

continue to push this we've gone 200

days without any action in the Senate

and we'll keep standing up here as long

as it takes

delivering that message on behalf of the

American people to make sure that it

breaks through so that we can truly have

a government that's of four and by the

American people so with that I'll turn

it back over to congressman sarbanes who

will facilitate some Q&A

thanks Chris

so we'll definitely take any questions

if you have them just to wrap again I

think what people need to understand is

that the American public is starting to

perceive that the problem is not

Washington as a whole where Congress as

a whole it's the fact that Mitch

McConnell will not take good legislation

that we are bringing forward pretty much

every week in the House of

Representatives and bring it to the

floor of the United States Senate and

the public is perceiving that that's

where the bottleneck is so we're just

earning Mitch McConnell bring these

important things beginning with HR 1 to

the for the United States Senate so the

voice of the American people can be

heard there any questions for any of the

members up here yes

given the fact that this is such a broad

and expansive bill is there anything

that you guys would support if McConnell

was to take up one or two provisions is

that ever been a discussion at this

point and would that be something that

you guys would support well you're right

that the the bill is broad in its scope

and it includes me very many are a lot

of different pieces that are all

interlocking and they're all things that

the public has said they want to see

that's why we put them together and and

chairman Lofgren was really the

architect of making that happen

we have recognized that there's things

in HR 1 that can be pulled out and

sanded separately and we already began

that process and again so may want to

speak to this because it was her

committee that led the effort there but

the SAFE Act took out a lot of these

ballot box security measures so it's a

way to say to McConnell okay we

understand that maybe we can't get you

to move on the whole package even though

that's what the public wants to see but

at the very least can you take up these

security measures with respect to our

elections and put those on one the

Senate floor and he hasn't done that

either we did pass the SAFE Act it it

basically models what the science

community has said we should do to

secure just the the ballot boxes that's

important to act on urgently because the

elections next year and localities need

to have a little bit of lead time in

transition to paper ballots to secure

the equipment having said that the

entire HR 1 is important we want to keep

the influence of dark foreign influence

out of our elections dark money out of

our elections but you can accelerate the

actual securing of the systems

themselves that's urgently needed

can we talk to you some of you a little

bit some of this does pretend to be

election security issues I'm gonna

recess now Pietschmann inquiry has been

launched how do you frame this to your

member to your constituents as you go

back explaining the process getting some

more skeptical on board what do you all

do that I be especially curious to hear

from some of the freshmen who represent

battleground or swing districts whispers

well I think the basic overarching

message is that House Democrats are are

able to both bring the kind of

investigations that need to need to

happen and obviously that's been a topic

of this week but at the same time we're

pursuing that we'll be doing it

aggressively there's a whole legislative

agenda and if you look at all of the

bills that have been introduced and

passed on the house side for lowering

prescription drugs equal pay for equal

work raising the minimum wage addressing

gun safety in this country etc we we

have sent a very impressive set of

legislative proposals to the United

States Senate so we're able to do that

even as we're fulfilling our

constitutional responsibility to do

investigation and oversight and I'll

just say I think we're all gonna

continue doing what we've been doing you

know as was mentioned town halls have

been front and center for most of us as

we get connected and build relationships

with folks in our district and so I

think we do have a responsibility to

continue the work that we're doing on

our own committees whether it's on

infrastructure veterans issues a number

of other things but also to you know

have an honest conversation with our

voters back home about the severity of

what we've seen this past week and the

responsibilities that we have as a

congress to stand up and meet the

demands of the oath of office that we

all took so I don't think any of us

believe that we're a part of this

discussion around an impeachment inquiry

we're doing

political purposes and so we do have a

role to make sure we're going back and

connecting the voters of our district

with the solemn obligations that we have

the oversight responsibilities that we

have that will continue and I do

understand that should members be

required to be here for any part of that

proceeding they'll certainly be called

that I think I think the issues are

connected in in this way that voters

expect us to meet our constitutional

responsibilities Iran on improving

people's lives but I also ran on the

content of the oath that we all took and

so that they they expect me if if the

President of the United States violates

the law to hold him accountable but at

the same time our first and most

fundamental duty is to be legislators

and as we learn from investigations

about conduct by the President or by

others in our government that violates

core American values we also have a duty

to pass legislation to ensure that these

things never happen again one of our

vulnerabilities to foreign interference

is our campaign finance system we've

learned that in the last few years one

of our vulnerabilities is that we have

not invested enough in the physical

security of our electoral system and so

I think it's actually it's very good and

a very important message for us to

deliver that even as we consider the

very grave matter of whether and how to

hold the president accountable for the

actions that have been detailed in the

last few weeks we also have to do our

duty as legislators to make sure that no

president no executive branch whether

Republican or democratic can do these

things in the future HR 1 provides a

very important safeguard and your

background you know this into policy

how do you use that based on what you've

seen in this instance with the report

whistleblower and understanding that

does that help you explain this better

to constituents and what do you say

absolutely I mean I my constituents know

my experience and they often come to me

with questions that are based on my

experience and I can tell them and you

based on my experience that what what we

what we saw in the president's dealings

with Ukraine on this matter is

absolutely unprecedented in our

country's history and places our

national security at risk given the fact

that you do have such a strong

legislative agenda here that you're

trying to work out any time is of the

essence how quickly do you need to be

moving forward with the impeachment

inquiry what would be your expectation

for timeline well I don't think there's

any fixed timeline that it makes sense

to put forward at this point I think

what you which you are seeing already on

the part of the Democrats is that we're

gonna treat this in a very sober and

serious way and we're gonna take things

step by step deliberately do it in a

timely way be aggressive about it in

terms of fulfilling our responsibilities

but I don't think any arbitrary deadline

is warranted here with respect to the

investigative side of things but to

emphasize what we've all been saying

even as that process is rolling now we

can continue to be very aggressive in

terms of legislative agenda we already

have done that and we're gonna continue

to do that because the average person

out there yes they're I think gonna pay

more and more attention to the conduct

of the president certainly based on the

events of this week but they're also

trying to deal with what's coming at

them ever

single day and that's where you know

pocketbook issues the closet of

healthcare feeling secure in your own

community because you you know you don't

have to worry about violence and so

forth those are the issues that everyday

Americans are kind of assimilating every

single day and we have to speak to them

and we are speaking today and again this

is another area it's not just HR one

that Mitch McConnell has shut down on

the Senate side it's all of these other

issues as well and I think the average

person out there is picking up on that

and he's gonna have to explain that when

we get to the ballot box next year for

this party for sure

we want to add one thing said I think

it's worth underscoring one of the

benefits of being in leadership on

behalf of the freshman class is being

fairly well apprised as to this class is

your accomplishments and the truth is

the legislative agenda has been

incredibly robust there's a great story

to tell

unfortunately it is not good as well

publicizes I think it should be but I

mentioned town halls this 63 Democratic

freshman in this class have held more

town halls than any other freshman class

in the modern history of the Congress

congressman Pappas has held 14 town

halls in his district in New Hampshire

which I suspect is more town halls than

by several of his predecessors combined

representative Howland as I introduced

19 bills standalone bills that she is

the lead author of that's the second

most bills of any freshman in the United

States we have had seven freshmen have

laws signed by the president our student

legislation that's been signed into law

by President Trump over the course of

the last nine months about double that

number of folks who have had bills

passed the house that are now pending in

the United States Senate the vast

majority of those bills are bipartisan

bills so this class is a hard-working

class and I think the legislative agenda

to the extent that it's been as robust

as as I've described I think that's

going to continue over the course of the

coming months you know notwithstanding

the important constitutional

responsibilities that we have under

Article one a couple of months we'll be

into an election year Democrats will be

figuring out the election platform the

agenda for for the upcoming Congress you

all have to figure out what you're gonna

be running on this was obviously HR 1

and you're in all of your minds do you

see this as something that stays where

it is on the agenda as you seek

re-election in 2020 and you're looking

looking to tell people what what

Democrats might do in potentially a

united government or are there other

things that are present to the fore

since then other agenda issues

for sure this would be part of the

agenda I mean in 2018 these candidates

ran on the for the people agenda which

was to raise wages lower prescription

drug prices and healthcare costs and to

fight corruption and clean up government

and that message was incredibly resonant

with the public I mean it really hit

home as they can attest to and so we're

gonna we're gonna go out with the same

basic message again that we're focused

on the economic impact that people deal

with every single day particularly the

cost of health care and we've moved this

week as you know to address that in a

meaningful way and yes fighting

corruption and making sure people feel

like their voices heard here in

Washington so that's absolutely gonna

remain at the center of the agenda

that's true yeah I mean if you if if he

wants to pass HR 1 so we can say check

we've gotten that done and we can focus

on the issues obviously we'd love to see

that but we're not holding our breath

yeah thank you

the events of this week have passed very

quickly and I wonder if you feel like

you have any guidance from the

leadership about what your message

should be to constituents when you go

back home absolutely we have guidance

from our leadership both by sort of

conversations that are going on every

single day but also by the example

things set by our speaker and others

with

leadership and that is that as members

of Congress and House of Representatives

article one legislative for Hinch we

have a constitutional responsibility to

conduct investigation and oversight

where that's demanded and clearly it is

in this instance with respect to this

latest episode it's taken things to new

level in terms of that responsibility

and we're stepping into it

and that's been a very very very clear

message from leadership but at the same

time we know that people out there want

to know what will Democrats do

ultimately if they're the ones that are

given the authority across our

government we've shown what we'll do in

the House of Representatives by passing

a very robust and meaningful legislative

agenda it's stuck in the Senate because

Mitch McConnell is the grim reaper

apparently thrives on that image but I

don't think that's gonna stand him in

good stead in the long run because the

public wants to see action on things

that matter to them so we're gonna keep

moving forward and the leadership has

been very clear and saying we need to do

both to investigate but budgets the

congressman the goose want to address

that or I thought you did sorry well

yeah on whether there's a single message

on impeachment and and how much sort of

guidance in this very chaotic week

lawmakers have been able to get from

their leadership no no I think

congressman sarbanes articulated the

message quite well and I think that as

he said the speaker and of course our

caucus chairman and others have said the

great example in terms of the way in

which they've characterized the path

forward so it's it's a solemn moment for

our country it's a solemn moment

public and it's a solemn moment for the

house you have a job to do so we're

gonna proceed as the speaker this is out

what I do think her comments earlier

this week about Benjamin Franklin for

those who heard her at the Atlantic

Festival were were spot on this this

notion that back in the final days of

the Constitutional Convention when

Benjamin Franklin was asked by someone

who walked by that convention what kind

of government the delegates had had

created that her response

his response I should say I was a

republic if you can keep it it's our job

in the Congress as the article one

branch to keep it and with leaders like

congressman sarbanes and chairwoman

Lofgren groups done incredible jobs that

show them in the House Administration

Committee and of course our leadership

and this incredible freshman class whom

is was point pointed out as student Lee

so has a wealth of experience in terms

of their careers coming into the

Congress I think we'll be in good shape

so thank you thank you

you
