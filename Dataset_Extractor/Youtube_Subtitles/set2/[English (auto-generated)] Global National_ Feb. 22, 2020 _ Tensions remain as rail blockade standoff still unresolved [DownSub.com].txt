global national with Robin Gill

reporting tonight Coleen Christie good

evening thanks for joining us it's been

more than two weeks since protests broke

out across the country in support of

what certain hereditary Chiefs supposed

to a natural gas pipeline in northern BC

yesterday the Prime Minister called for

an end to the blockades but tonight

there doesn't appear to be an end in

sight now Sean O'Shay reports in our top

story some protesters are vowing to die

for the cause as the standoffs continues

supporters in Toronto made something

clear from right outside the Ontario

legislature hundreds rallied to defend

indigenous blockades in British Columbia

and Ontario and one Mohawk supporter

warned it's a fight they won't give up

there is no way we're backing down

absolutely no way we will be here til

the end even if we have to die doing it

we will die defending our rights I know

my father and their hereditary Chiefs

aren't budging hereditary Chiefs from

bc's wood so it's a nation met with

leaders from the Connor walky Mohawk

territory in Quebec I think it went fine

but it's not over yet the stories that

they told us we're very touching the red

eteri Chiefs want a halt to construction

on the coastal gas pipeline that crosses

their land that dispute has spawned

protests like this one at the tie and

Onaga Mohawk territory in Ontario which

has halted freight and passenger rail

service but another rail blockade south

of Montreal came down peacefully Friday

night as police moved in to enforce a

court injunction earlier in the day

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said all

the blockades must come down but there

is no sign that will happen counter

protesters agree it's time now it's time

to get back to work and we do

supporters who marched through downtown

Toronto streets say employment isn't the

most important thing jobs are secondary

this is people's way of living and if we

need to sacrifice the jobs of a few

which are in the hands of corporate

interests when we must do so to protect

the future it is up to the governments

to get it sorted out on terms that are

respectful of indigenous sovereign

nations provincial and federal

governments have asked the Wood soliton

for meetings not have been scheduled so

far leaving blockades like this one up

into another week Sean O'Shay Global

News Toronto as world health experts

recalculate the risk of kovat 19:00 and

the evolution of the outbreak another

quarantine is under way here in Canada

151 Canadians woke up in quarantine in

Cornwall Ontario 129 of them were

passengers on a diamond Princess cruise

ship the others were helping to get

those stranded passengers back to Canada

after hundreds of people on the ship

became infected they'll stay in

quarantine for two weeks meanwhile

Canadians quarantined for 14 days in

Trenton Ontario are enjoying their first

full day of freedom

195 Canadians remain under quarantine at

CFB Trenton but they're expected to be

released on Tuesday 48 other Canadians

who are on board the diamond princess

have tested positive for the virus

today Japanese officials confirmed

another passenger released this week

after completing the cruise ships

quarantine also tested positive the

woman in her sixties is the first known

case among those released at the end of

the ship's containment period a sixth

person has died from the virus in Iran

as cases there continue to rise the

country is reporting at least 10 new

cases today bringing its total to at

least 28 middle-eastern neighbors

including Iraq are now closing their

borders to Iranian Nationals another

major outbreak is in South Korea two

people are dead and cases are exploding

there 229 new cases have been confirmed

since Friday skyrocketing south korea's

total number to more than 430 cases a

dozen towns in northern

we're in lockdown today after two people

infected with the virus died and 39

cases were recorded 19 passengers on

board the diamond princess returned to

Italy this week and the country is

ramping up its response to the outbreak

so as you can see cases are multiplying

around the world in countries where

travel bans to and from China have been

in effect 28 countries are now reporting

cases the Center for global infectious

disease analysis in London which

collaborates with the World Health

Organization on modeling to contain the

disease estimates two-thirds of kovat 19

cases from China have remained

undetected worldwide right now there are

more than 77,000 confirmed cases 1,500

of those are in countries outside of

China more than 2000 people have died

mostly in China but there's concerned

sources of human-to-human transmission

are going unchecked which will lead to a

spike in cases there are some troubling

revelations tonight about a respected

Canadian religious figure an internal

report from large international says its

founder Jean Vanier sexually abused at

least six women according to the report

there is enough evidence to show Vanya

engaged in manipulative sexual

relationships over a 35-year period

Vanier who died last year founded the

charity in 1964 to help improve

conditions for people living with

developmental disabilities it now has

facilities in 38 countries in a

statement L'Arche France says there is

no evidence people with disabilities or

affected Democratic supporters in Nevada

are voting for a candidate to defeat and

drive US President Donald Trump from

office senator Bernie Sanders holds a

double-digit lead in the latest poll

after taking the New Hampshire primary

he now admits he's been told Russia is

trying to interfere in his campaign as

Jennifer Johnson reports Trump seems to

welcome the liberal as his political

opponent Nevada Democrats gathering to

caucus the third contest in the 2020

primary season Vermont senator Bernie

Sanders so confident of a win he spent

part of Friday campaigning in California

but

14 states that holds votes March third

Super Tuesday and if we win here in

California we're going to win the

Democratic nomination and if we win the

Democratic nomination Donald Trump is a

one-term president Sanders now confirms

he was briefed by intelligence officials

a month ago that Russia is attempting to

interfere in his campaign and president

Trump's here's an otter crack he may be

a friend of Donald Trump's he's not a

friend of mine campaigning in Nevada

President Trump seemed eager to take on

Sanders confident no swing voter will

endorse the senators higher taxes and

free health care policies this November

we're going to defeat the radical

socialist Democrats here at least 75,000

Nevada Democrats cast their ballots in

early voting a record turnout and unlike

New Hampshire in Iowa Nevada is a much

more diverse State Sanders is getting

strong support from the Latin American

community everything is going to be here

in these caucuses making a difference

that's what it's all about

we represent the real face of American

the other candidates are trying to stop

Sanders momentum most in the party agree

a more moderate nominee is needed

pundits are predicting a world where

pretty soon the only two left standing

are Mike Bloomberg and Bernie I'm really

worried about our ability to defeat

Donald Trump if those are our choices

Michael Bloomberg was not on the Nevada

ballot but after taking a beating in

last week's Las Vegas debate the former

New York Mayor has announced he'll

release three women who lodged

complaints against the billionaire

businessman from non-disclosure

agreements allowing them to tell their

stories if they want to Bloomberg is

hoping to get some traction on Super

Tuesday but Sanders could effectively

secure the Democratic presidential

nomination March 3rd if voters don't

back an alternative Coleen Jennifer

Johnson in Washington Jennifer thank you

the US and the Taliban began a partial

truth this morning setting the stage for

the two sides to sign a peace deal that

would end America's longest war if the

week-long pact holds the two sides have

agreed to meet on February 29th

to lay out a timetable for the u.s. to

withdraw its troops from Afghanistan the

milestone according to the United

Nations more than 100,000 civilians have

been killed or injured since it began

documenting casualties a decade ago

coming up four popular Canadian

retailers are being sued for allegedly

helping their customers steal streaming

content they deny it but could customers

be liable

five BC teams were honored by the

governor-general today Julie Payette

presented the group with challenge coins

in honor of their heroic actions last

February the team's rescued an 8 year

old boy who was dangling from a

chairlift at a Vancouver area ski hill

cell phone video captured them grabbing

some nearby fencing then coaxing the boy

to fall into the makeshift net really

good being like recognized by so many

people that you can look up to

yeah but throughout your community

whether they've been here for like years

or seven months they're all really good

people do recognize bye

I really appreciate that the boys are

also skiing for free this season

receiving complimentary passes for their

heroic actions a lawsuit filed in

Alberta provincial court is raising

questions about how popular media

streaming devices are being used and

whether consumers can be held

responsible if they're used to watch

illegal content the suit was filed by

Alec o entertainment the company that

owns super Channel it's suing four

popular Canadian retailers including

Best Buy London Drugs and staples

accusing them of selling piracy devices

and teaching customers how to use them

Heather York's West explains my wife and

I dated about a year ago we went to the

Android box I even got my cable down to

beta this is hidden-camera footage of

interactions between an undercover

investigator hired by alar Co

Entertainment the parent company of

super Channel and the personal Arco

alleges is a salesperson at London Drugs

one of four retailer's named in a

lawsuit before the Alberta provincial

court here's another investigator

alleged to be at Staples the Premium TV

network is using the videos as evidence

in a 50 million dollar lawsuit against

London Drugs staples Best Buy and Canada

computers in the statement of claim

super channels parent company accuses

the retailers of contributing to the

creation of a culture of widespread

infringement and theft accusing them of

selling internet streaming devices that

allow users to access streaming content

for free and having employees direct

their customers to purchase them

so that they can steal programming they

should pay

we were kind of shocked when we first

learned that they were educating

consumers on actually how the steel

global news reached out to the four

retailers for comment in statements

London Drugs disputes the allegations

and says in part it would never

intentionally infringe intellectual

property rights while Best Buy said the

suits claims were without merit

staples declined comment while Canada

computers did not respond to our

requests for comments

Ilario was suing the store's customers

as well listing them for now in the

claim as john doe's because the company

doesn't yet know who they are though it

hopes to find out could a consumer be

liable for copyright infringement using

a device in a way that it wasn't

intended to be used i suppose

theoretically yes this copyright lawyer

says Larco will have to prove that these

so-called piracy devices don't have

legitimate uses on their own court

filings don't specify what these devices

are but in an interview with Global News

super channel CEO Don McDonald says they

are Android devices preloaded with

software typically Kodi

software and basically Cooley software

is intended to to be used for stealing

contents off the internet in a statement

to global news the US nonprofit behind

Kodi says the software does not provide

any support for pirated video content

other people including some software

developers misuse it by adding to it

encouraging users to perform unlawful

activities we at Cody have never

authorized these and condemned such uses

in the past out of our very scant

resources we have worked in cooperation

with media companies on such matters to

check illegal activities and we will

continue to do so tech industry expert

Graham Williams says Cody has plenty of

legal applications as well they're not

piracy devices their computers and their

computers that run software and they

have perfectly legitimate uses coming

soon trailers twitch for video games

VEVO TV for music videos the problem is

those pirated streams exist online tubes

that could potentially contain content

licensed to broadcasters like super

channel who

was responsible for those losses is

something an Alberta provincial court

may have to decide as his lawsuit

proceeds in the months ahead

Heather Eric's West Global News Calgary

still ahead a field of schemes how the

ghosts of the games past are haunting

Major League Baseball

the first spring training games in Major

League Baseball are being played today

but for months the sport has been facing

backlash from its worst scandal in a

century mic delay looks at how the

houston astros went from being baseball

champions to pariahs baseball spring

training is a time for renewal there are

no winners or losers yet and what

happened in previous seasons is

forgotten except this year when it comes

to the Houston Astros a team embroiled

in baseball's worst cheating scandal of

the past century and now the sports

world is up in arms even basketball star

LeBron James is disgusted the Houston's

2017 World Series trophy hasn't been

taken away I don't think it holds any

value with you know you cheated and you

didn't earn it you know that's that's

how I feel is it wasn't earned I feel

like every single guy over there needs a

beating you know it's wrong genuine

anger underscoring these comments is is

something that I haven't really ever

seen before

in my experience following and covering

Major League Baseball the cheating

scheme was as high-tech as it was simple

the Astros arranged for the camera feed

that recorded the opposing teams

catchers signals to be relayed to their

dugout the batter was in turn tipped off

to what pitch was coming by someone

banging on a garbage can in baseball

knowing what's coming is a huge

advantage the Astros coach and general

manager were both fired the team was

fined but no players were disciplined

they were granted immunity in exchange

for their cooperation with the

investigation if somebody grants the

immunity then they can take that back

and just punish you after they told you

that you have immunity baseball

commissioner Rob Manfred has defended

the punishment I think if you look at

the faces of the houston players as

they've been out there publicly

addressing this issue they have been

hurt by this they will live with

questions about what went on in 2017 and

2018 for the rest of their lives

but now Manfred is coming under fire

from players and fans who are furious

the Astros cheated to win the World

Series and

say he hasn't done enough to deter teens

from doing it again Manfred isn't

helping himself referring to baseball's

championship trophy something he

personally awards to the winners like

something he found in the garage the

idea of you know an asterisk or asking

for a piece of metal back seems you know

sort of a futile Act people are always

know that there was something about the

2017 World Series

so baseball it's Commissioner and the

Astros a World Series contender again

this year must now deal with both the

cheating scandal and the botched

handling of the whole thing none of the

millionaire players will lose any salary

but they still have to play a hundred

and sixty two games and should expect

questions and heckling all summer long

it's gonna be bad everywhere they are

going to get it from all the twenty-nine

other fan bases and that includes here

in Toronto where the Blue Jays have

their own connections to the scandal one

of their coaches Dave Hudgens was the

Astros hitting coach while others

cheating was going on he's been

tight-lipped about his role in it other

than to say that he fully cooperated

with the investigation the Blue Jays say

they're sticking by him Colleen Mike

delay in Toronto Mike thanks up next

Quade n' is the nine-year-old indigenous

boy from australia whose deep distress

of him constant bullying at school

captured hearts around the world now

center stage at a major sporting match

Down Under he let out the indigenous

all-stars a team stacked with his rugby

league heroes for an exhibition match

against the New Zealand Maori Quentin

has dwarfism but a huge heart and was

all smiles as he ran on the field his

mother who posted the viral video says

he always dreamt of being a rugby league

star the story of a young woman's

struggle with multiple sclerosis is

taking center stage in London

Jacqueline de Prague was a

world-renowned musician when she was

diagnosed with the debilitating disease

it robbed her of her greatest love the

cello but as crystal commencing reports

more than three decades after her death

a ballet is giving new life to her work

[Music]

a mixture of elegance and ferocity

that's how Jacqueline du prais playing

of the cello was once categorized the

story of her multiple sclerosis

diagnosis at 26 shared through dance

will be familiar to many with the

disease

it began with numbness and unexplained

sensations so I started to dream up this

story which is about her it's to some

extent of biographical work but it's

very much focused on the love affair

that she had with music and I liked the

idea of personifying music and the cello

and by using a male dancer in that role

there's a neck of the cello there's a

body of the cello

Kathy Marston got the idea for the

cellist from her sister a music teacher

Duprey was a young English musical icon

I really wanted to take care that and I

was portraying the illness with as much

sensitivity and poetry as poses as I

possibly could

la explores the height that she flew to

and then it sort of the loss of her

voice MS often strikes people early in

life women are diagnosed more than men

there's no cure and for some it can take

a devastating toll there's no telling

what what the future holds

some people will lose mobility some

people won't that the path is very

different so it's a it's a really

interesting way to tell the story

through movement I think a very powerful

one

Duprey had relapsing remitting ms it

crept through her fingers and eventually

she was confined to a wheelchair she

died at 42 the Royal Opera House in

London has partnered with cinemas around

the world to broadcast the cellist so

far only two small Canadian theatres are

slated to run it one NBC the other in

Ontario

I think it is an emotional work and it's

it's heartbreaking but it's not tragic

we should be celebrating the life force

of Jackie as much as the loss of her

talent Marsten's mum also has MS she

hopes the ballet will raise awareness

while bringing people a little joy
