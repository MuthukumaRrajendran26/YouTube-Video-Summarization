my colleagues in Parliament study this

agreement that they will want to vote

for it on on Saturday and then in in

succeeding days this is our chance in

the UK as Democrats to get brexit done

and come out on October the 31st is our

chance to focus on our priorities the

people's priorities the NHS putting

20,000 police on the streets of lifting

up funding of education across the

country the biggest expansion of the the

living wage those are the things I think

the people of our country want us to be

focusing on in addition to brexit we've

we've been at this now as I say for

three and a half years it hasn't always

been an easy experience for the UK it's

been long it's been painful it's being

divisive

and now is the moment for us as a

country to come together now there's a

moment for our parliamentarians

to come together and get this thing done

and as I say to begin building a new and

progressive partnership with our EU

friends and with whom of course we share

so many priorities now I have to go to

dinner

they're late fairly soon but I'm told to

keep this very tight indeed but I'm

going to I'm going to go to - Laura

Kreuzberg of the BBC thank you very much

we can keep this very tight

two very quick questions why are you

confident this can get through

Parliament when it doesn't seem to be

the case at home and what earth will you

do if this falls on Saturday

well thanks Laura I think that there is

as I say a very good case for MPs across

the House of Commons to express the

Democratic one of the people as we

pledged many times to do and to get

brexit done and as I have never tired of

telling as I repeat again I don't think

there is any case for delay we should

get on and get it done by October the

31st Robert prime minister was there

literally no other way of getting the

deal other than to turn over your

partners in government the Democratic

Unionist Party I think this is a very

good deal for every part of the UK and

particularly for for Northern Ireland

and I would point out that as I say just

now from the beginning Northern Ireland

will be able to join with the rest of

the UK in doing free trade deals around

the world and and all the other benefits

that flow from membership of the the UK

market and of course without having a a

any checks any infrastructure of any

kind at the border in Northern Ireland I

think in that respect it is a a great

success I'm going to take two more

questions and I'm gonna go to

distinguished mr. Dibble be in the front

but how will this deal help heal the

deep divisions over brexit in the

country I think that's a very very

important question and I do think that

the answer is that it will

because what it will enable us to do is

to get as I say the process of

extraction behind us and enable us to

come together and focus on building a

new partnership with our friends across

the channel our friends it's not just

our friends in Brussels but obviously in

every other European capital one of the

things that we're doing is building and

strengthening our bilateral relations as

well and expanding our own networking

across the European capitals George

Parker and then that's it I'm afraid

take it take a few more promise we heard

what John called you had to say earlier

about the fact that he personally didn't

think there was should be an extension

to the brexit process beyond October

31st did you ask your fellow leaders to

make a similar commitment and have they

done so my views be very clear for a

long time they just say I don't think

that delays is to the advantage of the

of the UK or indeed of the whole of the

of Europe I think people want to to move

this thing on it's been going on for for

a long time and and that's a view that

seems to be to be quite widely shared

Tom then Pippa and then that really is

it okay Tom fitter and then Beth and

then that's it

Prime Minister you've suspended the whip

from 21 Tory MPs when they voted for the

been acts will you treat this vote on

Saturday as a similar conference motion

and will you suspend them it from you

Tory MPs who don't vote for this deal

I'm not going to get into whipping in

this in this lustrous well more I would

I will say is that I do think there is a

a very good case for voting for this

deal on all sides of the house and we

will certainly be taking that very very

seriously on the whipping would you

restore the width for the 21 MPs that

you have that you have ejected from the

party and what and why should Labour MPs

particularly trust you to deliver on

your promises and political declaration

over workers rights that's a big problem

thank you

Pippa our on the on the on the vote it's

a big an important vote in will be it

will be making further announcements

about that in due course and there are a

series that there's colleagues as you

understand they're a series of votes on

the political declaration and that text

I do think it is a good text it it gets

to the heart of what we want to achieve

us as a UK in our relations with the EU

in the in the future a best-in-class

free trade deal but also a fantastic new

deep and special partnership that we

want to to build yes it of course it

does also contain important provisions

and commitments that this country gladly

makes about our determination to

maintain the highest possible standards

both for the environment and for social

protection we make those commitments

gladly and they're entirely right for

our country to do a bet positively last

question Prime Minister Nigel daughter

said earlier today that you were too

eager by far to get a deal at any cost

and the cost has been there support

you have the deal but you don't have the

votes your predicament no better than

Teresa Mays are you making the same

mistakes that she did well I think

say thanks Beth I think that this is a

very good deal I'm very confident that

when MPs of all parties look at this

deal they will see the merit of

supporting it getting brexit done on

October the 31st and honoring the

mandate of the people honoring the

promises that were made repeatedly by

parliamentarians to the people to get

breaks it done and giving us all a

chance to move on I think the imperative

is is very very strong the opportunity

is great and so let's do it thank you

all very much thank you thank you
