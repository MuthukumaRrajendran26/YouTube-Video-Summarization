a former Canadian Forces reservists from

Winnipeg could face up to 60 years in

prison after being indicted by a u.s.

grand jury

Patrick Mathews was arrested as part of

a sweep against an American neo-nazi

group that was allegedly plotting to

incite violence at a gun rally in

Virginia as Eric Sorenson reports we're

learning more about what's behind the

chilling accusations in one sense these

are the moderates gun rights advocates

with their high-powered weapons rallying

peacefully in Virginia last month

despite the rhetoric little did people

here realize the violence that might

have happened

according to the FBI some members of the

base a white supremacist group spoke of

targeting people at this rally the FBI

says the base wants to start a race war

in the u.s. that would lead to a white

ethno state this is a group that is

proponents of terror attacks Ryan for

fan investigative reporter for the

Winnipeg Free Press and got to know a

Canadian connected to the base Patrick

Matthews last August shortly after

Thorpe published a story about him and

the base the RCMP raided Matthews home

and seized weapons

a week later Matthews was reported

missing soon he would be on the radar of

the FBI he walked into a pretty

elaborate FBI investigation and actually

interacted with an undercover agent

within two days of being reported

missing in Manitoba the FBI says

Matthews crossed the US border illegally

and made his way to Michigan there he

met two men who had driven up from

Maryland members of the base a group

already being closely watched by the FBI

the trio then drove back to Maryland and

Matthews was taken to Virginia two weeks

later one of the men Mark Laemmle drove

Matthews in a pickup truck down to

Georgia there were other members of the

base there oh and one other key figure

an FBI agent who had infiltrated the

Georgia group the FBI says Matthews

bought a mole and there was a training

camp like this one with guns in November

Matthews returned north to an apartment

in Delaware in December the FBI snuck in

installed a camera and seized images of

Matthews testing out a gas mask

other evidence the FBI says it heard

Matthews in Laemmle talk about inciting

violence at the upcoming gun rally in

Richmond Virginia in January On January

1st the FBI observed Matthews and

Laemmle exiting a store in Delaware

where they bought ammunition they would

buy 1,500 rounds a week later the FBI

says the two were imagining violence at

the Virginia rally quoting Matthews

there is just angry gun owners just

streaming in from all over the country

and Laemmle later saying they're like

shooting their way out of the city

essentially finally On January the 16th

the FBI moved in and arrested Laemmle

and Matthews four days before the gun

rally in Richmond

the rally went off without incident days

later Matthews now with long hair and

others were indicted on multiple weapons

offenses they took steps to act and act

violently on their racist views in order

to spark what he called a violent

revolution for the white race Matthews

lawyer called his statements free speech

mr. Matthews statements should be

considered in the context of him

exercising his First Amendment rights

the arrests broke up one plot but Ryan

Thorp says the base as a disparate group

of cells remains dangerous

there's indication they had every

intention of carrying out violence on

people and I don't think we should be

cavalier about the level of violence

they could have perpetrated had law

enforcement not acted and remember the

trio down in Georgia with an FBI agent

on the inside they were arrested - and

there was one more twist the FBI says

one of them got worried about Matthews

believing he was a threat to their

broader operation and spoke of killing

him in the end the FBI not only may have

prevented violence at the gun rally they

may have saved Patrick Matthews life
