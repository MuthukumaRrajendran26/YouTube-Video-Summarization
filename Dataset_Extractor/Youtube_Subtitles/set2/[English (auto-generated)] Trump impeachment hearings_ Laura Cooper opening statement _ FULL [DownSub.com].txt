I appear today to provide facts and

answer questions based on my experience

as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of

Defense for Russia Ukraine and Eurasia I

would first like to describe my

background as well as my role and

vantage point relevant to your inquiry I

bring to my daily work into this

proceeding my sense of duty to u.s.

national security not to any political

party I proudly served to democratic and

to Republican presidents I entered

government service through the

presidential management internship

competition joining the State Department

in 1999 to work on counterterrorism in

Europe and the former Soviet Union

inspired by working with the US military

on a Department of Defense rotational

assignment I decided to accept a civil

service position in the policy

organization of the office of the

Secretary of Defense in January 2001

where I have remained for the past 18

years

my strong sense of pride in serving my

country and dedication to my Pentagon

colleagues were cemented in the moments

after I felt the Pentagon shake beneath

me on September 11th 2001 my office was

scheduled to move into the section of

the Pentagon that was destroyed in the

attack but a construction delay meant

that we were still at our old desks in

the adjacent section on that devastating

day after we had wiped the black dust

from our desks and tried to get back to

work

I found meaning by volunteering to work

on Afghanistan policy and would give my

next four years to this mission I later

had the opportunity to move into the

leadership ranks of my organization and

have had the privilege to manage issues

ranging from defense strategic planning

to homeland defense and mission

assurance I accepted the position of

principle director for Russia Ukraine

and Eurasia in 2016 and was honored to

be appointed formally to the position of

Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense in

2018 in my current role I work to

advance u.s. national security with a

focus on deterring Russian aggression

and building strong part

ships with the frontline states of

Ukraine and Georgia as well as ten other

allies and partners from the Balkans to

the Caucasus strengthening Ukraine's

capacity to defend itself against

Russian aggression is central to my

team's mission the United States and our

allies provide Ukraine with us with

security assistance because it is in our

national security interest to deter

Russian aggression around the world we

also provide security assistance so that

Ukraine can negotiate a peace with

Russia from a position of strength the

human toll continues to climb in this

ongoing war with 14,000 Ukrainian lives

lost since Russia's 2014 invasion these

sacrifices are continually in my mind as

I lead DoD efforts to provide vital

training and equipment including

defensive lethal assistance to the

Ukrainian armed forces I have also

supported a robust Ukrainian Ministry of

Defense program of defence reform to

ensure the long-term sustainability of

us investments and the transformation of

the Ukrainian military from a Soviet

model to a NATO interoperable force the

National Defense Authorization Act

requires the Department of Defense to

certify defense reform progress to

release half of the Ukraine security

assistance initiative or USA I funds a

provision we find very helpful based on

recommendations from me and other key

DoD advisors the Department of Defense

in coordination with the Department of

State certified in may 20 19 that

Ukraine had quote taken substantial

actions to make defence institutional

reforms for the purposes of decreasing

corruption increasing accountability and

sustaining improvements of combat

capability unquote meriting obligation

of the entire 250 million in u.s. AI

funds this brings me to the topic of

today's proceedings

I would like to recap my recollection of

the timeline in which these events

played out I testified about all of this

at length in

my deposition in July I became aware of

a hold being placed on obligation of the

State Department's foreign military

financing or FMF and DoD's USA I funds

in a series of interagency meetings I

heard that the President had directed

the Office of Management and Budget to

hold the funds because of his concerns

about corruption in Ukraine let me say

at the outset that I have never

discussed this or any other matter with

the President and never heard directly

from him about this matter at a senior

level meeting I attended on July 26

chaired by national security council

leadership as at all other interagency

meetings on this topic of which I was

aware the national security community

expressed unanimous support for resuming

the funding as in the u.s. national

security interest at the July 26th

meeting there was also a discussion of

how Ukrainian anti-corruption efforts

were making progress

DoD reiterated what we had said in our

earlier certification to Congress

stating that sufficient progress in

defense reform including anti-corruption

had occurred to justify the u.s. AI

spending I and others at the interagency

meetings felt that the matter was

particularly urgent because it takes

time to obligate that amount of money

and my understanding was that the money

was legally required to be obligated by

September 30th the end of the fiscal

year in the ensuing weeks until the hold

was released on September 11th I pursued

three tracks first starting on July 31st

and an interagency meeting I made clear

to the interagency leadership my

understanding that once DoD reaches the

point at which it does not have

sufficient time to obligate all the

funding by the end of the fiscal year

the United States and our allies provide

Ukraine with us with security assistance

because it is in our national security

interest to deter Russian aggression

around the world we also provide

security assistance so that Ukraine can

negotiate a peace

with Russia from a position of strength

the human toll continues to climb in

this ongoing war with 14,000 Ukrainian

lives lost since Russia's 2014 invasion

these sacrifices are continually in my

mind as I lead DoD efforts to provide

vital training and equipment including

defensive lethal assistance to the

Ukrainian Armed Forces

I have also supported a robust Ukrainian

Ministry of Defense program of defence

reform to ensure the long-term

sustainability of us investments and the

transformation of the Ukrainian military

from a Soviet model to a NATO

brings me to the topic of today's

proceedings

I would like to recap my recollection of

the timeline in which these events

played out I testified about all of this

at length in my deposition in July I

became aware of a hold being placed on

obligation of the State Department's

foreign military financing or FMF and

DoD's USA I funds in a series of

interagency meetings I heard that the

President had directed the Office of

because of his concerns about corruption

in Ukraine let me say at the outset that

I have never discussed this or any other

meeting I attended on July 26 chaired by

National Security Council leadership as

at all other interagency meetings on

and an interagency meeting I made clear

to the interagency leadership my

understanding that once DoD reaches the

point at which it does not have

sufficient time to obligate all the

funding by the end of the fiscal year

there were only two ways to discontinue

obligation of us AI a president directed

rescission or a DoD directed

reprogramming action either of which

would need to be notified to Congress I

never heard that either was being

pursued second I was in communication

with the DoD security assistance

implementing community to try to

understand exactly when they would reach

the point at which they would be unable

to obligate all the funds by the end of

the fiscal year I received a series of

updates and in a September 5th update I

and other senior Defense Department

leaders were informed that over a

hundred million could not be obligated

by September 30th and third I was

advocating for a meeting of the cabinet

level principals with the president to

explain why the

assistance should go forward although I

heard of attempts to discuss the issue

with the president I never received

details about any conversations other

than a status update that the hold had

not been lifted after the decision to

release the funds on September 11th of

this year my colleagues across the DoD

security assistance Enterprise worked

tirelessly to be able to ultimately

obligate about 86% of the funding by the

end of the fiscal year more than they

had originally estimated they would be

able to due to a provision in

September's continuing resolution

appropriating an amount equal to the

unobligated funds from fiscal year 2019

we ultimately will be able to obligate

all of the u.s. AI funds given how

critical these funds are for bolstering

Ukraine's security and deterring Russia

I appreciate this congressional action

that concludes my opening statement but

before answering your questions there is

one other matter I would like to address

I testified in a deposition before this

committee and other committees on

October 23rd 2019 at that time I was

asked questions about what I knew about

when the Ukrainian government may have

learned about any hold on security

assistance funds I answered those

questions based on my knowledge at that

time since my deposition I have again

reviewed my calendar and the only

meeting where I recall a Ukrainian

official raising the issue with me is on

September 5th at the Ukrainian

Independence Day celebration I have

however since learned some additional

information about this subject from my

staff prior to my deposition testimony I

avoided discussing my testimony with

members of my staff or anyone other than

my attorney to ensure that my deposition

testimony was based only on my personal

knowledge my deposition testimony was

publicly released on November 11th 2019

members of my staff read the testimony

and have come to me since then and

provided additional information

specifically on the issue of Ukraine's

knowledge of the hold or of Ukraine

asking questions about possible issues

with the flow of assistance my staff

showed me two unclassified emails that

they received from the State Department

one was received on July 25th at 2:31

p.m. that email said that the Ukrainian

embassy and House Foreign Affairs

Committee are asking about security

assistance the second email was received

on July 25th at 4:25 p.m. that email

said that the hill knows about the FMF

situation to an extent and so does the

Ukrainian embassy I did not receive

either of these emails my staff does not

recall informing me about them and I do

not recall being made aware of their

content at the time I do not have any

additional information about precisely

what the Ukrainians may have said what

may have been their source of

information about a hold or any possible

issues with the flow of assistance or

what the State Department officials may

have told them my staff also advised me

in the last few days of the following

additional fact that may be relevant to

this inquiry again my staff does not

recall informing me about them and I do

not recall being made aware of this on

July 3rd at 4:23 p.m. they received an

email from the State Department stating

that they had heard that the CN is

currently being blocked by OMB this

apparently refers to the congressional

notifications state would send for

Ukraine FMF I have no further

information on this on July 25th a

member of my staff got a question from a

Ukraine embassy contact asking what was

going on with Ukraine security

assistance because at that time we did

not know what the guidance was on USA I

the OMB notice of apportionment arrived

that day but this staff member did not

find out about it until later I was

informed that the staff member told the

Ukrainian official that we were moving

forward on USA I but recommended that

the Ukraine embassy check in with state

regarding the FMF sometime during the

week of August 6 to

10a Ukraine embassy officer told a

member of my staff that a Ukrainian

official might raise concerns about

security assistance in an upcoming

meeting my understanding is that the

issue was not in fact raised again I

have no further information about what

concerns about the security assistance

Ukraine may have had at that time my

staff also recall thinking that

Ukrainians were aware of the hold on

security assistance during August but

they cannot pinpoint any specific

conversations where it came up my staff

told me they are aware of additional

meetings where they saw officials from

the Ukrainian Embassy in August and they

believed that the question of the hold

came up at some point but they told me

they did not find any corresponding

email or other records of those meetings

consequently neither they nor I know

precisely when or what additional

discussions may have occurred with the

Ukrainians in the month of August if I

had more details on these matters

I would offer them to the committee but

this is the extent of additional

information I have received since my

deposition mr. Chairman I welcome your

questions I will answer them to the best

of my ability thank you
