well thank you very much everyone it's

great to be with my friend Boris Johnson

and just got a position that he's having

a very easy time with it's much easier

than you thought I just said is it

tougher Ari sir he said well I guess

what do you expect it I think it's

pretty much what you expected it is and

he's doing a fantastic job not easy and

securing a really good job and I think

he's gonna make great progress come

October come November but great progress

for the country okay

results are good and there's also gonna

start the show in November but it looks

to me like he is making great progress

so it's an honor to have you here will

be discussing trade that we can

quadruple our trade with UK and we can I

think we're doing big job Bob lighthouse

is here our trade representative your

Craig representative is here and they're

already scheduling for their a the

continuing against nations so we can

have substantially more trade with UK

and we look forward to doing that so

we'll talk about other things also to

make a heavy voice don't thank you very

much it's great to be here and I

certainly hope that we can make a lot of

progress quite fast I'm pretty but our

Secretary of State for international

trade is here we we have to to get going

on that boys remembering that the NHS is

not but everything else because there's

a huge amount we can we can do and I

guess we'll also talk a bit about the

wrong I think you share a common

perspective down but also make sure that

people in the Gulf don't get the wrong

idea about what they can get away that's

a complicated issue we have to make

progress though we'll be talking about

many things look forward to it and we'll

start in just a minute

so thank you very much everybody

you should resign because you misled the

queen with regard to shutting Parliament

down how do you respond to that well I

said earlier on thank you very much as I

said earlier on let's be absolutely

clear we respect the judiciary in our

country we respect the court

I disagree profoundly with what they had

to say I think it was entirely right to

go ahead with a plan for a Queen's

speech this is a the longest period we

haven't had a Queen's Beach / for 400

years we've got a dynamic domestic

agenda we need to be getting on with

more police on the streets investment in

our National Health Service improving

our education we need to get on with

that and frankly I think we need to get

on with brexit that's the overwhelming

view of the British people whether they

voted to leave or or remain they want to

get this thing done

by October the 31st and that's what

we're gonna do mr. Pratt was a very

nasty question from a very American

reporter one but I think he was ask me a

question to be fair that a lot of

British reporters would no I think he's

dealing very well I see what look I

watch it very closely as a friend of

mine I tend to watch friends closer than

enemies with the enemies you have to

watch in a different way I think he's

doing very well it's a complicated

subject but they took a vote and the

vote was I was there I happen to be

there today there you go but I made a

prediction even I even made a prediction

it was a correct prediction and you know

that was a long time ago and it takes a

man like this to get it done they have

to get it done otherwise it'd be a

terrible thing to do it any other way I

don't see another boat I don't see

anything happening I think he's gonna

get it done when you earned these UK's

Supreme Court decision I had no reaction

I just asked Boris and you know to him

it's another day in the office he's a

professional

it's just another day in the office yeah

well it's tomorrow's another day in

Parliament you know we have we had to of

course the first couple of months we had

been I think we were over seven with the

Supreme Court and since then we won the

wall we won assylum we want some of the

biggest ones we've had a great streak

going but we started off we were over

seven and then as you will report in

fact the first time we won you were like

shocked that we won and since then we've

almost run the table we've won a lot of

decisions so I'm sure that's gonna

happen to you well kind of our chickens

and we're full of respect if I say for

the justice is about court but we're

gonna we're gonna push on we're gonna

respect what the court had to say but

we're gonna get on and deliver Bracy

that's that I think that's what the

British people in other words she's been

very nice to the courtroom okay here's

total respect for the yeah just a

separate subject can you explain why aid

to Ukraine was stopped because I think

that other countries should be paying

also why does the United States the only

one paying to Ukraine and I've been

talking about this for a long time not

only with respect to Ukraine but a lot

of other countries but frankly why isn't

Germany I just met with the Chancellor

why is in Germany why is in France why

are these other countries paying family

why are we paying all the time and

nobody's given I believe more to Ukraine

you know President Obama used to send

pillows and sheets

I said anti-tank weapons and a lot of

things to Ukraine we think that it's

very important and both by the way I

don't know if you know it or not that

payment was made but I wanted to get

other countries other countries should

also pay but frankly it affects them

more I mean it's a barrier that's a wall

between Russia and the UK and they don't

pay and why are they not paying why is

it always the United States that that's

paying and I made that loud and clear I

told that to Mick Mulvaney I told it to

a lot of people is making wherever it is

I told it to a lot of different people I

told it to Mike I told it to two Mike's

I told it to Steve I keep asking the

same my senator Wilbur Ross I keep

asking the same question why is it that

the United States is always paying these

foreign countries and other foreign

countries that frankly are much too

much more effective than not I said hold

it up

let's get other people to pay and then

everybody called me oh please can we pay

and I said and there was never any quid

pro quo the letter was beautiful it was

a perfect letter it was unlike Biden's

who by the way what he said was a Hara

and asked how his son made millions of

dollars from Ukraine made millions of

dollars from China even though he had no

expertise whatsoever

okay so what he did was a real problem

with us there was no pressure applied no

nothing okay folks thank you very much
