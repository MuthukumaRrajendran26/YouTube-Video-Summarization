[Music]

good evening and thanks for joining us

families across this country are

devastated tonight their loved ones

caught in a tumultuous and tragic series

of events in Iran this is all that

remains of Ukraine International

Airlines flight PS 752 all 176 people at

least 30 of them children were killed

when the Boeing 737 fell from the sky

minutes after takeoff from Tehran

Airport it was not one of the grounded

737 max planes most of those on board

were from Iran and from Canada it went

down just hours after Iran fired

ballistic missiles onto us occupied

bases in Iraq a revenge attack against

the US for killing a top Iranian general

this video was shared by a state-run

media organization in Iran it says it

shows the pre-dawn crash the aircraft

appears to be in flames descending in

the distance before a bright burst fills

the sky almost immediately arounds

Transport Ministry blamed engine failure

Ukraine's Embassy in Iran put out a

statement ruling out terrorism or a

rocket attack but that was later

replaced by a statement saying it's too

early to draw any conclusions

Iran is refusing to hand over the flight

recorders to Boeing or to American

officials among the 63 Canadians killed

many were from Edmonton

they were mother's father's children

there were students and academics all

had so much potential so much life ahead

of them this is a heartbreaking tragedy

we will have much more on all the lives

lost a little bit later Global Affairs

Canada is now warning Canadian citizens

against all non-essential travel to Iran

President Trump today addressed the

nation he didn't talk about the plane

crash but he did appear to back away

from retaliating against Iran Iran

appears to be standing down which is a

good thing for all parties concerned we

have coverage of all of this tonight

beginning with Redman Shannon on the

catastrophic final moments of that

flight this is the immediate aftermath

of the crash involving Ukraine

international air

mine's flight PS 752 and as dawn broke

the scene of devastation became clear

smoldering wreckage of the Boeing

737-800 plane parts and personal

belongings strewn across a large area

signs of the lives lost it was clear to

rescue workers no one stood a chance all

they could do was gather the remains of

those who were alive just minutes

earlier this esata sheesh wood when I

arrived the plane and passenger bodies

had been shattered into many pieces said

this man the only thing that the pilot

managed to do was steer the plane toward

a soccer field instead of a residential

area the aircraft was scheduled to fly

from Tehran's imam khomeini airport to

kiev ukraine it took off just after 6:00

a.m. local time and climbed steadily to

a thousand feet before something

catastrophic happened there was no

Mayday call the plane veered off course

and hit the ground about 17 kilometers

from the airport

176 passengers and crew members died 63

of whom were Canadian Iran says in total

147 were Iranian implying that a large

number of the 63 Canadians were dual

citizens 138 passengers were booked on

the later connecting flight from Kiev to

Toronto Ukrainian officials say two

people who bought tickets didn't turn up

for the flight the airline says the

Boeing was just over three years old and

underwent maintenance two days ago the

company's president says it was one of

their best aircraft with an excellent

crew Ukraine's Embassy in Tehran

initially blamed engine failure but as

since retracted the statements

just hours earlier Iran had fired

missiles at Iraqi air bases housing US

troops fueling speculation the plane was

shot down the answers could be held in

the planes black boxes now in the hands

of Iranian authorities Iran says it

won't hand them over to the US or to

plane maker Boeing doors for wiping

approach in Ukraine's Prime Minister

says all Ukrainian airlines have been

suspended from using Iranian airspace

and a number of major airlines including

Air Canada are rerouting around the

country Redman Shannon Global News

London

getting at the truth of what brought

down that plane may not be

straightforward it happened in a country

that's the sworn enemy of the u.s. a

country that has no diplomatic relations

with Canada and where the media is

state-controlled lies have been told

before about plane crashes including by

the United States our Eric Sorenson

explains more about that tonight

Erik Donna the crash could simply be

mechanical failure or human error most

airline disasters are but history

politics and current events all injects

skepticism around the major players Iran

where the crash happened

the stunning coincidence just after

Iranian missiles were fired at a US base

in Iraq Iran has many enemies in the

region and it is far from transparent in

its affairs Ukraine has no conflict with

Iran but it does with Iran's ally Russia

which was involved in the Malaysian

jetliner shoot down six years ago the

United States is also at the center of

tensions in the region the

back-and-forth attacks with Iran and its

own history includes shooting down an

Iranian airliner 30 years ago and then

there is Boeing after the crash of its

second max 8 in Ethiopia last year

questions about its pilot training this

is a disaster with lots of questions and

answers that may not be trusted the

debris field suggests impact at high

speed it looks like it must have hit and

skipped along the ground as it was

self-destructing Jacque Williams is an

aviation expert he says early accounts

can be unreliable one report from

Ukraine blamed engine failure it then

removed that statement and the report

that too ticketed passengers didn't

board raises the potential for a

terrorist attack

says both the Iranian Aviation and the

Ukrainian airline are trustworthy I have

no doubts about the airline itself

aviation in general believe me Iran has

a good record but as facts are gathered

will they be believed with black boxes

in hand Iran has made clear us safety

experts among the best in the world will

not be allowed in to investigate

us-iranian relations are on a knife's

edge after an Iranian general was killed

in an American attack days ago

Canada has aviation expertise but has no

official diplomatic relations with Iran

and Ukraine well remembers this the

Malaysian airliner that was shot down in

its conflict with Russia Ukraine wants

permission to send its own investigators

to the crash scene we know that there's

tension in that part of the world

particularly in the last few days so

we'll have to find out but we got to

really avoid jumping to conclusions

about what happened Boeing's 737s are

among the best planes in the world but

as an American company with recent

crashes it will be under intense

scrutiny to the Iranian crash is a

tragedy for all involved but the

disaster comes at a time and in a place

of grave mistrust
