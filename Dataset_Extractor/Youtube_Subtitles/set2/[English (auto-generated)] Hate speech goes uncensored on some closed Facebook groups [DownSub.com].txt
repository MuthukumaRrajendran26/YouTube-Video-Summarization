Pembroke for the past couple of use

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been

making the push for privacy today we are

going to talk about building a privacy

focused social platform encouraging

people to use private Facebook groups

that require users to request permission

before they can join and view the page

users can also create secret groups that

don't appear in any search results

privacy gives us the freedom to be

ourselves but it appears those private

pages also provide the freedom to spread

hatred it has become the tool of hate

mongers of people who want to promote

violence using a fake account Global

News asked to join one private Facebook

group called Justin Trudeau must be

stopped

the group has nearly 20,000 members but

before we could join we had to answer a

series of questions including this one

do you see the massive number of Muslims

flooding into Canada as a threat to our

way of life in the future

once granted access we found dozens of

posts and comments using vulgar language

to describe Muslims and homosexuals

along with suggestions that they and

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should be

killed and some of the things that we

see especially in facebook on private

chat rooms really will would would curl

your innards Global News reached out to

all 10 of the pages moderators one

responded not interested you journals

are a moral scavengers with a narrative

to push many of these sort of moving

into those hidden spaces where they

can't be monitored as easily we're

seeing a rise in attacks on minority

communities the head of the National

Council of Canadian Muslims points to

terrorist attacks on religious sites in

Quebec City and New Zealand as examples

of online hatred inspiring violence

there needs to be a whole of society

approach and a whole government approach

to making sure that hate

is you know held at bay

now Facebook employs around 15,000

content moderators and uses software to

detect inappropriate behavior but those

tools still failed to spot that Facebook

page called Justin Trudeau must be

stopped as a result of our investigation

and inquiries Donna late today that

Facebook page was removed the company

says it violated its policies for

inciting violence
