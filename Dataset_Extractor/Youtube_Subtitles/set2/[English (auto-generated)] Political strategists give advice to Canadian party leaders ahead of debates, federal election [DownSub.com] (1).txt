hello I'm resetti Stevenson and this is

the West block politics perspectives and

players to campaign planes dual

citizenship plus discussions about

racism homophobia and abortion lots to

break down as we head into the federal

election on October 21st joining me now

to discuss it all is our strategy panel

Fred de Laurie for the Conservatives and

McGrath for the NDP and Richard Mahoney

for the Liberals Richard these two

stories at the end of the day people

look at them and they go you know it's a

bit silly to campaign planes dual

citizenship we're trying to choose who's

gonna run the country and this is what

we're supposed to pick from they're both

driven as we said by campaign War Rooms

why do more rooms do this why do they

think this kind of politics is effective

wars do this because they're trying to

throw the other guys off their game they

are trying to disrupt whatever the

message that the Conservatives are

trying to get on on a broader set of

issues to the electorate the Liberals

will try and say you know let's see if

we can't mess up their day they're

trying to tell a story about who these

people are and maybe in these kind of

sometimes irrelevant things to planes

whatever duels those are small that

you're telling a wider story of that so

for example the Liberals on the dual

citizenship I don't think any Canadians

think that it's wrong to have dual

citizenship but Mr Shearer himself

criticized other leaders mr. Mulcair mr.

deal the former Governor General for

having that and so it's it's it they're

trying to tell the story not that he's

it's a bad thing that he's a dual

citizen but rather is he something that

he doesn't other than what he pretends

to be is he is he not as advertised as

that as the thing goes is that the story

so but it sometimes as you say falls

flat because I think Oh what are the big

issues that doesn't matter to me whether

the guy's got two planes or one plane or

a half a plane it's a bit of the same

thing with the Conservatives in the

planes okay there's a second plane that

seems hypocritical when you have party

that saying we're all about the

environment and they are doubling their

carbon emissions as they go across the

country but while they also bought the

carbon offsets obviously campaigns think

this is effective and yet we haven't

seen anything moving in the polls why

not focus on your opponent's weaknesses

when it comes to policy instead of this

kind of mudslinging well we certainly do

we put a lot

effort into the policies that were

pushing out mr. shears announcements

every day is making a ruffy's making an

announcement but the other day it's on

all of us

to to focus on that but we get caught up

into this well the war rooms are driving

it by releasing of course they're

pushing it the same time like you know

mr. mr. Trudeau is talking about the

environment he's a supposed champion of

the environment he attended a protest on

it but his record shows it you know he

doesn't have a plan on the environment

does no way to reach his targets and now

he's actually flying around with two

planes it exposes the hypocrisy so it's

important at the same time why we're

pushing our message it's also showed the

contrast and what the other side is

actually doing and what they're actually

trying to do so and it is mudslinging

but it does expose hypocrisy on both

sides you look at this story as an NDP

er which one the plane or the dual

citizenship do you think is more

damaging I think they're both damaging

and I think that to get to the issue of

like the mudslinging and how the war

rooms are operating and that kind of

thing I think that in an era of

increasingly leader centered campaigns

people care about the character of the

leader and so this speaks to character

it whether it's hypocrisy or even this

idea of a double standard right that you

know even in both of these stories I

would venture that many Canadians do

don't even know what a carbon offset is

it's inside lingo it's you know it's

kind of meaningless I would bet many

Canadians would never even think of

having dual citizenship it's not these

are not that you know they're you're

kind of appealing to a group of voters

who don't have your experience in life

and who see you as increasingly elite

and out of touch and I think as an NDP R

that's what I look at when I see this I

see the elitism being out of touch not

being focused on the issues that matter

to Canadians so I would prefer and I

hear from voters as well whether it's in

focus groups or at the doorsteps or

whatever and for me I would have

preferred if the big story this week had

been about how we step up and meet our

obligations to First Nations children

instead of having you know the Trudeau

government basically deciding that

they're going to challenge a court

ruling that found them in violation of

the the rights of indigenous children

and when it comes to the dual

citizenship do you think that people

really question somebody's loyalty if

they hold dual citizenship is this a

real issue for somebody who wants to run

the country I

don't think it's a big issue for a lot

of people I think that the issue of

hypocrisy and double standards is really

more what this is all about I think that

most Canadians wouldn't have a problem

with this however and and one of the

things that I've thought when I've

looked at this also is how much did his

staff know about this so with a piece of

the you know the Conservatives went

after mr. Mulcair for having dual

citizenship French and Canadian and it

was quite a quite a big deal but we all

knew that he had French citizenship we

had talked about how to deal with it and

it was you know we were prepared it

looked to me like they were the people

around Mr Shearer may have been taken

off-guard by this and that thoughts back

to for instance the blackface brownface

thing where I wondered why in the

vetting process and in the preparation

process it looked like his staff also

were taken off-guard by this Fred the

question for me when he said he made the

steps to renounce his citizenship in

August was why didn't he do this when he

first became the leader of the

Conservative Party when the

Conservatives had the history of

attacking other people for the same

thing right look he did make the

decision to renounce it I think the the

leader any leader that's running to be

Prime Minister should have citizenship

in just one country not being Canada I

think it's important symbolic thing for

us to have so he did take the steps to

renounce it before the campaign began

and he won't he's no longer a US citizen

once the paperwork is approved and he's

been very forthcoming with that once he

started the you know going down that

road to do this and Richard speaking of

the Apocrypha when we talk about the two

planes why would the Liberals not have

just revealed this at the beginning you

have to think when you're flying to

campaigns you know the other war room is

watching planes potentially this could

come out and if you're out there saying

publicly we're all about the environment

and reducing carbon emissions and a

carbon tax but we're flying two planes

that could be a problem for you

well I think from their perspective they

did this last time this wasn't live that

they didn't sort of think it was a

secret number one number two the attack

on the two planes is the sort of same

thing that a lot of right-wing Trump's

have been doing for years they used to

go out al gore because he had a big

house all that sort of stuff the thing

that I think is strange to me is I mean

you can mr. Trudeau is running a pretty

good campaign there are great visuals

there's a reason for that because

they've done all these things they've

done all this homework the the thing

that's important to me

is the concerns aren't even trying to

make climate changes issue in the

campaign Mr Shearer didn't show up in

any of the climate protests he basically

has a plan that says they do nothing and

even his attack on this thing shows they

don't want they want Canadians to think

this is someone who won't even doesn't

give a crap about about about climate

change one of the other big issues in

the campaign has been abortion that

people have talked about for the first

time this week Brad

we heard Andrew Scheer come out and say

he personally does not agree with

abortion but he doesn't change the law

why didn't he just come out and say this

earlier because a lot of people were

willing to say perhaps you can have a

different opinion personally than you do

policy wise publicly but it took him

until this point in the campaign and

it's been damaging well Mr Shearer I

think we've all known that he's pro-life

that's always been his position and he's

also been very clear that's all

conservative and liberal governance and

they were not touching this that's not

an issue were touching mr. Trudeau said

he was pro-life a number of years ago as

well but no government is opening this

issue tomorrow it's the first English

leaders debate it's a lot of people on

this stage and a lot of moderators and

some people are wondering how do you

break through all of that and come out

on top and what's the strategy for the

parties going in to make their points

and make their leaders stand out I think

that what's important for the leaders is

they have to be calm they have to be

present they have to be well-rested they

have to know the files I have to know

the particulars that they need to make

in order to differentiate themselves

from the other leaders so for a leader

like Joe can eat sing what's important

there is that that we don't allow the

Liberals and the Conservatives Mr

Shearer and mr. Trudeau to try and turn

this into a two-person race and to

acknowledge that there is there are

other options yeah Fred in the Quebec

debate Mr Shearer seemed to be

surrounded he was taking it on all sides

what's the conservative strategy heading

into this debate there's no question he

was the target and I'm sure he'll get

the target again Monday his message is

going to be to Canadians about how his

platform is to make life more affordable

and the other leaders I I think

understand that that message is

resonating and they need to go after him

our geometric conservatives have made a

habit of underestimate mr. Trudeau and

his abilities the one thing I would say

is a pickup on and said these debates

don't usually have a knockout punch one

debate on a campaign that

several years ago I remember all the

pundits said at the end of the debate

well she clearly won the debate this is

you know on points and so forth and then

literally in the aftermath half the

debate when people had tuned in we saw

hunks of our support fall off it's

because people decided essentially would

and said they didn't like what they were

saying they found it too harsh

I thought she interrupted too much they

thought the you know the whole package

of what they saw they distance it in

like was it a knockout punch no was it

the turning point in the election

campaign absolutely and this may be the

turning point in what has been a largely

deadlocked election campaign but that's

all the time we have for today so I'm

going to wrap it up and we'll see all of

you next week we'll see if we're still

in the same position that's all the time

we have for today thanks for joining us

for the West block I'm Mercedes
