wrong to be putting pressure on the NBA

sir

well the NBA is a different thing I mean

I watch this guy Steve Kerr and he was

like a little boy he was so scared to be

even answering the question he couldn't

answer the question he was shaking oh oh

I don't know I don't know he didn't know

how to answer the question and he'll

talk about the United States very badly

I watched Popovich sort of the same

thing but he didn't look quite as scared

actually but they talked badly about the

United States but when it talks about

China they don't want to say anything

bad I thought it was pretty sad actually

it'll be it'll be very it'll be very

interesting excuse me are you okay then

with the Chinese government pressuring

the NBA over Hong Kong they have to work

out their own situation MB is they know

what they're doing but I watch the way

that like Kerr Popovich and some of the

others were pandering to China and yet

to our own country they don't it's like

they don't respect it it's like they

don't respect it I said what a

difference isn't it sad it's very sad to

me it's very sad
