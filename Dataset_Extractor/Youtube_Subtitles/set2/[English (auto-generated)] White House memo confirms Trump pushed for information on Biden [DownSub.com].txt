US President Donald Trump is facing

another fight for his job the White

House has released a memo detailing a

controversial discussion he had with

Ukraine's president a conversation that

led Democrats to launch an impeachment

inquiry in the official summary of the

July phone call with Ukraine's president

Trump asked him to investigate former

Vice President Joe Biden and to probe a

conspiracy theory about a democratic

email server hidden in Ukraine Trump

says the memo shows he didn't put any

pressure on Ukraine on the witch hunt no

push no pressure no nothing it's all a

hoax folks it's all a big hoax as our

Washington bureau chief Jackson prosecco

reports Democrats are now putting their

eyes on the whistleblower complaint that

brought all this to light it's better to

be on TV than buy home yeah with their

private phone call now very public

ukrainian president vladimir szalinski

and u.s. president donald trump tried to

save face over trump's asked that

ukraine investigate Democratic

presidential candidate Joe Biden he'd

was normal we spoke about many things

and I so I think and you are added that

nobody pushes me you know details of

that call were detailed in a White House

memo released Wednesday in it zolensky

tells Trump that Ukraine is almost ready

to buy more javelin anti-tank missiles

from the US for defense purposes Trump

immediately replies I would like you to

do us a favor though first asking for an

investigation into a DNC email server I

would like to have the Attorney General

call you or your people and I would like

to get to the bottom of it he said then

Trump pivoted to Joe Biden there's a lot

of talk about Biden's son that Biden

stopped the prosecution and a lot of

people want to find out about that so

whatever you can do with the attorney

general would be great said the

president in addition to mentioning US

Attorney General Bill Barr Trump went on

to tell zalenski that he would also be

hearing from his personal lawyer Rudy

Giuliani to discuss the Biden

investigation what those notes reflect

is a classic

feel like shakedown of a foreign leader

Democrats see the memo as explosive

evidence of Trump seeking out for an

election interference while enlisting

his lawyer and the Attorney General as

emissaries it's enough to build even

more support for impeachment proceedings

against the president there doesn't need

to be a quid pro quo to be a crime just

the fact that he did all those things is

sufficient

Trump's conduct on the call was

considered so concerning that it was

flagged by an anonymous whistleblower

and sent to the Department of Justice

for review and the DOJ reviewed that

complaint but found no violation of laws

which prohibit foreign election

interference but lawmakers here on

Capitol Hill may have an entirely

different view of the matter that

whistleblower complaint was sent up here

late this afternoon it's now being

reviewed by members of both the House

and Senate intelligence committees Robin

Jackson tomorrow we understand we could

get more information about the

whistleblowers complaint that's right

the Acting Director of National

Intelligence the person who originally

blocked that whistleblower complaint

from being made public is set to testify

in public

tomorrow morning giving us a broader

sense of how exactly we got here this

will also be important for Republicans

to hear because all day long they've

been standing by the President and

standing by that transcript saying it's

not enough to merit impeachment it'll be

interesting to see if the words of the

Acting DNI in any way changed their

views of the matter
