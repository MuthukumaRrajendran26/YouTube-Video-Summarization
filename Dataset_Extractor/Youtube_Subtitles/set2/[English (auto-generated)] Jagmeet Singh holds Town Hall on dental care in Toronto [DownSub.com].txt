before I bring our leader up here to

about him when I first met jag meet

man who is a natural born leader with

integrity an honest man a man who I want

to stand beside a man who I want to help

lead Canada and Canadians and then when

I saw his big poster on the Yorkdale

shopping plaza

I was doubly impressed and his face

should be plastered all over really

really

incredibly honored to have Maria Mary

and japhet and our entire team of

now we're right on the boundary between

today not only Humber River Black Creek

but also right beside us York Center so

it's great to have our candidate Andrea

with us friends I want to tell you a

little bit about what this election is

all about and and Maria touched on it

and japhet has spoken on this and all

our candidates is spoken about it we see

in this community like many communities

people who are having a hard time

they're struggling with things like

housing it's hard to find a place to

call home

people are worried about the cost of

health care more and more it's harder

and harder to afford things like

medication but all the things as well

like dental care

many people are putting it off they

don't choose to get their teeth cleaned

or to take the time to take care of

their dental health because it's too

expensive

and we know that transit is something

that people really desperately need here

in the community they want to be able to

get around and it's hard because it's

it's not being invested in enough and we

know that young people are looking at

the future and not filled with hope and

excitement but are worried they're

worried because they can't find a job

there's high rates of unemployment here

in the city for young people

particularly we also know that young

people are worried about the future

because they're worried about the

climate crisis and we will look at all

these things that people worried about

we see what the Liberals and the

Conservatives are doing about it and I

put to you that they are more

preoccupied with making life easier for

the people at the very top and that

makes life harder for everyone else

they've chosen to help those who are

already doing well the powerful

corporations

they've time and time again when push

comes to shove help them out and it's

made people hurt I want to show you some

examples you know we talked about young

people who are who should be hopeful

about the future who should be excited

about what's going to come in the

in in the future instead of being

excited they're worried because they've

got crushing student debt they're

crushed with the weight of student debt

and I think about the choices that this

government's made mr. Trudeau the

choices mr. Trudeau specifically is made

over the past four years while mr.

Trudeau's been in government

he's been charging students interest on

their student debt

he's been profiting he's been profiting

on student debt so over four years mr.

Trudeau has taken three billion dollars

off the backs of students by charging

them interest higher than banks even

he's charged interest plant prime plus

three percent that's higher than a bank

would give you that's her own government

but that's a choice of mr. Trudeau and

on the flip side that's three billion

dollars he's taken from students but on

the flip side what does he do for

corporations well last year last year

there was six billion dollars in

corporate loans owed to the government

guess what he did with those loans he

forgave them he wrote them off look at

that conscious right there this is mr.

Trudeau who claims to be helping young

people out he took he picked the pockets

of young people to the tune of three

billion and he gave corporations six

billion dollars by waving loans that's

the contrast right that's the contrast

we have and you know seniors seniors are

worried because their health care needs

are becoming more and more and it's

harder hard to pay for medication so

costly and here's another really

concrete example of what mr. Trudeau

does he promised in 2015 to lower the

cost of medication and and he promised

to do something very simple there is a

board that sets the prices for

medication they said give us a new list

of countries that we can compare to and

we can drop the price of medication for

Canadians just give us a new list we're

not allowed to do it on our own you've

got to legislate it legislate a new list

of countries and we can drop the price

of medication mr. Trudeau promised to do

it but four years passed and he didn't

do it

he promised in 2015 so what why did he

break that promise and then we started

looking to see well what happened why

did he break that promise well guess

what happened over the past 4 years

guess who he met with he met with the

big pharma lobbyists the insurance

lobbyists who tried to lobby em say no

no don't drop the price of medication

don't bring in free Pharma care it's

gonna hurt our profits guess how many

times he met with his government mr.

Trudeau's government guess how many

times they met with the big pharma

insurance lobbyists together total rough

guess 50 that's a lot of times 30 even

higher 800 is close if you if you put

together the Big Pharma and the land the

insurance lobbyists that the times they

met with the Liberal government over the

past four years that we can count

because it's all registered we've

counted our researchers have counted

eight hundred and seventy five times so

it comes as no surprise that the abandon

of the promise to lower the cost of

medication but guess what he did right

now guess what we're in right now our

election period guess what mr. Trudeau

likes to do during election periods

promises and lies kind of both right he

made a promise to lower the cost of

medication by doing exactly what he

promised to do in 2015 how can we

believe him how can we believe him

that's really what it comes down to

exactly and the thing is is that you

know mr. shears gonna now say Mr Shearer

just announced today oh I'm gonna I'm

gonna stop giving money to the wealthy

corporations come on who's gonna believe

that who's gonna believe that mr. mr.

sheer and his government have

consistently given the most billions and

billions of dollars to the wealthiest

corporations and the wealthiest

Canadians that's what they do and when

they do that they cut taxes for the

wealthy okay guess what else they cut

they cut services that people need and

we don't need to look further than

Ontario and Toronto families have to pay

for it let's look at what mr. Ford has

done he said he was for the people but

who was he really for for the powerful

corporations he cut services he cut

their taxes and cut services for

families we've got massive cloud

sizes education being cut healthcare is

being cut but we've got a different way

we're done with liberals and

conservatives taking Canadians for

granted right we're done with that we're

done with no more worry we've got a new

deal for people a new deal that says

we've got the courage to take on big

pharma we've got the courage to take on

the insurance industry and say you know

what we're gonna make sure if you need

medication in our country you use your

health card not your credit card that's

what we're gonna do and you know we're

gonna say we said today we announced

today a really bold plan something I'm

really excited about you know there's

one in three Canadians have no coverage

when it comes to dental care right we

know that at least four point three

million people well four point three

million Canadians are brothers and

sisters you know our family people very

close to us do not get the care they

need because they can't afford it so

what we announced today is immediately

within the first 100 days of a new

democratic government we're gonna put in

place some me that completes Tommy

Douglas his dream not just dental care

but dental care dental care

our plan our plan will immediately cover

everyone who makes less than $70,000 a

year who doesn't have public or private

coverage will be covered immediately

with our plan it's government funded

public coverage for everyone who needs

it under $70,000 immediately I was when

I first announced this I was telling

folks I was getting goose bumps like I

think about the people that could

benefit this from this right now I met

families and I met people who say you

know what I'm making an OK living I'm

getting by but I just don't have enough

money to to worry about my dental care

cuz it's just cost too much and our plan

for a family that's got four people in

the family that needs to get cleanups

and checkups

and maybe one or two people that need to

get maybe a filling done our plan would

save that family $1,200 a year

it's a massive savings some real savings

my friends I put at you again you know

at the end of the day we can make a big

difference we can make sure young people

have a brighter future we can take on

the climate crisis we can invest in

health care we can make sure people have

affordable bills when it comes to their

cell phone which are paying the highest

in the world we can take on the big

telecom we can take on the big pharma

cuz we're not in it for the rich we're

in it for people we're in it for you

that's what we do

and with and with great champions like

our candidates we have here today with

our great Kent champions like Maria and

and japhet and Andrea the whole team and

this community and the surrounding areas

we're gonna elect new Democrats and

we're gonna fight for a better future

I'm gonna do that together let's make it

happen some questions now some reason uh

questions so if you'd like to ask our

leader a question please let me know cuz

I'm the boss here now okay who'd like to

ask a question yeah okay how are you

going to do that there were some kids

who got a letter going home that they

had to have their teeth that do visit a

dentist because they couldn't afford it

right so that was like 20 years ago so

what are you gonna do that's gonna

change okay I'm gonna tell you exactly

what to do

so thank you very much the question just

to repeat a real quickly how are we

gonna do this the question is how are we

gonna make sure people get this coverage

this this plan that we're talking about

and I want to make this really clear

it's about choices so governments have

choices that they make there is

obviously limited resources but there's

certain priorities now I'm gonna give

you an example of what mr. Trudeau did

with the limited resources we have

there's only so much money we have to

spend and what does the government do

with that money that's the question they

do what's in their priority so they've

got a set of priorities they go okay

what are our priorities we're gonna

spend money on those priorities I'm

gonna give you an example of just tally

this with me what mr. Trudeau spent last

year so in the fall economic statement

that's just last year in the fall 2018

and the fall economic statement mr.

Trudeau put forward a massive giveaway

to corporations

he gave them basically 14 billion

dollars and he gave 14 billion dollars

to the richest corporation so they could

buy corporate jets and limousines it was

written in the fall economic statement

corporate tax cut that was basic

giving 14 billion dollars away he paid

14 billion dollars to the corporations

he bought a pipeline for 4.5 billion

dollars

we're almost at 20 billion dollars right

now right that's 20 billion dollars I

just mentioned that he wrote off the

loans for corporations in the to the

tune of six billion dollars we're

getting up to twenty six billion dollars

guess how much this plan would cost to

cover everyone who doesn't have any

coverage who earns less than $70,000 a

little bit less actually very close

actually that's a good guess

856 million dollars so less less than a

billion dollars so that's it that's the

contrast we make better choices who else

has a question sir Reverend sky I get a

mic to you our city is besieged by gun

violence I walked with mothers and

families who lose their kids to

conveyance and there's no care for them

after they have gone through the trauma

what specifically will you do or will

your government do to provide care for

youth the families and communities after

they've gone through that trauma thank

you for the question thank you it's a

very serious question because we are

faced with a pretty serious epidemic

here and here in Toronto

specifically in Toronto and it hurts to

see the stories when they come on the

news we lose young people families get

torn apart because of the loss and it

hurts to hear that and it hurts those

families and you touched on over the

important part after that horrible loss

then the families are left to pick up

the pieces and often they don't know

what to do it's really really tough and

so it's a complex question and I don't

want to assume that I know all the

answers because it's very complex but

there's a couple things I know we need

to do

there's supports that we need to put in

place for families and those supports

aren't there right now so when we talk

about head to toe health care coverage

in that we need to also recognize that

there's a big gap when it comes to

counseling and support services and

mental health services dealing with the

stress and the trauma and that's why

what we believe is what's missing in our

health care system where people are

telling me is there's not enough focus

on on those supports and so when we talk

about including medication coverage for

all dental care for all we also

include those support services or

families that means mental health

services and those supports the families

need when they go through these

difficult times we believe in putting

that into the healthcare system question

yes sir

what are you gonna do with the pipeline

that robot well first off we wouldn't

about the pipeline in the first place

that was a bad decision and we certainly

what we've committed to we certainly

don't believe it should be expanded and

vote very recently the BC Court has now

again said that the the decision-making

around allowing it or proving it is

flawed something we already knew they

again now have ruled that there's

problems with it and that project again

is now going to be challenged so mr.

trudeau just doesn't seem to get it this

project should not go ahead the the

Trans Mountain what it does is it goes

through into a coastal area where it

puts the coastal community at risk the

coastline of BC which is a beautiful

pristine coastline the diluted bitumen

that's being transported no one knows

how to clean it up so one oil spill

could result in a massive devastation to

the environment to the coastline and to

thousands of workers so our position is

very clear we need to stop the expansion

should not go ahead with it it is not

the right thing to do

you have a question sir okay question

here okay it's so bad sure sure I'll

talk about it yeah we're gonna have one

of them might we really get the question

so I'll just repeat it for folks

question was on car insurance and my

question was on carbon tax so let me

talk about both those first off the only

reason why I know a lot about the

insurance issues cuz I was provincial

and we put up a big fight because what's

happened in Ontario is a lot of what's

happening at the federal level the

government in Ottawa whether they've

been liberal or conservative and

recently the government's in Ontario

liberal and conservative have made a

whole bunch of laws that benefit the

people at the very top so in the case of

auto insurance every law that was made

when I got into office I remember every

single law that was being made Liberals

brought it in now conservatives are

bringing in kept on benefiting insurance

companies on hurting families allowed

them to make more and more profits and

people to get less coverage but to be

paid more for it imagine that we say you

know we're gonna charge more for the

movie ticket but you can only watch half

the show it's pretty much what they are

doing they're charging us more and more

and they're ripping us off eventually

essentially and they're they're covering

us less so what it's going to take is

someone with the courage to stand up and

I can tell you Andrew Horvath the

interior New Democratic leader and the

entire Ontario New Democratic team have

the courage to do that they're gonna

stand up

and then we're gonna win another

question coming up but before that it's

wanted to touch on the the carbon tax

what what we know is that there is a

price to pollution when companies

pollute when pollution goes into the air

when pollution goes into the water we

all pay the price it means the water is

not clean means the air is not clean to

breathe and it's a real thing I've seen

I met a young mom in NBC and because of

climate crisis the hotter temperatures

the longer summer is the hotter summers

forest fires are raging in BC more than

ever before just to give you a concept

of what it means in BC what it means is

because of forest fires are so intense

and so long the past two summers in a

row - the last one but the one two ones

before that the summers were so long and

so hot the forest fires are so bad that

doctors recommended people not to go

outside and breathe the air so when I

asked her mom what she was most worried

about she said she's worried about the

future for her baby but she was worried

about the following summer because she's

worried I found some days whether or not

her child could breathe the air so if

you look at that mom and look at that

baby in the eyes and say to them is

there a price to pollution yeah there is

there is a price but the way that price

should be applied should not exempt the

biggest polluters what mr. Trudeau has

done the biggest polluter should pay

their fair share

families should be supported but the

biggest polluters have to pay their fair

share my question is the young children

I am a mother with five children leave

this area

I am very supportive for Maria my

children they graduate most of them but

they cannot afford to leave my house oh

yes for the cannot afford rent they

cannot be a house they cannot even

thinking about marriage because mom what

we can do we live better here solution

my other question is the hope car is

covering only the hospital bed yeah that

I never knew until my son get leukemia

time ago 70 years ago sorry

and no it's finished now it's a life of

twenty years old he's doing good but

that day I discover that the oil car is

not covering the medication the

chemotherapy nothing I was surprised

they told me mom you have insurance that

time we were working a cash we didn't

have insurance we were in welfare they

push you to go to welfare because if

he's not covering the medication in the

hospital how you can have a medication

outside of those thank you for the

questions Thank You

mats can I see Matt Senate can I see

thank you Matt Senate med Senate's for

the question and it's going in fian okay

good thank you so much though for your

question you touched on two big ones one

it was very funny the way you said it

about the housing kids can't leave the

house you're right it's too hard they're

comfortable but I mean really they can't

afford it's it's too expensive they

can't leave and and parents are like

they're happy to have their kids but

they also want them to spread their

wings in and be able to find their own

place maybe parents really want them to

go more than yeah but the reality is the

kids want to go to but they can't afford

it and and but this is a very serious

thing

hey kids can't afford to find a place

because what's happened in our country

for the past thirty years the federal

government has neglected its job if you

look around every community not just

Toronto but across Canada where there

was affordable housing where there's

cooperatives where people can go and

live there with affordable rents you

could be a young student or a young

family or you could be a senior where

there was affordable housing nonprofit

housing or not for mark and not market

non market housing these housing units

that are affordable that people can live

in with dignity and their quality great

places they were built up until the 90s

what happened in the 90s the federal

government stopped funding these

projects so for 30 years the federal

government stopped building affordable

homes and now we have a housing crisis

but it's not a surprise it's because of

a decision and again I want to bring

back to the choices the government in

Ottawa liberal and conservative had

choices

and they chose to cut taxes for the

corporations make sure there was big

loopholes for CEOs they let them send

money offshore you've heard of offshore

tax havens billions of dollars go there

they're choosing this this is not a by

chance oh it just happened it's a choice

they're choosing not to build a housing

they're choosing not to address a crisis

mr. Trudeau chose through this he made a

big announcement he said I'm gonna build

housing guess what we found out in fact

the Parliamentary Budget Office found

out that mr. Trudeau is spending less on

housing than even mr. Harper did the

parliamentary budget found that he spent

19 percent less on housing and

percentage of GDP than mr. Harper so

he's actually spending less on housing

we're gonna do it differently we're

gonna say housing is a priority it's

something that should be a right we are

gonna build half a million new

affordable homes so young people however

buy future where housing is affordable

we're going to take on speculators the

foreign the foreign investors who put

money into Canada thinking our houses

are like a stock option or like stock

markets we're gonna end that by putting

in a foreign buyers tax if you're a

permanent resident or a citizen you can

buy but if you're buying from afar

there's gonna be a big tax to make sure

we stop and discourage that

we is really good at keeping the

questions going I like that we gotta

bring you to all we got to bring you to

the next town okay so first of all

welcome to Humber River community thank

you I have a question it's a different

kind of question

it's a courage validation question okay

so we have examples where we have

countries South the border who build on

who believe on building walls and

basically pitting one person against

somebody else as Canadians we have like

a reputation of helping and welcoming

every single person I just need to know

how courageous you are to stand up in

front of those parties who have policies

which support anti-immigration a great

question I really appreciate it

I've said it again and again and I'm

happy to say it now I will unequivocally

defend the beauty of our country as a

place that's built on immigration that's

built on people coming here and choosing

Canada as our home that makes us

stronger that makes us more beautiful

that builds up a better country and I've

called out people that are divisive that

spread messages that are hateful things

like saying there's a fear of mass

immigration or blaming refugees for

problems see what happens is when people

don't have housing we talked about

housing when people don't have jobs that

help pay the bills that help make ends

meet when corporations make massive

amounts of money the economy's going so

well but people aren't benefiting from

that economy what happens is some

political leaders are going to come

around and say oh you know whose fault

it is it's a new immigrants fault it's

that refugees fault when really it's a

fault of governments that chose to

benefit the people at the top and hurt

everyone else it's their fault

it's corporations its corporations that

are exploiting workers it's their fault

so we want to make sure that the right

target is there and I'm gonna make sure

every single time I get I say it is not

immigrants fault it's not new Canadians

it's not refugees its decisions that

governments have made that are benefited

and profited powerful corporations that

have heard Canadians that's what we

target our energy let's get you the mic

give us one sec Mike's coming around

yeah he's gonna reach it over to you

okay

okay I got two questions one is this gun

control cuz they're killing people

senseless killing I'm turning it and if

you if you're in power if you win

government what what are you going to

start doing if you become Prime Minister

Cano what what what were you first

tackle was the gun the gun control

massive gun killing okay thank you so

much I gotta say Maria's really good

what's going on in Toronto like it's

it's hard to read those stories right

like every time we read those stories on

the news where we see the news and we

hear about another another gun violence

incident where someone's lost her life

it hurts us to see that it hurts us

because we love our city I love this

city

it's a city I was I was born in Toronto

I love this city and anytime I see those

stories it makes me feel so sad to see

that and I think about the bright young

life they get stolen from us you know

what that young person could have done

it hurts to hear that so there's a again

this is a complex thing it's not like we

can do one thing to solve gun violence

but there's a couple things we can do

right there's a couple things we can do

one of the things that we've said if a

city asks for the right to be able to

ban handguns we should allow that city

the right to do so we should give the

city the right to do so and and we will

make and that's our commitment we will

make the legislative changes that allow

cities like Toronto where the mayor and

the council have said about something

they want to do will give the power

legislatively to the city to do that the

second thing though is a more complex

question we know we've met with experts

people in communities who say we know

the solutions we know what we need our

young people don't see a bright future

our young people are worried they're

they're afraid and they go down a bad

path because they have no hope and when

someone has no hope they come desperate

and when someone's desperate and they're

hurting they lash out and so the root

cause of violence is very complex I

don't want to act like I know all the

answers to this it's very complex but we

know that if we invest in communities

give young people a bright future make

sure they've got a good place to live a

quality place they can afford if they

can get jobs if they can get education

we can build up their bright future we

can move into a positive direction we

know we can do

I'd like to speak to you about

affordability of buying a home so I have

a young family and I rent it's a lot of

money but we would like something more

we would like our kids to stay in the

city we love this city it's where I was

born where my children were born but the

affordability in the city to even buy a

home for families who are trying saving

trying to get there the new laws that

came out with the help from the

government initiatives for first-time

homebuyers don't even affect the GTA

because of the market yeah it's very

strong we know that but what can the

government do and the NDP government do

to help families who want something more

than just renting and having continual

rent increases do they want to own they

want to stay where they are and enjoy

their communities York southwestern all

the way I like you took that from really

serious housing you know importance of

housing then you slip in your blessing

that's how we do so I mean you touched

on something it's really important I

think many people in this room will all

agree that they they're worried about

that whether they have housing they're

worried about their kids then and maybe

they don't have people in this room

don't have housing either or are in the

same position where they're renting and

they want something more stable so this

again is is a bigger problem but there

is there's ways to solve it and I'm

confident we can solve it if you make

the right choices so there's there's

kind of two parts to it there's how do

we control that the housing prices are

going up so fast there is how do we

provide some relief and then thirdly how

do we help first-time homebuyers so

there's three parts to it so the first

part is to get at the root cause why our

housing price is going up so fast we

found there's two things that we can

control I touched on it but let me just

get in more details so what people are

doing it's it's massively impacting

Vancouver and BC but it's actually also

happening here in Toronto

so because Toronto has a stable housing

market and housing prices are going up

there's foreign investors that are just

dropping money and buying homes here

they're buying condos here and they're

just sitting on it and it's driving up

the cost of housing it's speculation so

we are proposing to stop that BC

actually put in place a foreign buyers

tax

and it worked it actually brought down

the price of housing it's working we

want to bring that national so I would

put in place in national foreign buyers

tax so that we can stop that upward

rising pressure on housing that's

becoming out of control

it's literally out of control so that's

one step the second one is money

laundering now money laundering is

actually also contributing to the rising

cost of housing they said it's at least

5% that they can count in BC but there's

much more that we can't actually count

so money laundering is something that

the federal government should and can

tackle but we haven't actually seen our

government do that mr. Trudeau I asked

him the question actually in Parliament

just just a couple months ago when we

were in part my I asked him why is

nothing being done to tackle money

laundering there's a department for

money laundering but you haven't

actually hired anyone in the department

and they have and there's a budget for

it but no one's using the budget to do

the job it's the government's fault and

I guess what mr. Trudeau said to the

question he didn't respond no surprise

but I mean so we would make sure that

that department was funded and was given

a clear mandate to tackle money

laundering and finally when we look at

countries around the world where housing

is affordable there is a rental

opportunity that's affordable so right

now I want to rent or buy it's almost

the same price like the mortgages and

the rental fees are almost the same

so it's driving pressure on making it

hard to own a home so countries actually

have invested in non-market housing a

cooperative housing so you can have a

place to live that's quality that's

affordable and the rent is very low and

that way you can save up if you want to

buy your own or if you want to stay

there you can stay there but you have

the security of knowing you can stay in

that place for as long as you need and

that's also the fear when you're renting

you never know what's gonna happen if

the landlord changes their mind if they

do a renovation something happens and

you lose your place so what we're

proposing is non-market affordable

quality housing a cooperative housing

where you can live there for as long as

you want and that way it'll create more

opportunities for people to either rent

affordably or safe to buy their own

place and then finally when it comes to

buying their own place one of the

changes that people have asked for is a

longer time to pay back the mortgage so

they can have smaller payments so we're

gonna introduce that and we're gonna

double the first-time homebuyers tax

credit to help people out but it's

really the the whole

solution we're not thinking of just one

it's that whole package that's gonna

really solve this problem thanks you

thank you being a camera unfortunately

we have time for only one more question

Evelyn where'd you go there you are last

question er okay so um we've been

talking a lot about the problem some

more I'm wondering about solutions now

so in our community unemployment is a

big problem and the housing crisis all

those things but we see we seem to be

relying on creating employment right

well what's happening with creating like

part-time jobs and low-wage jobs what

ideas do you have like a certain like

I'm gonna present an alternative like

where as the large companies can go to a

bank and negotiate a loan how about a

guarantee for law people with lower

wages lower income savings how about a

guarantee for them when they have the

ideas to go forward to the bank

something like oh you have a guarantee

for the student loan so how about having

that for working-class people

what are you ideas on them thank you

very much the question thank you

to build jobs I think it's essential

we've got to be able to have a strategy

to create jobs and they've got to be

long-term permanent quality jobs because

you're absolutely right what's happening

is more and more job creation means

part-time precarious unstable

unpredictable jobs and that doesn't help

build communities it makes that makes

life very uncertain for a lot of people

and there's probably a lot of people in

this room that work jobs that they don't

know if they're gonna be able to keep

and that unpredictability makes you

afraid for the future and it's hard to

build a future when you don't know if

you're gonna have your job so what we're

proposing is we want to use our dollars

our public dollars use them very

seriously and make investments in

communities to create jobs one example

we know that there's a climate crisis

people are worried about that so we've

got a plan to tackle the climate crisis

but also create jobs and they're gonna

be long-term stable quality jobs what

we're hoping to do is our

commitment is a retrofit every building

and every home in Canada those jobs will

happen in communities those retrofit

javis mean those those who go in energy

audit so the people that go into the

home and it what needs to be done the

people that install the insulation or

the windows or the solar panels those

who sell and distribute those materials

these are jobs created in communities

they can't be sent offshore they have to

happen in communities so that's one idea

and then finally on your idea about

having access to entrepreneurs who want

to be able to set up their own company

we've got to make it easier he's right

now I remember my brother we started a

small business and when he tried to do

it it was so complicated there's so many

steps and he couldn't get funding it

makes it really hard we wouldn't

encourage entrepreneurship make it

easier for people who want to take that

jump in and start their own business and

start their own idea so it's got to be

easier we've got to find the easier ways

for people to access capital to start up

that company we've got to find easier

ways for people to get supported less

barriers less complication to actually

starting it making it streamlined I

remember my brother he's a lawyer and he

had to write all these documents and

prepare all these materials and he's

like this is so complicated this is like

a this is like a law case not just

starting up a business and that's that's

hard right like how are you gonna

encourage business if it's so hard to

fill out the paperwork so I agree with

you and we've got to do a lot better we

have one last one up there I think yeah

we got to figure out a way to do that so

I'm a I'm gonna look at mental health

treatments for all Canadian yeah it's a

great question first question thank you

it's really fitting that a young person

asking because this is a growing concern

like mental health we're seeing it more

and more people are having you know

concerns having some serious problems

and they're not getting the help they

need so we know we talked today about

our heads to health care coverage I'm

really proud of the fact we won't

include medication coverage that's gonna

help in some cases we talked about a

dental care dental care for four people

for Canadians our plan is to make it

universal we'll start with our first

step for those who make seventy thousand

or less but it doesn't end there because

they want to have it truly head to toe

health care coverage we've got to

include hearing and vision care we also

have to include mental health services

and that's what's been really missing in

our health care system and that means

providing the support so people can get

the mental care they a mental health

care they need it might also mean and it

definitely means help for addictions and

rehabilitation services and counseling

these have to be included in our

healthcare system and right now it's a

massive gap so people are falling

through the crops cracks because there's

no there's no supports there it's not

available so we're gonna take that very

seriously it's a part of our commitment

we want true complete comprehensive

head-to-toe health care including mental

services thank you so much thank you so

on a scale of one to ten how did he do

thank you thank you for coming out and

meeting the leader Jack meat sing is

real the NDP is a real contender and in

that was here today uh everyone for

see you all there and like oh I saw you

but we're gonna I want to meet with you

laughter it's oh so stick around we're

gonna take some pictures and hang out

and spend some time together so hang

tight and we're gonna take some

questions right here okay here he goes

from the media I mean hi mr. Singh it's

Annie Bergeron Oliver with CTV national

news hi Annie there is a story just

breaking in Time magazine it says that

Justin Trudeau wore brown face back in

2001 at an Arabian Nights party when he

was teaching at a private school the

Prime Minister's office has confirmed

that this was mr. Trudeau in the photo

they say it was an arabian night and it

was back in 2001 before he was prime

minister before he was a politician I'm

wondering what you think about this what

your initial reaction is to this story

in time well it's troubling I mean it's

really it's insulting anytime we hear

examples of brown face or black face

saying it's really it's it's it's making

a mockery of someone for what they live

and what the relived experiences are I

think he needs to answer for it

he's got to answer the question why he

did that and what does that say about

what he thinks about people who because

of who they are because of the color of

skin faced challenges and barriers and

obstacles in their life

racism is real people in this room have

felt it I've heard the stories I've

experienced in my life he's got to

answer those questions

the Justin Trudeau is expected to

address the media tonight that are

traveling with him on the election

campaign I'm wondering what you would

like to hear from him and what you think

that he should be saying to the public I

think what what this shows is something

that that we've seen some examples of

now it seems to be a pattern behavior we

see one mr. Trudeau in public that

seemed I'll be honest with he seems

really nice

right very friendly very warm in public

but in behind closed doors he seems like

it's a different mr. Trudeau behind

closed doors we saw at a private

fundraiser when activists who were

saying that our community is being

poisoned by mercury people from grassy

narrows they put up a sign saying hey

our communities are being poisoned what

are you gonna do about the fact that

people are dying in our community that

are suffering because the mercury poison

he mocked him and said thank you for

your donation while the crowd of wealthy

fundraisers the attendees of the

fundraiser clapped on and jeered these

protesters I mean on one hand he says

that indigenous communities are are the

most important relationship but then

behind closed doors he mocks people they

didn't attack him they said our people

are suffering from mercury poisoning and

he mocked those people I mean what type

of behavior does that show from a prime

minister who mocks people who were who

are saying this I want to say who is the

real mr. Trudeau is that who we see in

public or the one behind doors that

forgives loans for corporations but

makes students pay three billion dollars

who is a real mr. Trudeau is it the one

behind closed doors the one we know the

cameras are turned off and when no one

sees is that the real mr. Trudeau

because more and more that seems like it

is a farce Amy she sings to Lezak CEO he

thanks so much by a 4-barrel folks okay

mister seen the this is fairly well is

from Amica I used to work for Hispanic

newspaper here but now I Nestor Tina a

new digital website dedicated to remove

immigrants in Canada immigration hasn't

been an issue in the last federal

relations but this time around it seems

that it's gonna take some kind of

relevance

especially because mr. Bernier is now

attacking immigration to Canada there

are a few people who are there to defend

the contribution of immigrants to Canada

what is your proposal in terms of number

of immigrants coming to Canada

helping those immigrants to settle down

here in Canada as smoothly and being

able to cooperate to contribute at their

fullest yes thank you very much so first

off we need immigration in Canada

immigration has built up this country we

need it it's something that helps our

economy it's something that gives us

richness to our society it's the reason

why we have such an incredibly diverse

room right now that's a strength of

Canada it's a beautiful thing and I

reject anyone who makes a threat or

makes a fear or creates a fear around

mass immigration that is false that is a

lie and that creates hatred and it

creates divisions and that's wrong

and when and when it comes to the number

I mean as many as we possibly as our

country can accommodate we need

immigration and something that helps our

country out so we look at what makes the

most sense there's obviously a balance

between making sure we can welcome new

arrivals to Canada there's the right

supports in place so when people come to

Canada they can they can contribute

their best they can be a part of

societies want to make sure that the

right service is in place we also want

to make sure that people who come here

with international training

international experience that training

and that international experience is

very valuable to Canadians they can

contribute not just for themselves but

for all of us and we know that because

the current system does not recognize

those talents and that experience

they're missing out the new arrivals are

missing out and we're missing out on

what they could offer we've got to do a

much better job of recognizing the

international talents and experience

that people come with
