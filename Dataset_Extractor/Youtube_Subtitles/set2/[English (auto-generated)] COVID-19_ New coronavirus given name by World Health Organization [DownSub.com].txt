first of all we now have a name for the

disease and it is kovat 19 and I will

spell it see all the I D - 1 9 Co Co

stands for coroner's you know VI stands

for virus d for busy so cough it under

and read guidelines between deadly H Oh

the world work the World Health

Organization the World Organization for

Animal Health and the Food and

Agriculture Organization means WH o or I

and foul of the United Nations we had to

find a name that did not refer to a

geographical location an animal and and

an individual or group of people and

which is also pronounceable and related

to the disease having a name matters to

prevent the use of other names that can

be inaccurate or stigmatizing it also

gives us a standard format to use for

any future Khurana virus outbreaks and

now to the corona virus situation as of

6 a.m.

Geneva time this morning there were

forty two thousand seven hundred eight

confirmed cases reported in China and

tragically we have now surpassed 1000

deaths

1017 people in China have lost their

lives to this virus most of the cases

and most of the deaths are in Hebei

Province whoa-ha outside China there are

three hundred ninety three cases in 24

countries and one death last week I told

you that we had engaged

just network of country representatives

as well as the United Nations resident

coordinators in countries to brief them

on the outbreak and inform them about

the steps they can take

I also briefed secretary general Antonio

Guterres and we agreed to leverage the

power of the entire UN system in the

response today we have also activated a

UN crisis management team to be led by

my general doctor Mike Ryan

this will help whu-oh focus on the

health response while the other agencies

can bring their expertise to bear on the

wider social economic and developmental

implications of the outbreak so we are

all working to our strengths so Mike

will be the chief still continue to be

the chief emergency and will also

coordinate the whole UN response as you

know today and tomorrow W is hosting a

meeting of more than 400 scientists from

around the world both in person and

virtually the main outcome we expect

from this meeting is not immediate

answers to every question that we have

the main outcome is an agreed roadmap on

what questions we need to ask and how we

will go about answering those questions

this is exactly what whu-oh is for

bringing the world together to

coordinate the response
