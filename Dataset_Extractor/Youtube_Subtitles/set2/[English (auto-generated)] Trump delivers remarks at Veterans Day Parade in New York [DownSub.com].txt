fitting that the Veterans Day Parade

begin right here in New York City since

the earliest days of our nation New York

has exemplified the American spirit and

has been at the heart of our nation's

story of daring and defiance on July 2nd

1776 the British Armada sailed into New

York Harbor numbering more than 400

ships and carrying more than 30,000 men

the British came here to snuff out what

they thought was just a minor american

revolution didn't turn out to be that

way but the Redcoats did know what they

did know was they were going to have a

problem but they didn't know that New

York would meet them with the fearsome

power of American patriots in World War

one New York regiments like Harlem

Hellfighters the Lost battalion and the

fighting 69th were revered all over the

globe during World War two 63 million

tons of supplies and more than three

million service members shipped out of

New York Harbor on September 11 2001 the

whole world saw the horror and responded

to America's wicked enemies with

unwavering courage unbreakable spirit

and resolve that is deeper than oceans

fiercer fed fires and stronger than

steel last week I was honored to award

the

presidential citizens medal to an

extraordinary American Rick Rescorla

Rick enlisted in the Army at the

recruiting center in Times Square became

a great war hero in Vietnam and then

became head of security at Morgan

Stanley in the World Trade Center when

September 11th he saved 2,700 lives

immensely grateful to be joined by

Rick's son Trevor Thank You Trevor thank

you thank you very much thank you to

Trevor in every 9/11 family we pledge to

never ever forget the towering spirit of

strength that we see in this city lives

within the heart of every American

warrior from the snow Valley Forge to

the jungles of Vietnam from the forests

of Bella wood to the beaches of Normandy

from the mountains of Afghanistan to the

deserts of Iraq that spirit has helped

our fighters defeat tyrants conquer

fascism vanquish communism and face down

terrorism just a few weeks ago American

special forces raided the Isis compound

and brought the world's number one

terrorist leader to justice thanks to

American warriors al-baghdadi is dead

eyes on number three his reign of terror

is over and our enemies are running very

might of the American military in a few

weeks we will mark the 75th anniversary

of the Battle of the Bulge our nation's

bloodiest battles of World War two more

than 47,000 Americans were wounded and

19,000 gave their last breath for their

country we are proudly joined today by a

veteran of the Battle of the Bulge

a native New Yorker who is 94 years old

Jack enlisted in the Army right out of

high school he fought through brutal

months of the campaign in northern

France on Christmas Eve after marching

nearly 100 miles in the snow and

sub-zero temperatures he arrived outside

the town of Bastogne and Belgium for two

weeks Jack fought under ceaseless

artillery fire and helped push the enemy

back from a critical Road at one point a

mine blew up and it destroyed his

vehicle badly hurting many he was

wounded three times but he kept on

fighting after the Allied victory at the

Battle of the Bulge Jack fought for the

remaining nine months of the war across

the Siegfried line up the mosel river

through the Rhineland and all the way

across Germany until he reached the

gates of Ord roof concentration camp the

firts Nazi camp to be liberated that was

number one that was a big big event as

Jack has said about the Battle of the

Bulge when the chips were down and the

situation was desperate the American

soldiers stood up to be counted for a

brief moment in history these men held

our nation's destiny in their hands we

did not fail thank you very much

and corporal Foy we will forever be

proud of what you and your fellow

soldiers achieved for all of humanity

a battle of the Bulge veteran who has

since passed away

his name was Master Sergeant Roddie

Edmonds like so many of our veterans

rowdy never talked about the war Laura

never knew her grandfather story until

she embarked upon a school project about

ten years ago

rowdy was in the 420 2nd regiment which

was overwhelmed when the Nazis launched

their surprise assault he and his men

fought for 3 treacherous days before

being taken as prisoners of war after

they arrived at a prison camp the German

commander sent an order over the

loudspeaker the Jewish American soldiers

were all told to step out of line during

roll call the next day knowing the

terrible fate that would come to his

Jewish comrades rowdy immediately said

we're not doing that he said two orders

to have every American step out of line

with their Jewish brothers in arms

the next morning 1292 Americans stepped

forward

the German commander stormed over to

rowdy and said they cannot all be Jews

rowdy stared right back he said we are

all Jews here at that point the German

put a gun to rotties head and demanded

you will order the Jews to step forward

immediately or I will to shoot you right

now through the head

rowdy responded major you can shoot

but you'll have to kill us all the

German turned red got very angry but put

his gun down and walked away Master

Americans soldiers that day so proud to

be Jewish and so proud of our country
