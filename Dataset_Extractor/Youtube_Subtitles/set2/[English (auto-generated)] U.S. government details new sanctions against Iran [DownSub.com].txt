good morning everybody thank you for

being here today

just like to make a brief comment before

we talk about Iran sanctions I'm sorry

British saw that the Dow had 29,000 the

president's economic plans are clearly

working we're looking forward to the

China signing us MCA and a very strong

economy this year as previously

announced by the president we are

announcing additional sanctions against

the Iranian regime as a result of the

attack on US and allied troops first the

president is issuing an executive order

authorizing the imposition of additional

sanctions against any individual owning

operating trading with or assisting

sectors of the Iranian economy including

construction manufacturing textiles and

mining and let me be clear these will be

both primary and secondary sanctions the

EO also allows us to designate other

sectors in the future as Secretary of

Pompeo and me think is appropriate

second we are announcing 17 specific

sanctions against Iran's largest steel

and iron manufacturers set three safe

shells based entities and a vessel

involved in the transfer of products as

a result of these actions we will cut

off billions of dollars of support to

the Iranian regime and we will continue

our enforcement of other entities third

we are taking action against eight

senior Iranian officials who advanced

the regime's destabilizing activity and

were involved in tuesday's ballistic

missile strike secretary of Pompeo will

comment more on this today sanctions are

part of our commitment to stop the

Iranian regime's global terrorist

activities the president has been very

clear we will continue to apply economic

sanctions until Iran stops its terrorist

activities and commits that it will

never have nuclear weapons

now turn it over to secretary pump out

Thank You Steven good morning everyone

today President Trump is delivering on

the pledge that he made the day after

Iran attacked American forces in Iraq

there will be a series of new sanctions

secretary Newton just mentioned eight

senior Iranian officials that are

responsible for the regime's violence

both at home and abroad we're striking

at the heart of the Islamic Republic's

inner security apparatus these sanctions

targets include the Secretary of the

Supreme National Council and the

commander of the Basij forces

that's the regime's brute squad which is

in the last few months killed

approximately 1,500 Iranians who were

simply demanding freedom our action also

targets other senior leaders close to

the Ayatollah they've carried out his

terrorist plots and destabilizing

campaigns across the Middle East and

around the world they've employed

soldiers across the region's

battlefields they've trained militias in

Iraq Syria and elsewhere in the arts of

domestic repression today they're

accountable with murder and ma'am the

goal of our campaign is to deny the

regime the resources to conduct its

destructive foreign policy we want Iran

to simply behave like a normal nation we

believe the sanctions that we imposed

today further that strategic objective

our campaign is composed of diplomatic

economic components the deprive the

regime of billions in revenue that

regime has used to fuel death and

destruction across the Middle East and

all across the world

sadly the previous administration had

opened up revenue streams for Iran but

under our administration revenue oil

revenues are down by 80% and Iran cannot

access roughly 90 percent of its foreign

currency reserves and not even two weeks

ago president rouhani of around admitted

that our sanctions have cost around over

200 billion dollars in lost foreign

income and investment as long as Iran's

Outlawz ways continue we will continue

to impose sanctions finally I want to

reiterate president Trump's concern for

Americans and dual national citizens to

say

tained inside of Iran Iran knows they

these individuals have committed no

crime they know the charges against them

are fake we will do all that we can to

get each of them returned home safely to

their families but that will take just a

few questions Maury you said we didn't

know precisely when and we didn't know

precisely where that's not the

definition of imminent the president has

also suggested that there was some sort

of attacking plan against an embassy

perhaps several embassies can you

clarify that you have specific

information about an imminent threat and

did you have anything to do with our

embassies we had specific emanation

information on an imminent threat and

those threat stream included attacks on

US embassies period full stop completely

true those are completely consistent

thoughts I don't know exactly which

minute we don't know exactly which day

it would have been executed but it was

very clear Qasem Soleimani himself was

plotting a broad large-scale attack

against American interests and those

attacks were imminent against American

facilities including American embassies

military bases American facilities

throughout the region mr. secretary in

the initial hours after the missile

attacks on al Assad an airfield it was

believed that Iran may have taken steps

to avoid US casualties but then the

chairman of Joint Chiefs Mark Miller

came out the Secretary of Defense came

out other officials came out to say no

these missiles were intended to kill

Americans if it was Iran's intent to

kill Americans

does that not deserve some sort of

response I mean if somebody takes a shot

at you and they don't hit you simply

because you've done does that mean that

they weren't trying to kill you so I

look I'll defer to their partner defense

on the details but there's no doubt in

my judgment as I observed the Iranian

activity in the region that night they

had the full intention of caring killing

US forces whether that was our military

folks or diplomatic folks who were in

the region and I'm confident that the

response the president taken is

appropriate

president said we don't want war we want

Iran to behave like a normal nation the

reason that the Secretary of Treasury

are here this morning is to continue

this campaign our strategic effort to

get Iran to behave in a way that doesn't

continue their 40 year long effort to

terrorize the world do you believe that

the Iranians shot down a Ukrainian

International Airways plane and if the

Iranians shot that plane down

will there be consequences we do believe

that it's likely that that plane was

shot down by an Iranian missile we are

we're gonna let the investigation play

out before we make a final determination

it's important that we get to the bottom

of it I've been on the phone I was on

the phone with President Solinsky just

before I came here I was on the phone

with my Canadian counterpart they were

working to get their resources on the

ground to conduct that thorough

investigation we'll learn more about

what happened to that aircraft and when

we get the results of that investigation

I am confident we and the world will

take appropriate actions in response

just gonna comment on that the Treasury

will issue waivers for anybody whether

it's Americans or others that can help

facilitate the investigation additional

sanctions including on the fixed force

and secretary minuchin at that point you

said I think we've done more sanctions

on Iran than anybody and it's absolutely

working since then we've seen an

escalation and violence from Iran

shooting down the drone attacking the

embassy

a contractor who's killed US troops how

are sanctions keeping the United States

economic sanctions keeping the United

States United States interest more

secure I think we have a hundred percent

confidence and we are consistent in our

view that the economic sanctions are

working that if we didn't have these

sanctions in place literally Iran would

have tens of billions of dollars they

would be using that for terrorist

activities throughout the region and to

enable them to do more bad things and

there's no question by cutting off the

economics to the regime we are having an

impact and as the president has said the

fact that the Obama administration

turned over a hundred and fifty billion

dollars to the regime we think we

wouldn't be in this situation had that

not been the case just that it's

important to keep in mind what's taking

place in Iran today this country has

never been in the place that it is today

big challenging problems their budget

they're gonna fail by tens of billions

of dollars or cheating their revenue

before this year they've got real

challenges and figuring out how to make

difficult decisions do you under a DES

block do you pick Hamas do you under

eight the Shia militias in Iraq or do

you allow your people to have the

opportunity to live the life they want

and grow your economy those are the

difficult choices that the regime is

facing and you can see the protests

protests that we expect will continue

that will demand from the Iranian regime

that they begin to treat the Iranian

people in the way that they so richly

deserve and this administration will

continue to support those efforts as

well you mentioned secondary sanctions

here what is your message to our

European allies who continue to do

business with the Iranians and then

specifically if you can will this impact

the in

Tech's barter mechanism that was set up

by a number of European countries to

avoid US sanctions to continue to do

business without using the US dollar

sure thank you I think those are both

very important questions so let me first

comment on insects I don't believe

there's been any insects transactions as

we've made clear we are working on a

Swiss channel that we have approved for

humanitarian transactions we'll continue

to allow humanitarian transactions we've

warned insects and others that they will

most likely be subject to secondary

sanctions depending on how they use that

so that's absolutely the case as it

relates to the Europeans both the

secretary and I have spoken to our

counterparts in Europe several times

over the last few days we've emphasized

the impact and the issue of Iran has

announced that they are no longer part

of the jcpoa and we've had very direct

conversations with our counterparts

about that what is your definition of

imminent this was gonna happen and

American lives were risk and we would

have been culpably negligent as the

chairman of the Joint Chiefs assessed

said we would have been culpably

negligent and we now recommended the

president that he take this action in

Qasem Soleimani he made the right call

and America's safer as a result of that

we're gonna try to do a 5/10 for

everybody this event as many people can

get questions I don't mean to cut you

off but we're trying to go ahead I mean

we did from my colleague buddy

sir at six months ago secretary Obama

the president said that US intelligence

agencies had been running amok he spent

most of the past three years he's been

in office denigrating and attacking the

intelligence community and disputing

findings whether it's on Russia or North

Korea were really any area that

contradicts things that he has sent

perfectly why then should Americans

suddenly believe your assertions that

we've had good intelligence on this when

the head of the executive branch has

been casting aspersions on the

intelligence community for most of his

time in office

look I served as the CIA director for

the first year and a half of this

administration I watched the president

rely on the work that the intelligence

community did for the entire time I

served as the head of the Central

Intelligence Agency I've watched him

rely on the capable men and women who

are delivering exquisite information to

the executive branch watch the president

have confidence in that information we

all challenge their work we have to make

sure we get it right the intelligence

community is not flawless we we get it

wrong in this case the intelligence

community got it fundamentally right

even the reflections we've seen after

the effect after effect after this

strike the costume Suleiman took has

demonstrated that we were quite right

there was an imminent attack there was

active plotting and we took an action

that we thought was likely to create

less risk for the American people and

confident that we did US troops from

Iraq immediately if that the case can

you comment on that he didn't quite

characterize the conversation correctly

but to the larger more important point

we are happy to continue the

conversation with the Iraqis about what

the right structure is our mission set

there is very clear we've been there to

perform a training mission to help the

Iraqis secure

forces be successful and to continue the

campaign against Isis to connect in near

the counter - campaign we're going to

continue that mission but as the as

times change and we get to a place where

we can deliver upon what I believe and

the President believes is our right

structure with fewer resources dedicated

to that mission we will do so we also

have today NATO team that's here at the

State Department working to develop a

plan which will get burden-sharing right

in the region as well so that we can

continue the important missions to

protect and defend and keep the American

people safe while reducing our costs our

resources and our burden and the risk to

our soldiers and sailors who are in the

region today you said that the imminent

threat was a threat to US embassies who

didn't know precisely when or where last

night the president said it was a threat

to embassies including to our Baghdad

embassy why can you say that here and

the president could say it at a rally in

Toledo but no one said it to lawmakers

behind closed doors and a classified

setting as multiple senators have since

then we did we thought we told them

about the internet all of the

intelligence that we briefed that that

you've heard today I assure you in an

unclassified setting we provide in the

classified setting as well to be clear

you told them that embassies were the

source word to be targeted that was the

imminent threat I'm not going to talk

about the details of what we shared in

the class if I said it but make no

mistake about it those leaders those

members of Congress who want to go

access this same intelligence can see

that very same intelligence that will

reflect well I describe you in what the

president said last night

threats are never gone great it's always

a lot of danger in the world well always

always a lot of danger in the world

throughout the region no nobody believed

that a single mission in any respect

took down the risk of terror terror from

al Qaeda terror from Isis terror from Al

Shabaab no no one believes that

president doesn't look at the list

though look at the achievements in the

administration we took away the

Caliphate in its entirety we took down

Hamza bin Laden we took down al Baghdadi

we took down Qasem Soleimani this is a

list that has reduced the capacity for

terrorists around the world to perform

the functions that put American men

women and the homeland at risk were very

proud of what we accomplished we're

going to stay the course when we take

one more over there yes next Wednesday

to sign the face one part of that deal

but China is also a big importer of

Iranian oil and Iranian minerals and

that's a big part of their economy as

well so how do you balance did you want

are you concerned about the Iran issue

coming up in either the signing of the

phase 1 deal or the negotiation for the

phase 2 deal well let me just comment I

had no idea you'd ask that question but

that's a good last question to end on so

let me first say that we are looking

forward to the Chinese delegation coming

next week phase 1 is very significant it

includes very significant components of

changes to technology issues

intellectual property issues and 50

billion dollars or purchases for our

farmers I would comment I don't agree

with your comment that China is a big

buyer of oil the China state companies

are not buying oil from Iran and I would

just say we are having conversations

with China as well with any other

counterparty on sanctions evasion so

thank you very much thank you everybody
