was very clear very quickly a lot of

seniors are feeling left out in this

election we were inundated with emails

and also one fax some of the highlights

the candidates are totally ignoring

seniors seniors seem to have been put on

the back burner and all the politicians

seem to talk about her taxes never about

low-income seniors and then there was a

woman out of Courtenay BC who says she

retired with a small pension quote I've

paid heavy taxes all my working life but

now what I'm struggling sinking

invisible we decided to check in with a

group of seniors in Kingston Ontario the

rooms in this building at one point were

filled with desks and young boys and

girls it was an elementary school it

skews a little older today but just as

kids sometimes feel adults don't listen

to them

there's a sentiment at the Kingston

Senior Center that politicians aren't

listening to seniors I'm not sure that

their voices are being heard loudly

enough and I don't know whether the

parties are taking for granted that

they're going to vote because as I'm

sure you know seniors vote there is no

group more likely to leave their homes

next week and cast a ballot in the last

federal election Millennials had a

strong turnout they turned up at close

to 60% seniors were very near 80 that's

it but even among reliable voters there

is disillusion quite frankly I mean I

couldn't list everything that's been

said and promised but none of it ever

comes to fruition

no seniors are a vulnerable group there

are challenges with being on a fixed

income finding affordable housing and

even just doing what's going on here

getting out and being with other people

isolation is I would say that might be

at the top of the list for seniors

seniors are more likely to use the

healthcare system and as a result know

its limitations some question whether

Canada is ready for Canadians to get

older to me the biggest issue is the

sort of force that's coming the tsunami

they call it that's coming to the

healthcare system and it seems like

they're not prepared for the aging

population

now just as often as we heard seniors

worrying about

there are issues we heard them worry

about the issues of others I'm glad I

slept in a bed last night not everybody

did there was concern about the homeless

and First Nations and just a general

sense that seniors have their challenges

but they're not alone

children have troubles and middle-income

blessed people have troubles so troubles

are universal younger people tend to

look at seniors and worry about taking

care of them well it's pretty clear a

lot of seniors look at younger people

the exact same way
