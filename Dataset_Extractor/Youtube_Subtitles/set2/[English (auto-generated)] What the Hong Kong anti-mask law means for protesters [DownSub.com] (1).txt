as the current situation has clearly

given rise to a state of serious public

danger the chief executive in council

decided to invoke the power under the

emergency regulations ordinance and make

a new regulation in a name of

prohibition on face covering which is

essentially an anti mask law after

months of protests in the streets of

Hong Kong an attempt by the government

to force riders to remove face coverings

has seemingly backfired everyone was

wearing masks in response to it and

there was a lot of people that showed up

this emergency law actually dates back

to the colonial era which Hong Kong is

now choosing to enforce the move comes

after a police officer was caught on

camera from several angles shooting a

protester at point-blank with live

rounds this regulation targets riotous

or those who resort to violence the

reason protesters conceal their faces is

rooted in fear they hide who they are

because they're afraid their employers

could be pressured to take action

against them even for protective

measures like everyone's gotta wear

masks because of the tear gas the

rioting started over a now shelved

extradition bill but it's now turned

into an anti China campaign the people

of Hong Kong are angry about what they

see as Beijing's interference with their

independence police can now ask anyone

wearing a mask to take it off if they

believe this prevents them from being

identified with the exceptions being

anyone wearing these for medical

religious or professional reasons it

kind of just gives them more of a reason

to apprehend people whether they're

violent or even not take part of like

anything aggressive what is unclear is

if this law will actually stop the

violence I'm sure that the people who

are showing support are gonna wear masks

nonetheless
