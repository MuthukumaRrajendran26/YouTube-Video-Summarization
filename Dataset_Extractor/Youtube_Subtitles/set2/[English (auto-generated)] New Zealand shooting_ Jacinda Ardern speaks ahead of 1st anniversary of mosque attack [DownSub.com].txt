assalam alikum khuda

koto Couture welcome everyone I'm gonna

start with I'm just a few introductory

comments some comments reflecting on the

past 12 months and then I'm happy to

take questions I'm just a note for

domestic media I know there'll be a

range of other issues that you'll be

interested in we'll be providing a

separate briefing relevant to domestic

media and issues of the day after this

one so that we can predominantly focus

on March 15 for this one I want to begin

by first and foremost acknowledging the

Muslim community here in New Zealand not

only for the impact that events since

that day on March 15 have had on them be

friends their family in their community

but also the ongoing generosity that

their community has shown that I think

is exemplified by the fact that

memorials as such not traditional within

Muslim communities but from the time

conversations began between council the

government in the community here in

Christchurch they were very clear that

they acknowledged it was something that

the New Zealand public may wish to mark

and we're very open to the idea of a

memorial in order to allow other New

Zealanders to reflect with them that for

me is emblematic of the generosity we

have seen from the community ever since

that day Iran gives us a chance as a

nation to reflect on changes that have

happened within our legislation within

our support services and within our

country I thought I would begin by just

reflecting on some of the legislative

changes that have occurred many of you

will have been here in the period in

which we moved immediately to ban

semi-automatic weapons and

military-style semi-automatic weapons

and assault rifles in the aftermath of

March 15

that was something that was supported by

members of parliament across the house

and has meant that essentially those

guns used in the attack were no longer

able to be accessed in the way they were

prior to that day we have now removed

60,000 907 prohibited firearms from

circulation more than one hundred and

ninety four thousand two hundred and

forty five prohibitive parts have been

handed in and approximately one hundred

and 2.2 million was paid in compensation

as part of that buyback scheme that

however we always said was only the

first part of the work we wanted to do

to reform our gun legislation tranche 2

is currently having just emerged from

Civic committee having amendments made

before it winter back into the house and

I expect that will pass within the

coming weeks and months and will be that

next installment for us tightening up

our legislative regime for accessing

guns in this country New Zealanders I

think of once again reaffirmed that

access to firearms in New Zealand is a

privilege and a responsibility not a

right the Christchurch cor was also a

fundamental part of our response to the

events on the 15th of March in the

aftermath I remember standing before you

and many of you asked what it was we

were going to do an atomistic

legislation to try and prevent the kind

of aftermath we saw of millions of

uploads and copies of the horrific video

of the attack on the mosques being

broadcast globally what became quickly

apparent to me was that any domestic

legislation would not necessarily

prevent or stop what we experienced and

so began the work on the Christchurch

call we now have 48 countries three

international organisations eight tech

companies in support of that call it has

resulted in things like the crisis

response protocol an initiative which I

loosely describe as a civil defence

response

for attacks that are broadcast in this

way online sadly we have seen other

events abroad which have called for the

kind of coordination that we could have

used on March 15 as a result of the

protocol in that coordination in those

events where social media platforms have

been used to broadcast attacks the

circulation of those videos have been

far far diminished my recollection is of

a recent attack in Europe the numbers

were in the thousands as opposed to what

we experienced here in New Zealand also

the body traditionally known as the gif

CT the global intimate forum to

counterterrorism has had their mandate

expanded as a result of March 15 has had

their membership now include full-time

staff and an executive director is

currently being recruited that body will

continue the work of the Christchurch

Corps including the preventative work

and research around algorithms one more

example of the practical outcomes of the

Christchurch core work just yesterday

Twitter announced research that they are

doing in conjunction with researchers at

our target Aversa T how Twitter can be

used as a platform to encourage

discussion that encourages inclusivity

rather than the counter which we often

see on social media but it wasn't just

about what we did in our legislation we

were mindful immediately in the

aftermath that we needed to make sure we

were supporting those directly affected

by the attack the work to make sure that

we had individual case managers from the

Ministry of Social Development to

ensuring that no one was excluded from

support because of this status to

working hard to make sure that visa

status that the long-term stability of

someone's status in New Zealand did not

affect affect the support that they got

right through to ensuring that families

who lost for instance those who held

names on bank accounts right through to

the fact that many did not have anyone

who could drive in their family we

looked at every single need

try to address it we've provided budget

support driver licensing support and

training english-as-a-second-language as

well as financial support and support

with housing and critically of course

mental health Christchurch in this

region very sadly has experienced far

more than ever any community should ever

be expected to experience and endure

that's why we put additional funding to

the tune of 17 million dollars into the

Canterbury thb to help support some of

the Italian initiatives specifically for

the Muslim community the phone line one

737 which is our general phone line for

mental health and support received

roughly 13,000 calls in the three weeks

after March 15 and that provided

professional health and support for

individuals throughout New Zealand who

may have felt affected of course there

is also the work that we must do more

broadly as a nation we recognize that we

had a job to do and a responsibility to

support those who worship a New

Zealanders synagogues or mosques to make

their places safe to worship we created

a 6.8 million dollar safer community

fund which has been accessed by those

faith communities who have had

vulnerabilities at their places of

worship to improve security there we've

held dozens of Hui with Muslim woman and

you to hear their concerns and their

ideas for a safer New Zealand over 250

have attended some of those events

across New Zealand

we of course launched the Royal

Commission into the events of March 15

and we have learnings I know that will

come of that Commission's work we

boosted the funding of the office of

ethnic communities to rebuild the office

and ensure that it could provide

practical support on the ground

including through some of the people

I've met in recent days from the office

who continue to support the community

here and finally in April of 2019 we

established the Christchurch response

special visa it was a category for three

groups that was significantly affected

by the

attacks new zealand-based families and

which an immediate family member died

people living in New Zealand who are

physically injured in the attacks and

their new New Zealand based immediate

families and people living in New

Zealand who are physically present one

of the mosques at the time and their

immediate families of course that has

also meant making sure we give stability

importantly for the widows who did not

have permanent residency at the time of

those attacks as well a year on I

believe New Zealand and its people have

fundamentally changed I can't see how

you could have an event like this and

not but the challenge for us will be

ensuring that in our everyday actions

and every opportunity where we see

bullying harassment racism

discrimination calling it out as a

nation that is when we'll show that we

each individually have the role to play

and making sure New Zealand has

fundamentally changed for the better and

that is what we must do every day I'm

happy to take your questions you're

right I was in a van visiting travelling

to visit a school in New Plymouth I was

in the van was I the mayor of New

Plymouth and and some others who are all

part of the visit when I was handed the

phone and started getting initially

briefings from the Minister of police

now at that's at that point we knew

there was a shooter we didn't know how

many we didn't know if it was a

coordinated attack and at that point I

recall being told that maybe two or

three fatalities even at that point I

remember saying I need to I need to get

down to Wellington in fact I wanted to

go directly but at that point I was not

aware of the scale the magnitude was

probably when I managed to get to a

space where I could switch on the news

and I saw the images of the st. John

Ambulance as

rolling in and the scale of it and the

numbers then we're becoming clearer and

it was devastating oh yeah oh come on

the front end down the back

yeah go ahead

[Music]

yeah so answer that in two parts how

have we changed I think the awareness

the knowledge the understanding that was

built between New Zealanders and our New

Zealand Muslim community has been really

clear to me in the and the days that

followed the weeks and the months and

that in large part is because the

community opened the doors

I had New Zealanders telling me that

they'd visited a mosque for the first

time or had conversations about about

faith with those they were visiting with

and and that was that in itself was a

way that I think many were changed by

what happened on that day does it mean

however that we have reached awareness

across the country does it mean that we

have removed discrimination from our

community absolutely not but I think I

would like to think that there is

growing and common resolve amongst New

Zealanders that we wish to be defined by

what we are not as much as by what we

are and that I think is more pronounced

than ever as a result of March 15 on the

issue of covert 19 of course as you will

have seen from news today around other

events going on across New Zealand I

take these issues very seriously I take

the advice of our health officials very

very seriously and I've continually

requested the most up-to-date advice

their position has not changed on where

New Zealand currently stands in terms of

transmission we do not have community

transmission in New Zealand and so

that's the basis on which they have made

their decisions around mass gatherings

the very clear advice I'm continue to

give though is that if you feel unwell

do not attend the memorials on March 15

and for those who are attending making

sure that people of course acknowledge

close contact

college is very hard I accept in these

this environment and basic public health

sneezing into your elbow washing your

hands but I rely on that advice from

public health officials and because of

New Zealand's current status status

device they have given me look we

obviously have been willing to take on

board the advice that we're receiving

and the information we have and make

decisions as we need to you will have

seen that we've done that with Pacifica

in that case there are very specific

responsibilities we feel the knowledge

that we have about the number who are

coming in from the Pacific to visit and

then likely to exit again meant that we

felt we needed that precautionary

approach because of that specific event

but I am constantly checking them with

our house officials making sure we have

the latest advice on the best way to

proceed and that is what we've done in

this case I can't I can't see the basis

on which the the advice would change but

again we have been always been willing

to move to support and protect New

Zealand's public health and so you know

I won't rule that out entirely but I

can't necessarily see that happening in

the next 48 hours but I will always base

my decisions on the most up-to-date

information and advice

again every single case we've had

regardless we have treated exactly the

same in terms of contact tracing you

know we did have a case where someone

was not aware of their illness when they

attended an event we've still managed to

a hundred percent contact trace close

context for every case in New Zealand

and that will be the approach we

continue to take in the queue you'll

understand why I make a general comment

here New Zealand is not free of those

groups who define themselves as

extremists white supremacist those

groups exist here and the responsibility

we have to combat that not only their

existence but the precursors to that

existence continue my view would be that

there's much more that we can do and

those earliest stages what is it we do

to make sure that if we see bullying and

racism and discrimination in our schools

that we proactively and systematically

seek to address that because at the

moment so much energy of course an

agency responds absolutely going in to

acknowledging the aftermath but there is

much much more in my view we could do to

stop people being radicalized with those

views in the first place

yeah I'll come just into the front row

well you know it this event has not

changed our relationship this event here

has not changed our relationship with

Australia at all in fact you know I the

response from leaders in Australia and

supporting us through that period was

extraordinary and in every event sense

and so for that I want to be really

really clear you'll notice that it's not

something that is often commented on the

citizenship of the person in question

because for us it was actually about

acknowledging what happened here on our

soil and doing what we could to make

sure it never happened again

as for other countries I think probably

all I can do is reflect on what I said

the last time I had the chance to speak

not just sit on a domestic stage but

more broadly and New York and September

my viewers actually our comments know no

boundaries anymore

that leaders now have a stage that is

amplified beyond the domestic and that's

because of their we all have a

responsibility we all have a choice we

either promote ideas of inclusivity and

are careful never to blame groups when

we have challenges domestically or we

don't but my call on leaders is to

remember that your words travel your

sentiment travels there are no borders

anymore and the impact of what you say

can impact my nation as much as your own

yeah just here

no no because I can't imagine signing up

to anything that says you know eliminate

just a little bit of terrorism and

violent extremist content online it is

it is a larger aspiration but that that

has to be our aspiration we live in a

world now of course where this is our

new form of publisher these are our new

broadcasters and in my mind all the

christchurch calls does is our social

media platforms to enforce what are

their existing Terms of Service but to

do it in a much more effective

comprehensive way and I don't think we

should lose our ambition around what

that will mean and our expectations

should not change a second row I think

we have to treat the environment is

basically an ecosystem you know one of

the issues of course has always been

that there will be those who behave

responsibly lock up their weapons ensure

that they don't get into the wrong hands

but actually the even those who behave

in that way I have found that they have

through through various reasons had

their guns access taken stole them so

the more we're able to remove those from

circulation that has a knock-on effect

for those who still own those guns there

are now hefty penalties that will be

applied so there is no longer a buyback

option there is only a penalty for

continuing to hold those firearms and of

course we keep in mind that our police

okay doing an incredible job making sure

that they are also confiscating those

guns as part of their everyday actions

as well

yes yes yes if we reflect on the example

of Australia of course no one looks back

and says that they should never have

made their moves and I don't believe

we'll ever look back and say that we

shouldn't have made ours you know

essentially the guns that were utilized

in this attack now we've made a move on

in 60,000 of them have been taken out of

circulation so fundamentally yes you

know I also reflect oh I'm sure they

won't mind me saying it but I was

talking to some of our first responders

many of whom I'd I've met several times

before but one of them said something

new to me today they were amongst some

of the group that came in first from the

police to clear the building to make

sure that the shooter wasn't there

anymore and you can imagine they weren't

sure how many there were and his comment

to me was when he first walked in even

though he'd been told on comms that the

shooter had left he could not imagine

that there was only one just the scale

of what he saw in front of him he could

not imagine that one person was able to

do that and that was because of the

weapon that that person had and so I do

believe New Zealanders safer oh sorry

yes yes

yeah and I think that's a very fair

reflection in my mind remembering

remembering is not just memorials and in

fact that's something I think of

anything the Muslim community would want

us to think about it's not once a year

reflecting on an event it is if we stand

up and say that that is not who we are

it is demonstrating it every single day

and you know I'm the Minister for child

poverty reduction so we formed a

strategy on child well-being we want to

New Zealand to be the best place in the

world to be a child now I expected when

we did this work that we'd get a lot of

feedback about kids on child poverty

issues on things in the local community

that made a difference to them maybe

some comment on more time with mum and

dad what I did not expect that one of

the major things that came through was

bullying and discrimination kids just

want to be able to feel like they can be

who they are without being teased or

being excluded and yet that exists in

New Zealand there are things that we can

do every single day the way we teach our

kids the way we act in our workplace the

way we respond to bullies and racism and

discrimination and debt is what I think

that we can best do to honor the legacy

of those that were lost I've just come

you don't mind our skin around though so

- yeah well one of of course the things

that you will have seen is in the

release of our counterterrorism strategy

there is a very public acknowledgement

of the fact that these groups that along

side groups that perhaps in the past

have had more airtime in New Zealand and

abroad I would add and so there's that

end of the spectrum and I have no doubt

that we'll receive further commentaries

advice from the Royal Commission it's

the reason we set it up I expect that

they will give us greater guidance on

what more we need to do not just at that

end of the spectrum but as I've already

said if we want to

address issues that our children are

experiencing actually that's the place

where we see the foundations of

intolerance and hatred and so we need to

start there as well and so I think too

often we think about babies being

extreme events when actually the seeds

of them starts somewhere else and what

can we do to address those and in that

regard we have got a number of pieces of

work that do work in our communities and

with our children and in our education

system yeah hi Jackson oh no I reject

the second half of that question I think

you'll see once we make the final

announcements on the second tranche that

what we've been working through are

actually minor if you let me just finish

I think you'll see once you see the

final details of some of the minor

amendments that are being made that we

are as a government entirely on the same

page just to finish though I am

disappointed that more broadly we

haven't had support from all of

Parliament my viewers that actually

putting in place some guidelines about

what we expect from individuals who own

guns in New Zealand expecting them to be

of certain character a willingness to

register weapons this is all to make New

Zealand safer and I would have liked to

have thought that everyone in Parliament

could have got behind there what are the

proposed here are watered-down I can't

give you that assurance you will see

you'll see for yourself when they are

released but we are going to have

improved gun laws and that will be the

case once you see the details of those

minor what I consider to be smaller

movements

yeah well two parts I think I would say

in response to that one is the types of

weapons that you've been able to access

in New Zealand and of course that was

the element that we moved on very very

quickly and so they're essentially

covers off the access point to the guns

that were used in this attack the second

question then is around people's access

to licenses in New Zealand and that's

where we focused our second tranche of

reforms in my mind actually those

reforms have been a long time coming

the thought purported New Zealand was

decades old we just haven't been able to

build political consensus around the

changes that New Zealand needed and this

those changes for me because they have

time and time again being highlighted as

the ones we need to make I am confident

that they will make a difference to the

safety of New Zealanders and they're

much needed my concern also is that

without them we might have seen further

decline and we needed to of course stop

them everything that we do is in the

hope that it never does

everything and I know that that would

have been the focus for Australia when

they've had horrific events like this

everything we do of course is around

trying to ensure this never happens

again

and I would say not just in New Zealand

we've set our sights and trying to

assure it doesn't help for heaven

elsewhere as well I'll come down the

back and into it Harold

I'm not sure it would be fair to say to

label what has happened in that way as

loopholes and so on in fact the best

thing I think we can do is first and

foremost allow the space for the for the

court case to happen without prejudicing

that and then the Royal Commission

report every expectation will canvas

heavily because we sit in their terms of

reference we wanted to know was there

anything that could or should have been

done to have prevented this from

happening in the first place so I'm

going to leave that there

those comments for for that learning

that we'll have from the Royal

Commission on the issue of threats to

Illinois it feels unfathomable to me

that after everything that the Muslim

community of experience that we have

people who have a desire and are acting

on it to make threats against down with

some community after everything that has

happened and that is something that of

course we can't just stand up and

condemn we have to ensure the safety of

the community that's why we put in place

for instance at Community Safety Fund it

was a very sad acknowledgment that we

needed to private provide practical

support for greater security to be

installed at synagogues and mosques to

ensure the safety of worshipers that is

a very sad reality in something I wish

New Zealand never had to do I'm if you

don't mind I'm gonna go into substantive

Kovich it after the stand up of okay and

least it's relevant to the memorial sure

yep

no absolutely not let me be very clear

we have currently no community

transmission in New Zealand so the

Ministry of Health has continued to give

me the same advice that they don't

advise a need for the cancellation of

mass gatherings in New Zealand however I

New Zealand has a responsibility is the

gateway to the Pacific to do everything

we can to prevent any transmission or

any chance of transmission into the

Pacific because of course the impact on

their health system and the ability of

their health system to cope with cases

it would just be it would be hugely

damaging we've already seen what

happened with measles now I received

advice very recently that there was a

large number of people looking to a team

Pacifica coming in from the Pacific

Islands and then returning to the

Pacific Islands that was a risk that it

was no appetite for in cabinet because

of the responsibility we take so

seriously to the specific Pacific even

though we currently have no community

transmission here you will have petty a

few petty if I could just give Petiot

just explaining in the Ministry of

Health did not advise us that we needed

to cancel Pacifica their advice has been

absolutely the same their advice has

been that there is no community

transmission in New Zealand and

therefore no currently public health

grounds to cancel those events but the

advice I received was that we did have a

large number of travellers from the

Pacific coming in now one of the issues

we've got in our favor is our ability to

contact race every time we have a case

in New Zealand but that really is

reliant on those people continuing to be

in New Zealand self isolated New Zealand

and have access to New Zealand's health

system if we have individuals on large

scale as we do from Pacifica traveling

back into the Pacific I can't provide

that self isolation or that care it was

just a risk we weren't willing to take

even though the public health advice

hadn't changed and these were saw a

number of other events all around the

country as well

I'm gonna keep the covered questions -

after the stand up I'll keep the covert

questions and I'm happy to answer them

again and I've answered this question

I'm happy to take them after the stand

up which she'll be in attendance edges

to stay and to stay in social housing no

so yeah so without getting into anyone's

personal details some of those access

issues for social housing can depend on

someone's status which is why we tried

very hard to make sure we gave security

of status particularly through those who

had like for instance the widows so that

enabled them to access other services

there may well be cases of people whose

visa status haven't allowed them access

to public housing of course that won't

be widespread because we tried to deal

with that as much as we could in those

cases often now caseworkers are working

to support them into private as housing

instead and often cases actually people

are in private housing regardless

because of the availability but those

people have case managers who are

they're available and supporting to try

and find the right housing fit well

would that implies that implies that

actually social housing is a the only

option will be the best option sometimes

it's not housing is what we want to

support people into and many of the

individuals we've been working with will

be and had been going into private

housing because of the availability the

makeup of families and for instance

perhaps needing larger homes or even

making sure that we can quickly adjust

make sure housing is fit for purpose for

disabilities so that's that's the key

getting the right house regardless

yes we've had frequent contact and it's

not just being through me but through

officials and so on

for instance a number of events have

taken place we've had in Wellington at

the end of last year we had a protocol

exercise where NGOs and social groups

came together to to look at the

responses should we have an event like

this again and of course this the work

that the give CT is doing with officials

just you feel free to ask you something

yes are that workers know that workers I

mean network has not got done there's a

number of different streams where once

we have the gov CT and other working

groups established we'll continue that

work algorithms is an area specifically

we're really we're at the early stages

but there is no timeline for this

working there's no end point I expect it

to continue and I expect all nations to

continue to apply pressure no I still I

felt as uncomfortable Dean as I do now

talking about myself in this regard

because it's never been about me yeah a

last last one

rain not that's not my understanding I

believe it was simply an issue of the

weather but ultimately that was made

locally in terms of those who feel

unsafe to worship you know there are

things we can do to buildings there are

things we can do to security gates and

access points but for me people will

feel safe when they feel supported when

they feel that their community is

looking after them when they feel

they're not facing discrimination or

jibes in the street or you know comments

that make them feel unsafe and so we can

help support the physical but we need

everyone to help support the community

with that sense of security that they

feel day-to-day and they're a global

threat it's not just New Zealand all

right thank you everyone
