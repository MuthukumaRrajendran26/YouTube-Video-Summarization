we're deeply concerned by reported

violations of international norms and

standards on the use of force including

the firing of live ammunition against

demonstrators in Iran during the

protests that began on Friday and have

continued into this week we're

especially alarmed that the use of live

ammunition has allegedly caused a

significant number of deaths across the

country certain government officials had

confirmed certain deaths here in there

including as I said I had to look how

many who has spoken of a number of

people losing their lives but there are

there are increasing reports suggesting

that the numbers killed I'll certainly

in the dozens in at least two figures

some reports even higher so it would be

very useful to have a better clearer

picture but it's clearly very

significant very mmm alarming situation

and widespread across the country as

Iran is a state party to the

International Covenant on Civil and

Political Rights we call on the Iranian

authorities to respect the right to

freedom of expression and the right to

peaceful assembly and Association has

laid down in the Covenant which is a

binding international treaty we also

call on the government to immediately

re-establish Iranians access to the

Internet as well as other forms of

communication which allow for freedom of

expression and access to information as

so many other popular protests across

the world of Illustrated all too clearly

in recent weeks and months simply

responding with harsh words and an iron

fist raises a significant risk not only

of violating international norms and

standards but also seriously aggravating

the situation - everyone's disadvantage

including the government's protests of

this nature and on this scale are an

indication of deep-rooted and often

well-founded grievances that cannot

simply be brushed aside
