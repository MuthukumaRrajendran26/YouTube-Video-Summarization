there is sadness and grief in Ukraine

tonight as the bodies of the victims of

downed Ukrainian Air Lines flight 752

are returned to their native country the

world is still waiting to find out

exactly what happened in the moments

before the plane was shot down by Iran

and as Abigail Beeman explains there's

concern the Iranian government may be

backtracking on its promise to turn over

the black boxes at Kives Airport a

chance to remember eleven victims killed

on flight ps7 52 as their bodies

returned home in Montreal shared grief

at this memorial 57 Canadian citizens

were on the plane 29 permanent residents

we know 30 have now been buried in Iran

and the prime minister said this week

families want about 20 victims to come

home to Canada Armen more a table lost

his twin brother and sister-in-law

please go investigate and find what has

happened that night it was a necessary

steps to stand up for the families

Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister flew

to the cabinet retreat in Winnipeg

straight from his rare face-to-face

meeting with his Iranian counterpart I

stress that then I said you know Iran as

a pad to choose a door they go to the

pad of transparency accountability and I

taking full responsibility when you say

to the world you take full

responsibility that comes with

consequences but since he left new

reports emerged that Iran may not turn

over the black boxes for a third-party

investigation when Francois Philippe

champagne heard that he reached out

again in writing to push for it perhaps

the delay may implicate furthers the two

Canadian Transportation Safety Board

investigators who were on the ground in

Iran left for Ukraine Sunday after six

days examining the wreckage more are on

standby for when a decision is made

about the black boxes I mean I'm sure

there'll be a more of an update of what

type of work that needs to be done but

one thing I can assure you is we're

working very hard to making sure that

that the investigation that is going to

be conducted is going to be credible and

independent not a lot of answers as the

world waits for Iran's next move and

Canada doesn't have a lot of options

after years of economic sanctions and no

diplomatic relations with Iran
