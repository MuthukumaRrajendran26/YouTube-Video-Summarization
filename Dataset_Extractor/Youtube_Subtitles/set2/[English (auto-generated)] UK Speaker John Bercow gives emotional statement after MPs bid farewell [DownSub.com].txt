or questions to the Prime Minister but

Mr Speaker I know the whole house will

want to join me in recording that after

10 tumultuous years this is your last

Prime Minister's Questions and as befits

a distinguished former Wimbledon

competitor you have sat up there in your

high chair and not just as an umpire

ruthlessly adjudicating on the finer

points of parliamentary procedure with

your trademark Tony Montana scowl and

mr. speaker not just as a commentator

offering your own opinions on the

rallies you are watching sometimes a

survey can sometimes kindly but above

all as a player in your own right

peppering every part of the chamber with

your own thoughts and opinions like some

tennis ball machines I'm uncontrollable

tennis ball machine mr. speaker

delivering a series of literally

unplayable and returnable formerly

unreturnable volleys and smashes and

although we may disagree about some of

the legislative innovations that you

have failed

there is no diet in my mind that you

have been a great servant of this

Parliament and of this House of Commons

you have modernized you have widened

access that you have cared for the needs

of those with disabilities and you have

cared so deeply for the rights of

backbenchers that you've done more than

anyone since Stephen Hawking to stretch

time in this particular session

to the end of what must be the longest

retirement since Frank Sinatra

I'm sure the whole house will want to

join me in thanking you and hoping that

you enjoying your retirement the

soothing medicament that you

[Music]

Thank You mr. speaker

[Applause]

Thank You mr. speaker I hope you will

indulge me one moment while I say a word

about you I'm sure you will

I want to thank you mr.speaker for the

way that you've used your speakership in

the decade-long tenure you've had you've

done so much to reform this House of

Commons and our democracy is the

stronger for the way that you've done it

you have preserved for 10 years you've

given real power to backbenchers vastly

expanded the use of urgent questions

which has been overwhelmingly popular

with all government ministers and opened

up the number of emergency debates which

is even more popular with even more

government ministers and in the

traditions of the great speaker lens

than others you've stood up for

Parliament when it has to be stood up

for I think we thank you for that

because you've also carried that message

internationally as well in the role of

parliamentary democracy and Parliament's

holding government's to account and as

we hope to form a government in the

future we hope to be held to account by

Parliament as well thank you mr. speaker

can I on behalf of those of us on these

benches wish you all the best for your

impending retirement and salute you sir

for the way that you have stood up for

the democracy of this house in order at

this time of crisis that we've hold the

government to code we trust that you

enjoy your many passions in retirement

you'll always be welcome up in Scotland

and if you need to visit Li football

team as an antidote Arsenal you'll

always be welcome and Easter Road to see

these

mr. speaker let me mr. speaker wish

Englund all the best for the rugby Jase

winsome mr. speaker and from the Liberal

Democrat ventures can we wish you well

and congratulate you on a decade

particularly as a modernizing speaker

from topicality of debates to promoting

diversity within the staff of the house

to reforms to support parents who are

MPs you have helped to drag this

institution out of the past so that it

can face the future mr. speaker may take

the occasion of your last Prime

Minister's Questions mine to join in the

tributes to our own role in the chair

during your decade there have been

impressive nted attempts really to try

to at times increase the power of the

executive at the expense of this

Parliament and you have been very

formidable in maintaining the duty of

government to be accountable to this

house I trust your successor will try to

live up to a very considerable

achievement Thank You mr. speaker as

your former Deputy Speaker can I say

that nobody has sat in that chair who

has done more to defend and promote the

rights of LGBTI people in this country

and throughout the world and when so

many people live in fear of being born

the way they are I salute you thank you

Thank You mr. speaker I won't have never

known this place without you here and I

think it will be it well it's going to

be different it's a delight to see your

children here watching today because I

know that while you have a

responsibility to Parliament that you

take your responsibilities as a parent

incredibly seriously also we proceed

with a number of statements that need to

be made I would like to thank the Prime

Minister and colleagues for their kind

and generous personal remarks which are

greatly appreciated

I want to thank staff of mine past and

present who have given up their time to

be here today for the last Prime

Minister's question that I chair all of

them are people who've worked with me

for a significant period of time we've

had fantastic relations and a terrific

bond and I hugely appreciate the fact

that they've offered to turn up on this

occasion and in particular again I want

to thank my wife Savi and our three

children Oliver Freddie and Jemima for

the support stoicism and fortitude which

they've displayed through thick and thin

over the last decade I'll never forget

it and I've always be grateful for it

you
