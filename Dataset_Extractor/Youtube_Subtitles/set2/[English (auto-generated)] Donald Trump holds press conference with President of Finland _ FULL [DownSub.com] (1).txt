you're lucky thank you very much today

it's my honor to welcome president mean

it's tha of Finland to the White House

and mr. president it's wonderful to host

you once again in Washington we've

gotten to know each other over the last

period of time and it's been it's been a

great experience the President and I

have just concluded very productive

discussions on a number of exciting

opportunities for our two nations before

going further I want to express our deep

condolences over the horrific stabbing

attack that took place yesterday at a

college in Finland America is praying

for the victims and their families and

we send our unwavering love and support

the American and finished people are

linked by an abiding commitment to

self-government individual rights

democracy and the rule of law this past

May our country celebrated the 100th

anniversary of America's recognition of

the independent nation of Finland in

1919 as President Wilson wrote at the

time our recognition was prompted by the

sympathies for a cause similar to that

which caused our own Declaration of

Independence in 1776 a century after we

established diplomatic relations United

States and Finland remain united by

those same cherished values central to

this effort is our nation's close

cooperation on matters of security and

defense although Finland is not a member

of NATO save a lot of money

Finland participates in many NATO

missions and exercises and I'm pleased

that Finland is substantially increasing

its military

budget America and Finland are also

working together to advance stability

freedom of navigation and respect for

national sovereignty in the Arctic both

of our nations are committed to a secure

Arctic region free from external

intrusion interference and coercion

simply put we believe that the affairs

of the Arctic should be governed by the

actual nations of the Arctic and as you

know there are other people coming into

the Arctic and we don't like it and we

can't let it happen and we won't let it

happen the United States and Finland are

likewise partnering to ensure the

security of 5g networks it is critical

that we use safe and trustworthy

technology providers components and

supply chains

we welcome the establishment of the

Orosz Innovation Centre in Finland

Qualcomm has done a fantastic job with

that this Innovation Centre will greatly

expand American and Finnish businesses

and cooperation in 5g we're also glad

that the Finnish company Nokia it's a

great company a global leader in 5g

technology is developing its

cutting-edge products right here in the

United States at Bell Labs in New Jersey

across the United States foreign direct

investment from Finland totals over 10

billion dollars each year finishing

owned companies invest more than 120

million dollars in research and

development in America and expand our

exports by more than 1 billion dollars

just today Finnish Nokian tires opened a

new manufacturing plant in Dayton

Tennessee a 360 million dollar

investment that is creating hundreds of

brand-new beautiful jobs for a great

state Tennessee we love Tennessee

so they made a wise choice you never

lose when you go to Tennessee I

encourage other finnish companies to

increase their investments in the united

states there has simply never been a

better time to do business in america we

have passed the largest tax cuts and

reform

and also regulation cuts in the history

of our country we slash business tax and

we're fuelling job growth through our

record-setting campaign to abolish all

of those really terrible unnecessary

regulations we have plenty of

regulations but many of them we didn't

need we get rid of them the American

economy is booming wages are rising

incomes are soaring and unemployment has

hit its lowest level in more than half a

century we want finished companies to

join in America's extraordinary economic

revival so many countries are coming in

it's the hot place we have the hottest

economy in the world and it's the hot

place to be they all want to be here the

president and I are also working on a

way to improve international trade based

on the principle of fairness and my

favorite word reciprocity I hope that

Finland which now holds the rotating

presidency of the EU Council will

support our efforts to achieve a

mutually beneficial agreement with the

European Union we're gonna have to start

doing something with the European Union

because they have not been treating this

country right for many many years and

they know it and I tell them and they

know it America's trade deficit with the

EU has been averaging a hundred and

sixty billion dollars a year for many

many years

achieving more balanced and robust trade

flows would greatly benefit both Finland

and the United States we also appreciate

Finland's strong partnership in

combating predatory trade practices

worldwide including the theft of

intellectual property from trade to

security from travel to Commerce we are

immensely grateful for our close and

deeply valued friendship with the people

of Finland great people and we're now

working on a deal to sell a large number

of airplanes fighter jets hopefully to

Finland see how that works out but we

make the greatest jets in the world we

make the greatest missiles and military

equipment anywhere in the world nobody's

even close mr. president I want to thank

you again for visiting the White House

the history of our two nations is a

profound testament to the importance of

our independence and

resolve to defend it I look forward to

continuing to work alongside of you as

we safeguard our precious sovereignty

and build a bright future of hope

harmony and peace for the American and

Finnish people and thank you very much

for being with us at the White House and

the Oval Office we had a very special

number of hours appreciate it very much

thank you sir Thank You mr. president

first of all I will deliver your

condolences to Finnish people they do

appreciate that thank you

ladies and gentlemen before meeting I

had some spare time so I visited a

couple of museums here Michelle American

history the same American African

history and Museum of American Indian

history and in addition to that I had a

possibility of attending ceremony in

Arlington mr. president you have here

great democracy keep it going on we were

we had a very good discussion with the

president like you mentioned our

diplomatic relations are 100 years old

during that time we have Dillo developed

our cooperation a lot not only in

official meetings like this but American

and Finnish people scientists for

example meet each other

cooperating working together we have

quite a lot of cooperation in Security

section sector also in defence because I

think that we share the feeling that the

most important thing for the nation is

to karate security to its citizens

and that is the starting point for

Finland also to this cooperation I

wanted to take up with the president the

importance of transatlantic cooperation

well we all know Europe needs USA but I

say that USA needs also Europe we know

the price of everything we should

recognize also the value of everything

we share the same values democracy human

rights rule-based order and in that we

are very similar

Europe has in a way awakened during the

couple of last year's to understand also

more about security point of view and I

just want to tell you that in my opinion

the strong Europe we have the strong

partner you have the Arctic area you

know in ODIs in very North is becoming

more and more interesting like the

president said we both alongside with

six countries from the Arctic Council

and we are working heavily there are

surely possibilities like we have heard

the maritime routes are being opened

maybe there are also resources but there

are huge risks one of them is that we

should keep the low tension we are used

to have there and that is what we have

been discussing and I do appreciate

president's position to emphasize that

it is not a place for military but even

greater

jeez the environment and I'm very glad

that we started to talk two years ago in

this very house about black coal it is

not maybe the burst which causes climate

problems but it is everybody can

understand that if plaque comes down to

ice and and snow when the Sun meets it

it melts down and melting sea-ice in

Arctic is very crucial I used to say

that if we lose the Arctic we lose the

globe we had a couple of birds very

important ones on arms control we some

of us remember the first years of Cold

War in 1960s there was no agreement at

all just cold war we can't let the

situation return no agreement at all

about arms control and that is why it is

important to try to negotiate new

agreements and to continue the new start

agreement that would be a good new start

for for international cooperation on

that to end up with you mr. president

referred to five key issues I city as a

whole

we are very proud to have the excellence

of

of center of excellence of hybrid in

Helsinki USA has been very helpful in

that very many countries are working

there together to fight against the

future danger of hybrid warfare what

comes to to providers in that area I am

NOT very willing to point out any

country or company we are now maybe a

bit late from USA in you making a risk

assessment it will be prepared in a one

two weeks time and after that we are in

a place that we have to choose the tools

to protect us mr. president I want to

thank you very much for having a

possibility of meeting you here it is

very valuable and I found our

discussions very open very interesting

and keeping a lot to my little country

thank you sir before we take questions

something happened that's been going

been going on for many decades and we

came to a conclusion could I ask

ambassador pence to just come up for one

second and explain the importance of

what just took place because this has

been going on for many many years and

this is ambassador pence no relationship

to our great vice president hard to

believe nobody believes that but that's

true but I have been introduced as his

father as brother of cousin as uncle we

are friends

good afternoon the when I arrived in

Helsinki I've been a year and a half ago

there were stack of papers on the desk

one of a couple of which concerned

indigenous peoples from the southwestern

United States Arizona Colorado

including probably most predominantly

but it's generically I refer to them as

Hopi Indians they were one of the group

in 1895 a lot of their remains had been

excavated and removed along with about

500 artifacts to Finland and there

they've remained despite a lot of

activity to get him back and I'll just

jump to the end and say through the good

offices of our State Department in

particular president nice too and and

his entire team we've secured a mutual

agreement whereby all all of those

remains including a number of of

petrified bodies will be going back to

to be put back where they were buried so

it's special to us and I think it's

probably special to indigenous peoples

everywhere around the globe that we're

all concerned about paying appropriate

respect to those who have departed

before us so thank you thank you both of

the presidents for supporting this

thank you that's a great job mr.

embarrassed that's been going on for

many many decades so I just want to

thank you sandy

John Roberts mr. president

Thank You president initiative if I

couldn't sir I've got two pregnant

questions to ask you maybe I could ask

them separately to get a fresh answer at

the beach one the three house

intelligence three house committees that

are looking into the impeachment inquiry

gave notice today that they will be

sending a subpoena to the White House

for documents and other materials will

you cooperate with those subpoenas well

I always cooperate this is a hoax this

is the greatest hoax this is just a

continuation of what's been playing out

John for the last since my election I

would say if you want to probably will

find out soon but probably even before

my election this is a fraudulent crime

when the American people but we'll work

together with shifty shift and Pelosi

and all of them and we'll see what

happens because we did absolutely had a

great call with the president of Ukraine

it was a hundred percent you have the

transcript and then shift went up and he

got as the chairman of the committee got

up and related a call that didn't take

place he made up the language iPod to

believe nobody has ever seen this I

think he had some kind of a mental

breakdown but he went up to the

microphone and he read a statement from

the President of the United States as if

I were on the call because what happened

is when he looked at the sheet which was

an exact transcript of my call done by

very talented people that do this exact

word for word he said Wow

he didn't do anything wrong so he made

it up he went up to a microphone and in

front of the American people and in

Congress he went out and he he gave a

whole presentation of words that the

President of the United States never

said it has to be a criminal act it has

to be and he should resign and some

people even say it was treason but it

was a very sad thing just so you know

the call was perfect the real call the

call I made many people were on the line

I knew that because usually when I speak

to foreign

country leaders you can name any one of

them but when I speak on the phone I

know that we have many people listening

from various intelligence agencies my

knowledge I know all about it and so

this isn't something like oh gee I'm on

the line let's talk about a big secret

this is many people on the line I don't

even know how many we'll find out I

guess

but many people Mike Pompeo was on

though I didn't say anything he just

because they listen for both knowledge

and for security reasons and for lots of

reasons but the president of Ukraine at

the United Nations the other day and

previous to that he announced through

his spokesperson said there was

absolutely no pressure put on him there

was no quid pro quo at all and if you

look at this whistle blowers which I

have a lot of respectful whistle blows

but only when they're real his report of

the phone call was totally different

than the fact but what got them was they

never thought I was going to release the

call because I don't like doing that I

don't want to do I hope I don't have to

do it again release phone calls to

foreign dignitaries to foreign leaders I

don't want to do that John I don't want

to do it again but I did it with the

permission of the Ukrainian government

we got permission we called up their

representatives and asked them would it

be ok otherwise I couldn't have done it

and if I wouldn't have done it I would

have been exposed to a lie because the

whistleblower report didn't he say seven

or eight times I said quid pro quo in

other words you're gonna do this or

you're not going to get money now in all

fairness Buyten said it and he's on tape

in all fairness you have at least four

United States senators Democrats that

said it and they said it a lot stronger

than even Schiff and his made-up story

said it Obama when he was dealing with

the President of Russia met Putin he

said hey tell flat Amir I can do a lot

more after the election you remember

that you didn't make a big deal out of

that everybody thought always in that

cute isn't that cute my talk and my

response Lindsey Graham said I never

knew you were that nice I can't believe

you were that nice he said that loud and

clear

it was perfect it was perfect not a

thing wrong with it to impeach a

president over a fraud that was

committed by other people that want to

win an election in 2020 which they won't

is incredible this is the greatest hoax

now it's gone on for a long time we had

the Muller collusion delusion okay that

went on for years and that's finally

done no collusion no obstruction no

nothing it was a joke and everyone knows

it and it was from the day one now I get

three days of peace and I'm walking into

the United Nations gonna meet with the

biggest leaders in the world and I hear

about the word impeachment they said

what did I do now and it was about a

beautiful conversation that I had and

just remember this the Ukrainian new

president a fine man said I don't know

what you're talking about there was no

pressure and he said it a number of

times okay what's your second question

just but you shouldn't be answering

asking two questions well you're gonna

want to answer me a favor

ask ask one of the I will finish the one

you want to ask John square ask one of

the finish president can I come back to

you because I think you'll want to talk

later sure what sounds like it might be

a good question let me see if I like the

question go ahead there may be for the

first time in three years I'll have a

good question and I love it there is a

report that came out just before you and

president Initiative walked out here

that the whistleblower met with a staff

member of Adam Schiff prime I love that

question being filed it shows that

Schiff is a fraud and I I love that

question thank you Joe can I finish

asking yes there's nothing to finish so

so the whistleblower according to this

report met with a member of staff adam

shifts staff you've got it right there

you know it I hate to say it's a New

York Times I can't believe they wrote it

your response to maybe they're getting

better your response to the fact that

that happened and the shift may have

learned some of what the whistleblower

knew prior to the complete it's a

scandal that he knew before I go a step

further I think he probably helped write

it

okay that's what the word is and I think

it's I give a lot of respect for the New

York Times for putting it out just

happened as I'm walking up here they

handed it to me and I said to Mike I

said whoa that's something that's big

stuff that's a big story

he knew long before and he helped write

it too it's a scam it's a scam just to

finish on this I appreciate it I love

that second question by the way should

have asked at first but but let me just

tell you the whole thing is a scam

the Muller deal was a scam the Russian

collusion was a scam

you can ask Putin nobody's been rougher

on Russia than Donald Trump

okay now with that being said it'd be

great to get along with Russia and we

will get along with Russia because it's

smart but nobody's been tougher on

Russia than Donald Trump

okay s1 please yes president Nene so

good to see you again you had a

conversation with President Trump about

5g and how Nokia finland's big company

could fill in that space you also met

with Chinese President Xi during the

summer in which you renewed the ties of

friendship between the two nations do

you believe that countries particularly

Western countries that put Huawei

equipment in there 5g cores are at risk

of national security

thank you like I told already in Europe

the situation is may be a bit different

from that here because the company you

mentioned is inside Europe partly at

least what European Union is now doing

is making a risk assessment asking each

country what kind of experience what

kind of what you have seen and found out

and that will be well finished in week

two or two weeks time and after that we

have to decide together

in the European Union which kind of

tools we need to protect ourselves you

refer to my discussions with the

presidency we didn't talk about five

sheep while meeting and we all know

Nokia is a major factor in this area

they will answer for themselves

thank you please example it was really

nice know this person

fitties I think they're all nice and

Finland all that Finnish reporters just

- okay did I wait a minute yes and I

have one question for a president Trump

and one question for president kneestr

first mr. Trump how will this political

storm affect the US foreign policy

especially its relationship with Finland

and second for for personal Minister

because this is the biggest issue here

at the moment I have to ask what kind of

favors has mr. Trump asked from you or

the other way around you mean what

favours I asked storm I think you mean

the other way around

both ways okay so the political storm

I've lived with it from the day I got

elected I've done more and this

administration has done more than any

administration and the history of this

country in the first two and a half

years I'm used to it

for me it's like putting on a suit in

the morning people have said to me how

does he handle it rush limbaugh said I

don't know if any man in America that

could handle it

Sean Hannity said the same thing others

have said the same thing I don't know

any man in America because it's all a

fraud and because of that and because I

know that I'm right and because I'm

doing a great job for the American

people I'm very very happy living the

way I'm living I thought that I would

finish off the first term without the

threat of people making false claims but

this one turned out to be incredible

all because they didn't know that I had

a transcript done by very very talented

people word-for-word

comma 4 comma done by people that do it

for a living

we had an exact transcript and when we

produced that transcript they died

because you look at the whistleblower

statement and it's vicious vicious and

that whistleblower there's no question

in my mind that some bad things have

gone on and I think we'll get to the

bottom of it I think it's going to be a

total reversal but I've lived with this

I've lived with this cloud now for

almost three years more than that

because it probably started even before

and I think nobody has done what I've

done when you look at tax cuts and

regulation cuts and rebuilding our

military and right to try right to try

that means people that are terminally

ill and very sick have the right to use

our medicines are great medicines

because we're so far ahead of every

other country so many things that we've

done our vets are now taking care of we

got choice nobody thought we could ever

get choice that's when you have to wait

on line as a vet you go outside you get

a doctor we pay the bill you don't have

to wait for three weeks to see a doctor

of your event we cherish our vets at

least this administration does but for

many years they didn't but I take care

of the vets no administration is done

and I've lived with it from the day I

got elected so I'm just fine with it

ok yes we had a conversation and

discussion when a very equal basis which

is I really appreciate that

well I had one request specifically I

wanted the president to take more notice

on transatlantic relations because I

consider it's useful both for USA and

Europe while we were discussing also

trading I told the president that the

big purchase we are doing on fighters

will be finished in two years time we

have five different candidates three

from Europe and two from United States

he also that ours is best Jeff go ahead

thank you sir

Jeff Mason from Reuters mr. president

I'd like to ask you about your use of

the word treason

you used it repeatedly in the last few

days

do you consider anyone who opposes you

geminus no I consider when they lie when

they stand stand before our great body

in our great chamber and they make up a

story that's fiction

like shifted he took that perfect

conversation I had with the Ukrainian

president and he made it into a total

lie it was a total fabrication and you

do admit that it was a total fabrication

he said this is what and the only ones

that don't like my conversation are the

ones that never read it but they heard

shifty chef that's what I call a lie and

because of the fact that he's he's lying

about the President of the United States

and as to what the president says you

know I believe it or not I watch my

words very carefully there are those

that think I'm a very stable genius okay

i watch my words very very closely and

to have somebody get up and to totally

fabricate a conversation that I had with

another leader and make it sound so bad

it was so evil and now I see this that

just came out minutes ago where he met

at a time that was impossible to have

done unless this corruption involved and

just you know we've been investigating

on a personal basis through Rudy and

others lawyers corruption in the 2016

election we

investigating corruption because I

probably will I was going to definitely

but I probably will be bringing a lot of

litigation against a lot of people

having to do with the corrupt

investigation having to do with the 2016

election and I have every right to do

that because the way they've treated me

and other people they've destroyed

people they've destroyed their lives

with a phony charge that never existed

and that was collusion never existed and

you had 18 people that hated Donald

Trump and you had Bob Muller that hated

Donald Trump and in the end they

couldn't find one damn thing I could

find it on you they couldn't find one

thing about Donald Trump having to do

with collusion this is after two years

and spending forty two million dollars

and I've been looking at that long and

hard for a long period of time how it

started why it started it should never

happen to another president ever but

I've been talking about it from the

standpoint of bringing a major lawsuit

and I've been talking about her for a

long time we've been investigating the

corruption having to do with what they

did to my people

they destroyed many of people many

people they came down to Washington to

do a great job and they left home they

left Washington dark they were dark they

came down here I say bright-eyed and

bushy-tailed they wanted to do a great

job for the people they wanted to do a

great job we won the election and then

they get served with subpoenas all these

subpoenas now look at Nancy Pelosi Nancy

Pelosi hands out subpoenas like you know

she has to approve it she hands out

subpoenas like their cookies you want a

subpoena here you go take him like their

cookies Paul Ryan would never give

anybody a subpoena he wouldn't give him

when Mark Meadows went in to talk he

wouldn't give him when Jim Jordan went

in when Devin Nunez he would go in and

then see Paul I'm not saying wrong or

right but Paul Ryan no let's talk about

it that's a big thing to give a subpoena

let's talk about it two weeks later

they're still talking they wanted

subpoenas to investigate the corrupt

Democrats and the corrupt people on the

other side Paul Ryan would not give

subpoenas

Nancy Pelosi here you go take it who

wants a subpoena every day you get

subpoenas and Paul Ryan was actually

right probably because they should never

ever allow a thing like this to happen

to our country again thank you very much

please mr. president can you just make

clear right here

what do you or what did you want

President zalenski to do with regard to

Joe and hunter Biden if you look at what

he said okay and he brought it up I

think he brought up the name Rudy

Giuliani what I want is the following

and I've said this loud and clear we

have our ambassadors here we have Mike

Pence here why are we the only ones that

give the big money to the Ukraine we

give money to Ukraine and it's bothered

me from day one and you have plenty of

people just here I say how come it's

always the United States that gets

ripped frankly Ukraine we want to help

them and I do like the new president you

know why I like him because it was

honest because he said there was no

pressure at all exerted on me

meaning him by the President of the

United States she said it by the way

that one sentence should stop this but

he said there was no pressure exerted

but you don't have to ask him all you

have to do is read the transcript read

the telephone call but what I was having

a problem with the two things number one

Ukraine is know before him for

tremendous corruption tremendous more

than just about any country in the world

in fact they raided one of the most

corrupt countries in the world and I

don't like giving money to a country

that's that corrupt number two you don't

like I said excuse me number two I said

the following and I said this loud and

clear to everybody and in fact Rob

Portman backed me up and there's nobody

more honorable than Rob Portman of Ohio

because he called up please let the

money go I said Rob I hate being the

country that's always giving money when

Ukraine helps Europe and the European

countries far more than they help us

they're like a wall between Russia

Europe there like a wall there a big

wide beautiful wall and he said you know

what but it's important and he in fact

he came out and he said that this was my

only reason because I don't like being

the sucker country we were the sucker

country for years and years we're not

the sucker country anymore but I gave

the money because Rob Portman and others

called me and asked but I don't like to

be the sucker in European countries are

helped far more than we are and those

countries should pay more to help

Ukraine ask a question thank you sir

look Biden and his son our stone called

crooked and you know it

his son walks out with millions of

dollars the kid knows nothing you know

it and so do we go ahead ask the

question the question sir was what did

you want president Solinsky to do about

president vice-president Biden and his

son hunter yeah it was just a follow-up

of what I just asked you sir we have the

president of Finland ask him a question

I have one for him I just wanted to

follow up on the one that I asked you

which did you hear but if you want you

hear me yes ask him a question I will

but my Avenue a long answer ask this

gentleman a question don't be rude

no sir I don't want to be rude I just

wanted you to have a chance to answer

the question that I asked everything

it's a whole hoax and you know who's

playing into the hoax people like you

and the fake news media that we have in

this country and I say in many cases the

corrupt media because you corrupt much

of the media in this country is not just

fake it's corrupt and you have some very

fine people two great journalists great

reporters but it to a large extent it's

corrupt and it's fake ask the president

of Finland to question place okay I'll

move on now mr. president in your

opening remarks you said to President

Trump that you had been to some museums

today and that you respected the US

democracy and encouraged him to continue

it are you concerned that that's not

happening and my second question to you

sir is the WTO rule today in favor of

the United States saying that the United

States can now impose tariffs on your

peon Goods because of illegal subsidies

against Airbus it was a big win for the

United States right it was you never had

wins with other presidents did you but

we're having a lot of wins at the WTO

space that started I think 10 or 15

years ago

excuse me it Windsor now because they

think I don't like the WTO and they want

to make sure I'm happy because all of

those countries were ripping off the

United States for many years they know

that I'm wise to it we've had a lot of

wins this was a 7 billion dollar win not

bad but I think the Chinese form the

question sir is if you're concerned that

the president will impose those tariffs

and the effect that that may have on the

economy yes first of all men are a third

to your democracy I just wanted to tell

that I'm impressed

what American people have gained during

these decades hundreds of years building

up very impressive democracy so keep it

going on to w-t oh I have a lot of

respect to multilateralism and to

international institutions so WTO has

given now a decision which is well quite

tough with Europe but I just say that

the WTO has said its opinion and that's

that I just want to finish by saying

it's an honor to be with the president

of Finland he's done a fantastic job

very popular beloved over in Finland the

WTO has been much better to us since

I've been president because they

understand they can't get away with what

they've been getting away with for so

many years which is ripping off the

United States and please remember the

president's last remarks that we are a

great democracy we are a great the

United States is a great democracy and

I'm airing what I'm airing because we

are in fact a democracy

and if the press were straight and

honest and forthright and tough we would

be a far greater nation we would be a

far greater when we don't have the cnn's

of the world who are corrupt people

thank you very much everybody
