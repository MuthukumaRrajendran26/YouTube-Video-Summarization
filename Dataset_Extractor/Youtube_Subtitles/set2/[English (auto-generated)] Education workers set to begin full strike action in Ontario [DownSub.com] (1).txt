the union representing 55,000

educational workers say they are

prepared to walk off the job we have

team coverage with critical information

you need to know parents but we're gonna

start with this

what would a full strike mean for

students and parents right now under the

work-to-rule campaign custodians have

stopped cleaning hallways and emptying

garbage cans outside schools clerical

workers have stopped finding

replacements for absent staff and

education workers have stopped overtime

on Monday if no deal is reached the

55,000 union members will all walk off

the job

so with teachers cross kewpie picket

lines the union says that is under

discussion in which case schools may

have to close altogether

also in question what would a strike

mean for the polling stations located in

Ontario schools for the October 21st

federal election the union says it is

not their intent to interfere with that

Minister when did you find out that QP

intended on taking job action on Monday

ramping this up to a full fledged strike

effectively twenty to thirty minutes

before they went live does that set a

precedent for good faith bargaining when

you know you do come back to the table

you know what I wish that we've had a

bit more notice perhaps but the end of

the day I think that this is an

avoidable circumstance I mean QP

introduced some partial withdraw of

service though the century on Monday you

know 48 hours later they've announced to

ramp this up and I think we all have a

lot of question marks about why do you

think this has anything to do with the

federal election assemble notes that the

day of the strike action is on the first

election debate English language debate

I mean curious but I don't really want

to make any conclusion at this point I

just want to make sure that they

understand that my mission is to get at

the table you went to private school you

don't have a lot of experience or any to

my knowledge when it comes to labor

negotiations why are you the best person

suited to be dealing with this issue you

know what I got into politics because I

believe we need generational voices in

government

so what do you say to that ei out there

who's watching this and making $40,000 I

thinking to themselves

mr. leche doesn't know what I go through

on a day-to-day basis well you know I

did go to say Marga Marie I did was

educated in a Catholic public school for

elementary but I obviously don't profess

to know the struggles and challenges

they faced I realized they work hard the

big sticking point is sick days or you

have a hundred and thirty-one sick days

paid by taxpayers and there are some

people that think this is a government

that is cutting cutting cutting and not

really looking at where they're cutting

when it comes to supports for autism

services health care and on your file

and on education what do you say to

those people to convince them that that

is not the case

I made unabashed offender of public

education I want families to know I will

fight hard to the kaepa table as I know

the premier believes it is hard to

defend their kids futures and those are

just talking points no I think I've

already demonstrated word indeed I've

reopened the capital program that's

helping to improve schools by half over

half a billion dollars this year alone

we're undertaking a new revamp of math

going back to basics a new curriculum

being introduced next September I mean

these are actions thanks appreciate up

Travis will the four government consider

calling back the legislature early to

deal with this issue I don't really have

a clear answer on that one Alan right

now I did press the minister a couple of

times asking him whether or not that

would be on the table he certainly did

not say it's off the table but said that

he wants to get a deal with negotiating

with the Union right now and he said

that these offered some days although he

wouldn't clarify what days they would be

back at the table we did see last year

if you remember Alan OPG a workers that

went off the job and the legislature was

recalled to legislate them back to work

so certainly it is an option whether or

not that happens we'll have to find out

before October 28th that is when the

legislature is set to resume
