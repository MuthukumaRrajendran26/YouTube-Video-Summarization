a greeting between two defeated MPs

heading in to face colleagues for the

last time I think today is really about

saying thank you to the people who have

done a remarkable job serving this

country whether or not it was for one

term or many we really want them to have

the opportunity to speak I think there's

a message there that there has to be

communication better communication and

in terms of what the government's do and

I think the message from Canadians is

look there's a mix of parties back here

now party is the new minority government

we'll have to work with people were

obviously concerned about economic

uncertainty that is the the issue that

was that was raising the anxiety across

Western Canada the biggest loss a

liberal wipe out in Alberta and

Saskatchewan including veteran Minister

Ralph Goodale many anxious to hear from

him today and learn about what went

wrong but as for whether he'll help the

next government in some capacity going

forward I'm always anxious to help in

any way I can and I'm not pitching for

any particular role the Prime Minister

knows he needs to do something to work

with the west and Quebec where the

Liberals lost seats too I've been

reaching out to premiers to mayor's to

business leaders to colleagues and

former colleagues on there's a lot a lot

of work to do to make sure that we're

governing for the entire country

but no decisions or details yet such as

whether Trudeau would appoint a Quebec

left tenant like Prime Minister's past

it's really up to the Prime Minister to

decide until Eve that the house and for

the 20 odd new faces in the room today

is about learning how can I be a good MP

would probably be the place I where I

would start that's what I want to learn

first and foremost liberal sources tell

Global News Trudeau could face a

slightly different caucus this time

around one more willing to stand up and

push back in part because of the

weakened minority result and in part

because so many of them rookies in 2015

now have four years under their belts
