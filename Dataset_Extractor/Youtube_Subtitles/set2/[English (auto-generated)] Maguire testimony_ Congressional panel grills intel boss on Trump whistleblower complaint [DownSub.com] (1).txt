anybody in your office leaked this to

the Washington Post or NBC News ranked

you remember I leave the intelligence

community we know how to keep a secret

do you solemnly swear or affirm that the

testimony you will give today shall be

the truth the whole truth and nothing

but the truth so help you God

you would concur would you not director

that this complaint alleging serious

wrongdoing by the president was credible

it's not for me to judge sir the it is

from you it is for you to judge

apparently I mean I agree it's not for

you to judge you shall provide it to

Congress but but indeed you did judge

whether this complaint should be

provided to Congress and we can we at

least agree that the Inspector General

made a sound conclusion that this

whistleblower complaint was credible

that is correct that is in the cover

letter that's been provided to other

committee I believe that's also be

public the decision and the

recommendation by the Inspector General

that in fact the allegation was credible

is it okay for a president to pressure

any president to pressure a foreign

government for help to win an election

it is unwarranted it is unwelcome it is

bad for the nation to have outside

interference when you read the complaint

were you shocked at all by what you read

Congress when the conference women

excuse me they said I had a life

experience I joined the Navy I

understand your record could you tell

what is I I realize the I realized for

well full and well the importance of the

allegation and I also have to tell you

congressman congresswoman when I saw

that I anticipated having to sit in

front of some committee some time to

discuss it you don't believe the

whistleblower is a political hack do you

director I believe that as I said before

mr. chairman I believe the whistleblower

is operating in good faith well then

they smile the law they couldn't be in

good faith if they were acting as a

political hack could they mr. chairman

my job is to support and lead the entire

intelligence community that individual

works for me

therefore it is my job to make sure that

I support and defend that person you

don't have any reason to accuse them of

disloyalty to our country or suggest

they're beholden to some other country

have you no sir absolutely not I believe

that the whistleblower followed steps

every step of the way however the

statute was one in this situation

involving the President of the United

States who is not in the intelligence

community or matters underneath my

supervision did not meet the criteria

for urgent concern I'm just asking about

the whistleblower right now I think the

whistleblower did the right thing the

end result will be that the

whistleblower will be able to come

before this committee and Congress and

have the full protections of the whistle

after all what is the whistleblower a

statue for if not to provide those full

protections against retaliation against

litigation congressman I am doing

everything to endeavor to support that

with the gentlewoman yield yes um

director I do I have your assurance that

once you work out the security

clearances for the whistleblowers

Council that that whistle blower will be

able to relate the full facts within his

knowledge the concern wrongdoing by the

President or anyone else that he or she

will not be inhibited and what they can

tell our committee that there will not

be some minder from the White House or

elsewhere sitting next to them telling

them what they can answer or not answer

do I have your assurance that the

whistleblower will be able to testify

fully and freely and enjoy the

protections of the law

director McGuire this appears to be the

first intelligence community

whistleblower complaint it has ever ever

been withheld from Congress is that

right sir a congressman Carson and I

believe that it might be and once again

I said in my statement it is in fact as

far as I'm concerned unprecedented

you believe that the whistleblower was

operating in good faith I do and without

bias I don't know about that I do not

know about that I do believe that but

you have no reason to believe that he or

she was acting with bias correct I just

believed that the whistle blow

was acting in good faith but you have no

reason to believe that the person was

biased I would not know whether he bias

or not by a sir I just don't know

whistle blower says I have received

information from multiple US government

officials that the President of the

United States is using the power of his

office to solicit interference from a

foreign country in the 2020 US election

you would agree that should be

investigated would you not Chairman the

horse has left the barn you have all of

the information you have the

whistleblower complaint you have the

letter from the IC IG you have the

office of legal counsel opinion yes but

anyway yes we do but would you agree

that if there is a serious and credible

an investigation that you agree there

should be an investigation I believe

that it is a matter to be determined by

the chair and this committee
