there is no cheaper way to reduce

greenhouse gas emissions other than

carbon pricing it relies on markets it's

flexible carbon pricing is used in more

than 50 countries around the world but

Canada's carbon tax imposed on several

provinces last spring has proved a tough

sell this time go to your local gas

station first

the Conservatives just released this

attack ad here you'll pay 31 cents a

litre more it relies on misleading

numbers based on a hypothetical scenario

where a government relied solely on a

carbon tax to reach Canada's emissions

targets something none of the parties is

proposing Justin Trudeau he costs you

more we also know that the overwhelming

majority of Canadians are going to be

worse off with this carbon tax but in

reality around 80% of Canadians actually

stand to make money from the tax an

average household in Manitoba for

example can save around $100 through a

government rebate the important thing

about this program is all the money gets

rebated back to households and

businesses several provinces are also

fighting the carbon tax in court

Ontario's premier forcing gas stations

to post these stickers on their pumps

the risk of a carbon tax recession is

real but economists say that's also

untrue a government report found the

current carbon tax will have almost no

impact on Canada's GDP growth by 2022

it's going to depress activity in

industries that generate more carbon and

it's going to help grow other sectors of

the economy
