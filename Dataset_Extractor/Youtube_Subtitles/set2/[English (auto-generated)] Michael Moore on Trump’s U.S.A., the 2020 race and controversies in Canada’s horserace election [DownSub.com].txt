you have this affinity for Canada why is

that I I don't know I I think it's it's

like on the way here I thought I've got

to help somehow here I've got a I've got

to help our neighbors and I thought well

one thing I could do is bring back an

American who's trying to become your

Prime Minister so if I get to meet Mr

Shearer while I'm here you know I will

encourage him I will speak to his

American side and tell him that we

desperately need him back home right now

you want it to be a Canadian citizen at

one point still still on the radar well

I don't know I I don't want to be a

Canadian citizen but I would like a

passport you know just a insurance

policy in case sort of thing

you're obviously in tune with Canadian

politics what do you think of our

current campaign well it's it's

confusing to Americans because of the

four main candidates you have a white

man in blackface you have a Canadian who

was also an American did the blackface

turn you off I was so disappointed you

and you and you do understand that mr.

Trudeau is beloved in the United States

in large part because he's everything

that Trump isn't so in contrast you have

a prime minister that goes to the

airport to welcome refugees that come

here

you-you-you he seems to have a kind

heart you know he cares about his people

these are all things that we now no

longer have it's interesting that great

moment where Trudeau and Obama had lunch

together in that diner or wherever they

were and you look at that and I remember

people saying at the time Oh Canada now

has their Obama

someone who cares someone with a heart

someone for peace and goodwill so it was

just sad to see that and I think I guess

my first thought was actually what is

wrong with white people and white guys

especially what seriously what is this

that white guys especially in their

youth mmm want to dress up as a person

of color it do you think he should still

remain as Prime Minister that's up to a

human to the Canadians that's really

wrong for an American to say anything

about what you should do but I'm sure he

feels very bad about it he didn't he

didn't he seemed to cop to it and but

you can't get a good explanation out of

a Kenya I mean you can't I mean you can

say he was young but I was that age and

never in a thousand years would I have

ever thought of doing something like

that so you know but he admitted right

away I'm a child of privilege white

privilege you know I noticed that you've

become more of a political commentator

so let's talk about the impeachment

inquiry is this this phone call to

Ukraine's president is this what America

needed that Muller couldn't produce it

is really fascinating that robert muller

spent two years a dozen or so

prosecutors investigators everything and

and could not do anything to dislodge

trump in fact Muller Mulder's

investigation was so weak in the sense

that it produced facts that we already

knew

and he was unable to even get an

interview with Trump he couldn't force

Trump to sit down and be questioned Bill

Clinton had to be questioned but Trump

see people laugh at Giuliani and Trump's

lawyers guy named Ty Cobb but they

clearly were geniuses in some weird

sense because they protected trunk from

ever having to answer a question under

oath from the prosecutor and it looked

like he must have felt relieved the day

of Muller's

testimony we had all thought Muller and

we had never been really in front of the

cameras or the microphones during the

investigation so we imagined this

mythical character the strong g-man with

the broad shoulders investigating the

the criminal president Trump and then

and then all like The Wizard of Oz you

pull back the curtain and he's sitting

at the table and four or five times the

the members of Congress had to he

couldn't find the microphone that was

right in front of him it was sad

director Muller of the microphone is

right there oh oh he he over a hundred

times said I can't answer that I don't

want to get involved I don't want to Wow

it was shocking and it must have been

shocking to Trump and Trump sat there

and watched that July 24th the phone

call to the president of Ukraine was

July 25th the very next day

Trump wakes up after a breakfast of KFC

he's bullied he's he's feeling strong he

really he beat the g-man he beat them

all and in his arrogance wasn't even

knowing that a dozen people were

listening to the call and were witnesses

just went ahead and and broke the law

and invited a foreign leader to

interfere with our elections he you

predicted that he would win the 2016

election how did it get to that well

six months before the election when I

tried to tell my fellow Americans that

Trump was gonna win and he was gonna win

by winning Michigan Wisconsin and

Pennsylvania nobody wanted to hear that

plus it sounded crazy how could this

idiot win look at Hillary Clinton may be

the smartest person ever to run for

president or in the top five at least

how could she lose how could we lose I

said well because I live in Michigan I I

see what's going on here people are

angry the Michigan voted for Bernie in

the Michigan primary Wisconsin voted for

Bernie in the Wisconsin primary I

already saw it

people didn't want the old guard that

gave the industrial Midwest the crummy

life that it's living and been living

for the last couple of decades so

absolutely for sure

you know I knew Trump was gonna pull

this off only because of the anger

amongst the voters is he gonna repeat a

victory in 2020 if you would ask me that

question two weeks ago I would have said

yes if the election were today Trump is

going to win the Democrat next year is

going to get even more of the popular

vote than Hillary Clinton got but but

not the electoral college now after he

has so brazenly committed and what I

think is an act of treason so publicly

mm-hmm and admitted it I don't even know

if he'll be on the ballot at this point

who is the natural Democratic candidate

to beat him well I think there's four or

five the could be two but beating Trump

is not enough Hillary beat him beating

him isn't well we have to do you have to

crush him who the question is is who is

the person who absolutely would crush

him today without a doubt and I don't

know if it's any of the 19 that are

running I mean there's a couple that I

obviously if you know my politics that I

like a lot Bernie and Elizabeth Warren

and and Biden could beat him and and

maybe even Buddha judge could beat him

Kamala Harris could beat him but beating

him isn't enough to win the electoral

college

so so in order to absolutely crush Trump

like if you want to absolutely make sure

that Trump is going to lose I'd be

running a beloved American and in my

mind that person is Michelle Obama if

everybody as soon as I say that anybody

they go oh yeah and then right away they

all she wouldn't like yeah yeah but

that's what she said I saw her first

appearance at the bookstore in New York

back in November when her book came out

that's what she said not going back to

1600 Pennsylvania but in the months

since she continued her book to her she

extended it because she started because

they had to move her into arenas she

never did a book story she had to be in

15 thousand seat arena in the Midwest in

the south

she is a beloved American and would

absolutely crush drama you've said that

the candidate has to be anti-trump

aren't all Democrats anti Trump yeah

it's not enough to be anti Trump you

have to share to be for something you

have to show Americans a huge contrast

between yourself and Donald Trump in

order to win this election if if

Democrats are just gonna run on the

negative of I'm not Trump

wow that's pretty disappointing that's

such a low bar you set for yourself of

course you're not trunk who is Trump to

be Trump you have to be without empathy

without a conscience you have to be a

narcissist of such a magnitude that I

don't know when we've seen anybody like

this do you think Joe Biden could be

your guy you said that he could alienate

the progressive side of things I like

Joe Biden I've met him a couple times

he's he's he's a good guy we need to

inspire the Democratic base people are

very depressed there is a malaise across

the land and next November third you're

from a little over a year from now we

need a person who when you the American

voter wake up in the morning you can't

wait to get out of bed to go vote for

fill in the blank you gotta think who is

that person that's gonna inspire people

not the hard core not two people that

always vote but I'm talking about mm-hmm

the Democratic base excuse me I'm

talking about the Democratic base that

often times doesn't doesn't vote that's

we've got to bring out the American

electorate next year seventy percent of

those who are eligible to vote are

either women people of color or young

adults between the ages of 18 and 35

that's the Democratic base so what can

be done to first of all pick a candidate

that's going to inspire women people of

color and young people to not only go to

the polls but bring five to ten people

with them that's what we should be

thinking about that's the strategy okay

let's talk about your films you've drawn

Canada into your films right Bowling for

Columbine sicko what is it about us that

you think we're doing right probably the

main reason Canada is in most of my

films it's only 60 miles from Flint you

know it's it's a half a mile across the

river from Detroit it's just easy to get

a crew and go over there you know we're

visiting for the day we we just came

over to get some Tim Hortons and then

head back but you know get some filming

done no I look the United States is very

fortunate to have right on our very

border a country that structures itself

differently than we do in ways that have

a deep regard for our fellow human

beings Canada is not perfect it has many

problems I mean you don't need to listen

to those from an American but let me

tell you what you do have you actually

believe that when a person gets sick

they shouldn't lose their house that's a

Canadian value people are actually

pausing right now thinking did he what

did he say we mean lose your house

that's inconceivable here in this

country because because you believe

that's a human right you will not join

us when we want to go

invade other countries you actually

believe that peace is the better path

than war than killing and speaking of

killing you do actually have a lot of

guns mostly hunting you know rifles and

shotguns it's a big nation of hunters so

why aren't those guns being used to kill

each other

why don't canadian any given year how

many gun murders are there in Canada 150

250 out of a nation of we think that's

high and there are malls there are calls

to ban handguns in this country ya know

and and you should actually put - even

to get a handgun permit in this country

it's it's difficult you can't just go

into Walmart and buy a handgun there's a

process you have to go through here so

when you take your film like Bowling for

Columbine do you think you have affected

change in the US have you changed

policies and made it a better place

well it's a very good question I know

that my films over the years have

educated a lot of Americans teachers

show my films in schools a lot so a lot

of young people have grown up thinking

about things like guns or healthcare or

capitalism in a different way so I know

the effect that that has had and I know

why people come to my movies and why

they come in larger numbers than you

would say to a

you know a nature documentary or

something like that so I think I'm it's

a good question I'm I'm very

self-critical so I I think of it

sometimes as you know I made this film

about General Motors in Flint and where

are we

we're still you know President Obama and

never should have given General Motors

back to General Motors you know after

the government took it over I mean they

could have given it back with the

mandate you could have your company back

if you start building cars without the

internal combustion engine if you start

building light rail and bullet trains

and transportation for the 21st century

that General Motors could do what so we

don't have we still have an enormous

amount of gun violence as this evident

every day every week and and we have

Obamacare but 30 million people still

don't have a card if I walk around

British Columbia today how many

thousands would I find without a British

Columbia health care card you know not

that many probably maybe nobody no adult

because it's a right so we don't have

that still what I what I say to my

fellow Americans is that that and why I

often put Canada in my films is I'm

trying to tell Americans we need to be

more Canadian like we'll be a better

people if we are we don't have to give

up our Americanism we just we just have

a neighbor who's kind of showing us they

could mentor us a little bit it's okay

it doesn't take away our we're number

one it just you know that candidate with

no Canadian want somewhere on say we're

number one you know look it's just like

they're just there to show us there's a

better way to do things it's not perfect

but it is better
