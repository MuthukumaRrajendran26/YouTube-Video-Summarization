British Street artist Banksy appears to

have given his hometown a gift just in

time for Valentine's Day

the mural shows a small girl with a

slingshot and a splatter of red flowers

it's on the side of a house in Bristol

England a city about two hours west of

London as crystal commencing explains

Banksy's art often plays with elements

of darkness and joy and this piece is no

different

Marsh Lane is getting a whole lot of

love we were just working around the

corner and then someone was saying that

all covers the new banks around the

corner so yeah just immediately spoken

off work

surely lots of people left work early to

see the new Banksy and more will be

flocking to this Bristol England

neighborhood although some worry how the

piece will fare with the storm in the

forecast a lovely surprise really nice

yeah yeah just driving down the road to

go and do some shopping and there it was

sad stuff and have a look it's just

amazing amazing yes but is it about love

it did appear on Banksy's Instagram page

on the 14th Bristol is reportedly his

home but little is known about one of

the most recognizable names in street

art we do know he is a master at making

people gasp remember this

nyancy is one of a kind you know where

he's not the be-all end-all you know

he's a it's very clever artist yes for

his messages self-expression fills every

inch at Leake Streeter Banksy tunnel in

2008 the space under Waterloo station

was transformed by the mysterious

painter when he hosted the Cannes

Festival

Banksy's work can be found all over

including around the corner from the

Global News London bureau we went to the

back to the exhibition that way so that

when they had the dismal land and we

were just driving past it saw so

everyone here so we thought we'd stop

and have Hook along gaze and a few

pictures maybe the point of this

Valentine's Day Banksy is to get people

to spend time together doing something

that costs nothing Chris toga Manson
