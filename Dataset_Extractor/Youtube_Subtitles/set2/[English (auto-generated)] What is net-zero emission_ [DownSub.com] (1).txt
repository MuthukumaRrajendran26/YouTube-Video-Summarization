you may have heard of the term net zero

emissions and discussions around climate

change which is being driven by

increasing amounts of greenhouse gases

in the atmosphere primarily caused by

fossil fuels and agriculture to slow

down climate change agencies are pushing

for what's known as net zero emission

which is when the amount of emissions

put into the atmosphere equals the

amount being captured for example let's

say a hundred tons of carbon dioxide are

being discharged into the atmosphere by

a company that company needs to take

action to offset that carbon dioxide

like planting trees
