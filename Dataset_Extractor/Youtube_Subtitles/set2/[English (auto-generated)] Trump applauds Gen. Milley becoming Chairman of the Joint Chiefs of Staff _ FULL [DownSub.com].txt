thank you very much for being here

fellows thank you very much and I see a

senator that's so supportive of our

Dan Sullivan thank you Dan of Alaska

done a great job as we prepare to

welcome a new chairman we must first pay

tribute to one of America's most admired

and beloved military leaders outgoing

chairman Joseph Dunford here today with

his wonderful wife Ellen Joe hails from

just outside Boston his father was a

Marine and a tough one who landed on

Incheon and Korea and fought at the

Chosun reservoir so Joe knew which

branch he was destined to joint he

didn't have too much of a decision to

make I think what do you think in 1977

he was commissioned into the US Marine

Corps in 2003 Joe commanded some of the

first American troops in Operation Iraqi

Freedom and very very successfully

commanded them for his exceptional

bravery he received the Legion of Merit

with combat valor as a general Joe was

promoted so quickly that he was

nominated for his third star before he

had formally

- second how do you do that how do you

do that Joe in 2013 he was named

international security assistance force

command in Afghanistan and he was

instrumental in strengthening Afghan

security forces to share more of the

burden and today they are indeed sharing

much more of the burden in 2014 Joe

became Commandant of the Marine Corps

and the next year he was named chairman

of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and in that

role Joe published the first joint

military net assessment in 20 years we

have a lot of the ideas that we've

brought forward and you know we've spent

2.5 trillion dollars since I'm president

two point five trillion dollars far more

than this country has ever even thought

about spending but we had to have a

modern great military with the most

magnificent and the finest machinery

planes boats ships weapons of all kinds

we've never had anything like you have

today when I took over we were a very

depleted military and today we're a

level that we have never even come close

to Joe solidified America's competitive

advantage through global integration of

the joint force he also provided

critical leadership during the complete

rebuilding of our military and he helped

me in another way something that

probably only Joe and Ellen really know

because in I would say 2015 i sat with

Joe at a dinner and believe it or not I

was getting a big award from the Marines

and Joe was presenting the awards and I

had no even thought of running for

president and I said to my wife and

family look at that guy he's

great-looking guy isn't he

it's like central casting he's like

right out of Hollywood but he made the

great presentation that night and I got

to talk to

because I sat with him and Ellen and his

son Patrick and I was asking Joe lots of

questions about the military he said you

really enjoy this don't you I said well

I just love our country it's very

important to me I love our country I

said I don't know what do you think

should I give it a shot this was before

it was public he was one of the first

people I asked I said what do you think

you think I'd have a shot if I get it

we're gonna rebuild that military it's

gonna be stronger than ever before and

he helped me form an opinion he gave me

a lot of information and he has ever

since so for that I want to thank you

and Ellen and I want to thank Patrick I

hope I got his name right it's a long

time ago but I think his name was

Patrick right did I do good but general

Dunford also provided vital strategic

direction to the campaign against Isis

in Iraq and Syria with his help and the

great courage of our war fighters I'm

proud to say that the ISIS territorial

Caliphate has been 100% completely

obliterated when we came to office it

was a mess it was all over now we have

thousands of captured Isis fighters and

we have 100% of the Caliphate as

chairman Joe has also been a strong

supporter and crucial advocate for

creating the six branch of the US Armed

Forces something that I'm really proud

about and something that when I make

these big speeches in these massive

arenas loaded up with people thousands

and thousands at just about gets the

number one line of applause because I

say we're creating the space force and

the place goes crazy great popularity
