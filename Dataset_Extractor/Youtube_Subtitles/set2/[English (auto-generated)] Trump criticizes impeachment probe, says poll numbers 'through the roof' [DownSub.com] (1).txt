well I think they follow the leader

one thing with the Democrats I give him

credit for it a lot of them don't want

it you know that you interview them a

lot of them are they should they call

them from districts where I won and then

they won after when I wasn't running but

I'm going to win a big if you look at

what's happening with my calls they're

through the roof you know why because of

this phony which I if you look at what

happened with the fundraising we set a

record the Republicans because people

are sick and tired of it I got a call

the other night from pastors the big the

biggest passage evangelical Christian

they said we have never seen our

religion or any religion so electrifies

they are they say they've never seen

anything like it

churches are joining hundreds of

thousands of people and you know that to

logic says because of you and your

partner the Democrats the hosters you

think it'll pass out and die in the

Senate well I think this I think that we

have great we have a great relationship

in the Senate I have a 95% approval

rating of the Republican Party I believe

the Senate that I haven't spoken to that

many senators but I believe the senators

look at this as a hoax it's a witch hunt

it's a disgrace should have never

happened

just like Russia delusion delusion

should have never happened that was do

it John and just like that Jenna never

happened so I think in the Senate I

think they feel that the Republican

Party has just read it very very badly

now in the house they have the majority

they all vote with AOC and and +3

Nancy Pelosi petrified of them

she's afraid she's going to lose their

position Nancy Pelosi will lose her

speakership right after the election

when the Republicans take over their

minds because we have no right the way

they're doing it they've taken away our

right so if they proceed and you know

they'll just get their people they're

all in line because even though many of

them don't want about they have no

choice you have to follow their

leadership and then we'll get it to the

Senate if we're going to win the

Republicans have been very unified this

is the greatest witch hunt in the

history of our country so we beat the

one that started immediately we went

through two years to follow and that

came out like a ten who came out perfect

and a few days go by and they start this

nonsense and this is just as ridiculous

so the Democrats unfortunately they have

the votes they can vote very easily even

though most of them many of them don't

believe they should do and I do believe

I do believe that because of what

they're doing with Pelosi and and their

real leaders AOC plus three that's their

real leaders I really believe that and

they're going to pay a tremendous price

at the pole and we saw the first glimpse

of it two weeks ago in a great state

North Carolina we saw a great great

glimpse of what's going to happen

energy Pelosi said we'll be a Ewing

as everybody knows we've been treated

very unfairly very different from

anybody else if you go over a mentally

history I didn't go over any aspect of

life you'll see how unfairly with the

traitors

we've done a fantastic job everything to

me is about corruption we want to find

out what happened with 2016 and as you

know there's a lot of work going on to

that I don't care about fights campaign

but I do care about corruption this

campaign that's up to him politics

that's up to them I don't care about

politics politics is I think I made

clear and yesterday somebody asked me a

question and I gave an answer but always

in the form of corruption what I want to

do and I think I have an obligation to

do it probably a duty to do it

corruption we are looking for corruption

when you look at what Biden has done it

and when you look at other people what

they've done and I believe there was

tremendous corruption with Biden but I

think there was beyond

I mean beyond corruptions having to do

with the 2016 campaign and what these

lowlifes did to so many people hurt so

many

in the Trump campaign which was

successful despite all of the fighting

us I mean despite all of the unfairness

though we are looking at corruption

we're not looking at politics I don't

know somebody said that a long time ago

was that in 2017

tell me what

all I can tell you this when I speak to

barn leaders I speak in an appropriate

way if we notice they don't mention the

call that I had with the president of

Ukraine they don't mention that because

it was so good the only time they

mentioned it was when Adam Schiff made

it up he talked about Pinocchio's that

should get pension obviously made up he

made up the story it was a phony story

Adam Schiff so they don't talk about

that anyone you know when this came out

it was quick broke whoa

well there was also yesterday the

Ambassador who I heard was tremendous

and a tremendous person he was a hundred

percent for what we're saying a hundred

percent and if you look he also said

there was no quid pro quo that's the

whole ball game
