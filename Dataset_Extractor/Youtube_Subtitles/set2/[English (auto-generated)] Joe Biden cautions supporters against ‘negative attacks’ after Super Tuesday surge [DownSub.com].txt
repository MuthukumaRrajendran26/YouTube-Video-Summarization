folks it's gonna be very short and I

just wanted to come down and I began by

thank you everybody for being here Miss

America thank you thank you so so much

for your 1ng support going all over the

country for me and it means a lot folks

you look I want to thank everyone we had

a great night last night

tremendous support from all across the

nation with with victories in Texas

Virginia and North Carolina Arkansas

Alabama Tennessee Massachusetts and with

just this morning we heard one may as

well well know it's gonna be a while

before the final results committed

California but those of you who love the

knock down those of you who have been

counted out this is your campaign this

is your care penny look we're gonna

bring together all Americans we did that

you showed that last night regardless

you race your gender or your disability

your ethnicity Democrats Republicans

independents

I'm very stripe they're really mean it

this is what we have to do it

this is a momentum unify the nation

that's why either the race in the first

place to unify this country so we

welcome all those who join us all those

who want to join us and build a move and

this is a movement then we need that

movement to beat Donald Trump in the

build of future we all know is possible

you know I'm especially proud of our

campaign is generating so much

enthusiasm driving up voter turnout

across the nation this idea that we

didn't have a movement look at the

results look at who's showing up we are

bringing out this campaign

behind me of bringing out people who

have not participated and it's way up

way up and it sort of turns to me that

positive progressive vision we have been

provided for the nation is resonating

resonating all over the country to make

sure health care is affordable and

accessible everyone to make sure that

every child gets a quality education

regardless of the ZIP code in it and and

to take on and beat the NRA and the gun

manufacturers which promise you I would

do and not only protect Social Security

but what I've been calling for some time

increasing benefits for those who are

seniors in that that our need now after

they've lost a spouse in there and we've

essentially run out of their coverage

because they were living long thank God

and securing it for every generation

that follows that's the proposal we put

forward and take on the existential

threat of climate change you know yes

ma'am and you know creating in the

process will create over 10 million

good-paying jobs not 15 bucks an hour 45

50 bucks an hour with benefits that's

just gonna happen and those people who

may be displaced for this process

they're the ones we're going to get

those jobs I was proud I was proud to

serve as President Obama's vice

president for for eight years and what

we were able to accomplish but from

passing Obamacare to the work we did to

help rescue the auto industry and and

nations economies where everybody kind

of forgets my mother used to have an

expression see the greatest ability got

David kind wasn't willing to forget and

then she'd say if that weren't the case

one would only had one child and we were

just getting ready we had just gotten

economy up and running again in a big

way and we were about to rebuild the

middle class in a way that we should be

building and now we will we were taken

we took on the climate change everything

was just beginning but we know we have

so much more do we have to put in a

bigger broader vision for this nation

and make it happen and but first first

we have to defeat Donald Trump and so we

have to keep Vincent policy as a speaker

in order to do that we have to also win

the Senate back and that's how we're

gonna this vision do I have to the

future that's how I'm gonna be able make

it a reality you know what we can't

double that happen in the next few weeks

let's let this primary turn you know

campaign to negative attacks the only

thing that that can do is help Donald

Trump and it doesn't do anything help

any one of the candidates or less than a

campaign trying to keep our eye on the

ball and the eye on the ball is to

reclaim the soul of this country I

believe people understand the bubble

burst the Donald Trump poses an

existential threat to our standing in

the world

it really does it they have to know that

he's fanned the flame they'll know he's

fanned the flames of a paid and sought

to divide us they've watched it in soul

insult our allies and embraced

demagogues he's embraced dictators

at the same time our alliances are

weakened without any question every

lines he had has been weakened and I

know that if we give this man another

four years through the White House and

forever and fundamentally change the

character this nation we can't let this

happen

that's why from the moment I entered

this race I did say where the battle for

the soul of this nation and we are now

it's on Michigan Mississippi Missouri

Idaho we want the code Washington State

we're gonna take this fight all across

America to rebuild middle class to give

people an opportunity that's been denied

that one lately this oppression and the

you know the next president I've said

many times has to be able to he or she

has to bail on the first day that there

are like the president they're sworn in

stand on the stage and they're gonna

face a divided nation and a world of

disarray they have to be able to know

what they're doing I know what I want to

do I really make it clearer and clearer

to all people in this country to me now

and election day and I believe we have a

significant opportunity significant

opportunity to move this country to

convene in the 21st century unlike we've

had any opportunity before I really

believe that with every fiber might be

it's the folks as I've said from the

beginning characters on the ballot

I don't be the character the candidates

character

so I'm looking forward to it and again I

thank you all I'm not going to take any

questions I'm sure you all have

thousands of them and you get a chance

to ask me a lot of those we go along I

just wanted to make a statement before I

before I headed out I'm doing another

move here and I want to thank you all
