right well Donna this is something a lot

of experts call a crisis but we got

emails from people who are living it one

of them a gentleman from Pemberley

Nareesha Columbia it's about two hours

north of Vancouver a gentleman who says

he's stuck in an old trailer basically

because everything else is unaffordable

what we decided to check in on it he

doesn't want to complain and Terry

O'Connor has a pretty good job he's a

truck driver two local quarry but this

trailer is about all he can afford well

I've got five people living in five

hundred and forty square feet and you

know I've got two animals so I can't go

anywhere now new housings going up in

and around Pemberton all the time

Whistler's just a half hour south and

it's booming it's just not affordable

rents have exploded to the point even a

one-bedroom apartment can go for about

$2,400 a month you know how are you

gonna afford that that would blow

O'Connor's budget you can't and then

you're spending you know 60 80 percent

of your paycheck on housing how are you

gonna live well that's a struggle felt

across Canada what was once a big city

problem spread to the suburbs and now

even further budgets are strained to the

point about 800,000 households are

spending more than half their income on

rent paying too much on rent really has

become the new normal for Canadians in

small mid-sized and large communities

right across the country it took a while

to get this bad back in the 90s

developers saw more money in condos and

turned away from building new rental

apartments add to that a growing

population and more people priced out of

buying homes supply fell way behind

demand rents skyrocketed and salaries

didn't I think that as housing prices

and rents have gone up raw incomes have

remained relatively flat the parties are

promising to build new affordable

housing with things like incentives to

developers but the

end of this crisis isn't around the

corner

even once a project is is approved it

can take two three four five upwards of

seven years to get those homes built

that's terrible I mean it's it's for me

it's the number one issue O'Connor makes

no bones about it as he told us in his

original letter his boat will go to

whichever party quote blows the housing

horn the loudest Donna all right Mike

Armstrong in Montreal thanks
