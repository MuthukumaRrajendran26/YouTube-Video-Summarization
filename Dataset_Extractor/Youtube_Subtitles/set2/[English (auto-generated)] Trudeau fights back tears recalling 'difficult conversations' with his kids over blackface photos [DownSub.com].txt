you had a bit of privilege duffel here

you went to good schools your father was

my minister and an internationalist and

I'm wondering if he knew that you were

doing this in high school

preparing blackface and what he thought

about it and if he if he didn't know

what do you think he would have thought

I my father raised me to try and defend

people's rights one of our family motto

has always been provide counterweights

it was the reason he gave for why he

chose to go to Ottawa in 1965 when all

the power tended to accrue towards

Quebec City in the quiet revolution and

Quebecers becoming strong and staying in

Quebec he said no we need to provide

counterweights and if you're strong you

need to go where your strength is most

needed that is the way he raised me and

I certainly have tried to use that

privilege that you talked about the

opportunities that I've had in my life

to put them in service of people who

didn't have the kinds of opportunities

that I have that's the kind of leader

and the kind of prime minister I've

tried to be the kind of man I've tried

to be certainly the kind of parent have

tried to be and in my conversations with

my kids difficult conversation I had

this morning about taking responsibility

for your actions and learning from your

mistakes this is certainly something and

I think my father

wouldn't be pleased with how I behaved

but perhaps would feel that taking

responsibility for things is important

when I think of the conversations I have

with my kids this morning I also

recognize that there are far too many

Canadians who this morning had to

explain to their kids what those

pictures were of their Prime Minister

and what kind of society we live in and

what kind of world we need to live in

and how things have evolved but at the

same time I regret deeply parents who

had to have difficult conversations with

their kids that were uncomfortable and

hurtful because of my actions
