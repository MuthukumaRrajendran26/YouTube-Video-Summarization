it gives me great pleasure to name this

ship so David Attenborough and may God

bless her and all those who sail in her

we are of course here to celebrate a

true British marvel one that is strong

sturdy and incredibly well engineered

that deepens our understanding of the

impacts our behavior has on the world

around us and arms us with the facts to

do something about it an icon capable of

feats not seen before and potentially

never seen again and no I'm not talking

about you David those words wouldn't do

you and your lifetimes work justice I'm

referring to the hugely impressive ship

behind us through this state-of-the-art

new ship the British Antarctic Survey

will help to expand global knowledge of

the polar oceans and the impact of

climate change on this crucial region as

last week's climate protests the world

over and yesterday's reports on our

oceans and frozen regions demonstrated

there has never been a more important

moment for this ship to get to work and

there is no person more fitting for this

beacon of scientific research to be

named after than you David

it is my immense privilege and relief to

welcome Sir David Attenborough rather

than boaty mcboatface to speak

your royal eyeness

great problems require great research

and facts in order to solve them that's

what this astonishing ship will be here

to do to find out the facts to find the

science with which to deal with the

problems that are facing the world today

and will increasingly do so tomorrow it

is the greatest possible honor that it

should carry this marvelous ship should

carry my name and I wish good luck good

fortune to everyone who will sail and

work with her
