and throughout history is once again

thrown into stark relief it is the

divide between those whose thirst for

control deludes them into thinking they

are destined to rule over others i've

told kim jonghwan what I truly believe

that like Iran his country is full of

tremendous untapped potential socialism

and communism are about one thing only

power for the ruling class today I

repeat a message for the world that I

have delivered at home America will

never be a socialist country
