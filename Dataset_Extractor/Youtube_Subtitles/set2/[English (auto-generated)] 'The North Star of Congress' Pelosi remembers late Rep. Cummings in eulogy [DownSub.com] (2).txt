some more thank you Bishop Thomas for

bringing us under this beautiful

auspices to pay tribute to our darling

precious Elijah mr. president mr.

president and mr. vice president

Madam Secretary Archbishop Lawrence

Bishop members of the clergy

distinguished guests too early of your

for our darling Elijah as Speaker of the

House I had the sad honor and personal

privilege to bring the condolences of

the entire Congress of the United States

to Maya the Cummings family the people

the constituents of Elijah's district

people of Baltimore to our entire

country I say that with great authority

because yesterday my friends and those

of you who loved Elijah yesterday Maya

gave us the privilege of having a

celebration of Elijah's life in the

capital of the United States the first

African American Lloyd maker ever to

serve in repose lie in repose

[Applause]

[Music]

it was so beautiful

and as has been referenced Elijah

brought people together in life of

different parties and in his death of

different parties and that's why I'm so

pleased that yesterday service was very

bipartisan in fact it took bipartisan

agreement for Elijah to lie in repose on

the same cattle pool that Abraham

Lincoln lay in repose and so today we

have a very strong bipartisan of

Elijah's colleagues from the House of

Representatives led by arch chair of the

black caucus Karen bass our leader Steny

Hoyer John Lewis Marsha who got the nod

and I'm happy to get it as well and so

many of our members of the House in a

bipartisan fashion please rise to be

recognized and their families and their

staff

Elijah's staff John Lewis where are you

John Lewis

[Applause]

and we had a strong representation from

the United States Senate in a bipartisan

way yesterday today also led by Ben

Cardin and Chris Van Hollen brings so

many senators here today bishop thomas

how brilliant was it of Elijah's parents

to name him elijah

as the senate as the secretary said the

more lord the god is my lord and as we

know from the Old Testament there is a

tradition to leave a seat at the table

for Elijah who might show up but our

Elijah always made a seat at the table

for others he made a seat at the table

for children who needed an education for

even new members of Congress so that he

could mentor them for all who wanted to

be part of the American dream Elijah

himself personally lived the American

dream and he wanted everyone else to

have that opportunity hence many seats

at the table how fortunate for her

country that his parents also taught him

to live up to his name how blessed are

we all to know him and to benefit from

his friendship and his leadership Elijah

was a proud man proud of his heritage

proud of Baltimore

and proud of America

he always appealed to our better angels

and to the promise of America calling us

to live up to our principles and for a

higher purpose as he said does this just

so all the words that we will use that

are the best words or words that Elijah

used when we were not meeting the needs

of children in our country he said we

are better than this he felt himself to

a high standard and that is why I've

called him the North Star of Congress

our guiding light Thank You Maya for

giving me this opportunity to speak at

the Baltimore celebration as well as

yesterday of Elijah's life previously

I've seen some of you over time speaking

as Speaker of the House before at st.

James Episcopal Church to speak of the

funeral service for congressman parren

Mitchell a sad and proud day for the

Baltimore community in our country that

day paying tribute to Peron was both an

official and a personal honor my

D'Alessandro family and the Mitchell

family had been friends for generations

now it is my great honor and personal

sadness to join you at the new psalmist

Baptist Church

Elijah's church to celebrate Elijah's

life as I said yesterday members of

Congress said goodbye to Elijah Maya

gave us the honor again upholding that

official service in the statuary hall of

the house at that time I said this was

appropriate because Elijah was master of

the house master of the house in his

chairmanship of

Committee on Oversight and reform he

lived up to his responsibilities to hold

the federal government accountable to

the laws of the land one word I would

use to describe a larger over and over

again this is the word future he was

there to make the future for our

children whom he called as has been said

our living messengers to a future we

will never see but he wanted for those

children to have a future worthy of

their aspirations and he wanted them to

have a future built on our values

continue to be built on our family and

as a master of the house he was also the

mentor of the house so anybody in here

be mentored by Elijah Cummings he was no

surprise when we had this election and

we won the Congress that Elijah said

send me as many freshmen as you can

because I want to help them be oriented

to reach the full their fullest

potential in the House of

Representatives so wonderful that he did

that in all members whether new or not

benefited from the generosity of his

spirit

sometimes the candor of how we do our

work whether we asked her not the candor

was there and again it was an honor to

share again this some of these thoughts

about our dear Elijah Elijah loved

Baltimore and his district he was my

Baltimore brother in Congress we had our

chats about Baltimore all the time he's

loved and respected his constituents by

example he gave people hope by his

parish he fought for what is right by

his brilliance knowledge and legal

prowess he made a difference in so many

ways fighting for gun violence

prevention expanding opportunity for

everyone

recognizing now this was the most recent

recognizing the cost of prescription

drugs hurt

the health and economic well-being of

America's working families he was

willing to reach across the aisle even

across the Capitol even down

Pennsylvania Avenue so it should be a

source of pride to all of us who loved

Elijah that the Committee Chairman

immediately named HR 3 the lower drug

cost Act now

the Elijah II Cummings lower cost

[Applause]

doulton our Baltimore connection gave me

special entree into the thinking largest

thinking which helped me a speaker our

love of the Orioles and the Ravens made

it fun Thank You Baltimore for your

contribution to the greatness of the

United States of America when I spoke on

Wednesday my brother Tommy dalesandro

service I acknowledged that we would be

honoring Elijah today we lost two great

leaders in one week we did involve

tomorrow

[Music]

one thing that Elijah one of the things

that Elijah my brother Tommy and I being

from Baltimore and I representing San

Francisco had in common was the pride we

took in Baltimore our Baltimore another

thing Tommy Elijah and I had and I am

representing San Francisco had in common

that our hearts are full of love for

America they used to tell them in San

Francisco for us love means letting

other versions exist and that's exactly

what Elijah did respecting respecting

the views of others reaching across the

aisle building community and content

consensus Thank You Maya thank you to

children and to your entire family for

sharing Elijah with us and for loving

him so much he you were the source of

his strength and inspiration I hope it
