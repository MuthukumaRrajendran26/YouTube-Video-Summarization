when I responded earlier I hadn't seen

the image itself and seeing the image it

jarred me and I wasn't sure if I wanted

to come out and give a statement but I

got a message from a friend and I faced

a lot of racism in my life and I can be

honest with you I fought back when I

faked racism I I fought back my fists

but there's a lot of people that weren't

able to do that one of my friends told

me how he wasn't able to do that and

seeing this image today the kids that

see this image the people who see this

image are going to think about all the

times in their life that they were made

fun of that they were hurt that they

were hit that they were insulted that

they were made to feel less because of

who they are and I want to talk to those

people right now I want to talk to all

the kids out there all the folks who

live this and our growing up and are

still feeling the pain of racism I want

you to know that you might feel like

giving up in Canada you might feel like

giving up on yourselves I want you to

know that you have value you have Worth

and you are loved

and I don't want you to give up on

Canada and please don't give up on

yourselves there's so many people in

this country that believe in taking care

of one another I know it's hard to

believe right now but there are and

together we are going to come together

and take care of one another so seeing

this image is gonna be hard for a lot of

people it's gonna bring up a lot of pain

it's gonna bring up a lot of hurt please

reach out to your loved ones please

reach out to people who are suffering in

silence right now please let them know

that they are loved and they are

celebrated for who they are when I was

growing up I fought racists I dealt with

them myself and I fought back but I got

a message from a friend who reminded me

that there's a lot of people out there

they couldn't do that they couldn't bite

back they didn't have the ability to do

that

they couldn't they couldn't do with

themselves and I think that it's gonna

hurt to see this it's gonna hurt them

I'm wondering do you think his apology

is enough for him to say no today I'm

not speaking to the Prime Minister and

it's not for me to say that it's for the

people to decide I'm speaking today to

young people to people who've grown up

with racism people who've grown up being

being told that they were less being

told that they were less worthy less

valuable and couldn't fight back and

they had no way to stand up for

themselves I'm speaking to them and I

want them to know that you are valued

you are loved

you have Worth and please don't let this

make you give up on yourself or give up

on Canada we live in a beautiful place
