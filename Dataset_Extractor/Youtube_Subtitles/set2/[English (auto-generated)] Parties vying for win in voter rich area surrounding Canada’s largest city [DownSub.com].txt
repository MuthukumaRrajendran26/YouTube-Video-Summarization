hello I'm David akin and this is the

West block policies perspective and

players well the election campaign is

underway and politicians are Criss

crossing the country looking for your

vote and ahead of that October 21st vote

one of the most critical areas in the

country will be the Greater Toronto Area

in writings like Whitby

there's no incumbent both the liberals

and conservatives are working hard to

win here I'm Todd McCarthy and I'm the

Conservative candidate in Whitby what

we're all hearing at the door is

affordability is the number one issue

for people here in would be the high

taxes the broken promise is the fact

that the Trudeau government is out of

touch in terms of their priorities they

just don't feel that the government of

mr. Trudeau reflects their values or

their priorities they feel talked down

to they feel that mr. Trudeau is

arrogant and right here in Whitby Selina

who was a former Liberal MP elected in

2015 she left the Liberal Party she

rebuked mr. Trudeau and she decided not

to run again because she couldn't

tolerate working with someone she

couldn't support on a matter of

principle I respect her for that but if

his own Liberal MP turned on him what

does that say about him in his party so

Whitby has a clear choice to make and it

was a very close election last time

we're working hard to make sure that we

get our message out to get our positive

vision for Whitby and Canada to the

doors and it's resonating people are

overwhelmingly agreeing to take long

signs and as I said the number one issue

is affordability high taxes people want

to do their part for the environment but

the problem is the carbon tax doesn't

get it done it just puts people under a

greater burden it'll increase the price

of gas by as much as 11 to 23 cents per

litre in the coming year or two and our

choice is resonating the Green Home Tax

Credit is really what people want its

citizens choosing to make a positive

impact to fight climate change to do

their own part to reduce their carbon

footprint so that is a positive choice

which gives our citizens a tax credit

reduces their taxes gives them a tax

refund puts more money in their pocket

it's all part of our

of helping people get ahead hi my name's

Ryan Turnbull and I'm the Liberal

candidate for whippy there's definitely

clear trends like the issues that are

coming up for people in web D I would

say to talk one that I've heard at the

door is climate change people are

concerned about our climate they're

concerned about our you know protecting

our environment and they want to see

action a lot of people think we need to

go further than what we've ever done

before but I think there's a lot of

support for climate change being one of

the key other you know issues like

unemployment I think people are

recognizing that the Liberal government

has you know created a million jobs and

achieved you know reducing unemployment

to a 40-year low so I think you know the

Liberal government is being well

received at the door professor peter

grave teaches politics at McMaster

University in Hamilton Ontario and

professor sketch it out for us why is

this part of the country the Greater

Toronto Area or GTA so important and how

do you expect the campaigns to deal with

this area well two reasons on the one

hand it's a greatest population center

in Canada and so you have the largest

number of seats up for grabs and the

second thing is that these are seats

that change so they voted conservative

in 2011 to deliver a Stephen Harper

majority and liberal in 2015 to deliver

a Justin Trudeau majority so the fact

that they're in play makes some extra

interesting for the parties so in

downtown Toronto for instance the NDP

did very well in 2011 and the Liberals

in 2015 so presumably it will be a

conflict between those two in the seat

rich suburbs of Toronto it's much more

between the Liberal Party and the

Conservative Party although even there

we saw in the last provincial election

the NDP did better and given that mr.

Singh is from Brampton there may be some

surprises in parts of the the Greater

GTA but it's mostly a liberal

conservative fight in the suburbs

clearly the parties recognize that

people living in that area are finding

it tough economically they feel that

they're working hard and not getting

ahead and so I guess it will be whether

they are looking for a solution in a

sense of thing

that will hit them directly in the

pocketbook like removing the GST from

home heating as Andrew Shearer has

proposed or whether they look for more

collective solutions to say we need

better investments and things like

housing or pharmacare and that would

help bring make the ends of the months a

bit easier in which case a party like

the NDP or the Liberals might be more

interesting to them
