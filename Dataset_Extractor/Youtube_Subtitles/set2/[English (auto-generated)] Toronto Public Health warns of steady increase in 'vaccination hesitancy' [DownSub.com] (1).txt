I can tell you that in the 2018-2019

school year our team assessed about

three hundred and twenty-two thousand

think about that that's a really huge

number three hundred and twenty-two

thousand student immunization records

and based on this assessment I can tell

you that ninety-four percent of our

seven to seventeen year olds in our

school systems here in Toronto

were up-to-date for measles mumps and

rubella vaccinations and that about 1.7

percent

so just under two percent of the

students in our system indicated that

they had a philosophical or religious

exemption and applied as such in Toronto

we've seen a slow but steady increase in

student vaccine non-medical exemptions

from 0.8% in 2016 to 1.7 percent this

year this trend is not unique to Toronto

it's something that in fact has been

seen throughout the province as a whole

so to my mind what does this mean it

means that we need to start having an

evidence-informed conversation on this

important issue

at what point at what point will this

increasing rate of exemptions lead to an

increasing number of onion eyes people

and therefore lead to outbreaks and at

what point would we as a system both as

public health providers and in concert

with our health care system at what

point would we together need to act we

need to start with this conversation now

so that we don't find ourselves in a

situation with several outbreaks that

cause severe illness and children and

contribute to added strain and

ultimately cost to our healthcare system

as a whole
