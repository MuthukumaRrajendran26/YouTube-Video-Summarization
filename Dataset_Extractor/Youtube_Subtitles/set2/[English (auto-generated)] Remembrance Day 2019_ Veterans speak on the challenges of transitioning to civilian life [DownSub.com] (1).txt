hello I'm Mercedes Stevenson and this is

the West walk politics perspectives and

players the toll of war on canada's

veterans and their families is high from

the physical scars they wear to the

invisible mental wounds the men and

women of our Canadian Armed Forces have

sacrificed for their country with some

paying the ultimate price past

governments and the current one have

both come under fire for making and

breaking promises to veterans despite

constant commitments to do better

joining me now to discuss Canada's track

record and what needs to be done to help

veterans is retired sergeant Alanna

Gilmore who was a frontline medic in

Afghanistan and retired master corporal

Jeff de potty who was a jtf2 Special

Forces sniper thank you both very much

for joining us we really are looking

forward to hearing from you especially

as we head towards Remembrance Day

tomorrow Ilana you saw the worst of the

worst injuries in Afghanistan you saved

lives that takes a toll too and you've

talked very publicly about suffering

from PTSD what are some of the

challenges for a veteran like yourself

as you've transitioned out and into the

civilian world trying to deal with these

physical and mental scars I feel for a

lot of us we don't quite know how to

navigate the health system once we leave

the military when you're a soldier and

you're serving you're well taken care of

you have to be because you can be

deployed at any time so you need to have

a medical service that is ensuring that

you are a healthy that you have your

immunizations that if you have any

illness that it's looked after injury

the same thing so when we get let go all

of a sudden we are now cast out and

we're expected to figure out how to

navigate a system that we've not been

part of probably for the majority of our

adult years so I think for a lot of

people it's almost overwhelming there's

a huge delay I find at least it was for

me when I got out in 2015 and I know

there's been some improvements but there

was a lull there was a big gap of time

from release to when you say got you

know your doctor on the civilian

inside or you got your prescriptions or

you got your disability claim through

the Veterans Affairs of Canada and the

only way to get those pension claims in

is by submitting umpteen numbers of

paperwork plus supporting documents and

then you have a waiting game and as you

can tell like and what's happened before

in the past huge delays in these people

getting their paperwork looked at and

what that does is it actually means that

the person is not getting looked after

they're not being medically treated so

whatever ailed them while they were in

service is now not being necessarily

looked at on the civilian side and I'm

not saying everyone is in that but I

would say it tends to be more complex

cases people who have multiple injuries

or illnesses that stem from military

service and then we have all these

people you know under old guidelines

that were denied but then those

guidelines change so what happens to

those people are they allowed to appeal

again so we have all these questions on

how do we pick these people up and how

do we provide them the service that they

need the treatment that they required

Jeff go ahead well I was gonna say I

agree that a serving member once they

leave based on time served something

along that kind of metrics should be

entitled to a medical package rate out

of service that transition time is

extremely difficult so like I say I

agree 100% with Atlanta I also think

that that transition time when a

soldiers searching for their new

identity the military is great at

creating soldiers it's great at taking

care of soldiers but once that stops an

individual has to now find their new

identity that layered on top of any

medical issue I think that's where vets

will start to see most of their issues

arise from Jeff what was that experience

like for you because you're pretty

unique we don't often hear from somebody

who

year 1 special forces unit I imagine it

must be an even more jarring transition

to go into civilian society yes that's

right

extremely high paced environment and

then as soon as you sign on the dotted

line that it's all done it kind of just

sends and I don't want to throw the cap

under the bus

totally there are programs there

Veterans Affairs the legions CFM WS the

Canadian Forces Morel and Welfare

services to help with the transitions

it's just not nailed down yet as soon as

you're done signing your paperwork

saying you're leaving and all all your

kits packed and hand it in there should

be a more robust program there to help

soldiers move into the next portion that

doesn't have such a government feel to

it not such a medical feel because some

people are leaving the military and they

don't want to be part of a government

feeling organization some kind of third

party organization would be great

Ilana why do you think the government's

have struggled with this so much because

it's not just a partisan issue the

Conservatives took a lot of heat from

veterans the Liberals have disappointed

a lot of veterans with the pension and

other programs why is it that

politicians can't seem to get this right

I don't know I don't understand it

you know we've now created three tiers

of three divisions of veterans you know

every time they come out with a new

package that's different from the

package that was there before you know

some veterans now fall under the new

veterans Charter now we have veterans

falling under the pension for life and

then we have the old pensioners that

fell under a different system before so

there's three that I'd mentioned all

just since you know since 2019 this year

and April 1st it rolled out for the

pension for life I don't quite

understand why we get nickeled and dimed

so hard the amount of money they must

put in to try and fight everything that

we're looking for just for quality of

life just to make sure you know whatever

ailments we have based on our service or

looked after for life I feel like that's

the least that can be done for our

veterans and for their families because

the families are just as much involved

as the member the

selves the struggle is real it's 24 and

7 and honestly I think it's time for

politicians to admit to that and

actually see what can we do to make

their lives easier instead of making us

fight for everything Jeff in the last

election campaign which just wrapped up

there was a lot of promises made by

different parties to veterans including

the now governing party the Liberals

they were going to reach out to every

veteran and sure they weren't homeless

inject more money into the system do you

believe that there will finally be

change for veterans I don't hold my

breath I don't want to be cynical but I

don't hold my breath the thing is I

agree with Atlanta they could streamline

all this save money and still have

solutions to the problems getting note

that funding to the to the vets and as

Lana said to their families their

families are gonna be that first line of

defense for any of the long-term mental

illness any of the well-being in the

longitudinal

area Jeff I want to ask you about a

tough topic but I think you're an

important person to speak about this

especially given what you did in the

forces and and the additional sort of

cultural barriers around a tier one unit

and talking about mental health and

talking about the issue of suicides

among serving members and our veterans

it is still an epidemic both in those in

uniform and those after they retire why

do you think it is that we are

struggling to help veterans who are

facing suicidal feelings and to be able

to reduce these numbers more

significantly there's probably lots of

stigma attached to it a lot of negative

press I would imagine it's just I don't

think it's all that difficult I think

the government's are over complicating

it I think if they start bringing like

I'm like referring back to the calf does

an excellent job of taking care of their

soldiers if there was just something to

bridge that gap between Veterans Affairs

the calf government's could save some

money they could reach into something

that's taboo I personally also agree

with Oana saying that you know PTSD gets

a bad rap we can empower things like

post-traumatic growth which is the big

brother to PTSD and remove those stigmas

so that people's ears don't get in the

way and once we start talking about it

that's when those floodgates open up

showing people how to talk about it yeah

and we don't just want to focus on the

negative because there are lots of

veterans like both you and Jeff who have

done incredibly well Alana despite the

challenges what are some of the things

that have helped you that you would

recommend to fellow veterans who are out

there that are looking for a lifeline

so I released in 2015 I'm gonna be very

honest when I say I had a very difficult

transition I had amazing difficulty

figuring out how to Rio Dental I myself

but in the civilian world I had

depression the PTSD was elevated there

is again that stopgap between service

within the military and being under this

umbrella than just being cast aside and

basically the wind picks up the umbrella

closes and off it goes and you're left

you know all of a sudden you're getting

soaked because now like all this stuff

is now being thrown at you and you have

no idea how to handle it so for me as

soon as I got back into something

military I actually found myself I found

a purpose again that even though I

wasn't wearing the uniform that I was

still good for service I was still good

to serve veterans maybe not

the servicemen and women but I could

still advocate I spent 10 years

advocating for significantly injured

catastrophic wounds and stuff from my

expose so now I'm navigating a new

system from a veterans angle and it's

inclusive it's everybody female male it

doesn't matter but the point is it's the

fact is is that we served you know now

we have people who truly need us that if

don't put themselves at risk they need

our help why can't we just do that and

that is absolutely a fair question and

one we will continue to ask

unfortunately that's all the time we

have today but thank you both

Alanna and Jeff for your service to our

country and thank you for coming on to

talk about this issue with us that's all

the time we have for today thanks for

joining us for the West block I'm

Mercedes
