take off on a dark and dreary fall

morning in London to a beautiful sunrise

over Europe breakfast number one is

served YUM then it's time to get moving

no this is not kangaroo acclimatization

this is science what we've done

basically is to design three very

important things on the flight first the

lighting then the meals should you land

the milk composition and physical

activity on board all to see what

passengers and crew will need to stay

healthy and sane although I'm not sure

what Nappers will make of hikes down the

aisle or intimate stretches so our

intention is to have a bigger sea pigeon

economy that we've ever done before have

dedicated stretching areas in economy of

course more legroom costs you more money

but these guinea pigs I think it may be

worth it I actually feel fantastic

I feel really well probably a lot better

than I normally would at this point in

the flight to be honest this test flight

is a half hour longer than New York to

Singapore currently the longest

commercially available flight London to

Sydney is not revolutionary a jumbo jet

actually did it 30 years ago on this

occasion the plane used around half as

much fuel to carry double the number of

people but still nowhere near a full

passenger load 15 hours in comes the

second sunrise before landing in Sydney

springtime for a big Aussie welcome for

Qantas this is really one big ad aimed

at Boeing and Airbus both are racing to

develop aircraft that may one day take

300 people half the way around the world
