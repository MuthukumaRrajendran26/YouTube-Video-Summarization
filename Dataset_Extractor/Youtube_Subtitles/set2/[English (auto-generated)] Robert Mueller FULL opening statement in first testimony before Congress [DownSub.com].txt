good morning Sherman and learn the

ranking member Collins and the members

of the committee as you know in May 2017

the acting Attorney General asked me to

serve as special counsel I undertook

undertook that role because I believed

that it was a paramount interest to the

nation to determine whether a foreign

adversary had interfered in the

presidential election as the acting

Attorney General said at the time the

appointment was necessary in order for

the American people to have full

confidence confidence in the outcome my

staff and I carried out this assignment

with that critical objective in mind to

work quietly thoroughly and with

integrity so that the public would have

full confidence in the outcome the order

appointing me as special counsel

directed our office to investigate

Russian interference in the 2016

presidential election

this included investigating any links or

coordination between the Russian

government and individuals associated

with the Trump campaign

it also included investigating efforts

to interfere with or obstruct our

investigation throughout the

investigation I continually stressed two

things to the team that we had assembled

first we needed to do our work as

thoroughly as possible and as

expeditiously as possible it was in the

public interest for our investigation to

be complete and not to last a day longer

than was necessary

second the investigation needed to be

conducted fairly and with absolute

integrity our team would not leak or

take other actions that could compromise

the integrity of our work all decisions

were made based on the facts and the law

during the course of our investigation

we charged more than 30 defendants with

committing federal crimes including 12

officers of the Russian military

seven defendants have been convicted or

pled guilty certain of the charges we

brought remain pending today and for

those matters I stress that the

indictments contain allegations and

every defendant is presumed innocent

unless and until proven guilty in

addition to the criminal charges

we brought as required by Justice

Department regulations we submitted a

confidential report to the Attorney

General at the conclusion of our

investigation the report set forth the

results of our work and the reasons for

our charging and declination decisions

the Attorney General later made to the

purport largely public as you know I

made a few limited remarks limited

remarks about our report when we closed

the special counsel's office in May of

this year but there are certain points

that bear emphasis first our

investigation found that the Russian

government interfered in our election in

sweeping and systematic fashion

second the investigation did not

establish that members of the Trump

campaign conspired with the Russian

government in its election interference

activities we did not address collusion

which is not a legal term rather we

focused on whether the evidence was

sufficient to charge any member of the

campaign with taking part in a criminal

conspiracy and it was not third our

investigation of efforts to obstruct the

investigation and lie to investigators

was of critical importance obstruction

of justice strikes at the core of the

government's effort to find the truth

and to hold wrongdoers accountable

finally as described in volume 2 of our

report we investigated a series of

actions by the president towards the

investigation based on Justice

Department policy and principles of

fairness we decided we would not make a

determination as to whether the

president committed

crime that was our decision then and it

remains our decision today let me say a

further word about my appearance today

it is unusual for a prosecutor to

testify about a criminal investigation

and given my role as a prosecutor there

are reasons why my testimony of a

testimony will necessarily be limited

first public testimony could affect

several ongoing matters in some of these

matters court rules or judicial orders

limit the disclosure of information to

protect to protect the fairness of the

proceedings and consistent with

long-standing Justice Department policy

it would be inappropriate for me to

comment in any way that could affect an

ongoing matter second the Justice

Department has asserted privileges

concerning investigative information and

decisions ongoing matters within the

Justice Department and deliberations

within our office

these are Justice Department privileges

that I will respect the department has

released a letter discussing the

restrictions on my testimony I therefore

will not be able to answer questions

about certain areas that I know are of

public interest for example I am unable

to address questions about the initial

opening of the FBI's Russia

investigation which occurred months

before my appointment or matters related

to the so called steel dossier these

matters are subject of ongoing review by

the department any questions on these

topics should therefore be directed to

the FBI or the Justice Department as I

explained when we closed this special

counsel's office in May our report

contains our findings and analysis and

the reasons for the decisions we made we

conducted an extensive investigation

over two years in writing the report we

stated the results of our investigation

we

precision we scrutinized every word I do

not intend to summarize or describe the

results of our work in a different way

in the course of my testimony today as I

said on May 29th the report is my

testimony and I will stay within that

text and as I stated in May I will not

comment on the actions of the Attorney

General or of Congress I was appointed

as a prosecutor and I intend intend to

adhere to that role and to the

department standards that govern it I'll

be joined today by Deputy Special

Counsel Erin sembly mr. Sibley has

extensive experience as a federal

prosecutor and at the FBI where he

served as my chief of staff and mr. mr.

Sibley was responsible for the

day-to-day oversight of the

investigations conducted by our office

now I also want to again say thank you

to the attorneys the FBI agents the

analysts the professional staff who

helped us conduct this investigation in

a fair and independent manner these

individuals who spent nearly two years

of working on this matter were of the

highest integrity and let me say one

more thing over the course of my career

I have seen a number of challenges to

our democracy the Russian government's

effort to interfere in our election is

among the most serious as I said on May

29th this deserves the attention of

every American Thank You mr. chairman
