water ice and snow covered three

quarters of the planet they soak up the

impact of climate change but the latest

UN report predicts sea levels could rise

three feet by the year 2100 oceans will

acidify and some marine life will

collapse climate change is coming fast

not just in the atmosphere but in the

water the consequences for nature and

humanity are sweeping and severe what is

at stake is the health of ecosystems

wildlife and importantly the world we

leave for our children

Canada is threatened in many ways from

coastal communities to our vast Arctic a

lot of communities a lot of coastlines

in Canada are in big trouble now we know

it's just going to be a lot worse than

we anticipated just a few years ago the

Canadian reality we faced three oceans

are more than two hundred thousand

kilometres of coastline is longer than

any other country in the world rising

sea levels will confront oceanfront

communities mountain snow and glaciers

are melting and permafrost is thawing

and we are intimately connected to the

Arctic where the impact is greatest the

needs say experts is to act on multiple

fronts

we need a different energy source we

need to do carbon capture out of the

atmosphere and we need to scare take

care of the people that live near sea

level and yet Canada is among the most

divided countries debating climate

change in this election campaign the

party now leading the polls vows to end

carbon pricing good morning everyone

climate change is here other parties

differ in the degree of urgency to do

more many of us are caught between a

rock and a hard place it's very

difficult for Alberta shift away to

shift away from oil and gas development

but at the same time we have to face the

consequences if we continue down this

road we're going to pay the price later

the bottom line from many experts

addressing climate change will involve

some pain so get on with it because the

pain will only get worse Erik Sorensen
