people in California the Governor of

California come on in everybody then you

wonder why people are flooding our

borders come on in you have free

education free health care everybody

gets a rolls-royce come on in come on in

you know to show you how corrupt CNN is

when I use that expression they said the

president wasn't telling the truth he

said they get a Rolls Royce and they

don't ah they don't get it do they they

never got it some idiot at CNN said you

can't win without CNN I guess we showed

them I guess we shot bad but CNN is a

voice that really seems to be the voice

out there and it's a terrible thing for

our country and we ought to start our

own Network and put some real news out

there because they are so bad they are

so bad for our country we vastly

expanded affordable insurance options

including Association health plans

short-term plans and health

reimbursement arrangements which are

incredible and many of these options are

up to 60% less expensive than Obama care

nobody got that but nobody got that that

self Obama care

I didn't say Obama care I said Obama

care

president obama care he can have it and

i have many people coming down from

Canada and I said what are you doing

there getting an operation of some kind

why don't you get it up there they say

there's nothing like what you've been

able to do in a short period of time and

will making it even better

though they used many labels all of the

Democrat plans would devastate our

health care system to fake moderates on

the left are telling the same lies they

did under the last administration but

the last administration frankly was

moderate compared to the maniacs that

you're hearing from today these are

maniacs

Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren

you know when I used to hit her I

thought she was gon run I thought she

was gone

she came up from the ashes she emerged

now we're probably gonna have to do it

again cuz I don't see sleepy Joe making

it I'll tell you now I thought she was

gone under this administration we

believe that every American family has

the right of choice you have a right to

choose choice so important like what we

did with events choice where they can go

out and get a doctor instead of waiting

in line for three weeks four weeks two

months

choice and you look at the doctor and

you look at the plan that is best for

you

the truth is there is no longer a

moderate wing of the congressional

Democrats they've gone crazy

they've been hijacked by the radical

left I mean these people on the Left

these people are that the same guy I

think so so to like him I can't admonish

him again I think it's the same guy got

a powerful voice Democrat lawmakers are

not trying to build up the country they

only want to wreck and destroy all of

the things that we've built up over the

last three and a half years four years

five years prior to us getting in here

you look at the stock market numbers

from the time of the election from that

November 9th date go a day later was

November 8th was that one of the great

times 2016

but go a day later and you look at the

numbers in the stock market up way over

50% the 401ks are doing unbelievably

well one of these people gets in your

401ks are going to hell the stock

market's going to hell

frankly I think and I hate to say it but

country is going to go to hell they are

consumed by rage and radicalism and

insatiable lust for power how about

justice Cavanaugh

they talk about a woman they talk about

a woman about horrible things that he

never even thought about horrible

horrible things and the following day

and they want to impeach him and then

the following day she said no I don't

remember anything I don't remember that

and they say we don't care we want to

impeach him anyway now what they're

trying to do is turn his vote liberal

but he's a much tougher guy than that

I hope he's a much tougher guy

thank you yeah I better be tell you if I

weren't I wouldn't be up here right now

you want to drive him crazy don't do for

more you say eight more years you'll

drive him one of these crazy maniacs on

the show was interviewing somebody

radical left and he goes you know he's

gonna wind aren't you big show and they

go no no we're gonna find it with it no

no he's gonna win and you know he's

never getting out you know that don't

you

he's not gonna get out you know he's and

I thought like here's a comedian I

thought he was like kidding and having

fun he meant it these people are sick

they meant it anyway but know if you

want to drive him crazy just say eight

more years or 12 more years sixteen

sixteen would do it good they would

you'd really drive them into the loony

bin

and that's why they do the impeachment

crap because they know they can't beat

us fairly that's the only reason their

delegate they can't win

they can't
