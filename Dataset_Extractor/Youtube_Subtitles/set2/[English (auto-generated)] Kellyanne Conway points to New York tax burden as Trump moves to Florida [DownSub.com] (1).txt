quickly can you house checks him right

on why president truck moved his

residency to Florida is it because the

taxes are lower there is it because it's

a battleground state can you give us a

sense of why obviously he loves Sparta

and he loves his property in Florida at

mar-a-lago and and he said very clearly

yesterday that he's been treated

unfairly but he speaks for many people

would be taxpayers who've been treated

unfairly in New York I thought it was

incredibly unfortunate really

disappointing of the governor of New

York to try to take a cheap shot at the

president has has Andrew Cuomo seen the

numbers of New Yorkers who have left New

York and have stated why they left New

York because of a high tax burden

particularly in some other reasons I

mean maybe he should open up some

hydraulic fracturing there so he just

stops losing some of the New York

workers to Pennsylvania in other states

as well but obviously the high tax

residents of New York have fled the

state for many many years to Florida and

to other states as well Florida

obviously Texas they don't have state

income taxes New Hampshire Tennessee I

believe the handful of states left but

the president made clear any and he does

it with with some regret because he

loves New York that it's been home for

he and his family and his children and

their families for many many years but

obviously he loves Florida as well in

Florida and I think the president is

doing what many taxpayers have done and

property owners have done which is go to

a state that is more hospitable to

hardworking Americans who want to pay

their fair share but I can't understand

why the tax payer has become so

confiscatory and so upside-down and

frankly I think the governor of New York

should take it should take a look at his

economic policies and what's happening

there

sit there because he voted there as he

volunteered there realize that's what

people do when they change their

residents right if you if you change

your domicile then you intend to reside

there so one would presume that you

continue to do that I've been to marlak

I'm sure you have I'd say they're

probably a few electric bills for him to

pay there I'm not sure he drives himself

anywhere but I'll get back to you on the

drivers answers you can ask what an Air

Force morning there but I've checked at

the so the way is the way to go to me

whatever state such as for tax avoidance

I'm just concerned could just send a

signal to other Americans that the best

thing to do is to avoid taxes at all

cost for the state taxes in New York

which are high me but what do you mean

first of all he's making the best

decision remedies but he sent a very

naughty Minister on single this signal

he sent the same statement to New York

tips that they've heard from many overly

tax highly taxed individuals many people

have fled in New York and other high tax

state for lower tax states that's

unfortunately become a matter of a

height of high tax state to lowest tax

state migration and so he's he and the

first lady or the latest to do that but

they are joining tens of thousands of

other people have done the same thing
