this detention center in northern Syria

is home to the world's most unwanted

prisoners remnants of the so called

Islamic state

six months ago Isis lost control of its

territory in Syria and Iraq defeated by

Kurdish forces with help from American

and a small number of Canadian troops

but now those Western forces are mostly

gone leaving the Kurds to manage nearly

100,000 Isis prisoners held and

makeshift detention camps and prisons

across the region Global News visited

this detention camp last week the

largest in Kurdish controlled Syria home

to more than 60,000 women and children

with alleged links to Isis during the

visit guards fired warning shots after

violence broke out between some of the

prisoners Kurdish officials say there

are often riots and attempts to escape

they call the camp a ticking time bomb

the ISIS prisoners include thousands of

foreigners from countries such as Canada

that are refusing to take them back

those Canadian citizens came here to

kill us and our kids and to destroy our

towns this Kurdish spokesperson says we

arrested them and were preventing them

from doing any other terrorist attacks

but the Canadian government is doing

nothing about those citizens

that's not respecting our sacrifice he

says they're currently holding around 40

Canadians with alleged Isis ties

including Kimberly Pullman from BC I

don't think there was one person here

that's not traumatized she moved to

Syria in 2015 a decision she says she

almost immediately regretted I can

safely say that I never ever want to

return to the Middle East ever gave my

life to Him

but Paul Minh says she's received no

contact from any Canadian authorities

you need image what the Canadian

government was the first to contact us

about its captured citizens two years

ago but then halted discussions without

explanation says this Kurdish government

Minister

with Turkish forces now pushing into

northern Syria the head of NATO issued

this warning captured dodged terrorists

must not be allowed to escape the choice

facing the Canadian government may soon

change either bring the alleged foreign

fighters home to face charges or risk

having them escape and resume their

fight Jeff sample Global News
