so we're starting with a just a basic

general aviation airplane here it gives

us something to start with we don't have

to spend a lot of time designing an

airplane so we're doing is we're just

focusing on the electric systems today

so what you see here is a is a techno

airplanes built in Italy and we've

modified it with all-electric systems so

that's where the focus of our testing is

to look at that so so as time goes on

you'll be able to see these technologies

actually move into real commercial

airplanes as companies come in and build

these for commercial products that

people can use so there's a number of

interesting new markets for electric

airplanes the first one is called urban

air mobility and there's many many

companies trying to get into this this

this area so if you think of like an air

taxi imagine a taxi but in 3d a vehicle

that can lift off the ground and take

you around a big city say 20 to 50 to

100 miles so that's a really interesting

application for electric vehicles and so

you need electricity electric vehicles

to be able to enable that kind of market

so that's one market the other one is

sort of short haul flights where you

have like 20 to 50 passengers currently

today those kinds of airplane designs

are too expensive for an airline to

actually operate so when you introduce

electricity electric systems it can make

the operations much much cheaper and

just enable something that doesn't exist

today so NASA is a government agency we

don't get involved in commercial

application and commercial products so

we're developing technologies and then

trying to help the certification

agencies like in our country the FAA

Federal Aviation Administration and how

are you gonna certify these electric

airplanes you have new electric motors

controllers battery systems how do you

make those safe so that we have a

transportation mode that is you know

safe like playing in a regular

commercial aircraft it's very exciting

for us I know for me and Kim Williams

the other pilots going to be flying

for Armstrong to get back into the crew

Derrick's explained work is very excited

for us it's cutting-edge technology so

we're really excited looking forward to

the challenges we're gonna know smartly

get it done and hopefully what we

produce will be beneficial to their

community
