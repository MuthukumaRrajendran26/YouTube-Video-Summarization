I'd like to start with something that

you'd probably rather forget but the

fact that you've been exposed to someone

who wore blackface on what we know of

three occasions most recently in 2001

when you were 29 years old and a teacher

it is the biggest hit your campaign has

taken so far it's all down to you it was

you doing that

putting that makeup on what is that done

to your campaign and what does it say

about your judgement I think it's

something that I've recognized was a

terrible mistake I should have known

better at the time but I didn't and I'm

going to have to work a long time to

continue to demonstrate the kind of

focus I've had on fighting racism

fighting discrimination fighting

intolerance as I've worked on as a

politician you know your critics say it

makes you a hypocrite that you set high

standards for other people but you don't

live up to them yourself

certainly I set high standards for

myself as well and I hurt a lot of

people I care about deeply it was a

terrible mistake

and I take full responsibility for it I

applied those high standards to myself I

will always fight against racism and

tolerance and discrimination and I heard

a lot of people who who considered me an

ally you know people have been fired for

doing this certainly lost their

reputations for it you've asked for

forgiveness but why should Canadians

give you a pass because your leader of a

party I have someone who has

demonstrated throughout my political

career and indeed as Prime Minister that

fighting anti black racism fighting

systemic discrimination fighting

unconscious bias and putting real money

of real initiatives and working hard to

fight all this intolerance is something

that I'm I've done and I'm going to

continue to do and I'm going to continue

to do even more given that I have

obviously not lived up to that in the

past when did you stop thinking that

darkening your skin was acceptable

was it something did someone tell you

hey you know this is crazy you're you're

covering not only your face your throat

your hands I think in the video even

your legs did someone say to you Justin

you not to give this out as I've spoken

about I represent one of the most

diverse multicultural ridings in the

country and the work I've done in you

know the late 2012 2008-2009 to be a

better representative a good

representative for people by spending

time in mosques and good Juarez and with

the Haitian community and all the

diverse communities in my writing and

fighting for them let me to understand

to a much greater degree the kind of

discrimination and intolerance that

people face on a daily basis because of

the color of their skin and that's where

why I understand now which I should have

understood then that it is always

unacceptable so it was when you got into

politics I think the years following my

father's death involved a lot of changes

for me I went back to Montreal in 2002 I

went back to school studied engineering

studied environmental geography I got

involved more with the team of at

Canada's national youth service program

I did more environmental and youth

activism I was learning a lot more about

public engagement a lot more about

service and

obviously I am a very different person

today than I was back then

have you talked to your mother about

this yes I talked to my mother I've

talked to my kids I've talked to what

did you have friends my mum my mom as

someone who has lived through very

difficult times in the public eye some

of it possibly deserved some of it not

she reminded me to stay focused on both

the people I've hurt and how I'm going

to do better in the future was she

disappointed in you

I think everyone a lot of people who

know me we're disappointed in me you

disappointed in yourself sure of course

I hurt people who I care about deeply

and who trusted me and that is something

that I I need to understand but also

something that I'm going to need to work

for the rest of my life to do better
