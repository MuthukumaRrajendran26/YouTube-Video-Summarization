doreen is moving ever closer to Canada's

East Coast people they are now bracing

for the impact of that storm Global

chief meteorologist Anthony Farnell is

in Halifax this morning good morning

Anthony what can you tell us so far it

looks like things are picking up there

it is picking up it's amazing last night

was just a regular Friday night

everybody out talking about the storm

but they were still out about town today

all the shops everybody basically

hunkered down and everything's closed

for this Saturday this is the first real

band of rain that's moving into the city

itself the storm the center of Hurricane

Dorian with winds 150 kilometers per

hour

well that's still about 400 kilometers

off into the Atlantic now yesterday

there were cruise ships here there was a

lot of Navy vessels as well they have

gotten out of the Halifax harbor they

would rather deal with the 15-metre

waves that are just offshore then be

basically bumped around inside this

Harbor which is expecting a storm surge

up to a meter and then waves on top of

that so the worst of it will be later

this evening when they are expecting

widespread power outages as well in fact

already some parts of Halifax are in the

dark this morning so Anthony how about

the the people that you talked about

people milling around yesterday business

as usual now the things are closing up

and people are preparing are there

evacuations at this point there are

voluntary evacuations for some places

right around Halifax Peggy's Cove many

of us know it for its lighthouse but

there are some residents there they're

being told or strongly encouraged is the

wording to leave a same thing on the

eastern passage area they are being

asked to leave but it is not a mandatory

evacuation basically most residents that

have lived here their lives they are

just well they're Hardy and they're just

kind of waiting and seeing how bad this

will be the benchmark storm is hurricane

one that was back in 2003 caused

hundreds of million

dollars of damage also several

fatalities so this is not hopefully

gonna be a repeat but it's a much larger

system that's not just going to hit

Halifax but all of Atlantic Canada

Newfoundland and big flooding expected

in New Brunswick as well so conditions

are quickly gonna go downhill as the day

progresses and there are definitely

people that are heeding the warnings and

yesterday was a busy day places like

Costco and all the the big box stores

sold out of bread and water and propane

tanks because maritime residents are

expecting to be without power not for

hours but likely days after this system

moves through later tonight okay

certainly we're gonna keep an eye on

that situation Anthony thank you
