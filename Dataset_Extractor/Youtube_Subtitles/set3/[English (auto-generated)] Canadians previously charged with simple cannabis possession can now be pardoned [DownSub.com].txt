ma the collectivity LC 93 is the next

logical step in a process that began

during the last election campaign when

we committed to ending the prohibition

of cannabis in Canada the result of

decades of prohibition had been that

Canadians were among the heaviest and

youngest users of cannabis in the world

under the former system the illegal

cannabis trade puts 7 billion dollars

annually into the pockets of organized

crime and Canadian law enforcement

agencies spent over two billion dollars

a year every year trying to enforce an

ineffective and counterproductive legal

regime last October we finally put an

end to the old way of doing things and

cannabis is now legally and strictly

regulated as promised however one of the

lingering consequences of the previous

system is that it saddles many Canadians

with criminal records and the people

affected are disproportionately from

minority communities we promised to

introduce legislation to provide pardons

with no application fee and no wait time

today that commitment becomes a reality

exceptional step to eliminate the

waiting period and the application fee

for people seeking a pardon for cannabis

possession it means that instead of

waiting five years and paying the parole

board 631 dollars applicants will no

longer have to wait a single minute and

will not owe the parole board a single

cent and as I stated earlier we know

that this is particularly significant

for many in minority communities

including black and indigenous Canadians

burden and stigma of that criminal

the criminal sure well first of all the

practical effect of a pardon and

expungement are virtually identical and

we have taken an unprecedented step with

the No Fee no wait time pardon process

we're making it we're making it simple

ultimately we were reserving the

expungement process for situations that

would have would have been covered by

the Canadian Charter of Rights and

Freedoms so in this case we're moving

with the process that's efficient that

takes into account also the fact that

that police agencies and the court

system across Canada have different

record-keeping procedures and an

application based pardon process is one

that will most quickly and most

efficiently allow people to clear their

record

possession are there actually people in

Canada as far as you know

yeah to my understanding no one's

actually sitting in jail as a result of

a conviction for possession of cannabis

that being said there might still be

some community service obligations or

other things that were part of a

sentence and in that case we're not

going to interfere as a government with

a sentence that's been duly imposed by a

court

we wouldn't interfere in that regard so

those people have to finish their

sentence that being said if the sentence

is done if if if the the sentence has

been completed but there's still some

sort of fine or a surcharge that has yet

to be paid those people will be able to

apply for a pardon immediately know

they'll be able to apply for the pardon

they'll get the pardon the fine the fine

is with different agencies or or other

organizations so that wouldn't that

wouldn't be something that's covered in

the application process with with the

RCMP

any sovereign country has the right to

control who goes in and who who goes

into their country so that is in a sense

beyond our control what what is within

our control and what is important here

is that the the criminal record will no

longer show up in any sort of

verification database so the Canadian

database is CPEC won't show a criminal

won't show that criminal conviction

anymore

and so that's usually what the American

border agents will be checking now if

they for some other reason had some

prior contact that a person may have had

within their own database was in an

American database showing a conviction

possession that might still show up but

but the current the current Canadian

database moving for will no longer show

that criminal that that criminal

conviction

[Music]

does that hardener race I'll leave that

to Minister gödel's the the what we are

doing here is is simply the pardon

process for simple simple cannabis

possession enough rather not for other

crimes

[Music]

the the the pardon to my understanding

is almost instantaneous there there are

no criteria other than a simple

possession and having completed the

sentence so it will take it will take a

few weeks to get it done whereas before

it would take a few months so this is

this is an unprecedented thing for the

reasons that I've just raised a minute

ago the record-keeping across Canada not

being uniform through different

provinces and and police services we're

not quite sure we think that there are

up where there may be upwards of 250,000

people who have in some way shape or

form some kind of cannabis possession

conviction we're hoping by expediting

this process to make the number of

people who have access to it to the

pardon reach into the thousands but it

will never get up to that point some of

those people have died etc so because

the record-keeping is non-uniform we

don't actually have the answer this is

what our best prediction is
