Manitoba manhunt this is now day number

nine the search goes on for to Port

Alberni British Columbia man wanted for

three murders we heard a little bit

informally today from some of the RCMP

talking about what happened on Sunday

and Monday when they pursued a tip to

York Landing Manitoba that was a tip

they thought would be very credible one

in which they sent a lot of manpower

into that community we heard about how

they flew RCMP members in there and how

the locals basically provided vehicles

pickup trucks they were assisting

because the RCMP had no vehicles at the

time they got in there they assisted

they searched dogged Lee for about 24

hours almost 24 hours and that search

though turned up nothing so where does

the search go from here there was a

briefing here this morning the tactical

and the other officers here getting

their orders about what they will do for

today we know the RCMP is pursuing about

260 tips that they've received over the

last seven days some better than others

that one we described not so productive

but they are pursuing those leads

questions are starting to be asked about

how long this particular investigation

can go on in its current form there's a

lot of officers here from the RCMP

there's military involved we've not

heard officially about any change in

that from the perspective of what we see

here there's certainly no let-up in the

number of people they have involved in

this but now with day 9 of this search

the real proof in the pudding is going

to be whether they can find these two

men either dead or alive Sean O'Shay
