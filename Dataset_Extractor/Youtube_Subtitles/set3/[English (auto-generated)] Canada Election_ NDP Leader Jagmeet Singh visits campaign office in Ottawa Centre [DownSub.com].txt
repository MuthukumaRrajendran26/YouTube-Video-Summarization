territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe

people so thank you everyone for being

very very happy to be joined by our

leader Jack beat Singh

some amazing candidates from SD SG

Chelsea Catherine Schmitz dudes actor

[Music]

maxxium I was in electoral Stephanie

mercy a sample Salman Taseer della piet√†

walks on a PC my particular of my messy

and not chef dragged me things that

family new job three I am so proud to be

running for this party

under jug meets leadership not only am i

proud of who the leader is his

background his story but I'm even more

proud of the bold progressive platform

we're offering to Canadians because that

is the true test of a leader art

platform is a road map for climate

justice social justice and economic

justice for all

[Applause]

now those of you who know me know that I

have a little experience with justice

and the justice system I was raised in a

family that spent a lot of time thinking

about justice you may know that my mom

Louise Arbour was a war crimes

prosecutor a High Commissioner for Human

Rights for the United Nations and a

justice at the Supreme Court of Canada

and my god Larry Taman has spent much of

the latter part of his career working

internationally on reforming justice

system so I couldn't be more proud of

both of them I've had my own experience

with the justice system of course as you

know I was a federal prosecutor I took

on corporate tax evaders human smugglers

environmental polluters a chance for a

short while to be involved in the team

that was prosecuting a small little

known company called Essen sealable and

some of you may have heard of it I don't

know it's been from time to time it

comes up but really I think what's so

exciting is that the NDP's platform the

New Deal for people makes it clear who

New Democrats are in it for we are not

in it for the fossil fuel companies that

the Liberals have been subsidizing

despite promising us to stop that

practice four years ago in fact we're in

it for you which is why we're gonna stop

giving big polluters corporate welfare

and invest instead in renewable energy a

just transition for fossil fuel workers

and big time into our public transit

system which is very fitting with the

opening of the LRT earlier today and

what we're gonna do is we're gonna work

towards free public transit for all but

meet and I both know that there's no

climate justice without social justice

and that's why we're not about big

pharma they've successfully lobbied

liberals and conservative governments to

let them keep charging Canadians

exorbitant drugs for their

pharmaceuticals no because we're in it

for you and that's why we're gonna bring

in universal single-payer pharmacare to

save Canadians money

[Applause]

[Music]

everyday we're not in it for corporate

developers looking to get rich off the

backs of people who are just looking for

a decent place to call home and that's

why we're going to invest in non-profit

affordable housing units across Canada

so that everybody can live in dignity

and you may have heard that when it

comes to economic justice we're not in

it for the ultra-rich and the giant

corporations who've been getting off too

easy for too long that's why we're in it

for you every day and we're gonna ask

Canadians with more than twenty million

dollars to pay a little bit more just a

little bit it's not a big deal so that

we can improve the lives of every single

person in this country by properly

funding the public services we all rely

on jugni is the only leader who's shown

the courage to take on these vested

interests and that's why I'm so proud to

be part of his team so for all these

reasons I'm proud to be standing with

dread meat saying shoulder to shoulder

and with the NDP to say that we are in

it for all of you jug meat is the only

leader taking on the rich and the

well-connected he's the only leader

who's gonna stand up to powerful insider

lobbyists and he's the only leader who's

actually on our side so that's why I'm

so proud to be running for the NDP in

this election with drug me it is my

enormous pleasure to introduce you to my

friend our leader jug meat Singh

how's it going friends

come on so funny they mean okay I want

to practice somebody something with you

I'm gonna ask you are you ready and the

responses can be we ready you got it

like from the song are you ready are you

ready okay it sounds like you're ready

but now we got to do it in French to

really know if you're ready so ask who's

that spray only play ask you that ask

you who the play

okay miss Tom lick it was at play

friends

first of all Emily first of all it's our

Stephanie Stephanie did an incredible

job introducing shows the quality of our

candidates powerful young women give it

up to Stephanie at it and and Emily Wow

if you didn't know her track record she

is a powerful voice for people she is an

incredible lawyer and I didn't know may

come and they may have a cut at

Haleakala can adapt our Canadian

magazine don't go away

Canadian lawyer magazine don't see if a

and they inquire bleakman candy that I

only try third the EF del la Buckley did

not resume who live in you do Canada and

the thing is we need a new vision for

Canada because here in Ottawa we're

hearing a lot of people worried about

the future

Emily touched on health care and housing

one of the things I really want to focus

in is on young people and when you talk

to young people today you look in their

eyes

instead of hope and excitement their

eyes are filled with worry despair and

fear and what are they most worried

about let me talk to young people

the worried about our climate the worry

about not about climate change they're

worried about climate crisis they're

worried about catastrophic climate

change and we will look at a young

person in the eyes today I want us to be

able to look back and tell them that you

know what we did everything we can and

we are doing everything we can

to fight this crisis oh say on Seikaly

impact this decreased climatic a fail on

a on a on a vague hughley's impact EC at

Ottawa avec le new innovation don't

compile the the LAN party climb under

his climatic see CEC Ottawa je parle

avec leisure you know do love my song

when you meet someone who's lost their

home or is it worried about losing their

home because of extreme weather

conditions there's no words to describe

that fear and that pain because your

home is one of your most precious places

a place where you should feel safe but

because of extreme weather

fueled by climate crisis people are now

losing their homes we know it's real and

so we owe it to people to tell them what

we are gonna tackle this crisis with all

the strength that we can muster to deal

with it seriously because it is serious

but I'm also very hopeful because if we

change the direction of this country we

can actually create a lot a lot of

opportunity and that's why I want to

talk about our collage Gino Columbus at

Aquila his climatic I want to talk about

our power to change our vision and our

commitment to tackle the climate crisis

when we look at the crisis a lot of the

reasons why we're in this position today

we took it all the concerns we have

whether it's housing or health care or

this climate crisis the reason we're

here today is because of decisions that

have been made at the federal level by

governments in Ottawa liberal and

conservative who have chosen to make

life easier for the wealthiest life

easier for the richest and harder for

everyone else so if we want to tackle

climate crisis we have to have the

courage to take on the biggest polluters

we have to be able to call an end for

fossil fuel subsidies right now

and say exactly must've come about there

come here Johnny Don's on Google mo nail

Democrat on the annual a Lisa bone song

battle yeah that was a pretty good line

I got a scene in English as well on

there on the first day of a new

democratic government we will

immediately end all fossil fuel

subsidies day one we know that we know

that judo is not the way we know that

Shiro is not the way for Casca lady

angela dixiano his climatic melody

occasion solutio pasa via she tell

people in come on first attack he liked

his climatic on a shot on people in

c'est pas possible defesa

he thinks that it's okay to on one day

declare a climate emergency and on the

next day to expand the building of a

pipeline that is not what climate

leaders do climate leaders and fossil

fuel subsidies and invest in renewable

energy creating 300,000 good jobs of

quality for the future and I'm and I'm

pretty sure I'm pretty sure I don't need

to say this but I'm gonna say it anyway

we know that when it comes to the

climate crisis or any other concerns

that Canadians have that the

Conservatives are not the answer they're

gonna cut taxes for the wealthiest and

cut services that you and your families

need and they're gonna make the climate

crisis even worse because it's very

uncertain if they even believe that

there's one going on donk sukham

proposed set cohosh - year notice a

vision a new deal for people one that

puts people at the heart of everything

we do

a plan that says we can expand our

health care to include Pharma care for

all like we can go beyond that to

include dent

CAIR Vision Care Hearing Care mental

health services addiction care a new

deal for people that says that everyone

can have a place to call home by

building half a million new affordable

homes across this country and a new deal

and a new deal for people that says we

can tackle the climate crisis by

retrofitting every home by investing in

public transit by electrifying

electrifying transportation creating

300,000 new jobs and building a bright

future so we can look at young people in

the eyes and say you know what when the

climate crisis came looming we did

everything we could and we were with you

all the way so I'm gonna need your help

one more time I'm not the best singer

but I want to try this out so we renewed

a new deal for the people and I need you

to join with me it's gonna go and I need

everyone to join in so it's what we have

is a new deal for the people
