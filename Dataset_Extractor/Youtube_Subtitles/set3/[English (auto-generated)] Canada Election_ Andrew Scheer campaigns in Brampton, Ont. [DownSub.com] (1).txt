[Applause]

and I know that with your help on every

single door we knock on every person we

meet and we pass that message on we're

gonna make sure that he's our prime

minister so friends so friends please

join me in welcoming our leader and the

next prime minister of this great

country

Andrew cheer thank you very much merci

beaucoup - Laveau let's give a big round

of applause for our pad he is one of our

hardest-working we have great candidates

all across the can all across the

country but our pet is one of the

hardest one when we have this we have

this big board in the campaign office

this big bar that shows how many doors

knocked every single day and our pin is

always right near the top if not the top

every day thank you so much our band for

all your hard work I just want to know

something for today I need your help

with something you know sometimes early

on the campaign you need to feel a bit

of the sense of what's on the ground

what people are here at the doors I just

want to ask you are we going to win

Brampton North I was thinking that was

the case but I'm glad to hear you say it

I know we're gonna win Brampton north

because I know we're gonna win seats all

across the GTA all across Ontario

because everywhere I go people are

telling me the same thing

then under Justin Trudeau life keeps

getting more and more expensive he

raises our taxes the cost of living goes

up and everywhere we look Justin Trudeau

is not addressing the needs of Canadians

his massive deficits are threatening our

social programs and their meaning that

more and more of your hard-earned tax

dollar is going to pay the interest on

that debt

now remember this is 2019 this is the

year that he promised that he would

Masari this is the year that he promised

the budget would balance itself it's not

balanced billions and billions of new

debt making sure that your taxes will go

up after the election when he doesn't

need your vote but he still needs

your money so this question the this

ballot question this campaign is coming

down to one simple test who do you trust

to make life more affordable to help you

get ahead is it Justin Trudeau is it me

and the Conservative Party we know that

over 80% of Canadian families are paying

higher taxes today than they were just

four years ago and the carbon tax is

making everyday essentials more

expensive things like gasoline and home

heating and the groceries you buy now

I'm gonna here to tell you we've made

some announcements this election

campaign one that is we've made quite a

while ago was that job number one the

very first piece of legislation that our

pan is gonna have to vote on and I know

which way he's gonna vote will be called

an act to repeal the carbon tax that's

job number one we know the carbon tax

doesn't do anything to lower emissions

it just makes life more expensive and it

makes everything else you buy cost more

as well so we're gonna cancel the carbon

tax we're gonna go one step further

because in Canada in the winter it's not

a luxury to heat your home it's a

necessity so we're going to take the GST

and HST off of home hydro and home

energy bills that's gonna put more money

back in the pockets of Canadians and for

new moms and dads when new parents take

maternity leave or parental leave they

end up foregoing a huge percentage of

their paycheck and at the end of it the

government comes along and taxes it away

so we are going to take we are going to

make maternity leave benefits tax-free

for Canadians now is there anybody here

today that ever takes a go bus or a go

train alright remember when you used to

get a tax credit for your monthly pass

or your presto pass and remember Justin

Trudeau cancelled that well just this

morning at a go bus depot I made an

announcement that as Prime Minister I

will

bring back the public transit tax credit

[Applause]

so we are only a few days into this

campaign and we are already unveiling

new ideas to make sure that you keep

more of your hard-earned money so that

you can get ahead because that's what

this election is all about making life

more affordable and that is the choice I

know the Canadians are tired of the

scandal and the corruption that Justin

Trudeau has been plagued with since he

became Prime Minister you know just this

week we learned that the RCMP is looking

into the SNC Laughlin affair but Justin

Trudeau won't let people tell the RCMP

what happened he's blocking them so I'm

gonna make this call every single day

until October 21st Justin Trudeau needs

to waive the cabinet confidences so the

RCMP can get to the bottom of his

corruption scandals you can't be the

maker of laws in this country if you are

a breaker of laws in this country the

ladies and gentlemen so that is the

choice I'm asking for your support

please we need your help we need to take

the great message that our pin and our

team of candidates are going to be

working on taking that message door to

door neighbor to neighbor parents

friends siblings we need to get this

positive conservative message out

because I know it's resonating with

Canadians the choice could not be more

clear where Justin Trudeau will raise

your taxes and make your life more

expensive conservatives with lower taxes

and leave that money in your pocket

where Justin Trudeau will call small

business owners tax cheats conservatives

will lower their taxes so they can

create the types of opportunities that

give young people a start in life where

he will abuse the power of his office to

reward his friends and punish his

enemies I will restore ethics and

integrity back to government and shine a

light on his scandals

and where he gets bullied and pushed

around on the world stage I will stand

up for Canada's interest and for

Canadians around the world and where he

will look a veteran in the eye a war

hero someone who has put their life on

this line for this country and tell him

that he is asking for more than he can

give I will honor the service that our

veterans have given to this country and

give them what they deserve

and where he will run massive deficits

add piles of debt to the finances of

this country where he will make life

more expensive and raise your taxes I

will run a government that lives within

its means to leave more money in your

pocket because it's time for you to get

ahead thank you very much

[Applause]
