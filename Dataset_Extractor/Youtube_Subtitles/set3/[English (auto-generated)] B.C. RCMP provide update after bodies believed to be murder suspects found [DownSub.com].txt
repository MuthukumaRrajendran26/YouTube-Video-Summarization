good afternoon and thank you for joining

us today my name is Staff Sergeant

Jenelle Schuette we're here to provide

an update with respect to the ongoing

homicide investigations in northern

British Columbia my to my right is

Assistant Commissioner Kevin Hackett who

will read a statement in English

followed by Staff Sergeant Annie lintel

who was read a statement in French and

then we will open the floor for

questions good afternoon and thank you

for coming here this afternoon for this

update into the status of the three

homicides in northern British Columbia

I'd like to begin by reiterating that

given the information announced earlier

today by our CMP colleagues in Manitoba

that the search for the suspects in the

three northern British Columbia

homicides has resulted in a discovery

this morning at approximately 10 a.m.

our CMP officers located two male bodies

in the dense brush this was within one

kilometer from where the items linked to

the suspects were found this is

approximately eight kilometers from

where mr. dicks burnt rav4 vehicle was

located Manitoba RCMP has confirmed that

the autopsies are being scheduled in

Winnipeg to confirm their identities and

to determine the cause of death while we

are still waiting for the definitive

confirmation of the identities of the

two deceased men we believe that they

are in fact the individuals that we were

searching for BC RCMP investigators have

spoken to the families of Leonard dick

Lukas Fowler and China DS and provided

them with the latest update the RCMP

will continue to offer support to them

understanding that the traumatic losses

they have gone through do not end with

the deaths of these men whom we believe

to be our suspects will also continue to

offer support to the Port Alberni

families of the two

as they deal with these difficult

developments investigators in British

Columbia have worked tirelessly since

the initial deaths were first reported

to us on Monday July 15th but I'd like

to stress that our investigative efforts

have not concluded yet we still need to

ensure that our investigative findings

whether its statements evidentiary

timelines physical or digital evidence

continues to confirm our investigative

theory and eliminates any other

possibilities or suspects until that is

completed we will not conclude this file

we continue to consult with the bc

prosecution service with respect to the

next steps and are mindful that a

positive confirmation that our suspects

are deceased does not impact the options

moving forward I'd like to acknowledge

that this investigation has been one of

the more dynamic and unpredictable of

the BC RCMP has recently undertaken this

investigation and the subsequent search

efforts have crossed multiple provinces

and territories and it's also included

extremely remote locations and impacted

communities and families both nationally

as well as internationally I'd like to

thank our law enforcement partners

across Canada the United States and

Australia for their support and

assistance in particular our colleagues

within the RCMP in Manitoba who

spearheaded the exhaustive and

challenging search and our province the

perseverance and dedication has resulted

in today's announcements finally I'd

like to recognize our partners in the

media locally and internationally who

were instrumental in providing the

latest updates from our investigators in

a timely comprehensive manner the

ongoing public engagement and the media

coverage was key to public awareness and

resulted in police receiving a constant

stream of information and over a 1,000

tips thank you

sukhiya permeable cedars of our

agreement a handsome man in the mill

pissed exploring mercy opportunities

take some questions now

I'll start with the first one regarding

the motive it's going to be extremely

difficult for us to ascertain

definitively what the motive was

obviously we will not have the

opportunity to speak with these

individuals and again the examination of

the area where they were located today

is still being dealt with and searched

so there may be additional items that

could help in that regard identifying a

motive etc but we don't have that

information yet and mr. dick with regard

to his injuries obviously we're from

that we know what those injuries were

but out of respect for mr. dicks

families I don't believe there's any

kind of operational necessity to speak

to the to the injuries out of respect

and sensitivities for the family sake

no that's not that's not the reason why

they weren't charged in order to get to

the threshold of charge approval status

from a crown perspective they require

information they require evidence and it

many times that evidence as in this case

was relying on forensic evidence and

forensic reports and that sometimes

takes some time and understandably until

they have the definitive results of

those examinations they're not in a

position to till a charge until it

happens but we anticipated the charges

were going to be laid while suffice to

say that there is there is significant

evidence that links both crime scenes

together and that is continuing when we

speak about the ongoing effects of the

investigation that has not concluded yet

this is this is early days for the

recovery of the two suspects like I said

we want to bring back all of the

information and all the evidence that we

have our investigators will go through

that meticulously and we'll be in a

better position perhaps in the future

the near future to talk about all of the

linkages perhaps that existed but

suffice to say there were significant

evidence that linked our suspects to

both crime scenes I I'm confident that

there is no further risk to the public

we have no information that suggests

that and given the the extreme nature of

the exposure that this particular

investigation has had I'm confident to

say it's highly unlikely that if there

was an offence it was linked we would be

aware of it but there's nothing to

suggest that there's any outstanding

offenses at this time part of me we're

gonna rely on the results of an autopsy

which will take place tomorrow and and

because it's in Manitoba that will the

responsibility of dealing with that will

be the medical examiner and in Manitoba

and as I said until the autopsy is being

completed until that scene has been

searched we're not in position to

comment I just don't have that answer at

this point investigators are going

through it right now

I'm sorry there there's no other

suspects that we're actively looking at

no

we have no evidence and again without me

looking at every piece of potential

information that lies in some of these

outstanding tips our current belief is

that there is nothing that links our

victims together and there's no

indication that this was was targeted at

this time I don't have that information

currently

well we're always open to looking to see

how we can possibly do things better or

improve our operations from my

experience and from my understanding of

the measures that we took in this

particular case in these cases I think I

stand by our timeliness of advising the

public with information when we knew it

this was a dynamic and constantly

evolving investigation and with the help

of the media we were able to get

information very quickly into the hands

of the public to enhance public safety

I don't know if we could have gone much

quicker than we did based on the

information well I don't think I need to

educate anyone on the geography of this

country but it's a huge country it's and

the area that they traveled is in some

of the areas that are most remote in

this country if you look at the distance

traveled this is like and I looked at on

a map this is like traveling from London

to Moscow to put things into perspective

coupled by the fact that they were

traveling in areas that weren't highly

populated by communities or residents

that sometimes assist in locating their

movements and frankly individuals when

they're on the run or trying to elude

the police take measures to avoid

contact with both the police and the

public too so they can maintain the

freedom for as long as they possibly can

so those factors likely contributed to

their ability to remain undetected for

some time sorry

well I would start and again I'm not in

the mind of these individuals at this

point but if you if you look at the

route they took they they decided likely

and again I don't know this to be a fact

but they decided to take that particular

route and I'm surmising that they chose

to go on the north and not down to the

south more regularly traveled roads

because that could have enhanced

detection No

I'm sorry I don't have any information

in regards to that at all I can't speak

specifically to what other measures we

could have could have taken in this

particular case we we rely on the

information that we have the the

timeliness of the information we may get

information that is not verifiable until

it's checked or verified and it's it's

it's a it's a balance sometimes before

speaking with the median giving

erroneous information that could end up

complicating matters so we want to be

sure before we alert the public's

assistance that we're actually looking

for the right type of vehicle etc and we

will also want to examine evidence as it

comes in we may get hundreds of tips

which may include the examination a

detailed examination of hours of

surveillance cameras or video for etc

that takes time and you know that that

played a role in us assisting us in this

investigation I understand you have many

questions and

there may be an opportunity for that in

the future but I'm not in a position to

speak about that today thank you thank

you very much
