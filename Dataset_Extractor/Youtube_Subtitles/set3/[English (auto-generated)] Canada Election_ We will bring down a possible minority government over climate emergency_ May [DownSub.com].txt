hello I'm Mercedes Stevenson and this is

the West walk politics perspectives and

players

[Music]

the images of Liberal leader Justin

Trudeau and black face and brown face

have made headlines around the world

putting the liberal campaign into

heavy-duty damage control mode and de

railing their plans for the week

Trudeau's longtime friend Green Party

leader Elizabeth May is now questioning

the Justin Trudeau she thought she knew

and her friendship with the Liberal

leader

she's calling on him to do more to

address racism in Canada

here's that conversation Elizabeth me

thank you so much for sitting down with

us it's great to see you Thank You

Mercedes it's been a pretty tough week

the past week for Justin Trudeau and the

Liberals on the campaign three different

incidents of the liberal leader in

blackface or brown face what is your

response to that I'm so deeply shocked

those who know me know it's hard to

believe that I'm finding trouble finding

the words I usually don't have trouble

articulating my feelings but I find this

deeply troubling and really shameful

behavior and it's inexplicable that

Justin Trudeau could be three times

recorded I mean it seems to be something

he likes to do which is racist behavior

do you think that he's fit to be the

Prime Minister of Canada and given

there's been three incidents I belong to

a tradition that is prepared to forgive

but he has to express for two to me and

all Canadians why we should forgive him

at this point it is behavior that hurts

people

it hurts children of color it hurts

indigenous peoples it hurts all of us

who care about really eradicating racism

from this culture from the society yet

puts its it puts it right in our face

that racism is alive and well in Canada

and that is unforgivable he admitted to

two occasions when he was asked he

didn't talk about the third given that

he apologized for two of them but he

didn't disclose this additional one that

we've confirmed do you think that

there's concerns about how many times

it's may have happened

I don't want to sound unfair but it's

transparent that he apologizes for the

incidents that he thinks are in

distribution and circulation

he apologizes when he's caught and he

should have come out before any of this

became public do you think well at this

point I can't feel certain that I know

who he is anymore I can't feel certain

that there aren't other pictures

circulating among friends with more of

this sort of thing so we know that he

apologized and confirmed two incidents

because he must have known those two

incidents were already in the hands of

his political enemies how much more

could there be out there and what

possible explanation is there for this

racist behavior which surfaces not once

not twice but now three times his camp

says that he has demonstrated policies

that clearly show he's progressive that

he's not racist he has said that he

regrets this that it was a mistake but

given the three incidents do you feel

that you could support a liberal

government in a minority situation led

by Justin Trudeau there's no question

for me that I find mr. shear and Liberal

Party policies at mr. Trudeau

unacceptable at this point but the

nature of Westminster parliamentary

democracy is that after an election you

meet with everyone and figure out what's

in the best interest of this country and

I want to reiterate because a lot of us

as Canadians get wrapped up in US

politics and u.s. style politics where

the leader of the party is actually a

presidential candidate and their name is

on every ballot we have to remember in

Canada we have a different system the

only seat the only place Justin Trudeau

is actually running where his name is on

the ballot is in Papineau the only place

where my name is on the ballot is

insanity Gulf Islands and depending on

the results of the election I mean

within a very short time after the 2015

election the leader of the Conservative

Party wasn't Stephen Harper it was rana

ambrose so i won't deal in hypotheticals

at this stage i need to see what happens

after the election what is the will of

canadians as expressed at the ballot box

because my my number one commitment

is to doing what's best for Canada right

now my trust in it's hard to have any

trust I mean so many promises were

broken that mattered and I'm just here

today at the Assembly of First Nations

British Columbia meeting and it rings in

my ears and it rings so hollow that no

relationship is more important to us

than our relationship with indigenous

peoples and it rings in my head and it

rings so hollow that 2015 will be the

last election held under

first-past-the-post and it rings in my

head so Hollow

no government could approve a pipeline

that went through a process as flawed as

the anyb review of trans mountain these

were promises that I believed so I will

always talk to all other party leaders

after an election campaign to put

together a parliament if we're in a

minority situation which I clearly hope

we will be I would not want to see this

country with a majority Liberal

government or a majority Conservative

government majorities in this country

based on first-past-the-post give a

hundred percent of the power to leaders

who didn't get even a majority of the

votes so I will always do what I think

is in the best interest of Canada and

try not to make firm hypothetical

projections we really don't know what in

what will happen in this government you

might end up asking Justin Trudeau if

he's prepared to support a green

government who knows the Conservatives

have said that mr. Trudeau is a

hypocrite do you think that he's had

threat now I there's it's hard to I mean

for me on the climate issue his policies

are hypocritical on indigenous issues

his policies are hypocritical on racism

which is really more is so deeply

disturbing I don't think he is addressed

adequately perhaps even within his own

heart and soul what it is as a person of

privilege and any anybody with white

skin as a person of privilege that's

just the reality of our lives if you

don't actually unpack who you are unpack

all the cultural benefits all the

political benefits all the societal

reality that our society discriminates

against people of color if you don't

truly get that then you need to do

a lot of work and I think this speaks to

andis as one of the liberal candidates

here earlier today said all of us have

to do a lot of work and I'm prepared to

accept that but it's it's certainly

smacks of hypocrisy Miz may I have to

ask you as a party leader have you ever

worn brown face or black face or have

any of your candidates or in brown place

or black face that you're aware of

absolutely

never have I done such a thing it's it's

appalling and I don't think that any of

our candidates are hiding anything from

us one dear friend of mine just

contacted the party to say I did once

and this is of course a well-known

Canadian satirist and comic Greg Malone

who was a founder of Catco he's running

in Avalon and he let us know that in one

of the skits that was broadcast on CBC

several decades ago I haven't seen the

skit but there was a skit in which he

wore a black face but it was as I said

it was it was part of us a comedy skit

on Cod Coe in on and broadcasts on

national public broadcaster but it's

still you know in retrospect he wishes

he hadn't done it do you think you

should still be allowed to run as a

candidate he still wore a blackface

again it at the time it met it wasn't a

hidden video it wasn't a hidden event it

was published it was part of a national

very well loved comedy show and I

haven't reviewed it but I he is a he he

is very upfront about it and he didn't

hide it but if if black-faced is wrong

for Justin Trudeau in a yearbook why

isn't it wrong for a Green Party

candidate on a major national

broadcaster I think that the context of

it being a comedy show in an era where

it was broadcast on national television

was not something that was hidden and it

was not something that he would do today

and I know Greg extremely well they're

not multiple incidents and it wasn't

part of a private life entertainment

that he thought was appropriate so given

the outrageousness of cod co in the day

I think it falls in a different category

when it comes to Andrew Shearer you've

raised questions about whether or not

you can support him based on his

comments on indigenous people around

natural resource projects would you be

willing to support a conservative

minority government the reality of it is

that Andrew sheers comments on equal

marriage we were the first party to call

for equal marriage the speech that has

appeared it makes his views which are

appalling completely unacceptable to me

I've been attacked by the NDP because I

keep going back to what our first

principles of how Westminster

parliamentary democracy works I'm not

prepared to sign a blank check for any

of the other party leaders none of the

other parties have taken the climate

emergency seriously and in that I

include the NDP but that doesn't mean I

don't want to work with them when the

election is over we have got to find a

way to get past the hyper partisanship

of our system I've called for the other

leaders to form an internal cabinet

focusing only on climate within which we

work together because the people of

Canada don't like squabbling I know they

don't they don't like to hear people

arguing over each other they want us to

work like grown-ups sit down together

and figure out how to best serve our

country there's nothing in the

conservative platform that could induce

me to support that platform but after an

election would I talk to the leader of a

Conservative Party talk to the leader of

your democratic price talk to the leader

of the Liberal Party whomever those

people may be to serve the interests of

Canada this is a possibility that you

would support any of those parties in a

minority situation if we put and we will

we will bring down any government on the

very first confidence vote if there's a

failure to take the climate emergency

seriously by which we mean that we must

hold global average temperature to no

more than 1.5 degrees which means a

doubling of the target that Canada is

operating right now we're operating

under the same target Stephen Harper

left in place it's the same target

Justin Trudeau says it's important same

target is Andrew Shearer and well the

current target is 30%

Jack Mason wants to take it to 38

percent it must be a 60 percent cut by

2030 or the window of opportunity on our

kids living in a secure human

civilization can respond to the climate

catastrophes that are coming

no matter what we do we're in for a

rough ride the question is to have a

rough ride that we can plan for survive

and thrive or do we set a course where

our kids through their lifetimes may not

have a viable human civilization to

support society and support economy

that's our bottom line we will bring

down any government regardless of its

composition if there is a failure to

respond in a concrete committed and

serious manner to the climate

catastrophe is that exclusively the

target that you're setting it's not my

target it's driven by science and you

can't negotiate with physics we are told

there is a carbon budget we are told by

the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

Change that we have one opportunity and

one opportunity only to change the

course that we're now on so that's not

my target it's tougher than I expected

it would have to be but we revised our

targets based on the report of the

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

Change we have the most detailed

reasonable it's ambitious but mission

possible to deal with the climate

emergency is a plan that can work it's

not mission easy and people say it's you

know I've said it target the greens have

set targets that are unreachable this is

the thing they're the targets that

matter and if we fail we don't fail a

political promise we fail our children

in a very real way and our grandchildren

and I'm a grandmother before I'm a

politician and I will not do that

let's talk about your platform it was

released last week yeah we got a look at

it everyone knows Elizabeth me and the

environment and the Green Party and the

environment but it was first chance the

Canadians have really had to get some in

depth peeks at your policies on issues

not related to the environment

everything from national defense to

health care what are the promises that

you make in there well several promises

in terms of funding would be free

education yeah childcare yeah pharma

care dental care that has to be several

billion dollars always more than that

where's the money coming from tonight

well I hope very shortly and and the

delay I apologize for the delay we we

sister and I'm very grateful I have to

say the Parliamentary Budget Office has

assigned its some very brilliant top

analysts to look at all of our

where we think we'll find the revenue

what the programs will cost and we're

committed to finding a balanced budget

along the same timeline is the

Conservatives so we we have revenue

sources we've costed our platform and in

a number very few days Canadians will be

able to look for themselves where we

find the revenue but we increase the

large transnational corporate tax rate

we increase taxes on our commercial

banks we look to finding the offshore

money hanging out and hiding out as was

revealed in the Panama papers we're also

looking at ecommerce we have a lot of

companies that make a lot of money in

Canada and pay virtually no tax whether

it's Amazon or Facebook or Google we

also have a financial transaction tax

and on and on cutting some corporate

loopholes and of course stopping fossil

fuel subsidies which is now in Trudeau

promised and fossil fuel subsidies

actually Stephen Harper promised in 2009

- and fossil fuel subsidies they've gone

up since then so ending those subsidies

immediately saves us billions of dollars

are you looking at an increase in income

tax no individuals at all no not at all

so I'd note no tax increase on the real

backbone of our economy small business a

lot of people have said we should be

decreasing the corporate tax rate in

order to be competitive with the United

States where there's been cuts if you're

raising it are you risking driving big

international business out of Canada I

don't believe so there's money to be

made I have a lot of confidence in

entrepreneurs I go back to having worked

in governor in the 1980s and when we

were fighting acid rain the biggest

point source of pollution in North

America was inko and they threatened to

close their doors to put everybody out

of work if they were forced to meet the

standards that the Mulroney

administration was putting forward to

fight acid rain and you know what they

did they having said that they go out of

business having threatened its general

job blackmail as the usual tactic as

soon as they realized there was no

escaping it the government's

provincially and federally were holding

firm and they had to meet these

standards they figured it out they

installed new technology and they made

more money than ever so I have a lot of

confidence in the ability of large

companies large transnationals I'd like

them to put away their lawyers get out

their engineers and get to work because

this is an opportunity for a new

economic

revolution that will create jobs and

create wealth while not destroying our

future in the process one last thing I

don't think we've ever talked about we

talked about your passion a lot which is

environment and now I get to ask you

about mine which is defense and security

NATO and Nora mm-hmm do you think that

we should stay in those alliances I

think we need to constantly refresh and

review what is the strategic imperative

for Canada right now our single largest

security threat is the climate crisis

and we need to look at where our

alliances are we need to work look at

our role within the United Nations on

peacekeeping where we still ranked 59th

in the world our relationship with NATO

is very important but I want to review

it to see if we can use our influence

within NATO to address another huge

threat which is now be coming back

brightening for our face which is

nuclear disarmament we have Donald Trump

and Putin renouncing the work done by

Gorbachev and Reagan we need to pay

attention to nuclear disarmament and if

our NATO alliances and our NATO allies

can work with us to work towards nuclear

disarmament to make the world safer then

that alliance is very valuable but if

they won't we have to re-examine it

that's an incredibly potentially massive

international policy shift to talk about

moving away from NATO or NORAD Canada

gets a lot of quid pro quo

you know money in kind and we get help

from the United States where we're able

to defend our airspace because if

there's a NORAD are you worried that if

you put those things on the table

because you want to cut off any

relationship with nuclear weapons you

could jeopardize Canadian sovereignty

Canadian sovereignty is at risk when we

when we drop our own in interests right

now our northern coastline is

inadequately protected we need to have

more surveillance at on water and in the

air at for instance the f-35 is not in

Canada's interests except for the

alliances with NATO look at the current

situation in terms of where is the real

threat of an action by a foreign power

to take over Canada it's less likely to

be bombardment from the air it's more

likely to be working through cyber

security threats turning off all the

subways and all the water treatment

plants all at once we're in a new

era and conventional warfare is

conventionally deployed is I think I'm

likely an anachronism we're looking at

autonomous weapons we're looking at the

threat of which is something we're very

concerned about in terms of the

workplace and the life of work of

Canadians what's the impact of

artificial intelligence we're also

looking at what's the impact of

autonomous artificial intelligence in

terms of military application we need to

actually be what we've been in the past

we punch above our weight globally we

need to identify the real threats that

are coming at us not the ones we see in

our rearview mirror but experts would

say that North Korea and Iran are still

very much developing missiles and those

missiles could be shot down over

Canadian airspace would you want Donald

Trump being able to make those decisions

exclusively we were not a part of

neurotic I think we have to also look at

our relationships with Iran we have to

look at our relationships I mean that

Trump's done real damage to what was

growing as an Iran commitment which

everyone says all international

observers say they were living up to

their commitments on the nuclear

agreement that had been struck with the

previous Obama administration the world

became less safe when Donald Trump

decided to repudiate that agreement

matcom from France made a recent bid to

try to get Iran to keep to those targets

even while Trump has repudiated them I

think Canada needs to open an embassy in

Tehran we need to keep lines of

communication going even in a government

and the policies that we may deplore

having good links strong diplomacy has

always been candid a strong suit and we

need to redeploy and rebuild the elite

nature of our foreign service it's been

denigrated under Stephen Harper we have

a lot of work to do but I don't think it

makes sense to say that we go you know

go solely through whatever the United

States is saying or solely through what

NATO is saying we have strong

multilateral alliances through the

United Nations we need to be mindful of

all the places where we can deploy our

our strong suit which is we are we have

never been described as a big military

nation we are as Lloyd Axworthy said

soft power we punch above our weight and

when we

do so we do it in the interest of world

peace and in the interest of the global

human family which is why our platform

is designed around the sustainable

development goals to end poverty provide

clean water address the lack of

education for women and girls around the

world and within Canada so we have a

proud of our platform by the way and

we've always done by the way a full

platform this isn't the first time that

we've addressed all the issues but I'm

so happy that in this election the Green

Party is being taken seriously and

people are looking at the platform and

if you just did punching the kicking the

tires on where are you on defense where

are you in foreign policy I think we

have a very strong set of policies to

make the world a safer place

all those with me thank you so much for

joining us thank you that's all the time

we have for today for the West block I'm
