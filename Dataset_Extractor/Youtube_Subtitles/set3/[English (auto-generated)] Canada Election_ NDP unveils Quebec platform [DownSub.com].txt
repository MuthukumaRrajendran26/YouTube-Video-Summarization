you see become result an eye-catching ad

for a province that needs to be won over

I wanted to show an openness to Quebec

and I wanted to show folks in case that

were worried it's just here underneath

their NDP leader jug meet Singh without

his turban I have the courage to come to

Quebec I've got my guy with the beard

and the turban and I'm running for prime

minister

none of these seats are actually it's 8

seats as we speak so they they could

save a few but they are likely to lose

most of them in Quebec the NDP is in the

fight of its life down to 14 seats from

nearly 60 in Jack Layton's orange wave

of 2011 and only 9 incumbents are

running again in the vote rich province

I think he managed to reassurance troops

that finally he's in command of his

party so but clearly these the Liberals

and the Tories see an opportunity to

make gains at the expense of the NDP and

HP is trying to defend those seats Singh

admits his stance opposing bill 21 is a

challenge the provincial law that bars

public servants wearing religious

symbols from working including turbans

is popular in Quebec I guess it's the

fear of others you know in some regions

there's no nobody has seen a person with

the turban in their life you know in a

real person so it's probably the fear of

unknown and I want folks to know that I

won't back down from doing the right

thing even if it's hard in his platform

seeing made some bold promises more

money and power and getting Quebec to

sign on to the constitution to keep what

they have in terms of support but I

don't think there is anything here that

could alter their status within the

current race which is that they are rain

trailing behind really badly in Quebec

one area where the NDP has made tangible

gains picking candidates they started

way behind now they have 65 candidates

nominated in the 78 Quebec ridings and

the party says they expect to hit a

hundred percent in the next couple of

days
