I just started building crosses as a way

to show other people that I'm sharing

your pain I know what you've gone

through even more so but you you can't

let hate of somebody killing your friend

become because then you become that bad

person sooner or later so my message is

simply start by loving yourself and

everybody else will love you because if

you don't love yourself you're gonna

become that gunman someday and it's you

know you may think it's political and

they can stop it you can't stop it's

impossible it's just you know either

copycats or anger you've got 20 crosses

here today presumably I brought 20 down

here today

how many crosses have you built since

you've been doing this I built 26

thousand eight hundred and ten to date

they're not built until they have a name

on them what does that tell you about

where America is at that you've built

26,000 crosses you know you know I'm

from Chicago and I don't know you know

we have we have 580 homicides last year

in Chicago and but you know in all in

all homicides have gone down in America

but we're looking at the big deals so

the year I got married in Chicago we had

a 921 homicides were at 520 we've come

down and

it's just that uh when I think of the

numbers here I can't think of that

you know I think of the people I don't

think of the numbers you know and you

know I don't know if you've seen any of

my notebooks I have 75 notebooks full of

this and what I end up getting is all

the phone numbers and you got to ask

another question what is it like for you

to come to an event like this where

you've you've had 20 lives lost in an

instant it's like a day in hell

so you know

I just want everybody to know that this

doesn't define you

why do you keep doing this keep getting

asked more and more to do it I don't see

how I could deny somebody that asks me

when I've done it for everybody else you

know I'm sure you understand I do it for

Muslims I do it for the Squirrel Hill in

Pennsylvania that's that they send a god

I do if the see Ikes I do it for the

atheists I do it for anybody that asks

so I guess I got myself in a position

where I don't see it as bad anymore I

see it as I'm helping you know in a way

that nobody else could possibly do it

because not just that because I've done

it everywhere else it's it's like

they're looking for me to do this not

you know if somebody else went copied it

it doesn't wouldn't have the same

meaning of course and of course you

understand driving here 1,500 mile

driving here since Saturday all day

sunday showing up here 4 a.m. and not

sleeping that's part of the message you

know that oh no no we're I got people

coming in from Vermont in Florida today

and in Vegas and LA and I got comfort

dogs that are flying in if you know them

my routine I'm the front guy and I give

them something to go to and a place

where we can all meet and and show each

other were it's it's love that's kind of

winter

how many of these mass shooting events

just like this one have you been to now

I've been to all of them just as I

sneaked in and out you know I understand

that when I went to parkland Florida

they didn't figure it out until the

anniversary and the day after you know

go figure you know I'm pretty you know

in and out you know I did that in

Newtown I snuck in and out

I did that in Boston it's not a you know

so I've been there way too many

shootings

anyway - Minnie do you ever think you'll

reach a point where you don't need to do

this anymore

you know don't be silly this is cancer

it's I'm gonna be doing this don't don't

don't don't give us false hope I'm being

realistic I'm sorry to say that I'm

scared to wake up tomorrow morning so

are you
