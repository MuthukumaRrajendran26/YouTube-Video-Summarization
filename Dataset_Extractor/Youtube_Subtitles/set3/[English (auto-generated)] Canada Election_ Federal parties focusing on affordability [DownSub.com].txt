Adrian Vicente her partner and her

four-year-old daughter have been trying

to find a decent place to live in

downtown Ottawa for two years we haven't

been able to find a place that we can

afford

at least realistically in terms of like

you know being able to feed ourselves

and like having savings and making sure

other things are in check it was even

tougher before her daughter's started

school and she and her partner had to

worry about childcare so we both work

part time because we couldn't afford

full-time childcare that was like

another thing well campaigning

politicians are trying to make life

easier for millions of Canadians like

Vicente jug meat Singh is promising New

Democrats would build 500,000 new

affordable housing units our priorities

are the people behind me the families

that need affordable housing justin

trudeau unveiled a plan that while still

light on some details would provide the

equivalent of a guaranteed annual income

to all parents during a child's first

year of life people should be focused on

spending time with their baby not

worrying about how they'll pay their

bills and Russia r2 is pitching a mix of

tax credits to help parents raise their

kids along with some transit credits and

a universal income tax cut for all

Canadians is I have a plan to put more

money in your pockets so you can get

ahead now none of these will be cheap

all will cost the federal treasury

billions of dollars a year and so far

politicians are only saying they'll tell

us later how they plan to pay for it all

we will have a full costing of the

liberal platform with all the great work

done by the Parliamentary Budget Officer

in due course that now as part of the

exclusive polling the Global News will

bring you throughout the campaign later

this week we're going to talk about some

data which describes how Canadians feel

about all the issues in this campaign

but here's a teaser affordability is the

number two issue overall for all voters

but one in three voters tells Ipsos that

for them affordability is the number one

issue
