medications very expensive they can't

afford it

three million Canadians don't fill their

prescriptions because they can't afford

to I tend to just get that I have to get

and if I can't afford it I'll be perfect

we are announcing today a six billion

dollar down payment over the next three

years a six billion dollar down payment

just to begin to negotiate with the

provinces on big promises Pharma care

and a doctor or nurse practitioner for

all as well as mental health supports so

this is a historic moment actually three

of the federal parties have made a

commitment to implementing universal

public pharmacare the greens and New

Democrats are also promising pharmacare

the NDP are committing to ten billion

dollars a year no question Healthcare is

top of mind for voters but it's also

under provincial jurisdiction the feds

need buy-in for provinces to roll

anything out there is a great desire to

build a drug delivery program which is

based on need and not ability to pay

this is what Universal pharmacare offers

so it's interesting that that there was

not a single province that said no to us

today Trudeau slammed Ontario Premier

Doug Ford by name more than a dozen

times so the question becomes for

Canadians who do you want negotiating

with Doug Ford when it comes to your

health

it could be very expensive and right now

what we have are just essentially some a

little bit of information about how much

the the federal government would be

willing to inject into the system the

Liberal government's own advisory

council on pharmacare peg the cost at

fifteen billion dollars a year but when

asked by reporters today Trudeau offered

no costing and no specifics on a time
