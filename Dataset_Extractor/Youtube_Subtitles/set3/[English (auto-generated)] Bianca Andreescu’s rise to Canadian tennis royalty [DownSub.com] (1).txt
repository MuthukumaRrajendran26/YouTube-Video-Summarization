this is bianca and rescue she is 19

years old and she became the first

Canadian to win the Rogers Cup in 50

years she took on tennis legend Serena

Williams who retired from the game after

an injury going into the match I had

zero expectations I was super nervous

facing a champion on the other side of

the net

and rescue took home the title but not

before showing Williams what Canadian

compassion really looks like you made me

cry on the bench over there I know how

it is to pull out of tournaments and be

injured it's not easy and this wasn't

the way I expected to win and for you to

go off the court but you are truly a

champion Williams was winning tennis

titles before and rescue was even born

and she was ranked the world's number

one in singles eight times in 15 years

but undress Koo is inching her way up

setting records left right and center

the Rogers Cup win means she has ranked

14th in the world making her the top

ranked Canadian tennis player overall

just months ago she also wanted to

Indian Wells Masters I don't get easily

intimidated and I think that's what

stands out for me and I'm just really

proud with how I've dealt with playing

these top players the big question here

is this will and rescue eventually

become the best Canadian tennis player

ever

just ask the lady herself I'm definitely

not satisfied yet I

big dreams ever since I was a little

girl but I'm just gonna keep staying

hungry and motivated
