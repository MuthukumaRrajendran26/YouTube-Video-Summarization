really sorry that the cynical actions of

the pilots union have put us in this

position is by all accounts an own-goal

it's going to punish customers is going

to punish our brand it is going to

punish the rest of the colleagues as you

mentioned over 90 percent they have

already accepted the 11.5% deal and it

will also punish those pilots that want

to come to work every day at Berto is to

make it the best airline in the world

well I don't know how much public

support we have we get a range of mixed

messages what's more important is the

pilots are 100 percent solid

ninety-three percent of British Airways

Pilots voted to go on strike they're the

ones I'm representing in this dispute

they are the ones I'm trying to broker a

deal for on one side this deal is about

pay all the papers filed the strike

itself is only about pay and this 11.5

percent plus one percent deal reflects

what we believe is a general generous

deal but beyond that at the same time

Boresha which has never embarked in such

an investment program as it is right now

6.5 billion pounds in newer planes new

seats new catering new devices for our

crew new training new lounges this is

going on going on at the moment

unprecedented investment times as well

as soon as we found out about the

strikes we began to communicate with our

customers our number one priority was to

make sure that we offer them as many

options as possible and as of this

moment the majority the vast majority of

those passengers have already been real

comedy turd in other airlines nearly 50

airlines that operate in our network as

well as a Cimber away slides right

before or right after that is the focus

right now making sure that every

passenger that wanted to travel today

has had a solution we believe the vast

majority of them do have those solutions

already completed
