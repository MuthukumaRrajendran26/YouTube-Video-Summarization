that wasn't as this election campaign

details about the SNC Laughlin

corruption scandal number one the RCMP

are looking into the Liberal government

for possible obstruction of justice and

number two Justin Trudeau is doing

everything he can to block them his

actions in the SNC levelin affair are

beyond dispute he has done everything he

can to keep these facts hidden from

Canadians the accident substantiated by

ket policia it is now clear more than

ever before that justin trudeau thinks

that there's one set of laws for him and

his powerful friends and one set of laws

for every other hard-working canadians

like you so justin trudeau must allow

the RCMP to do its job and he must

immediately waive privilege and cabinet

confidentiality over the last four years

Justin Trudeau has repeatedly proven

that he can't be trusted but there are a

few things you can count on him to do if

he is reluctant he will keep breaking

his promises his endless deficits will

force him to raise taxes even higher and

his debt will hamper the government's

ability to deliver the public services

we are entitled to as Canadians like

education and health care and his poor

judgment will lead to more scandal at

home and more weakness abroad simply put

whatever so this election is coming down

to who you trust to put more money in

your pockets that you can get ahead and

a conservative government will live

within its means so we can lower taxes

put more money back in the pockets of

canadians so that they can get ahead

it's time for Canadians to get ahead so

that I'm happy to take your questions

you have any options to insist the RCMP

not be blocked from doing their job well

at this point it's quite clear that the

decision to waive cabinet

confidentiality or to make people

available to the RCT arrests with the

Prime Minister

he is not telling the truth when he says

that it's not his decision it is his

decision he has that power he needs to

stop hiding behind the clerk of the

Privy Council take some responsibility

waive that privilege and let the RCMP do

their job okay mr. Trudeau said this

morning it would be counterproductive

right now for the federal government to

get involved in bill 21 what a

Conservative government intervene we do

not have the intention of intervening in

this case we have made it very clear

this is not something that we would do

at the federal level and and that has

been our position from the beginning Oh

ecology proposing the corridor energy

take a locker use new pool ball

regularly to the question on Avvo

vocally this sector Prive como se come

off the proposal a project sure so one

thing that is clear is that all our

candidates and throughout Quebec prefer

that Quebecers and Eastern Canadians

have the ability to purchase Canadian

energy Canadian oil and gas that's why I

proposed the energy of the energy

corridor which will allow Western

Canadian energy to reach Eastern markets

and will also allow Quebec to share its

clean hydroelectricity with other

provinces as well so the idea here is

that we can get all the environmental

concerns a dealt with upfront and engage

in a robust and dynamic consultations

with First Nations before before the

private sector starts proposing

different types of projects that is the

responsibility for a federal government

to take on and the projects that fall

within the federal jurisdiction are the

responsibility of the federal government

and it's essential that can that a

federal government works in

collaboration with the provinces are

feeling and how their finance work work

on their finances but for most of your

adult life that might not have been the

case how do you expect to convince them

that you really do understand and why

does that matter well I made it very

clear that I grew up in a household that

didn't have everything that we ever

wanted but we had a good quality of life

I watched my parents make difficult

decisions I know what the impact of

double-digit mortgage rates had on my

parents and how long it took for them to

climb out of that debt that they

incurred at that time I was also only

able to pay my way through University

thanks to working at small businesses I

worked at a restaurant waiting tables

and worked at an insurance office and

that's why I was so passionate

defending small businesses when Justin

Trudeau called them tax cheats and

that's how you can understand that

Justin Trudeau just

he's never had to work a job he hasn't

like he's never had to pick up extra

shifts to make bills pay you know that's

that's his situation but the fact is we

can see that he doesn't get it in his

actions in its policies attacking small

businesses raising taxes saying that

higher gas prices are exactly what he

wants well millionaire liberals like

Justin Trudeau might not mind paying

higher gas prices hard-working Canadian

families certainly do we miss a clear

Abigail Beeman global news Mr Shearer

I'm curious about your decision to

launch in this specific writing when the

Conservatives haven't held it in decades

if you are hoping

win it how was your strategy different

this time around we are going to win

seats all over Quebec we are going to

surprise people the evening of October

21st we are going to win seats that we

haven't held in a long time we know

that's going to happen because it's

already happened we won a by-election in

Shakuni fjord a seat that we came in

fourth place we won it with a great

candidate we have a great candidate here

in Prague there and we have a great

message for Quebecers and that might

have to be the last question if the race

here one more one more do say we all

that Gagne esparto Quebec on a Gagne in

Excellency s Xavier

Gagne you see mister you say you won't

intervene and go 21 if you if you form

government do you think that the bill

infringes on people was really just

freedom people who are against this this

bill right now are making that case

directly in the courts that is their

right they will have the ability to do

so and the courts will ultimately decide

on that for our part but we will not

proceed with this type of initiative at

the federal level we don't believe that

this is something that we would ever do

but do you believe it infringes do you

do you believe it infringes on religious

right as I said I would never proceed

with this at the federal level we're

gonna see what the courts say I've

always felt that from the moment that

this bill was introduced that it is that

it's not appropriate to be implemented

the federal level that is our position

we're going to maintain that
