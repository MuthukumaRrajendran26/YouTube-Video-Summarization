okay good afternoon everyone I wanted to

just give a couple of updates that we

have and then we'll have some more

detailed updates about the investigation

we have received several media inquiries

to attend our National Night Out event

to make it easier for you to join us we

have arranged for an RTA bus to

transport interested media to the

multiple neighborhood sites in tonight's

program the bus will be at the

convention center at 4:15 and depart

around 4:30 I asked if you're going to

National Night Out to use this because I

don't want our neighborhoods to have a

ton of cars moving in out we're trying

to just be as succinct as possible I'll

be on National Night Out do you feel are

you going yeah so we're all yeah we're

all going and we'll be it will be on a

bus as well so that's that's our offer

to you alright next I'm going to turn it

over to chief bill to provide an update

on the investigation Thank You mayor I'm

joined this afternoon with Todd wicker

ahem this special agent-in-charge for

the Cincinnati FBI office

we provide a brief but important update

on progress investigation of the mass

shooting that occurred in the city of

Dayton on August 4th while we do not

have true clarity of motive of the

assailant based upon evidence obtained

we do have a more developed picture of

the evolving mindset of the assailant

materials reviewed thus far revealed

that the individual had a history of

obsession with violent ideations to

include mass shootings and had expressed

a desire to commit a mass shooting

subsequent material has revealed an

orientation toward violent ideologies

which elevate this case to one a federal

interest

thus the FBI will be taking the central

role in certain aspects of this case

while the Dayton Police Department

continues to focus on the homicide

investigation so I now I asked agent

wicker Hamm to provide more information

about this

an investigative focus however I will

clarify that the information provided

will be very limited and not likely to

be a span expanded upon what is already

being shared agent so uh Thank You mayor

Thank You chief my name is Todd wicker

ham on the Special Agent in Charge for

the FBI Cincinnati field office so the

Dayton police and the FBI have a long

history of working together side by side

in this community including very very

important Joint Terrorism Task Force

assignments that they Denise officers

have as well as our safe streets task

force so working together is nothing new

for us an FBI agent showed up in the

early morning hours in the Oregon

district after this horrific mass attack

so our investigation with Dayton police

is ongoing we have not made any final

investigative conclusions into the

motive of the shooter or if he was

assisted by any other people in this

attack however we have uncovered

evidence throughout the course of our

investigation that the shooter was

exploring violent ideologies and based

upon this evidence we're initiating an

FBI investigation side by side with the

Dayton police homicide investigation to

make sure we get to the bottom and we

explore everything and we ought to try

to understand the best we can why this

horrific attack happened so as we

continue to conduct this investigation

we're striving to do three things what

to figure out three things what if any

ideology influenced the attacker to

conduct this attack who if anyone helped

him or had any advance and knowledge of

his intentions to conduct this attack

and why he committed this specific act

of violence one piece of evidence does

not necessarily constitute a motive

hence the need for a thorough methodical

investigation the case is ongoing so we

cannot provide any detailed information

into our investigative activities at

this time it's absolutely critical that

we do this investigation the right way

this community and our country deserves

an answer as to why this happened so we

ask anybody with additional information

regarding this of

to provide that information to the FBI

tip line it's a tip line that's

available 24/7 for somebody to give

information that tip line is 1-800

if you call there and ask to give

information about the data date and

shooting somebody will take that

information and provide up both of the

Dayton Police Department into the FBI

there's another outlet in which people

can provide any type of digital evidence

that they may have collected whether on

that night or any social media evidence

that they may feel is relevant to why

this attack happened and that can be

provided at WWF bi govt govt backslash

Dayton shooting I also want to thank all

the organizations in this community that

have stepped up to help the grieving

process and the healing process begins

here in Dayton I'll take a couple

questions so I'm not going to get into

specifics as what we found because we're

so early in this investigation there are

so much more material to go through and

evidence to obtain in this investigation

but we have found very specific violent

ideologies that the shooter

we know followed and was interested in

so that has given us enough information

to open up an FBI investigation to make

sure we have every single tool every

investigative capability to figure out

why this happened and to try to make

sure it doesn't happen again

so anybody that wants to to do violence

that is part of what has to be shown to

investigate a federal investigation of

this type and so yeah so we have found

very specific one thing I'll point out

that we have not found any indication

that it's a racial motivation that is

not the any we have not found that

anything that indicates that it's a

racial motivation at this time I'm not

you know again we have a lot to go

through so but different violent

ideologies will cause in this

investigation to be initiated and we

have found evidence of a violent

ideology but I'm not going to I'm not

going to get I'm not get into the get

into the specifics we did not discover

an office computer we're still going

through lots of digital evidence but I'm

not going to tell you exactly where we

found this because we still have a lot

more to go through

agent did he specifically target his

sister we don't we do not have that

information at this time we don't know

so what we what we've saw on this is

this individual the shooter the attacker

in this case very specifically seeking

out information that promotes violence

we are going back as far as we need to

to find try to find out why he did this

and also if anybody else knew about this

or was involved with this we don't know

at this time did the Advanta see I don't

have that information at this time I'm

not going to get any more specifics

about what we do or what we do not know

did the events in El Paso's affect the

timeline of this at all we have not seen

any evidence that the events in El Paso

influenced him at this point again we

have lots of evidence to go through

No we have no evidence that the shooter

was on the FBI's radar prior to this

event thank you thank you special agent

next I'm going to invite assistant chief

Matt Carper to the podium to discuss the

President of the United States this

visit tomorrow Thank You mayor I know

there's been a lot of interest in in a

potential visit from the president into

the Miami Valley area tomorrow we don't

have the specifics yet as soon as we can

get more additional information as it

unfolds we'll release what we're able to

release to the public I know any

closures or inconveniences interruptions

would be minimal so we do understand

that so we'll share more information as

it becomes available and as we're able

to that's all I'm able to offer right

now I'm sorry I'll be able to give you

more information as as the details are

confirmed I'm not aware of any of any

organized protests tomorrow with with

any presidential visit or motorcade

going back decades that is the case we

are always ready for any kind of

dignitary protection assignment like I

said going back decades we've provided

those and and sometimes multiple

occasions per year so yes that is

correct we are ready thank you

you said that he wasn't influenced by

events I didn't say that no I said we

don't have not developed any evidence at

this point that says that he's

influenced by El Paso we still have a

lot of evidence to go through so I'm not

going to say anything else about that I

think we've discussed everything we're

going to discuss about the investigation

so are there any other questions no we

have not I don't know that that's clear

I mean we just we don't have any

specific information to really

understand that this time we just know

what happened you know actually I've

been a little too busy to read the gun

first proposal so until I have a chance

to the region evaluate it I really can't

comment well you were you were all there

so I I don't need to I don't want to

keep on going but you know I don't know

what you're really asking it frankly

actually oh yeah yeah I will welcome in

and the official capacity as mayor since

he is in the office of the President

we're not gonna get any through the

evidence that was seized in that search

for me that's all part of the

investigation and we haven't a chance to

even evaluate someone at this point so

we're done talking about the

investigation so I think we're done with

questions today we appreciate and I'll

see some of you a national night out

thank you
