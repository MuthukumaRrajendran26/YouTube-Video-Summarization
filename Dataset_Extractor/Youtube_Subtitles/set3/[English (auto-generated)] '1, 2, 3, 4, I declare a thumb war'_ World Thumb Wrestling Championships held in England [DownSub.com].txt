they said the rules of thumb wrestling

are we have best of three rounds there

were sixty second rounds to start the

match off we have a professional thumb

ring where people put the thumbs and and

get a good grip inside the ring and then

they'll say one two three four I declare

a thumb war

from there on you've got 60 seconds to

pin your opponent for as long as it

takes to say 1 2 3 4 I win the thumb war

[Music]

thumb is just as good as that and we've

had a mixture of winners over the years

our rigorous training regimes as a lot

of thumb ups on the old doorframes lot

of press ups and the thumbs waited from

ups so rigorous
