when it comes to apologies Trudeau is

the king

I apologize saying that we are sorry

today is not enough

most recently he apologized for his

makeup in this footage that surfaced

during his campaign and his reaction was

well you guessed it I am deeply sorry

and I apologize but can apologizing

actually help dig someone out of a

political hole 100% of the time every

apology is deemed to have been

mishandled that is what we're dealing

with with Twitter culture that no matter

what you do there is no way anybody will

be satisfied with it like the

Twitterverse usually does it has already

turned Trudeau's apology on its head

like this guy saying he dressed up like

2001 Trudeau and I now apologize for the

footage of Trudeau he apologized not

just during this presser but the day

before now I recognize it was something

racist to do and I am deeply sorry

there's no question that he needed to

apologize the question is whether or not

there is any benefit to apologizing 72

times versus 68 times no matter how you

say it a sorry can only go so far
