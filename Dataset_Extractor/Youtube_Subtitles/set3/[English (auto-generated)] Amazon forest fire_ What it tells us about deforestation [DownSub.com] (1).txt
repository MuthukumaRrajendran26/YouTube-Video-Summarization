jarring photos and videos of the flames

tearing through the Amazon have caught

the world's attention scientists using

NASA satellites to track the fires say

2019 is shaping up to be the Brazilian

Amazon's worst fire since 2010 the main

consensus the fires were caused by human

activity it's not a natural people such

fires who just you know reduced cover to

get new forage for cattle graze and not

pastures they might take advantage of

the drinks and clear

woody ready cover their land

that's Matt Henson a professor at the

University of Maryland who has studied

the satellite images of the fires he's

in Brazil now the images show the fires

are burning on farmland where forests

were already cleared for agriculture

most of the fires were likely set by

people preparing the land for planting a

common practice and agriculture that

happens every year most years some of

those fires spread to unintended areas

and some years are worse than others so

what's different this time around why

are we paying attention to the fires

Hanson believes a smoke traveling south

and the atmosphere into South Paulo the

commercial hub of Brazil played a major

role on the Descent you saw this really

clear aerosol line in the atmosphere

this really clear layer of smoke and

that freaks people I just landed Apollo

combine that with social media and

celebrities chiming in and you had the

perfect storm this isn't the first time

Raziel has suffered dramatic forest

fires 2015 and 2016 were particularly

bad years with the warming of El Nino

when droughts allowed the fires to

spread quickly but whether or not people

are paying attention it raises important

questions about deforestation

although locals say farming is an

important part of their economic

prosperity Brazil has been applauded by

the international community for slowing

down deforestation in the early 2000s

but in the last decade Brazil has been

backsliding in terms of limiting

deforestation large areas of land are

cleared for cattle farming and to grow

cattle feed like soybean

meat production today is nearly five

times higher than it was in the early

1960s the consequence of this is an

increasing deforestation not only in

Brazil but around the world stage it

looks like and as an economic incentive

Hollywood against the forest the forest

is continually drunk in tractor beeps

soy palm oil and wood products drive the

majority of tropical deforestation

forests especially tropical forests so

enormous amount of carbon

when forests are destroyed that carbon

is released to the atmosphere

accelerating global warming you have to

respect sovereignty you have to respect

economic development but we understand

in modern age that balance between the

services that the environment provides

like regulating climate and harboring

biodiversity and all these things versus

the economic development so the idea

that there should be a bit of structure

and you know much more organized

disciplined approach to development I

think it's perfectly reasonable while

there are some arguments about which

year has seen the worst forest fires one

thing is clear the Amazon is burning and

at least for the time being the world is

paying attention thanks for watching
