she never had a prosthetic arm in her

lifetime there you go

would not be worried about her at all

because she's super awesome um but you

know do I wish she had an arm so that

she didn't have any challenges yes but

it's made a tremendous difference in her

life

my favorite thing was to make a heart

out of two hands she'll be able to blend

in more and that might sound a little

strange but as a parent sometimes seeing

the attention and the questions that

continuous questions someday she just

doesn't want the questions and this will

be a way for her to have a bit more

anonymity and and just do things in a

different way so we're super excited

about that some of the limitations that

she faced were really not that many

she's really high functioning but there

are some things that have been difficult

for her to adapt to like putting her

hair up in a ponytail and when she plays

video games with her brother you know

there there's just she has to keep

moving her hand around back and forth

between the controller so there's some

things that she can adapt to really well

and some that she's more challenged to

adapt to

[Laughter]

I look forward to ride my bike and go

with my dad that looks good looks

fantastic that feels pretty like it's

holding on Trump no issues you need to

relax just a little bit I know that's

the hardest part is to remember to relax

and not to try to work too too hard

awesome little slow steady clothes fully

charged
