good afternoon I have just been to see

her majesty the queen who has invited me

to form a government and I have accepted

I pay tribute to the fortitude and

patience of my predecessor and her deep

sense of public service but in spite of

all her efforts it has become clear that

there are pessimists at home and abroad

who will think after three years of

indecision that this country has become

a prisoner to the old arguments of 2016

and in this home of democracy we are

incapable of honouring a Democratic

mandate and so I am standing before you

today to tell you the British people

that those critics are wrong the

doubters the doom stirs the gloom stirs

they are going to get it wrong again

the people who bet against Britain are

going to lose their shirts but this will

in a restore trust in our democracy and

we're going to fulfil the repeated

promises of Parliament to the people and

come out of the EU on October the 31st

no ifs or buts and we will do a new deal

a better deal that will maximize the

opportunities of brexit while allowing

us to develop a new and exciting

partnership with the rest of Europe

based on free trade and mutual support I

have every confidence that in 99 days

time we will have cracked it but you

know what we aren't going to wait 99

days because the British people have had

enough of waiting the time has come to

act to take decisions to give strong

leadership and to change this country

for the better and though the Queen has

just honored me with this extraordinary

Office of State my job is to serve you

the people because they're if there's

one point we politicians need to

remember it is that the people are our

bosses my job is to make your streets

safer

and willing a bin with another 20,000

police on the streets and we start

recruiting forthwith my job is to make

sure you don't have to wait three weeks

to see your GP and we start work this

week with 20 new hospital upgrades and

ensuring that the money for the NHS

really does get to the frontline my job

is to protect you or your parents or

grandparents from the fear of having to

sell your home to pay for the costs of

care and so I am announcing now on the

steps of Downing Street that we will fix

the crisis in Social Care once and for

all with a clear plan we have prepared

to give every older person the dignity

and security they deserve my job is to

make sure your kids get a superb

education wherever they are in the

country and that's why we have already

announced that we're going to level up

per pupil funding in primary and

secondary schools and that is the work

that begins immediately behind that

black door and though I am today

building a great team of men and women I

will take personal responsibility for

the change I want to see

never mind the backstop the buck stops

here and I will tell you something else

about my job it is to be Prime Minister

of the whole United Kingdom and that

means uniting our country answering at

last the plea of the Forgotten people

and the left behind towns by physically

and literally renewing the ties that

bind us together so that with safer

streets and better education and

fantastic new road and rail

infrastructure and full fibre broadband

we level up across Britain with higher

wages of higher living wage higher

productivity we close the opportunity

gap giving millions of young people the

chance to own their own homes and giving

business the confidence to invest across

the UK because it is time we unleashed

the productive power not just of London

and the southeast but of every corner of

England Scotland Wales and Northern

Ireland the awesome foursome that are

incarnated in that red white and blue

flag who together are so much more than

the sum of their parts and whose brand

and political personality is admired and

even loved around the world for our

inventiveness for our humor for our

University's scientists our armed forces

our diplomacy for the equalities on

which we insist where the race or gender

or LGBT or the right of every girl in

the world to twelve years of quality

education for the values we stand for

around the world every not everyone

knows the values that flag represents it

stands for freedom and free speech and

had the s corpus in the rule of law and

above all it stands for democracy that

is why we will come out of the EU on

October the 31st because in the end

brexit was a fundamental decision by the

British people that they wanted their

laws made by people that they can elect

and they can remove from office and we

must now respect that decision and

create a new partnership with our

European friends as warm as close and as

affectionate as possible and the first

step is to repeat unequivocally our

guarantee to the 3.2 million EU

Nationals now living and working among

us as I say directly to you thank you

thank you for your contribution to our

society thank you for your patience and

I can assure you that under this

government you will have the absolute

certainty of the right to live and

remain and I say next to our friends in

Ireland and in Brussels and around the

EU I am convinced we can do a deal

without checks of the Irish border

because we refuse under any

circumstances to have such cheques and

yet without that anti-democratic

backstop and it is of course vital at

the same time that we prepare for the

remote possibility that Brussels refuses

any further to negotiate

and we are forced to come out with no

deal not because we want that outcome of

course not

but because it is only common sense to

prepare and let me stress that there is

a vital sense in which those

preparations cannot be wasted and that

is because our under under any

circumstances we will need to get ready

at some point in the near future to come

out of the EU customs union and out of

regulatory control fully determined at

last to take advantage of brexit because

that is the course on which this country

is now set with high hearts and growing

confidence we will now accelerate the

work of getting ready and the ports will

be ready and the banks will be ready in

the factories will be ready in business

will be ready and the hospitals will be

ready and our amazing food and farming

sector will be ready and waiting to

continue selling ever more not just here

but around the world and don't forget

that in the event of a No Deal outcome

we will have that extra lubrication of

the 39 billion pounds and whatever deal

we do we will prepare this autumn for an

economic package to boost British

business and to lengthen this country's

lead as the number one destination in

this continent for overseas investment

and to all those who continue to

prophesize disaster I say yes there will

be difficulties though I believe that

with energy and application they will be

far less serious than some have claimed

but if there is one thing that has

rarely sapped the confidence of business

over the last three years it is not the

decisions we have taken it is our

refusal to take decisions and to those

who say we cannot be ready I say do not

underestimate this country do not

underestimate our powers of organization

and our determination because we know

the enormous strengths of this economy

in Life Sciences in tech in academia in

music the arts culture financial

services it is here in Britain that we

are using gene therapy for the first

time to treat the most common form of

- here in Britain that we are leading

the world in battery technology that

will help cut co2 and tackle climate

change and produce green jobs for next

generation and as we prepare for a post

brexit future it is time we look not at

the risks but at the opportunities that

are upon us so let us begin work now to

create free ports that will drive growth

and thousands of high-skilled jobs in

left-behind areas let's start now to

liberate the UK's extraordinary

bioscience sector from anti genetic

modification rules and let's develop the

blight resistant crops that will feed

the world let's get going now on our own

position navigation and timing satellite

and Earth Observation systems UK assets

orbiting in space with all the long-term

strategic and commercial benefits for

this country let's change the tax rules

to provide extra incentives to invest in

capital and research and let's promote

the welfare of animals that has always

been so close to the hearts of the

British people and yes let's start now

on those free trade deals because it is

free trade that has done more than

anything else to lift billions out of

poverty all this and more we can do now

and only now at this extraordinary

moment in our history and after three

years of unfounded self-doubt it is time

to change the record to recover our

natural and historic role as an

enterprising outward-looking and truly

global Britain generous in temper and

engaged with the world no one in the

last few centuries has succeeded in

betting against the pluck and nerve and

ambition of this country they will not

succeed today we in this government will

work flat-out to give this country the

leadership

deserves and that work begins now thank

you very much
