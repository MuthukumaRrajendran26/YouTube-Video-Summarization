this is the iPhone 11 Pro and these are

the most powerful and most advanced

iPhones that we have ever built in a

stunning new design now question my

favorite part about iPhone this is the

first iPhone that we've had a camera

system that we call Pro it's really

worthy of this name so what does it have

first it has a new wide camera that has

a fast F 1.8 aperture and focus pixels

to cover a hundred percent of the sensor

it is a new telephoto camera with a

larger F 2.0 aperture it lets in 40%

more light and as a new ultra wide

camera with a super wide 120 degree

field of view and a tremendous range of

focus across the entire image

introducing iPhone 11 Pro the triple

camera system combines cutting edge

technology with the extraordinary ease

of iPhone the redesigned camera

interface complements the new hardware

with a more immersive and intuitive

experience telephoto why

kannu ultra-wide cameras you can now

view four times more seen in your photos

and videos with the ultra wide all-new

night mode allows you to capture images

never before possible on an iPhone and

drastically lower light so this is our

lineup of three new iPhones starting at

six ninety nine ninety nine and ten

ninety nine in addition to that we're

going to keep iphone ten are in the line

starting at just $5.99 and iPhone 8 at

four forty nine so there's a lot of

great options for people at all

different price points Apple watch

series five featuring an innovative new

display that is always on

the new always-on Retina display never

sleeps so the watch face is always

visible with previous models of Apple

watch when you lowered your wrist the

display would go completely dark but now

with series 5 goals be able to see your

time and complications it tracks your

distance underwater and starts

competitions and accepts challenges

[Music]

and tracks your workouts and tells you

which direction you should be going and

reminds you to bleed and has an app that

measures the exact timing of the

electrical waves traveling through the

upper and lower chambers of your heart

otherwise known as an electrocardiogram

so in conclusion just to reiterate this

watch tells time
