residents in Florida are now watching

Dorian very nervously with that storm

stalled over the Bahamas they're waiting

to see when it makes the turn north a

turn that's going to determine what kind

of impacts they see here along the coast

here in Daytona Beach there's already a

mandatory evacuation order in effect and

it's underway right now and as you look

out the water you can see why you can

see those waves getting bigger and the

wind's getting stronger but the main

impacts of the storm on this part of the

Florida coast will likely not be felt

until late Tuesday or early Wednesday

they're still forecasting though wind

gusts that could have seed 150

kilometres per hour even if the storm

stays offshore utility crews from across

the US are already moving into the area

getting in place early to respond to

potential power outages the last major

hurricane here herma left seven and a

half million people in the dark nobody

wants to see a repeat of that right now

it's a game of inches any slight

deviation in the storm's path will have

a major impact on how it impacts Florida
