mr. speaker with permission I'll make

statement on the mission of this new

conservative government but before I

begin I'm sure the whole house will join

me in paying tribute to my writer friend

the member for Maidenhead for all she

has given to the service of our nation

from fighting modern slavery to tackling

the problems of mental ill-health she

has a great legacy on which we shall all

be proud to build and our mission is to

deliver brexit on the 31st of October

for the purpose of uniting Andry

energizing our great United Kingdom and

making this country the greatest place

on earth and when I say the greatest

place on earth I'm conscious that some

may accuse me of hyperbole but it is

useful to imagine the trajectory on

which we could now be embarked by 2050

it is more than possible that the United

Kingdom will be the greatest and most

prosperous economy in Europe at the

center of a new network of trade deals

which we have pioneered with the road

and rail investments we are making and

propose to make now the investment in

broadband and 5g our country will post

the most forward will transport and

technological connectivity on the planet

by unleashing the productive power of

the whole United Kingdom not just of

London and the south east but of every

corner of England Scotland Wales and

Northern Ireland we will have closed

forever the productivity gap and seen to

it that no town is left behind ever

again

community our children and grandchildren

will be living longer happier and

healthier lives in our kingdom in 2050

thanks by the way to the initiative over

the previous prime minister will no

longer make any contribution whatsoever

to the destruction of our precious

planet brought about by carbon emissions

we would have led the world in

delivering that Net Zero target we will

be the home of electric vehicles cars

even planes powered by British made

battery technology being developed right

here right now we will have the free

ports to revitalize our coastal

communities a bioscience sector

liberated from anti genetic modification

rules blight resistant crops that will

feed the world and the satellite and

Earth Observation systems that are the

envy of the world we will be the seedbed

for the most exciting and most dynamic

business investments on the planet our

constitutional sword I apologize for

interrupting the premises there's far

too much noise in this chamber

and far too many members who think it's

alright for them to shout out their

opinion at the prime minister well let's

be clear it isn't the statement will be

heard and there will be ample

opportunity in conformity with

convention and as established by me over

the last decade for colleagues to

question the Prime Minister but the

statement will be heard and it will be

heard with courtesy the Prime Minister

speaker by side you're engaging and also

far too much negativity by the potential

I think he will agree our mr. speaker

because our constitutional settlement

our united kingdom will be firm and will

be secure our union of nations beyond

question our democracy robust our future

clean green prosperous united confident

ambitious and that is the prize and that

is our responsibility in this House of

Commons to fulfill and to do so a

mistake so immediate steps in the first

is to restore trust in our democracy and

fulfill the repeated promises of

Parliament to the people by coming out

of the European Union and doing so on

October 30 I had all ministers are

committed to leading on this date

whatever the circumstances and to do

otherwise would cause a catastrophic

loss of confidence in our political

system it will leave the British people

wondering whether their politicians

could ever be trusted again to follow a

clear democratic instruction I would

prefer us to leave the EU with a deal I

would much prefer it I believe that it

is possible even at this late stage and

I will work flat hard to make it happen

but certain things need to be clear the

withdrawal agreement negotiated by my

predecessor has been three times

rejected by this house its terms are

unacceptable to this Parliament and to

this country no country that values its

independence and indeed its self-respect

could agree to a treaty which signed

away our economic independence and

self-government as this backstop does a

a time limit is not enough if an

agreement is to be reached it must be

clearly understood that the way to the

deal goes by way of the abolition of the

backstop

for our part we are ready to negotiate

in good faith an alternative with

provisions to ensure that the Irish

border issues are dealt with where they

should always have been in the

negotiations on the future agreement

between the UK and the EU I do not

accept the argument that says these

issues can only be solved by all or part

of the UK remaining in the customs union

or in the single market the evidence is

that other arrangements are perfectly

possible and are also perfectly

compatible perfectly compatible with the

Belfast or Good Friday Agreement - which

here of course steadfastly committed my

team and the writer on my Radha will

friend the secretary say for texting the

European Union are ready to meet and

talk on this basis to the Commission or

other EU colleagues whenever wherever

they're ready to do so and for our part

we will throw ourselves into these

negotiations with the greatest energy

and determination ad in a spirit of

friendship and I hope that the EU will

be equally ready and that they will

rethink their current refusal to make

any changes to the withdrawal event if

they do not if they do not we will of

course have to leave the UK without an

agreement under article 50 the UK is

better prepared for that situation than

many believe but we are not as ready yet

as we should be in the 98 days that

remain to us we must turbocharged our

preparations to make sure that there is

as little disruption as possible to our

national life and I

believe that that is possible with the

kind of national effort that the rich

people have made before and will make

again and these in these circumstances

we would of course have available the 39

billion pounds in the withdrawal

agreement to help deal with any

consequences I have today instructed the

Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to

make these preparations his top priority

I have asked the cabinet set free to

mobilize the civil service to deliver

this outcome should it become necessary

and the Chancellor has confirmed that

all necessary funding will be made

available

I will also ensure 4.2 billion zouri

Bianca I will also ensure they're

preparing for leaving the EU without an

agreement under Article 50 is not just

about seeking to mitigate the challenges

but also about grasping the

opportunities this is not just about

technical preparations vital though they

are it is about having a clear economic

strategy for the UK in all scenarios

something in which the Conservative

Party has always led the way and it's

why producing policies which will boost

the competitiveness and the productivity

of our economy when we are free of EU

regulations indeed mr. speaker we will

begin right away on working to change

the tax rules to provide extra

incentives to invest in capital and

research we will now be accelerating the

talks on those free trade deals and we

will prepare an economic package to

boost British business and lengthen this

country's lead which seems so bitterly

resented by the benches off of it

this country's read as the number one

destination in this continent for

overseas investment as state rested his

putt made possible at least partly by

the diversity the talent and the skills

of our workforce and Mr Speaker I also

want that fall to repeat unequivocally

our guarantee to the 3.2 million EU

Nationals now living and working among

us I thank them for their contribution

to our society and for their patience

and I can assure them that under this

government they will have the absolute

certainty of the right to live I want to

end by making clear my absolute

commitment to the 31st October date for

our exit our national participation in

the European Union is coming to an end

and that reality needs to be recognized

by all parties and indeed mr. speaker

today there are very many brilliant

officials UK officials trapped in

meeting after meeting in Brussels and

luxan work Luxembourg when they could be

better deployed in there they're

deploying their talents in preparing to

pioneer new pre free trade deals or

promoting a truly global Britain and I

want to start unshackling our officials

to undertake this new mission right away

sir we will not nominate a UK

commissioner for the new Commission

taking office on the 1st of December

under no circumstances though clearly

this is not intended to stop the EU

appointing a new Commission mr. speaker

today is the first day of a new approach

which will end with our exit from the EU

on the 31st of October there like hope

we can have a friendly and constructive

relationship those constitutional equals

as friends and partners in facing the

challenges that lie ahead I believe that

is possible and this government will

work to make it so

but Mr Speaker we are not going to wait

until the 31st of October to begin

building the broader above the future

that I have described we're going to

start right away

providing funding

and for funding for our frontline public

services to deliver better health care

better education and more police on the

streets Mr Speaker I am committed

but making sure that the NHS receives

the funds it deserves receive the funds

were promised by the last government in

June 2018 and these funds will go to the

frontline as soon as possible

this will include urgent funding for 20

hostel upgrades and winter readiness

I have asked officials to provide

quality proposals for drastically

reducing waiting times and for GP

appointments to address the rising tide

of violence in that attract right rise

of violent crime in our country I've

announced that there will be 20,000

extra police I've asked my right

honourable friend the Home Secretary to

ensure that this is treated as an

absolute priority we will give greater

powers powers resisted by the way by the

party opposite to the police to use stop

and search to help tackle violent crime

I have also tasked officials to draw

proposals to ensure the future those

found guilty of a very serious sexual

and violent offences are required to

serve a custodial sentence that truly

reflects the severity of their offense

and policy measures and policy measures

that will see a reduction in the number

of prolific offenders on education I

have listened to the concerns of so many

colleagues around the house and we will

increase the minimum level of the people

funding in primary and secondary schools

two previous two levels that began this

part by the end of this Parliament

we are committed we are committed to

leveling up across every nation and

region of the UK providing support to

towns and cities and closing closing the

opportunity gap in our society we will

announce investment in vital

infrastructure phone fiber rollout

transport and housing that can improve

the quality of people's life fuel

economic growth and provide opportunity

finally we will also ensure that we will

continue to attract the best and

brightest talent from around the world

now why no one believes more strongly

than me in the benefits of migration to

our country but I am clear that our

immigration system must change for years

politicians have promised the public an

Australian style points-based system and

today I will actually deliver on those

promises I will ask the migration

Advisory Committee to conduct a review

of that system as the first step in a

radical rewriting in a radical rewriting

of our immigration system I am convinced

that we can produce a system that the

British public can have confidence in

mr. speaker over the past few years too

many people in this country too many

people in this country feel that they

have been told repeatedly and

relentlessly what we cannot do since I

was a child I remember respectable

authorities asserting that our time as a

nation has passed that we should be

content with mediocrity and managed

decline a time and again

by the time and again these an escape to

these are skeptics and doubters

[Applause]

time and again by their pylos to

innovate and to adapt the British people

have showed the doubters wrong and Mr

Speaker I believe that at this pivotal

moment in our national story we are

going to prove the doubters wrong again

not just with positive thinking and a

can-do attitude important though they

are but with the help and encouragement

of a government and a cabinet that is

bursting with ideas ready to create

change determined to implement the

policies that we need to succeed as a

nation the greatest place to live the

greatest place to bring up a family the

greatest place to send your kids to

school the greatest place to set up a

business or to invest because we we have

the best transport and the cleanest

environment and the best healthcare and

the most compassionate approach to care

of elderly people that is the mission of

the cabinet I have appointed and that is

the purpose of the government I am

leading and that is what I believe that

if we Bend our sinews to the task now

there is every chance that in 2050 into

it I fully intend to be around

they're not necessarily in this job we

will be able to look back on this period

this extraordinary period as the

beginning of a new golden age for our

United I commend I commend this future

to the house just as much as I commend

this statement mr. speaker

[Applause]
