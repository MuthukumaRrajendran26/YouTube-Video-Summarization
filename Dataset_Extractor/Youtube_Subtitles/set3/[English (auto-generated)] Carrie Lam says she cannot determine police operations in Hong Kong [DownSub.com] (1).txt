English question is the police fired

tear gas and into Kwai Fong MTR station

on Sunday and almost caused a stampede

in ty ku station by shooting protesters

at very close range

many residents including young children

and elderly people were tear gas can you

tell the citizens of Hong Kong how they

could continue to live in the city

safely when the police keep flying

harmful chemicals into residential areas

the police have had a very difficult

time in the last few months to enforce a

law and to ensure law and order in Hong

Kong as everyone will will observe they

are under extremely difficult

circumstances so as I was just explained

police operations could not be

determined by someone like myself who is

outside the police especially when

policemen have to make on-the-spot

judgment or what will be in the best

interest and safety of people around

during that particular situation the

police have their code of practice to

follow the police have very rigid and

stringent guidelines in the use of

appropriate force and that requires the

lowest level of force in dealing with

those situations

[Music]

can I continue to answer okay sorry it

is it was not my choice to concentrate

on the police but all the questions now

have been focusing on the police despite

[Applause]

let me briefly give a very solemn and

serious response to that question about

the chief executives responsibility the

chief executives responsibility is to

ensure that Hong Kong remains a safe and

orderly and law-abiding City that is my

utmost responsibility because without

the rule of law without law and order in

Hong Kong it is extremely difficult so

ensure that 7 million people in Hong

Kong could continue to live in a

peaceful manner so that is my utmost

responsibility and that also requires my

support for all the law enforcement

agencies in accordance with their

policies their rules their guidelines

that also means that my responsibility

goes beyond this particular list this

particular range of protests I have said

after the violence has been stopped and

the chaotic situation that now we are

seeing could subside I wouldn't say it

will be eradicated totally I as a keylex

executive will be responsible to rebuild

Hong Kong's economy to engage as widely

as possible so listen as attentively as

possible so my peoples grievances and

try to help Hong Kong to move on that is

my very serious

political commitment and responsibility

to the people of Hong Kong at this point

in time reuters you you say that it's

your utmost responsibility to restore

order to hong kong is it not also your

utmost responsibility as Hong Kong's

leader to listen to the public all of us

here in this room all the reporters

we've been out on the streets we've

spoken to protesters over the past

couple of months they have made their

demands very clear now I would like to

ask you in terms of withdrawing the bill

using this specific term which the

protesters have called for do you as

Hong Kong's leader have the autonomy to

decide to withdraw the bill yes or no or

is this something that Beijing has to

approve as well in other words have your

hands been tied by Beijing in not

allowing the bill to be withdrawn or is

this a point of political pride on your

part in not doing this and refusing to

meet this demand of the protesters well

actually this question has been answered

on previous occasions you've evaded the

question as we have all heard from the

spokesmen of the Hong Kong and Macau

Affairs Office the central government is

still confident that I myself as the

government of the Hong Kong as they are

together with a police force that we are

still capable of resolving this crisis I

want to make various demands that we

have heard we have considered all

factors and came up with a response that

we have rehearsed time and again over

the last two months thank you

or not who will draw the extradition

session you you have not answered the

question you've evaded the question
