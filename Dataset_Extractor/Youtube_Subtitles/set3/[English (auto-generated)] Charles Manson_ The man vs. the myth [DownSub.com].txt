believe me if I started murdering people

it'd be none of you left it's been half

a century since Charles Manson's name

became synonymous with madness I'd take

this book and beat you to death with it

and I wouldn't feel a thing in the

summer of 1969

the American cult leader ordered his

followers to murder at least nine people

Manson was convicted of first degree

murder and narrowly avoided the death

penalty after California abolished the

punishment instead he died in prison

five decades later at the age of 83

but the morbid fascination with his

story lives on

this is a case that has kept people

absolutely fascinated transfixed and

there's really synonymous with the

recognition of serial killers Manson's

become this literal shorthand for evil

it is incredible to sort of look around

the sort of range of material that it

generates it attracts the 50th

anniversary of the Manson murders has

spawned a host of new movies and books

including Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon

a Time in Hollywood and Charlie says by

Canadian director mary harron adding to

an already existing exhausting list of

Manson material and the rehashing of

Manson's story is also refueling the

many myths surrounding his case some of

which he himself helped to create the

first Manson myth dates back to his

childhood born in Ohio to a teenage

mother and an absent father

he spent his early years in and out of

prison mostly for petty crimes but

Manson told much taller tales of growing

up desperately poor and alone one

popular myth recalls how his mother

actually sold her son for a pitcher of

beer kinda left out the part that he was

raised mostly by an uncle and aunt and a

doting grandma who gave him fancy

birthday parties bought him nice clothes

Charlie was a hustler he was a fraud

Benson used those childhood myths to

turn himself into a legend at least in

the eyes of his followers the so-called

Manson family a cult of as many as a

hundred people and one of the first and

youngest members of the Manson family

was Diane Lake Lake who later testified

against Manson at trial was just 14 when

she met him at a party she later moved

in with Manson and a handful of his

followers who live together at this

ranch

he had this an uncanny ability to

manipulate because he could become

whoever those people that he met needed

Manson's eerie ability to control his

followers remains a source of mystery

and intrigue and it's also where we find

another of Manson myth his seemingly

supernatural power of persuasion he

managed to make the world think he was

some kind of mystical mass killer who

could control zombie-like followers and

absolutely none of that was the case he

had no original philosophies he stole

everything from the Bible idols lyrics

and Dale Carnegie's how to win friends

and influence people he never had more

than a couple dozen drug addled

teenagers and young people following him

and most of them wanted to lead but some

remained and were even willing to kill

for him Charles Manson never actually

physically murdered anybody that we know

of

instead Manson ordered others to do his

dirty work

convincing five of his followers to

become murderers he kind of descended

into madness

he had an acid trip where he felt like

he was being crucified and he took that

as being that he was a the coming Christ

the first victim was Gary Hyneman

Manson's friend and fellow musician

Manson needed money to launch his own

recording career and sent three of his

followers to hyneman's house

Manson thought he had it was his money

and that he had money at the house and

that's what he came for was the money

which brings us to perhaps the most

pervasive Manson myth his motive for the

murders at the crime scene the words

helter skelter were written in blood the

[Music]

title of the hit Beatles to which Paul

McCartney says describes the rise and

fall of the Roman Empire but Manson had

his own interpretation it just kind of

means chaos it just means craziness the

prosecutor in the court case Vincent

Bugliosi used the helter skelter

calling-card to promote his own theory

that Manson murdered members of the

Hollywood elite to incite an apocalyptic

race war by Framing Pro black activists

for the killings Manson always denied

the race war theory the last person to

ever interview him was Canadian

James buddy day really the true story is

one of drugs and dynamics and and drug

deals gone wrong and all sorts of

craziness all these events that just

kind of led to these murders but that

helter skelter theory which helped to

convict him also turned his case into an

international spectacle the media were

looking for someone like Charles Manson

to fill that space in 1969 he confirmed

and crystallized a lot of the anxieties

and a lot of the issues and debates that

were then circulating around what we

might refer to as the counterculture but

also other elements of American culture

like the Hollywood elite a story of

drugs rock and roll mind-control and

Hollywood race Wars it's

wonder the Manson myths have survived so

long
