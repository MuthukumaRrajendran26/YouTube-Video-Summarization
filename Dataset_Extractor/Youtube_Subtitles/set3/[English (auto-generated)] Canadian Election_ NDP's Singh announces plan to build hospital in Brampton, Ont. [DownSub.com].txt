don't

I'll need to get a shot everybody

you

Bramson north welcome thank you for all

being here with us I like to introduce

my colleague sahrin Jeet Singh NDP

candidate for Brampton north hi everyone

my name is Shen Jeet Singh NDP candidate

for Brampton East we're here in front of

Brampton Civic Hospital those of us who

live in Brampton oh the Browns in the

middle of a healthcare crisis we were

600,000 people at just one Hospital and

I'm incredibly proud to introduce our

leader jugman Singh who's here who's

been fighting for brands for years and

been fighting for Canada once more jug

meat saying our leader thank you

Thank You friends for joining me we've

got an incredible team of Brampton New

Democratic MP candidates really proud of

them thanks for joining us today right

here by Brampton Civic Hospital you know

in 2015 Brampton sent five Liberal MPs

to Ottawa they voted for Prime Minister

Justin Trudeau and they did that because

they were finished with years of Harper

cuts times had become very difficult

health care funding was getting squeezed

and they wanted something different well

after four years of having these five

Liberal MPs people in Brampton continue

to suffer health care is still not at

the level it needs to be wait times are

extremely long here at this hospital in

2017 reports show that four thousand

three hundred and fifty two people were

treated in hallways hallway medicine has

become a reality in this city and it is

simply wrong health care funding has

been cut by Harper and like those cuts

were continued by mr. Trudeau people

have had enough with this I'm here to

say that is simply wrong the neglect of

Brampton is wrong the neglect of health

care is wrong so what I'm here to do

today is to commit to the following we

commit to building and new hospital and

Brampton we will support the funding for

this new hospital we also commit to

supporting the expansion appeal Memorial

and we commit to this to ensuring that

by 2020 we have pharmacare for all so

that everyone in our country has access

to the medication they need if you need

medicine in our country you should use

your health card not sure

credit card that's gonna help this

hospital it's gonna free up time someone

who can't afford their medication should

not end up in a hospital bed because

they couldn't treat their illness we're

gonna put an end to that so thank you so

much for joining us we're gonna make

better choices we're gonna make sure

that we take care of the people that

need support this is a crisis here in

Brampton but it's a reality for far too

many people we will invest more in

healthcare to turn things around thank

you so much and I want folks to know I'm

in it for them I'm in it for you and

we're ready to take your questions yeah

how can you commit to building a

hospital isn't that a provincial

jurisdiction how would you actually do

that

it's absolutely a provincial

jurisdiction and what we're committing

today is to to make sure that we put the

funding on the table to make this happen

we are committed to building this

hospital and we know we've got to work

with the provincial government but we

can't just stand by and give up when

we've got a Conservative government that

doesn't see the importance of building

and investing in healthcare and we've

got a Liberal prime minister mr. Trudeau

who's neglected his responsibilities

what we're doing today is saying we will

partner we will put the funding in place

to support the building of a new

hospital and expand Peel Memorial I'm

just yesterday and you've spoken about

this before your plan to treat drugs as

as a health issue rather than a criminal

issue can you tell us specifically what

that means

would you decriminalize drugs which

drugs would you want to see

decriminalize can you tell us exactly

what you're talking about when you say

that sure I spend a lot of time as a

criminal defense lawyer and I met a lot

of people that were in the criminal

justice system and when I when I met

with them and I spoke with them really

what they were struggling was they were

struggling with addiction they were

struggling with mental health they were

struggling with poverty and the criminal

justice system wasn't the way to deal

with their problems and we see that in

Canada we've got an opioid crisis

thousands of Canadians are dying and

we've got to do things differently we

can't continue down the same path but we

want to change the results we've got to

change our approach and so what our

approach is this when people are

struggling with addiction for personal

use when people are struggling with

mental health and people are struggling

with poverty they shouldn't be tree

with the criminal justice system they

should be treated with compassion and

care with the health care response and

that's what I'm committed to doing

making sure people who are in need

people who are addicted people were

dealing with mental health get mental

health services get addiction services

that is the way that we help people out

and the way we see lives

right now the access to to folks who

there's been concerns a court decision

that found that the criteria were too

that's a reality people who need to make

this choice for their dignity should be

able to make the choice and right now

the criteria being too narrow

doesn't allow access to this decision

for a lot of people and so I'm open to

looking at ways to making sure the

access is improved and that we do it in

a way that respects the dignity of

Bullock al-sisi is your way continued

aphasia mister saying Michael cooter

from global national is a vigorous

debate now going around on e-cigarettes

do you think that Canada should be doing

something to ban vaping well I mean all

our decision when it comes to to any

sort of a product that's in the market

should be based on evidence and should

be based on the science and if we have

some science then evidence that points

you a problem then we should respond and

and right now that science is unclear

there are some concerns being raised and

I think we should be very careful to

assess any sort of information that we

have and make the best decision possible

to protect citizens and that includes

vaping e-cigarettes and anything else

that might arise in terms of information

that we now have that should inform our

decisions we already have some

jurisdictions and and I know

more recently the president the United

States is looking at it you know

flavored nicotine and that sort of thing

would you if you were Prime Minister

consider a nationwide ban on

e-cigarettes what my concern would be is

you know as someone who doesn't smoke a

drink I really want to encourage people

to make healthy decisions I'm

particularly worried about young people

that might be influenced to get into

into a practice that they thing is safe

when it's really detrimental to their

health I want us to make good decisions

and good policies that protect the

safety and the health of Canadians and

so everything we should do everything we

do should be with that focus in mind and

if there is a there's a way to move

forward which discourages young people

from making a bad decision I want to do

that if there is information that we can

provide to help people make a better

decision towards their health I want to

do that mr. Singh Kevin Gallagher is CTV

News so we know that yesterday too NDP

candidates had

step down for various reasons there's

been lots of reports about difficulty

that your parties had to vet recruit

candidates said Ryan called the process

unprofessional

how can Canadians vote for you for Prime

Minister if it seems you're having

trouble organizing candidates for this

upcoming election well I want to be

clear we're gonna have all the

candidates in place so that everyone in

Canada can vote for a new Democrat no

matter where they live there's people

that have to stand up live up to our

standards as soon as information arises

where they are not meeting the standards

that we believe is important for our

candidates to meet we then move ahead to

ensure that there are no longer

candidates and that's what happened

recently and we're gonna continue to do

that if any information arises which

makes us doubt the quality of a

candidate we're then gonna move to say

that those those folks can no longer be

candidates I'm confident that people can

trust us to know that we're making good

decisions about the candidates we have

there is a high quality standard that

we're trying to achieve but more

importantly we're also trying our best

to recruit the real representation of

Canada we haven't seen enough

marginalized communities represented we

haven't seen enough women particularly

represented in politics so I'm working

hard to make sure that our candidates

reflect Canada and that's a tough thing

to do but a very important thing to do

but at what point do you have to strike

a balance here to get a candidate in the

riding before September 30th cutoff

right so is there an issue with the

vetting process in the in the party what

what's holding you back here no not at

all I'm we've got a strong process I've

just put in place some some sort of

strict or rigid demands I really want to

encourage equity seeking folks to be

reflected I really believe it's

important to to change the way things

have been done in the past I want to do

things differently and that's hard to do

I know but it's important for me so I'm

really committed to making sure we have

the most diverse list of candidates

possible people that really reflect who

we are as Canadians and particularly for

me a big emphasis is working hard on

recruiting as many women as possible

that's important it's hard I know many

people who are so qualified don't see

themselves reflected in politics and

then don't want to run I really want to

encourage them to run it's important for

me that's why I'm working hard you just

mentioned

oh hi you just mentioned at the top

there that you can put in the stricter

rigid demands when though do you have to

cut your losses so you get the 338 well

I'm an optimist and I believe we can

always fight to make things better I

don't want to ever give up so I'm

committed to the vision of making sure

we've got a candidate and that will

represent Canada they represent who we

are so it's tough work but it's

important work and I'm happy and proud

that we're doing it and we're gonna

continue to make sure that we've got the

best list of candidates possible for

people to choose from but rest assured

that by Election Day everyone in Canada

we can vote for a new Democrat no matter

where they live I want to ask you about

tonight this is your first official

debate in a campaign as leader so what

are you personally thinking what do you

think are gonna be your challenges in

this I'm really excited and I'm looking

forward to it one big challenge is mr.

Trudeau hasn't showed up for four years

and he's not showing up to this debate

I'm really disappointed by that I think

Canadians are disappointed they expect

that the Prime Minister should be able

to stand up and respond to questions

hold up and and defend his record his

record is pretty abysmal but that

doesn't mean he should give up on the

debate so that's gonna be one of our

challenges how do we debate the prime

minister who's responsible for many of

the outcomes that we've seen over the

past four years

when he's not present but we're still

gonna move ahead of course and we're

gonna make sure people know where we

stand and I'm gonna take the opportunity

to share the stories that I hear from

people across this beautiful country I'm

mister saying Brian Platt with post

media you mentioned off the top

the Liberals have every seat in brampton

right now that's right this is an area

you've won provincially and you almost

went federally in 2011 what do you have

to do to win here in this election well

we just have to look back and point out

what liberals have failed to do over the

past four years right here we're at

Brampton Civic hospital and with five

Liberal MPs

they have failed to improve the health

care conditions here in Brampton it's

one of the biggest concerns when you

speak to people in Brampton their

concern is is the hospital the people

who are we who are standing in this line

right now this is really important for

them that we have a hospital that that

serves their needs of the of the

community this is one of the fastest

growing communities in Canada it is

underserved and the five liberal piece

have failed the people of this of the

city we're gonna show them that you

don't have to accept bad or worse with

conservatives we're gonna cut services

even more that they've got a real choice

with New Democrats who are going to

invest in building a new hospital we're

gonna invest in expanding our health

care making sure that medication is

covered for all these are things that

are really appeal to the people of

Brampton and I'm confident that they're

gonna see in us our real champion for

them someone who's gonna fight for them

so I'm gonna be on their side cuz it's

really clear we're in it for people and

they're gonna see that I'm also sticking

in Brampton the issue of Public Safety

is a big if deal here as well I'd like

to know what plans you have for public

safety improvements in Brampton as well

particularly with peel Regional Police

certainly Public Safety is a concern

that that impacts people across across

Canada when we spoken with with people

who are particularly concerned about

public safety we're worried about young

people and young people who end up in a

going down the wrong path there's

concerns around young people who don't

see a bright future don't see a hope and

they end up going in mixing up in the

wrong crowd and then it creates a spiral

so from speaking to people who are who

are experts in the field people in the

community people that I spoken to they

want to make sure young people have

bright promising futures and that means

making sure we've got the programs for

them making sure we make and we're the

right investment so that young people

can see a bright future they can get a

job they can own a home that they don't

have to resort to some of the negative

decisions that sometimes the pressures

around them encourage we are confident

that with our plan to build affordable

housing our plan to create 300,000 new

quality jobs to tackle climate crisis

and our plan to improve health care will

create the climate and the conditions to

improve public safety but also just the

quality of life for everyone in our

country but particularly here in

Brampton

absolutely we've got to invest federal

money in in youth education youth

services youth programs we want kids to

have access to fitness programs we want

people to be a healthy and active and we

want to encourage positive and bright

futures that we know are possible if we

make the right choices and that's what

we're committed to doing yes media

funding for the hospital to the Brampton

as you can as you have make an

announcement for the new Brampton

Hospital but how you'll make sure that

the provincial government will not put

their nose in this matter as we all know

if you MPs will get elected and how the

benefits will be given to the Brampton

it's really good question it's gonna be

difficult to work with a conservative

prime premier who has not made health

care to priority and instead has been

cutting services that it's gonna be a

challenge but what I'm committed to

doing right now is just because it's a

challenge doesn't mean we give up New

Democrats don't give up on people we're

in it for people and that means that

we're gonna fight hard we're gonna say

this is important here is a funding we

are ready to put money on the table to

make sure we build this hospital we have

to work with the provincial government

that's true

but if we show the courage we show the

conviction we show that we're ready and

we've got money available on the table

to make this reality I can't see why

your premier would say no to that

especially when the people needed so

desperately so this is just clean from

birthday Jerry Mira mistake I'm gonna

upper arm loca Bostick I'm gonna thank

you same question sure

question was on how can I convince the

people of Brampton to vote for New

Democrats when they voted for liberals

in the past I said well let's just look

at the past four years the past four

years have shown that Liberal MPs all of

which who represent Brampton have failed

the people of Brampton they failed

making sure that health care which is

one of the biggest concerns for Brampton

has not been addressed they failed to

address that problem and so what we're

committing today is saying that you know

you don't need to choose between

liberals or conservatives conservatives

who are going to cut to make things

worse and liberals who are gonna take

you for granted

we're saying that you can choose new

democrats we're gonna fight for you

we're in it for you because we believe

you deserve equal and adequate funding

that means building the additional

hospital here in Brampton a city that is

as fast growing as Brampton deserves the

right type of funding and that means

also expanding Peel memorial we also

believe in making sure we've got

medication coverage for all by 2020

that's something that's gonna

significantly improve the conditions in

the hospital but for people's lives in

general people can count on us we'll be

there for them so why are you promising

to build a hospital in one community

when hallway health care does appear to

be a problem for all across Canada I

guess why are you spending this this

morning talking about one specific

community when this issue is is the

issue is truly across Canada but if we

look at Holly Medicine it's really here

in Brampton Civic where it's a real

crisis level I mentioned in 2017 a

report showed it's literally 4352 people

were treat

in hallways that's a number that far

exceeds anywhere else in Canada it's one

of the highest numbers for hallway

medicine it's a crisis level here and

what we're saying is we're committed to

providing the funding to address this

crisis there's a crisis in Brampton and

it's been neglected and that's not gonna

stand with New Democrats we believe

that's wrong we're also talking about a

broader solution with Pharma care for

all by 2020 that's gonna alleviate a lot

of pressures off of hospitals across

Canada many people end up in the

emergency room because they couldn't

afford the medication that would have

kept them well in the first place that's

creating a burden on the hospital system

that's a lot of waste because people who

could have treated their endless end up

in a $1,500 a day bed in an emergency

room it could have been avoided that's

why our plan is to tackle this crisis

here in Brampton but also the crisis

broadly speaking across Canada what are

your plans for the Canada health

transfer do you plan to increase it or

keep that current levels a great

question I really want to point this out

that Harper mr. Harper put in place a

cut of thirty billion dollars that's

what his plan was to cut health or

health care transfers by thirty billion

dollars now he made the plan but he

didn't actually put it in place it was

mr. Trudeau who put in place his thirty

billion dollar cut and mr. shears

talking about keeping it in place we're

saying that that is wrong we need to

actually increase investments in health

care their health care transfers used to

be 5050 between provinces and the

federal government now they've dropped

to 25 percent approximately at the

federal level and 75 percent at the

provincial level that is wrong and

that's a lot of the reason why health

care is in such a dismal condition right

now we want to change that thank you

very much everybody

thank you so much thank you thank you
