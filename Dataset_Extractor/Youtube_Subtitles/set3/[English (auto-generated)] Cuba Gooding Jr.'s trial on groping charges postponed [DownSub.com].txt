how you can do that

and Cuba takes the position and we do as

well that he is someone that should

never have been prosecuted we believe

that the only reason he was arrested and

prosecuted was because of his celebrity

and the district attorney's office was

looking for a high-profile case but I

think they'll be extremely embarrassed

and disappointed when the end result is

an outright dismissal which will also

reveal that the circumstances of his

arrest and the charges were totally

unfounded a review of all of the videos

and all of the preliminary information

that we have considered up to this point

shows not only that Cuba is innocent but

that a district attorney who was being

conscientious and appropriate should

never have even initiated this

prosecution and we're confident that

this will become a hallmark case for the

not-me movement so that in the future

prosecutors will not just randomly and

irresponsibly arrest somebody without

proper information and prosecute

evidence to move forward with the case
