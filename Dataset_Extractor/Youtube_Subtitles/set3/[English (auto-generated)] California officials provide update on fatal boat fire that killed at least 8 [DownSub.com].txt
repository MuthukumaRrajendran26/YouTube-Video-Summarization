incident today began at approximately

3:30 a.m. the Coast Guard sector in Los

Angeles received a mayday call that was

from a fully engulfed 75 foot commercial

diving vessel that was off the coast of

Santa Cruz Island crews from the US

Coast Guard the Ventura County Fire

Department and the vessel assist

organization responded the Coast Guard

launched aircraft as well as boats and

located a vessel that was fully involved

in flames in the Platts Harbor area on

the north side of Santa Cruz Island the

crews were actively fighting the fire

when the vessel began to sink at

approximately 7:20 a.m. this morning

39 Souls were reported to be on board

that vessel when it left Santa Barbara

five victims were subsequently rescued

and during the initial response and have

been transported to Ventura were

transported to Ventura Harbor this

particular dive trip that the boat was

on was a three-day trip that began

August the 31st it was scheduled to end

tomorrow morning it was advertised as a

Labor Day weekend North Channel Islands

dive trip the boat was scheduled to

depart Santa Barbara Harbor at 4:00 a.m.

on Saturday the 31st and return

Monday the second as I say in the

morning the dive company chartered the

boat and the crew from truth aquatics

say Santa Barbara Harbor based operation

that has been in existence since 1974

so far the in Santa Barbara

I am the coroner as well as the sheriff

so our coroner's Bureau has been

involved in this event because four

victims have been recovered thus far as

deceased they have been transported to

our coroner's Bureau we can only

identify them at this point as two adult

males and two adult females rescue and

recovery efforts on the scene have

located an additional four victims on

the ocean floor in close proximity to

the vessel and we have dive teams that

are in the water as we speak that are

working to attempt the recovery of their

remains but the the boat remains

unstable and I'm not sure when we're

going to be able to recover those bodies

as well as any more that may be within

the vessel the coroner's Bureau is

responsible for identifying the victims

for notifying the next of kin and for

determining the cause and manner of

death

we have asked for assistance due to the

sizable nature of this incident and have

received support from the Los Angeles

County coroner's office and from the

Sacramento County coroner's office as

well the four victims that we have

recovered as of now will need to be

identified through DNA and that may take

some time the condition of the remains

that are recovered subsequently will

determine the speed at which we are able

to identify any of the victims our

hearts go out to the families of the

victims of this terrible tragedy

we understand

the tremendous burden that they are

under right now is they wait to

determine exactly what happened and what

condition and situation their loved ones

are in we will be working diligently to

try to get them as much information as

possible as soon as possible we've also

set up a Family Assistance Center which

is designed to provide specialized

assistance to family members of victims

of this tragedy I am going to now turn

this over to captain

Monica Rochester of the United States

Coast Guard Los Angeles sector and she

will give you a briefing on the rescue

effort that was undertaken this morning

yeah my name is Sheriff Bill Brown

common spelling

good afternoon I'm captain Monica

Rochester captain of the port for Coast

Guard Sector Los Angeles Long Beach we

have been fully involved with this

incident since zero since 3:30 a.m. we

continue to have Coast Guard vessels

continue our search and rescue efforts

along the shorelines of Santa Cruz

Island we also have our Coast Guard

aircraft that is also engaged in

providing cover to ensure that we have

the full swath or full breadth of the

area to be to be searched we've also

provided a safety zone which is

approximately a mile which provides

safety to the responders so that we

don't have interference from other

vessel traffic or any other incursion

into the area where the incident has

occurred additionally we have also

established a 3,000 foot ceiling for a

temporary flight restrictions so again

this is all to protect the first

responders this isn't a day that we

wanted to wake up to for Labor Day and

it's a very tragic event and we will

search all the way through the night

into the morning but I think we all

should be prepared to move into the

worst outcome but those are our efforts

right now and they will continue through

the night and into the morning thank you

good afternoon my name is Suzanne Grima

people probably had many plans ranging

from working or spending time with

family and friends I'm sure nobody

planned to have their day spent the way

it is now and waking up to the news that

we received we have a Family Assistance

Center that is set up at Warren Hall at

Earl Warren show Graham the Family

Assistance Center will be open through

9:00 p.m. tonight open again at 9:00

chaplain red cross hospice of Santa

Barbara Sheriff's Department fire and

others working together as a team in

addition the county has a public

information line that can be called that

number is eight three three six eight

eight five five five one so we'll carry

on together as we get more information

and learn new findings as the day's

progress hope that you will take care of

yourself well and take care of others

thank you

Thank You Susana thank all of our

speakers we now be in a position to take

some questions from let me get him well

we're always hopeful that there would be

more survivors found and the

search-and-rescue operation continues

today and will through tomorrow morning

doing everything that we can to try to

see if anyone could have survived this

I'm sorry couldn't hear

yeah I don't know that there is a black

box on the vessel like this and I

couldn't answer that question for you

correct tomorrow morning it was supposed

to end Tuesday morning

the initial reports that were received

in the Mayday were that the fire was

under way there were no initial reports

of an explosion there have been several

media reports about potential for an

explosion or explosions that could be

it's just speculation but obviously that

could be scuba tanks or or propane tanks

or other things that could be blowing up

in the fire but there's nothing that

would in in the initial broadcast from

the vessel that indicated that there was

an initial explosion we don't know that

at this point you know and I think it's

you have to understand this is probably

the worst case scenario you could

possibly have you have a vessel that's

on the open sea that is in the middle of

the night I mean at 3:30 in the morning

fire is the scourge of any ship and you

know the vessel this you know if not

everybody most everybody was asleep at

this time the the majority of the people

were the passengers on the ship and the

sleeping compartment was on the bottom

deck of the ship so they would have been

sound asleep when this fire started so

you can imagine that of all scenarios to

be in a remote location have a fire that

occurs have limited if any firefighting

capabilities that could address that and

then to have all of a sudden a fire

that's spread very very rapidly you

couldn't ask for a worse situation

hi-yah could you repeat that question

yeah I know that I can't tell you

exactly how much has been searched I

don't know if captain Rochester can can

address that but certainly the island

itself the coastline has been checked I

don't have the the actual specific

length or amount but what I can tell you

is that we continue the search around

the island itself as well as the water

currents have indicated that moving to

the west so we will concentrate our

effort also to the west as well are

usually that design is required to have

an emergency escape hatch it's usually

lead leaves the individuals out onto the

main deck from there from what we would

call their accommodation spaces their

sleeping quarters I don't have that

information I'm sorry could you repeat

your question

the crew the crew that was interviewed

today by Santa Barbara Sheriff's as well

as some Coast Guard investigators but I

don't have the knowledge of what was

discussed

okay let's clarify that it was a total

of 39 people on board six of which were

crew and 33 were passengers well one

question at a time please

so it's a total of 39 people on board of

that our six crew members and 33

passengers that is unaccounted for that

is correct yes there were I

I can't speak to that the investigation

is ongoing

so the Coast Guard communications center

i explained to me that when the call

came in the vessel is already totally

engulfed in flames

that's exactly how it was relayed to us

no I don't have any of that information

excuse me say that again

so the boat has sank and now it's

inverted and it's on the seabed it's on

the floor in approximately 60 62 feet of

water excuse me

vessel is inspected annually by the

Coast Guard and they have been in full

compliance with with regulatory

requirements hold on just a second they

had someone behind you that was trying

to ask a question I don't have that

information or that will come out

probably through an investigation the

Coast Guard itself will launch what we

call a formal marine in quite a Board of

Inquiry so there will be a team of Coast

Guard folks that will come out and

convince that process

right now we're working on the next

next-of-kin notifications identification

the sheriff sheriff barber at Santa

Barbara Sheriff's Office has the lead on

that so I don't have that and they have

that answer and and I'm going to go

ahead and relinquish my opportunity for

somebody else to speak on behalf of this

incident I I don't have that information

but we certainly you know we can if you

want to meet with our public affairs

folks we will certainly provide that

information to you as best as we can

thank you very much the question was is

the vessel going to stay at its location

or will it be towed in we're under

discussion right now as to how that's

going to be handled and what condition

the vessel is in if it could be towed

without breaking apart and whether it

should be examined on site versus

brought on to shore so that'll be

something that the experts will be

dealing with and making recommendations

for as we go forward we don't have a

location for that yet

so it was a group I was a build as a as

a labor day trip I I don't believe that

they were all from one group I think

there were people from all around

Southern California and perhaps further

who or diving enthusiasts who you know

just got on this boat much like you

would get on a fishing boat where you'd

have a few people that you might know

but the rest of the people you wouldn't

know and it's that type of operation

I've not heard that

the question is was there firefighting

equipment onboard there would have to be

firefighting equipment onboard to pass

the Coast Guard inspection we have at

this point there's only four people have

actually been recovered four more have

been spotted or seen on the ocean floor

and the remaining 31 people are still

missing at this point okay one at a time

please yes this is this investigation is

a joint investigation between local

state and federal agencies that all have

jurisdiction and varying interests

within this investigation so in other

words you have the Sheriff's Office you

have which which handles the coroner's

matters as I indicated before you also

have the State Office of Emergency

Services that responds to disasters and

major emergencies like this you have the

federal National Transportation Safety

Bureau and other federal investigative

agencies that will be in support of that

the Coast Guard has an investigative arm

the Coast Guard Investigative Service so

there's a number of different agencies

that will be involved in this

investigation

I don't have that information Nick the

question was what has the crew relayed

or conveyed the only information that

I've got is that we do have some

statements from them that the

investigators are looking at we also

have the the gist of what the initial

Mayday call was

other than that we don't have any

details of allow rescue divers to go

inside of this yeah I don't know that I

can answer that question is that the

boats unstable what has to be done

before rescue divers can go down there

it's it's only unstable from the

standpoint that it's upside down in

relatively shallow water with receding

tides that are moving it around

essentially so at some point they're

gonna have to make a determination of

when the best time is to actually either

refloat that vessel and attempt to

recover anyone who may be inside or to

try to make the recovery while it's

still on the ocean floor

well correct the fire there's the four

just to clarify the four that we have

for actual bodies that have been

delivered to our coroner's Bureau the

other four who have been identified as

deceased are still on the ocean floor at

the vessel site and the remaining 30

remaining yeah five alive so yeah you

look at the remaining the remaining

twenty six people would be still missing

at this stage yeah I don't I don't have

the age ranges it's a mixture of men and

women and crew and passengers that's all

I know at this point don't know that all

right I'm gonna say two more questions

here so burning questions in the back so

the salvage operation to get the the

vessel refloated and and examined is one

that obviously calls for a tremendous

amount of expertise that's one that will

be required and then there's also

concern for whatever fuel may be left in

the vessel in terms of hazardous leaked

type to contain the fuel that may be and

any other hazardous materials that may

be in the vessel as well

that I don't have that information at

all yeah we have that is not information

that's made its way to us well there's

an investigation to determine if there

was any criminal activity but we have no

reason to suspect that there was at this

point but we are gonna make sure that

that's not the case so that's why we'll

be conducting don't have that

information for you thank you ladies and

gentlemen oh I'm sorry we will be

holding another press conference

tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock 10:00

a.m. same location right here at 10

o'clock thank you

if anybody still has specific questions

that they'd like to see me offline about

I'll stay up here and you can ask those

questions I think we've covered
