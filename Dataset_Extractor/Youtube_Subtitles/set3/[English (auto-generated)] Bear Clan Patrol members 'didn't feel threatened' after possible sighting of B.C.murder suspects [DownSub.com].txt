okay so what have you been hearing in

the last so we my members in New York

Landing had a potential sighting of the

two people that are being searched for

right now and that's kind of led to a

whole bunch of things happening RCMP are

now in the in the community they're

searching from what I understand most

recently there are focusing on an area

about the size of a football field

apparently some shots have been fired

and they've asked our group to secure a

perimeter around their community so our

group from Fox Lake are now traveling

from Gilliam to York factory to join the

other or you're planning to join the

other group well at first I got I was at

Walmart buying cat litter and cat food

and stuff like that I got a phone call

from Robert wavy who works with Fox Lake

Cree Nation and he was asking me if I

confirm a possible sighting and I didn't

I didn't have any you know I hadn't

heard yet so I called to travis biggity

my coordinator out there in York Landing

and asked him if he could confirm a

sighting and he absolutely did

so at 4:15 this afternoon they were

doing patrols around the community they

went to the the garbage dump area and

the sewer sewage treatment plant water

treatment plant is in the same area

there had been some activity at the

sewage treatment plant earlier in the

day there was some kind of an issue

there so workers were coming and going

from the treatment plant so they saw two

guys near the dump and at first that

didn't strike him as odd because they

thought it was associated with the work

going on at this water treatment plant

when they noticed the truck that was

associated with those activities wasn't

present then they kind of went oh this

might be something else and so they were

careful to you know get an idea of a

description of the gentleman that they

saw their exact location and the

direction of travel after that and it

seems to have helped this search

a huge help for police and it's also

dangerous you know it is thankfully the

gentleman that they saw didn't didn't

have any backpack with them no visible

nothing in their hands no weapons or

anything like that so they didn't feel

threatened at all and they as soon as

the guy saw our guys they bolted so they

they went across the road towards lagoon

and then disappear behind it into a tree

line like nothing no it was at a

distance yeah it seemed like I guess in

retrospect what he was saying is that it

seemed that they were scavenging for

food at the dump they saw yeah they saw

they had eyes on and they bolted well

Travis said that he called RCMP right

away and they waited about 20 minutes

and didn't seem to get any kind of

response we phoned them back and think

they were already like there so that's

pretty exceptional considering the the

distance of travel and things yes the

community RCMP and the police are doing

their job and they've asked us to stay

back and just cordon off the community

kind of thing and keep an eye on the

perimeter and so we're sending the other

four members from Fox Lake to join the

other three so that we'll have seven

members they're watching the perimeter

of the community

so these he's shot two part before they

play or not well I guess all they heard

like all the Travis can tell me is that

the shops would that he heard the sound

of shots he doesn't know from who at who

just that he heard the sound your but

your guys are they're there and they

haven't said anything like that all that

all that he said to me is that they're

they're focusing on an area about the

size of a football field helicopter is

hovering over that area and they've got

a lot of resources there right now I'm

hoping that this comes to a swift then

and safe end for everyone what's going

through your mind for me remember that I

know you guys do a lot of great work

here but you're not it's not often that

you have guys searching for yes well

it's it's a little stressful I'll tell

you knowing that my people are in harm's

way that way also I wanted to be there

but I couldn't because my mother had a

medical procedure that I had to be here

with her for yesterday so I wasn't able

to go I was supposed to go tomorrow and

now that this is all happening I'm like

dang I'm here instead of there or I

should be and that's a little

aggravating but you know again the the

most important aspect is that everybody

stays safe and that that this comes to a

safe end yeah they again the plane was

there to pick them up this afternoon and

they refused to get off yeah and then

the guys that were like my people that

were in gilliam waiting for the plane to

come back to Winnipeg they refused to

get on they're coming back to they're

going back to York yeah so that's the

kind of people we got working with us

that's something I missed something

again I just want to clarify that you

know we are there at the request of the

grand chief Harlem duelists from the

seminary Manitoba Chiefs that's who's

taking care of all the charters and

things like that and keep them our

members fed and happy
