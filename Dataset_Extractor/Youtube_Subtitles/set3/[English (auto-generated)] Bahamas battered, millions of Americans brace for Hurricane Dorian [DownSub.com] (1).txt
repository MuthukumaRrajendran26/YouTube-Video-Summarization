we've seen a dramatic increase in the

number of watches warnings and

evacuation orders up and down the

Florida coast the first hurricane

warnings are now in effect here in

Daytona Beach we've been told we have to

pack up and leave starting tomorrow

morning along with all the other

residents and tourists but the bottom

line here is that this is a game of

inches for Florida and any small

deviation in Dorian's path will have a

dramatic impact on how it impacts

Florida on a Daytona street called

harm's way

residents are debating whether it's time

to get out we really don't know until

probably by the day or two before and by

then it's already too late many are

boarding up fearing they're about to be

in the path of a monster hurricane these

college roommates have a generator at

the ready but are just as ready to pack

up and leave we're gonna decide later

tonight once the Hurricanes pretty set

in what it's doing just up the street we

found Deborah kozloski preparing to ride

out the storm if it comes this way so

God's hands right now and we're just

hoping for the best

Dorian's uncertain path has made for

difficult planning at hardware stores

there's a last-minute run on supplies as

the track shifts closer to land plywood

is still the top seller one little bump

off of the predicted plane you know to

put us in a really bad place well up and

down the coast people wait for

evacuation orders that may or may not

come is they still don't know where it's

gonna hit so when we find out where it

hits then we'll take it from there

warnings and states of emergency now

stretch from Florida into Georgia and

the Carolinas utility crews from across

the US are now positioning themselves

along the coast while people stock up on

sandbags to prepare for storm surge and

flooding that will arrive even if the

storm stays off the coast if you look at

the forecast it absolutely could impact

the coast and turn once it hits the

coast and so we've got to prepare for

that eventualities a nervous waiting

game that has residents watching

Dorian's every twist and turn

even if Dorian doesn't make landfall he

will have had a major impact on Florida

on what should have been the busy Labor

Day weekend hotels that were booked

completely solid report occupancy rates

of less than 10 percent the airports are

shutting down today and tomorrow in

Orlando and Daytona Beach and gas

stations well about 50 percent of them

in this part of Florida have run

completely dry at this point
