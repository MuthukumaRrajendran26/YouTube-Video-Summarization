as political leaders crisscross the

country vying for votes Jeff Balin Gul

is fighting this election from his

Facebook page I think we're talking

about issues in a way that legacy media

and legacy political parties aren't the

former Conservative Party staffer now

runs Canada proud a not-for-profit

digital advocacy group whose mission is

to defeat Justin Trudeau one internet

meme at a time here are the top five

weird facts that people don't know about

Justin Trudeau the group packages these

mocking videos and images with text in

different languages designed for social

media and while it might be tempting to

laugh Aufbau Engels campaign this

Facebook page is no joke leading the

pack amongst engagement its content

receives upwards of a million shares

reactions and comments each week that's

more than some of Canada's top

mainstream news outlets the era of

dinosaur old style media dictating what

everyone's season here is it's quickly

fading so we're gonna see new emerging

voices I think that's largely a good

thing Canada proud is part of a new wave

of online advocacy groups on both sides

of the political spectrum there are

strict limits on how much these

registered third parties can spend on

their political advertising but those

restrictions don't matter if the content

goes viral it's clear that they let us

off the hook

Canada proud published this video that

appears to show Trudeau bragging about

bribing Canadian media organizations the

editor removed Trudeau's actual punch

line about his own bad press it's been

viewed hundreds of thousands of times

things that go viral are things that

appeal to some of our of our baser

instincts this political studies

professor says an average Facebook user

can struggle to differentiate between

news and advocacy what's happening is

the more people are consuming their news

particularly through social media the

more likely they are to present answers

which are kind of in favor of their

party rather than in favor of in favor

of the facts

more than 23 million Canadians are on

Facebook and polls suggest around half

the population now received their news

from social media making this a new

battleground in an election campaign
