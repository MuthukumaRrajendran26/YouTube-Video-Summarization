I reminded the Prime Minister of my

strong and long-standing advocacy not

just on stricter gun control but also on

the need to have stronger more respected

laws in areas like bail and sentencing

for gun crimes and the paramount need

and this was a point where I said to him

that we have much more to do and there's

quite frankly I'm not satisfied with

what has been done to date the need to

invest in kids and families and

neighborhoods these are areas where

there remains much to be done and at a

time of increased anxiety and troubling

criminal activity in our city I've asked

the Prime Minister to consider doing

more I believe that while it takes

longer to get the effects you need that

the investment in kids and families and

neighborhoods programs that work and

that can work and that must work our

programs we must invest more in together

and that we need to do better than we've

been doing it working together and

making those investments that's why our

government has invested money to prevent

cross-border smuggling of illegal guns

we've also given money to the province

to prevent and reduce gun and gang

violence and yesterday we announced a

joint effort between our government

mayor Tories government and the

government of Ontario by coming together

to provide four and a half million

dollars in funding for the Toronto

Police Service officers on the front

lines will be better supported in their

crucial task of keeping Torontonians

safe but as join John pointed out those

measures alone won't do it we need to

take a holistic approach if we want to

stop the gun violence that's shaken this

city one way our government can help is

by providing funding to build more safe

community spaces where young people can

spend time a great example is the

proposed new community center in

Lawrence Heights we made serious

commitments in 2015 to move forward on

stronger common-sense gun legislation

that's exactly what we did with Bill c71

enhancing background checks you know

bringing in other measures that will

make it more difficult to transport and

to spread guns we've invested massively

in gun measures at the border to ensure

that we're doing a better job of

interdicting guns from the United States

as

at the same time we strengthened gun

controls at home it is in parentheses of

concern that Andrew Shearer and the

Conservatives have committed to rolling

back a number of those stronger

protections we brought in and we know

that there is more to do that's why we

look forward to putting forward a plan

that will continue to invest in

controlling our guns and keeping our

communities safer and that's exactly the

thing we're going to move forward for

with on a stronger mandate
