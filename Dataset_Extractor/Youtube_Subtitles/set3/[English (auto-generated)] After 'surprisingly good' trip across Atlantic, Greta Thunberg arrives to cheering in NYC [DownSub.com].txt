just because of you come

[Applause]

open up

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

we are extremely relieved that this has

all worked out exactly as planned we

wish your greater all the best for your

upcoming journey to North and South

America

[Applause]

well all of this is very overwhelming

and the ground is still shaking for me

so but I want to thank everyone so much

everyone who is here and everyone who

who is involved in this climate fight

because this is a fight across borders

across continents and it's it's as you

said it is insane that a sixteen-year

will have to cross the Atlantic Ocean to

to make a stand and to and this of

course is not something that I want

everyone to do the trip was it was very

surprisingly good I did not feel seasick

once so that was

and I am very grateful for Tim aletheia

and everyone else who has been making

this trip possible and of course for

everyone everyone else every activist

who fight daily to to save the world

basically but to keep the fossil fuels

in the ground and to create safe passage

to I'm sorry my brain is not working

correctly the climate and ecological

crisis is a global crisis and the

biggest crisis humanity has ever faced

and if we don't manage to work together

to cooperate and to to work together

despite our differences then we will

fail so we need to to stand together and

support each other and and to take

action because otherwise it might be too

late so let's not wait any longer let's

do it now

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

okay so we've got time for some

questions so if you could state who your

questions for and we will start okay

gentlemen at the back there right now

I'm going to first finish this press

conference and then go go back to the

boats and get my stuff and then I'm

going to rest and then on this Friday

I'm going to join the school striking

young people outside the UN which they

have been doing for every Friday now for

more than half a year

yes even on a sailboat in the middle of

the Atlantic Ocean

I I heard about the poorest in the

Amazon rainforest the fires in the

Amazon rainforest and it is of course

devastating and I it's so horrible it's

hard to imagine I so I mean we need to I

mean this is a clear sign that we need

to stop destroying nature and we need

and our war against nature must end and

I mean the Amazon such a key to

addressing the climate crisis and the

ecological crisis so that is incredibly

important we cannot understand how

important it is so yeah

it's strange everyone always asked me

about Donald Trump but I mean my message

for him has just listened to the science

and he obviously doesn't do that so I

mean I as I always say to this question

if if any no one has been able to

convince him about the climate crisis

thing the urgency then why should I be

able to do that so I'm just going to to

now focus on on spreading awareness and

that people in general will start caring

and realize how big of a crisis this is

I mean of course oil and gas has its ups

and downs and we need to to sort of

realize the consequences from a bigger

perspective of what it actually does

when we use it the way we use it today

and and I'm pretty sure when Mills

doesn't cause cancers and was what's the

second question my message to the all

the activists to just keep going and I

know it's a where it may seem impossible

and hopeless sometimes but it always

does so you just have to continue

because if you try hard enough and long

enough you will make a difference and if

enough people stand together fight for

the right thing then anything can happen

[Applause]

[Music]

I mean of course that is it's a huge

focus on me as an individual and maybe

in a way that takes away from the focus

from the actual problem and so I mean of

course I I wish this was more not

focused on me but more as a whole and

yeah so but I mean there's not much I

can do about that if I if what I'm doing

makes it can make a difference and it if

it can create attention for the climate

crisis then I am going to use that

opportunity to to try to change things

[Applause]

indeed I'm going to to relax for some

some days now and I will I won't really

celebrate this trip or anything I will

just be as normal because that is what I

enjoy it the most to do anything so go

go for walks and eat fresh food not to

freeze dried and to be dry and to to

clean myself

I am definitely coming to Chile as it

looks now and I'm going to try to get

there

of course without flying so there will

be a lot of trains buses and probably

even sailing as well I will figure that

out as time by and from cop 25 I expect

I mean that must be some kind of

breaking point this United Nations

climate action summits in September now

and the cop 25 these two have to be a

tipping point and I think I hope it will

be because it must and I and many people

with me are going to try to do

everything we can to make sure that the

world leaders have all eyes on them

during these conferences so that they

cannot continue to ignore this

I was how old I were when I first

started to become a climate activists or

I first heard about like found out about

this issue when I was maybe seven eight

or nine years old and then I I realized

that's oh this is actually very bad and

I started to read about it more and more

and when I became maybe 11 I became

depressed and the climate crisis was a

huge cause of that and because I just

felt that there everything is hopeless

and there's nothing we can do when no

one is doing anything and but then I

sort of got out of that depression by

promising myself that I'm going to do

everything I can to change things and

that it's what I tried to do and I

started to go to marches and

demonstrations and to join organizations

and things like that but I still thought

things were too slow that nothing was

really changing so I I was desperate in

a way tried to do something just

anything and then this idea of school

striking came up and then I thought yeah

I might just as well try that and see if

it works and if it doesn't then I will

try something else and then I did it and

then it became huge very quickly

[Music]

I mean

what I say to to all leaders is that we

have to take you you have to take

responsibility and see the bigger

picture and and of course different

countries have different what is there

how do you think different

ways or they're depending on different

things and and that of course we need to

take into account that's and of course

the aspect of equity which is stated

throughout the Paris agreement we also

need to take into account the different

countries are on different developing

levels and we need to make sure that

everyone gets a just transition because

and that's why yeah

I mean yes burning fossil fuels and that

of course creates more greenhouse gases

in the atmosphere and increases the the

percentage of several greenhouse gases

such as carbon dioxide and so yeah that

is that is true maybe and of course that

combined with deforestation and

destruction of natural habitats

okay are not a good combination because

so yeah

one thing I'm going to miss the most is

to be disconnected from everything and

everyone do not have contact with anyone

and to just not have anything you have

to do and to just sit put literally sit

for hours and just stare at the ocean

not doing anything that was great and

I'm going to miss that a lot and of

course to be in this wilderness the

ocean and to see the beauty of it and

that I mean those are going to miss

peace and quiet

[Applause]
