this way

he's very candid very forthcoming he

regretted what happened but I told them

I'd work with me I know him personally

I've sat with him at the cabinet table I

sit with him at the cabinet table he's

no I understand how difficult this is

for many people and then I said to him

look I know that you are a champion of

diversity that you care about people and

I know there's no one that I know at

least that's champion diversity

inclusion like Justin Trudeau and that's

why it's a privilege for me to be part

of his team and to be part of this

campaign you you and every other

candidate has to be a professional name

and a career on the line for him to go

deep by him I mean it put your election

chances further out of risk do you feel

like you're missed

I have a lot of respect for I think this

moment demonstrates that he was very

candid with Canadians he's very sincere

he was very sincere he was very sincere

in his regrets but he it's a leadership

it's a leadership attribute to take

responsibility when you took

responsibility unlike other leaders who

haven't taken responsibility but more

importantly he's engaging Canadians have

run a broader conversation and I'm part

of a very diverse cabinet I'm part of

conversations where we put forward

anti-racism policies we're part of a

government that promotes LGBTQ rights so

I'm very proud to work with him and I

know what he stands for he's a person

that truly champions diversity and

inclusion

so I can't speak to what I don't know I

think he's being very candid very

forthcoming with Canadians and as you

heard today were focused on measures to

help middle-class families to

demonstrate that we're focused on

investing in middle-class families and I

don't err you hear I hear when I go door

knocking trust me I got my running shoes

on so right after this event I'm gonna

be knocking on doors and what I hear

from Canadians is the fact that they're

concerned by the cuts that they're

seeing in Ontario and they're looking

for a forward-looking progressive

government and a party that's going to

focus on their concerns and their

anxieties and that's what I'm gonna be

doing no this is the first time and of

course that I've meditated every song

that means how can you say he's being

candid you use that word so many times

when he can't say whether he's worn

blackface since 2001 in recent memory

he's been up here speaking to reporters

to Canadians about this issue who's

taking many questions and like I said

I've worked with him very closely I've

known him for many many years he truly

is a champion when it comes to diversity

inclusion I know what it means to sit

with him at the cabinet table when it

comes to fighting for those that are

falling through the cracks that are less

fortunate and it really is an honor and

privilege to work with him and that's

why I have confidence in him and his

leadership
