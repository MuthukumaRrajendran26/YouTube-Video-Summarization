good morning everyone thank you for

being here it's great to be here at the

Fredericton bowling club alongside Matt

de Courcey for the last four years matt

has been doing a tremendous job

representing his community in Ottawa he

has fought for the things that matter

most to families things like betters

child support for seniors sorry better

support for seniors the new Canada child

benefit and mitigating the impacts of

floods in the region I know that Matt is

ready to continue this important work

after October 21st and keep moving

Fredericton forward also happy to be

here with our great some of our great

members of the brunswick team and look

forward to continue to work with them as

well Jeanette Karen and Elena my friends

in every election we get to make an

important choice about the kind of

country we want to live in we get to

decide what kind of future we want to

build together in 2015 after a decade of

failed conservative policy Canada's

economy was flat economic growth job

creation wage growth all were stalled

thanks to a Conservative government that

believed cuts and austerity were the

answers to everything

the Canadian oh don't you see in Havana

possibly Kapiolani I mean you're really

shows you only belong bullet moving

across the country

poverty is down and unemployment is low

and job creation is way up and it's

because our team rejected conservative

cuts and austerity and chose instead to

invest in the middle class and people

working hard to join it we've put more

money in people's pockets by cutting

taxes for the middle class and raising

them on the wealthiest 1% we stop

sending child benefit checks to

millionaires so we could send

or to the single parent working two jobs

more to the family of five that falls a

bit short

at the end of the month and we're

conserving more of our nature ensuring

that our air stays clean and our water

stays safe because we owe it to our kids

and to ourselves to take care of our

environment the service models allow for

Oprah Vanille who's out politic this

Andy Harper that's the choice

it's that clear and it's that important

conservatives like to say they're for

the people but then they cut taxes for

the wealthy and cut services for

everybody else including for seniors our

liberal government chose to move canada

forward by investing in families and

seniors and in our communities by having

faith in canadians and the results speak

for themselves in four short years

canadians have created over a million

jobs we negotiated new health accords

with the provinces and territories

including historic investments in mental

health and in-home care the new Canada

Child Benefit is helping parents with

hundreds of dollars tax-free every month

and we've lifted nine hundred thousand

Canadians out of poverty including

300,000 kids we're off to a great start

but we know that here in New Brunswick

and right across the country there's

more to do we know more people need our

help Canadians are living longer than

ever before but as they age costs go up

so a lot of people are struggling to

keep up with the costs of prescription

drugs to make rent and to buy their

grandkids presents for Christmas our

parents have worked so hard and

sacrificed so much to give us a good

life once they get to retirement they

and have to worry about their savings

running out one of the first things we

did when we took office was to reverse

the Harper government's decision to

raise the age of eligibility for Old Age

Security and the guaranteed income

supplement to 67 from 65 we boosted GIS

by nearly $1000 for low-income seniors

who live alone

Piscotty in proven power dollar check

the pain today were continuing this

important work of investing in and

supporting our seniors by announcing

that a reelected Liberal government will

increase old age security by an extra 10

percent once folks turn 75 these

measures will increase benefits for most

seniors by 729 dollars next year that

number will continue to rise each year

with inflation and that's on top of the

money seniors have already received from

the positive changes we've made to OAS

and GIS by expanding benefits for older

Canadians during our first mandate we

helped lift 50,000 seniors out of

poverty with these new measures we will

help 20,000 more seniors two-thirds of

whom are women these changes will help

many people here in New Brunswick but

today were taking things even further a

new Liberal government will also work

with provinces and territories to boost

the Canada Pension Plan and the Quebec

pension plans survivor benefits by 25

percent for surviving spouse this would

mean an increase in maximum

benefits of more than $2,000 per year

losing your partner is one of the

hardest things people will have to go

through in their lives with this new

measure our government is giving those

who've lost a loved one some much-needed

breathing room as they grieve and adjust

to a new life

my friends seniors have built the Canada

that we know and love today and they

deserve to enjoy their golden years to

the fullest while the Conservative

leader wants to go back to the policies

of the Harper years policies that hurt

seniors our new Liberal government will

continue to step up for those who need

it and deserve it most because at the

end of the day politics is about people

it's about you and whether you're 7 or

77 you deserve a real plan for the

future my friends we've done a lot over

the past four years together but the

truth is we're just getting started

on October 21st we all have an important

choice to make will we go back to the

failed policies of the past or will we

continue to move forward I'm for moving

forward for everyone now see that Lisa's

mother

hi mr. Trudeau David Kaufman from CBC

News the latest numbers from the finance

department have the deficit for the last

fiscal year at about 14 billion dollars

you've made about four billion dollars

in new spending promises during this

campaign but we haven't seen a cost on

how you're going to pay for it or how it

will impact the deficit so will you give

us a deficit-reduction plan in your

platform or Shakuni means expect that as

long as you're in the Prime Minister's

office the country is going to be in

deficit Canadians expect their

governments to be fiscally responsible

and that is something that is the heart

of everything the Liberal government has

done and will continue to do but we made

a very different choice than the

Conservatives did in 2015

instead of continuing to propose cuts

and austerity as the Conservatives had

done for

years under Stephen Harper we made a

decision to invest to invest in our

seniors to invest in our kids to invest

in communities and that has worked over

the past four years we see an

unemployment at record lows we've seen

job creation at record highs we've seen

hundreds of thousands of people lifted

out of poverty because we have a plan

that understands that confident a

confident country can and should be

investing in itself and in its future

but the fiscal responsibility element is

really important we know that every

single year under our plan and this will

continue our debt as a proportion of our

country's GDP will continue to decrease

it's one of the lowest sin in the world

and it's continuing to get lower

that's the fiscally responsible plan

that we have always put forward but of

course a lot of politicians talk about

you know their plan and their

responsibility and and other people's

responsibilities people are a little bit

skeptical of politicians I get that

which is why people should look at the

official and the credible bond rating

agencies that actually look at fiscal

plans of country around countries around

the world and assess them there are only

11 countries in the world with triple-a

bond ratings Canada is one of them

Moody's S&P others have looked at

Canada's fiscal plan and said that is a

sustainable plan for the future one that

Canadians can be confident in so we are

going to continue to invest in Canadians

to support our seniors and to grow our

economy and keep things better for the

future

mr. Trudeau just to follow up on the

specific Canada Pension Plan boosts that

you're proposing here today you boost

benefits you have to pay for it somehow

so are you telling Canadians to pay for

this promise their premiums are going to

have to increase over what they are now

there are two announcements today we're

making one is that we are increasing Oh

a s by 10 percent for seniors over 75

years old because we recognize that as

people age sometimes their costs go up

as well that's why we are going to be

there to support seniors and I will

remind you that Stephen Harper's

government cut benefits for seniors by

raising the retirement age from 65 to 67

and he didn't campaign on that he didn't

promise he was going to do that he just

went ahead and did it and the

Conservatives will do that again they're

trying to pretend that you can get all

of Stephen Harper's credits without

getting any of his cuts that's just not

credible

in regards to the Canada Pension Plan we

will work with the provinces and

territories to ensure that we're able to

increase survivors benefits for a widow

or a widower from 60% to 75% we know

losing a loved one is one of the hardest

things someone's going to go through

losing the partner and we need to give

them more support to be able to live out

the rest of their life in in in in

safety and security and that is

something we're going to work with the

provinces and territories on as we know

changes of the CPP require us to work

with the provinces and territories we

demonstrated that we could do that when

we strengthen the CPP in the in the

spring of 2016

even though the Conservatives were

opposed to it and have committed to

reversing those changes we made to the

CPP that's a conversation we're going to

be having with the provinces hi mr.

Trudeau Tom Perry with CBC News and who

sure says you're gonna have to raise

taxes and to pay for your deficits to

pay for all this new spending what's

your response

will you have to raise people's taxes

for all these promises you're making we

are the party that has lowered taxes for

Canadians we lower taxes for the middle

class as the first thing we did by

raising them on the wealthiest 1% we've

consistently invested in the middle

class things like the Canada Child

Benefit things like the increase of the

guaranteed income supplement because we

know that when you put more money in

Canadians pockets they do better and the

economy does better that's the

fundamental contrast with the vision

that the Conservatives put forward that

continue to think you can cut your way

to growth that austerity is a way of

creating opportunity and growth it

failed it failed for 10 years under

Stephen Harper and Andrew Shearer has

exactly the same plan in 2015 and in

2019 we have a different approach we

know that investing in Canadians and in

their communities is the way to grow the

economy we are going to be lowering

taxes for Canadians and increasing

opportunities and benefits

it's for them like we are today because

that is the way to create a prosperous

society the Conservatives don't

understand that we've not seen an

independent costing commit to allowing

one of the commitments we made in the

last election was to empower the

Parliamentary Budget Officer to be able

to actually cost the different political

parties election platforms and I can

assure you that we have been and are

working with the Parliamentary Budget

Officer on costing elements for our

platform we will be releasing a fully

look carefully at how we can work with

the Quebec government to benefit

citizens just like we work with

governments right across the country to

to help out theirs

citizens yes there are government's who

disagree with us on certain things and

it's obvious it comes to mind that the

fact that there's a number of

conservative premiers that don't think

we should be fighting climate change

that think we should make pollution free

again well I'm sorry I think Canadians

including in those provinces across the

country understand that the only way to

build a stronger future for our economy

is also to make sure we're protecting

the environment and that's what we've

done consistently so we will try to work

with the Premier's wherever we can but

we will continue to stand up strongly

for what is right and what Canadians

need every step of the way we will

always work to do that in a respectful

and collaborative way whenever possible

glorious evening is mr. Trudeau has be

moving closer to Election Day can you

tell me what the Liberal Party is doing

to prepare for the possibility of

foreign cyber interference in the

electoral process and also fake online

news we demonstrated leadership on this

over the past year as our Minister of

democratic institutions Kareena Gould

move forward on measures and a

legislation that protects Canadians from

and our electoral systems and our

democracies from foreign interference we

obviously know we have to continue to

remain vigilant we have intelligence

agencies and security agencies who are

ensuring that we are continuing to have

free and fair elections we have created

bodies that are there independently to

oversee if there is interference in our

our electoral process at the same time

however

citizens need to be very alert and aware

of the propagation of misinformation and

falsehoods on the Internet I think we've

demonstrated as a party that we take

that responsibly very responsibility

very seriously unfortunately we're

seeing from Andrew Shearer and the

Conservatives the kinds of behavior and

the kinds of misrepresentation of the

truth that really resembles what we see

south of the border I don't think that's

something the Canadians want I think

that's something that we're all going to

have to stand strongly against and

ensure that the

debates and disagreements we have in

this election between parties that are

important for Canadians to understand

the issues and see the different

perspectives happen in a way that is

based on facts and reality to allow for

a strong robust but truth based contrast

morning mr. Trudeau Teresa Wright from

The Canadian Press I'd like to ask you

about the first nation of nests can tag

aware a number of there been forced

evacuations because of the lack of water

people are getting sick from the water

can you please talk about what you're

prepared to do about the water crisis in

our community we are very concerned

about the situation in the community I

can assure you that our Minister of

indigenous Services Seamus O'Regan has

been in contact with the leadership of

that community if people from the

department of indigenous services are

engaged to provide the supports

necessary and we're going to continue to

work with the communities the community

to keep people safe and take the

measures and the steps necessary to

ensure that people are kept safe

we know that ensuring drinking water in

indigenous communities is a priority the

Canadians called for in the 2015

election we set out an ambitious plan to

lift all boil water advisories in

indigenous communities right across the

country within five years and I can

report we have lifted 87 long-term boil

water advisories and are on track to

eliminate all those remaining on

schedule that is something that matters

that is something matters to Canadians

and obviously to indigenous peoples as

well but there's always more to do and

that's why we're working with this

community needed is facing a very

difficult situation right now this

community has been without safe drinking

water for 25 years

a little over a week ago you sent the

military to help this part of the

country in the wake of Hurricane Dorian

why not more urgency when dealing with

water issues for indigenous communities

we take extremely seriously the

responsibility to move forward with

urgency on fixing the drinking water

situation in communities right across

the country that's why we've been able

to lift 87 long-term boil water

advisories when as you pointed out for

decades very little was done we know

that there is more to do and that is why

we are working with this community we

were looking at all different options in

terms of how we're going to create

stable long-term drinking drinking water

supplies for these community needs that

have in many cases suffered for Tod far

too long thank you thank you sir good

morning David akin from Global News I'd

say you deeply disappointed many

progressive voters that you're you're

broken promise on electoral form a

bald-faced broken promise on electoral

reform is the biggest one and a lot of

those disillusioned progressive values

voters are thinking this time about

voting for the Green Party and many in

this write another writing so I want

vite you to address that voter who is

voted liberal in 2015 but now is

seriously looking at a green option what

can you say to them to rebuild that

trust get them excited again about

politics because they're disappointed

actually throughout this campaign we've

been talking not just to specific groups

of Canadians but to all Canadians

demonstrating that we understand that as

much as we have done over the past four

years on being one of the governments of

the government that has done more for

protecting the environment than any

government in history done more on

indigenous reconciliation services than

any government in history that there is

always lots more to do we are we have

brought in a feminist international

development policy that has made a huge

impact

on communities around the world by

empowering and educating women in some

of the most vulnerable communities we

have done many of the things that

Canadians asked us to do over the past

four years at the same time we recognize

there is lots more to do and that gets

down to the choice that Canadians are

facing right now do we continue to do

the hard work that we've been doing over

these past four years moving forward on

protecting the environment while

protecting Canadians economic well-being

as we move towards the future do we

continue to prepare for a world that is

changing rapidly and empower citizens

young people workers with training and

education to be able to continue to

thrive in a transforming world do we

continue to play a strong role in the

international stage standing up for our

values and creating opportunities for

people around the world are we going to

continue to stay true to our values and

do the hard work we've been doing for

the past four years or do we go back to

the Harper years that is the choice

Canadians are facing right now this is a

really important election and I look

forward to continuing to talk with

Canadians about the positive choice to

move forward that we are putting forward

to them let me just put a little finer

point because a lot of Canadians have

had to make choices in the last four

years and in PEI the Green Party is

official opposition and the Liberals are

in third place in this province there's

three Green out my ways and these voters

here rejected a liberal government very

closely aligned to yours there's a first

Green Party MPP in Ontario the Greens

hold the balance of power in BC how do

you account for all these people

choosing green how do you figure that

out this is all while you've been Prime

Minister I think at the same time as we

look what's happening across the country

we have to recognize that even though

the vast majority of Canadians are

really concerned about the environment

and about fighting climate change in

provincial governments right across the

country there have been conservative

premiers elected who don't believe in

fighting climate change who don't

believe that protecting the environment

needs to be a priority and

fortunately that's something New

Brunswickers are struggling with right

now people are choosing premiers who are

choosing to use millions of dollars of

your money to fight a concrete plan to

fight climate change in the courts

instead of figuring out how to work with

us to build a better future in which we

can have a stronger environment and make

life more affordable for all Canadians

the fact is the price on pollution that

we're bringing in right across the

country in those provinces where

conservative premiers supported by

Andrew Shearer want to make pollution

free again we are putting more money in

the pockets of most New Brunswickers

with putting a price on pollution than

they would have if we didn't put that

price on pollution we are fighting

climate change and making it affordable

for Canadians so the fact that people

are making different choices at the

provincial level is interesting to

political scientists and to pundits but

I'm listening to Canadians and Canadians

tell me we need to have a strong plan

for the future we need to be able to

fight climate change and grow the

economy at the same time and we've done

more on both of those fronts over the

past four years than any government in

Canadian history but we are the first to

recognize there's lots more to do and

that's the choice Canadians are facing

right now do we continue with the

positive choice we made in 2015

or do we go back to the Harper years

with envy share

why are you supporting a pipeline in the

West and not energy East the energy East

project was withdrawn by the proponent

for market reasons for price reasons for

reasons of supply and demand if there is

no project for the federal government to

evaluate then there is no project for

the federal government to evaluate

projects that come forward we will

evaluate on their merit through a

rigorous process that the Conservatives

didn't believe in we know the only way

to build infrastructure projects

particularly energy infrastructure

projects is to demonstrate

responsibility towards the environment

partnership with indigenous peoples and

to work collaboratively with communities

and governments right across the country

and as projects come forward we will

submit them through a rigorous process

but if the proponent withdraws a project

we can't make a determination on that

project new civil ke moko's avatar la
