well yes it's been a difficult couple of

weeks for this community many of the

residents here have gone from worrying

about two of their own Briar szpakowski

and Ken MacLeod thinking that they were

missing to complete shock upon learning

that they were actually murder suspects

in the BC murders now since then it's

been tense many wanting answers as the

nationwide manhunt has unfolded and

awaiting the fate of the two young men

which of course we learned today it's

about time glad they got him I hate to

say it but dead or alive heartbreaking

for the parents you can't tell the kids

to turn off now Port Alberni is actually

quite a small city just roughly 18,000

people and being thrust into this

international spotlight has been

difficult today the mayor says this may

bring some closure but it's not the

outcome they were hoping for as a

community and and from the perspective

of the city we are just incredibly

saddened by the news it's not the

outcome that we were hoping for and I

mean there's just been so much tragedy

here now as for the shpigelsky and

McLeod families there were several

vehicles parked outside of their homes

today no trespassing signs were also

posted along with the notice on one of

the doorways that said they are asking

for privacy at this time it will not be

making any statements to media
