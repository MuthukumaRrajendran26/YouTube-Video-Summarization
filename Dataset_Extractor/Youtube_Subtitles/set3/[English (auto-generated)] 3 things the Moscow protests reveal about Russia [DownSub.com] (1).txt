July 14th 2019 Moscow Russia

police detained dozens of people at a

rally they are fighting for fair

elections officials disqualified

opposition candidates from a city

election saying they failed to collect

enough genuine signatures to run but

what started as discontent about a local

election has since turned into something

much bigger

tens of thousands joined in August saw

the biggest political protest Russia has

seen in close to a decade the police

crackdowns have escalated growing more

violent those who wanted to run as the

opposition have been arrested but the

protests represent much more than ballot

blogging these speak to what's happening

throughout the country starting with its

leader his name and face pop up at many

of the rallies in the nation's capital

but the man himself is anywhere but the

protest during 1 July event Vladimir

Putin wasn't even on land he was

underwater to see a sunken submarine if

he wanted to interfere with it he would

he would he could look like the goods

are he could make a public statement

make him go back over those nominating

papers and lo and behold find that

they're okay

that would defuse the whole thing he

hasn't done that so clearly he he backs

rather draconian methods that Moscow is

using Putin has been in powerful

political positions since 1999 and his

rating as a leader is still up there at

well over 60% more than what many other

world leaders can brag about but

Russia's trust in Putin has been

slipping and this may be because a

younger generation is looking for change

[Music]

they've only known Putin in power so

there's a great deal of Putin fatigue

and the 20 and early 30 year-olds see

the possibility of Putin staying in

power for at least another five years

according to his constitutional term and

they're seeing their most productive

years of their life all taking place

under one ruler which they see is just

something that shouldn't happen in a

civilized country but some of the people

out there pushing for change are getting

pushed back police punched this 26 year

old woman in the stomach an incident

that had Russian celebrities take notice

including rapper Igor Creed who posted

about the arrests and if history proves

anything the more authorities have tried

to fight the people on the streets the

more angry they become

[Music]

protests like these are a pretty rare

sight in Russia but they look a lot like

the protests that happened between 2011

and 2013 when police clashed with

anti-putin protesters who took to the

streets alleging electoral fraud today

the people of Moscow are again on the

streets for democracy a segment of

population got really angry about being

treated basically treated like garbage

by the ruling bureaucracy of the city

there even the scraps of democracy that

they enjoyed we're kind of snatched away

from them in a rude sort of a way but

it's extremely significant because it

points to the Achilles heel of the Putin

regime and the mini Putin regime in

Moscow which is that they don't have

democratic legitimacy Putin has had a

tight grip on Russia for two decades but

what's brewing in the nation's capital

could pose a challenge that could sink

the Russian leader
