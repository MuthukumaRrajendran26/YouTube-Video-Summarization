hello everyone it's great to be back in

Toronto with so many outstanding members

of our liberal team they've been true

advocates for their community these last

four years helping us bring about real

change for the middle class and building

an economy that works for everyone

I'm very much looking forward to

continuing the work we've started

together after election day but first we

all have a very important choice to make

on October 21st we get to decide what

kind of future we want to build together

we get to choose the kind of country we

want our kids to grow up in under milk

Canadians chose a new team with a new

approach a team with a clear vision of

the kind of Canada they wanted to build

a Canada that is fairer safer and more

prosperous for all Canadians four years

later we still have a lot of work to do

but we've moved forward from the

policies of the Harper years and we've

got the record to prove it poverty is

way down unemployment is at historic

lows and job creation is way up and it's

because our team rejected conservative

cuts and austerity

because we chose to put people first we

stop sending child benefit checks to

millionaires so we could send more to

the single parent working two jobs and

to the family of five that still has

trouble making ends meet at the end of

you know I've been on the campaign trail

for a little over a week now and have

been to every province everywhere I go I

talk about the progress we've made the

solutions we've built and the people

we've helped I talked about the change

we delivered real change but as I stand

here today I think of the thousands of

families who've lost a loved one to gun

violence during those same four years on

the issue of guns one thing I can say is

that not enough has changed don't get me

wrong we did take meaningful steps to

address gun violence Stephen Harper made

it easier to purchase and transfer a

weapon we reversed that we started

requiring firearm retailers to conduct

more extensive background checks

something the conservative leader plans

to scrap if he's elected but as long as

Canadians are losing their loved ones to

gun violence not enough has changed not

for the teenager who was murdered in

Mississauga on Sunday not for the man

who is shot in Calgary on Monday not for

the parent who buried their child not

for the little brother or sister who's

been left behind in 2017 there were 25

more victims of gun violence in Canada

than in 2013 2500 the conservative

leader looks at those numbers and still

thinks it should be easier for people to

buy a gun

he is vowed to gut Canada's gun control

law he wants to loosen restrictions on

assault weapons he wants to scrap

enhanced background checks and he wants

people to be able to buy a gun without

ever even showing their license to own

it gun crime in Canada is on the rise

it's a fact frankly I don't understand

how anyone could look at this alarming

trend and conclude that we need less gun

control but that's for the conservative

leaders to explain to Canadians here's

what we will do to end gun violence we

will ban military-style assault rifles

and start a buyback program for all

military-grade weapons that were legally

purchased

[Applause]

and we will work with the provinces and

territories to enable municipalities to

restrict handguns that's what a

reelected Liberal government will do

I'll also tell you what we won't do we

will not bring back the long gun

registry and we will continue to respect

Canadian farmers and hunters but we know

you do not need a military-grade assault

weapon when designed to kill the largest

number of people in the shortest amount

of time to take down a deer Deborah rail

in Canada and that's what a reelected

liberal government will strive to do

I've often said that politics is about

people and on this particular issue

here's the hard truth people are dying

families are grieving communities are

suffering so we're going to do more and

we're going to do better thoughts and

prayers are just not going to cut it

the choice could not be clearer liberals

are for tougher gun laws conservatives

are for weaker gun laws that's that's

the difference between forward and

backwards

that's what choosing forward means hi

Michelle's olio with The Globe and Mail

if you couldn't answer in English and

French that would be appreciated for my

colleagues the vast majority of hand

guns used in crimes in Toronto come from

outside the city in fact the Danforth

hand gun came from Saskatchewan

municipal ban would do little to stop

the flow of these domestic guns into the

city so my question is why aren't the

Liberals willing to have a countrywide

ban on handguns we are moving forward on

an approach that is going to work to

keep our communities safer we know that

banning military-style assault weapons

is an important step in keeping Canadian

safe and strengthening the safe storage

laws for legal gun handgun owners is

going to be extremely important as well

to prevent legally purchased firearms

and handguns from ending up in criminal

hands but we've also heard very clearly

from a number of cities like Toronto and

others who've said that they want more

tools to restrict handguns within their

municipalities and that's why we were

going to work with them and work with

provinces and territories to give them

the power to do just that you work on

yourself

you have a clip of a secret well Paul

O'Neill is a cheap affair exactly Massa

Perry with CBC News I can get you to

answer in English and French as well

they're already strict limits on who can

own an ar-15 or a weapon like that there

are limits on the size of the magazine

you can have for this weapon so what's

the justification for banning an

outright and on your buyback program

what happens if someone doesn't want to

sell you their weapon are you not

turning law-abiding gun owners into

criminals um we recognize that there's

always going to be more to do on

protecting citizens and communities from

gun violence that's why we're moving

forward on banning assault weapons and

enabling cities to ban to restrict

handguns we believe that the choice is

very clear

liberals want to strengthen gun control

conservatives want to weaken it

conservative leader has talked about

expanding the size of magazines

available we think that's a step in

exactly the wrong direction the

Conservatives want to loosen gun laws we

want to strengthen it we know that guns

designed for killing the largest amount

of people in the shortest amount of time

have no place in Canadian society have

no place in our communities that is why

we are banning more

within tolerance and marginalization as

part of their daily experience who I

me to be an ally who are deeply hurt by

the terrible choice choices I made many

very very hard to demonstrate that as an

individual and as a leader I will

continue to stand against intolerance

and racism I will continue to stand

intolerance their entire lives in ways

that some of us like me have never had

an incident for which I am deeply sorry

and I have apologized to Canadians but I

have also pledged to continue to work

with all Canadians in the fight against

Islamophobia anti-semitism anti black

racism racism and intolerance in all its

shapes and forms and on that I am

certainly in deep agreement with mr.

in your past from your youth before your

Academy or anywhere else that you think

Canadians should know about now or that

if you were running for the Liberals for

the first time a vetting committee might

take some

real issue with I have been forthright

about the incidents that I remember as

was pointed out I hadn't remembered the

incident on the in the rafting the

rafting company I was working for and

that's why I am worried about being

definitive I did not realize at the time

how much this hurt minority Canadians

racialized Canadians and for that I am

deeply sorry I hurt people who consider

me and have considered me to be an ally

and I will continue to fight against

racism and discrimination with

everything I do as leader black face any

other type of incidents or actions note

that I can recall yeah um she from

laughing sister you apologized

immediately after the black faith faith

issue emerged but you haven't apologized

or taking any actions regarding the SNC

leveling scandal some feminists they

were the solution that because the way

you treated the two strong female

feminists female ministers and there

they were disappointed that you you get

in the owner your prom is too long a

transparent government and to hold the

principle of Independence of Judas

judicial review judicial independence

and so what corrections are you going to

take to convince that the dissolution

feminists that you are still can be

trusted and to be voted for first of all

I recognize that one of the fundamental

jobs of any prime minister is to stand

up for the public interest to stand up

for Canadian jobs and that's exactly

what I did and what I will always do is

stand up for Canadians and their jobs

and their pensions and their communities

I will do that in a way that will and

always have respected the independent

judicial processes that

our core to our institutions and our

democracy that is why I asked the

Honourable and McClellan to gather

recommendations by a broad range of

experts to consult with just about every

living former attorney general in this

country to make recommendations so that

no future government is in the situation

that we we were in we will continue to

stand up for Canadian jobs we will

continue to respect the independence of

our judiciary and future governments

we'll have better tools to be able to do

that mr. Trudeau where you a member of

any fraternity while in college that

discriminated and campaigned against

immigration and secondly I couldn't see

any member of the cabinet racialized

community behind you is this a choosing

in the political campaign as we are

witnessing it today first of all I I was

never a member of any fraternity in my

university years or organizations that

discriminated against people my my

primary involvement in clubs in

university was both the McGill debating

Union and the McGill students as the

sexual assault center of the McGill

student society where I fought against

and stood against the kind of challenges

that far too many women were facing

around sexual assault and still continue

to face in regards to the people here

today there are many many great

candidates from all sorts of different

backgrounds and sorry marrying is here

and yes marrying is is is here we have a

great team of diverse Canadians who

stepped forward to serve Canada

including in our cabinet and we're going

to continue to make sure that we have a

government and a party that looks

hello at Toronto Star the premier Doug

Ford of Ontario has said that he would

have posed a handgun ban ban on hanging

on sales in the City of Toronto how

would the liberal is ensure that if the

city as it has said it wants to do wants

the right to impose a handgun ban on in

the city of Toronto that it can follow

through with the province imposing we

are going to be working with

municipalities across the country on

giving them the ability to restrict

handguns within their their city limits

we recognize that there are many

conservatives out there who think we

should be weakening gun control I

disagree liberals think we need to

strengthen gun control and we need to

listen to municipal leaders like John

Tory very plant and others who've been

very clear that they need to keep their

citizens safe by further limiting

handguns in their cities and we will

work with them and with the provinces to

give them something that not just

municipal leaders but many many

Canadians are asking for reckon a so

hi Jamie good foreign from cp24 I'd like

to give you an opportunity to respond to

some comments made in an inner

that I conducted with the co-founder of

black lives matter Toronto I in regards

to the photos and video they say that

they were outraged but not surprised

given your track record on policy

relating to race that the apology was

filled with empty words and that the

apology doesn't matter what matters most

is how you will fix race relations like

you to respond to that

obviously I deeply hurt racialized

Canadians and I am deeply sorry for that

I understand the anger and the

frustration of people who everyday face

discrimination face anti black racism

face systemic bias face face unconscious

unconscious bias and systemic

discrimination these are things that our

government has taken significant steps

not just to stand against but to

actually act on whether it was

recognizing the UN decade of people of

African descent and investing 25 million

dollars over the coming years so that

community organizations in the black

community can have the financing and

funding to continue to help members of

their community whether it's moving

forward on a national anti racism

strategy that includes anti black racism

Islamophobia anti-semitism and other

forms of discrimination and intolerance

we have moved forward in many different

ways of trying to demonstrate a

government that will consistently and

unequivocally stand up to defend

people's rights to defend people against

intolerance and discrimination but I

recognize there is much much more to do

and I recognize that on a personal level

I deeply hurt and disappointed many

people who considered me to be an ally

and for that I am deeply sorry merci
