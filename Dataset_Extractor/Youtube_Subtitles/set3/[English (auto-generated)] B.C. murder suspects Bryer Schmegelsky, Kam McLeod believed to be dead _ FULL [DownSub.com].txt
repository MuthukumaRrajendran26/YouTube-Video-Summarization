good afternoon over the last two weeks

our officers have worked tirelessly to

find the suspects wanted in connection

to the homicides in British Columbia

well there were no confirmed sightings

since July 22nd we never gave up in our

search efforts following up on every

lead considering all options and using

every available resource we knew that we

needed just to find that one piece of

evidence that could move this search

forward on Friday August 2nd that one

critical piece of evidence was found

items directly linked to the suspects

were located on the shoreline of the

Nelson River following this discovery we

were at last able to narrow down the

search we immediately sent and

specialized our CMP teams to begin

searching nearby high probability areas

this morning

at approximately 10:00 a.m. RCMP

officers located two male bodies in the

dense brush within one kilometer from

where the items were found this is

approximately eight kilometers from

where the burnt vehicle was located at

this time we believe these are the

bodies of the two suspects wanted in

connection with the homicides in British

Columbia an autopsy is being scheduled

in Winnipeg to confirm their identities

and to determine their cause of death to

the families of everyone affected by the

series of events over the last few weeks

I know it has been so very difficult and

I hope today's announcement can begin to

bring some closure I want to thank the

communities and the leadership of

gilliam Fox Lake Cree Nation Ilford War

Lake First Nation and York Landing your

lives have been disrupted many of you

lived with uncertainty and fear but

throughout you were resilient you came

together as communities and you helped

our officers get the job done to the

officers involved in the search I

commend you for your determination your

innovation for never giving up and for

working night and day to bring this sir

to a conclusion this was a search that

could not have been successfully

achieved without the help from our

partners and Canadian Armed Forces from

RCMP employees who came in from across

the country and from multiple private

partners above all however it was a

search that could only be successful if

we had strong public engagement and

support thank you to all Canadians for

remaining vigilant for calling us with

information and most importantly for

being our partners accorded any up Simon

thank you questions I can't answer that

we're with the the reason we're going to

an autopsy is to determine those kind of

details I'm confident that the the it is

them but there to identify them

officially and and caught you know to to

be sure we have to go to autopsy I don't

have an answer for that

it's a

very dense place it's a difficult place

to find anybody as I said earlier very

tough terrain lots of lots of land as

well it's it's a huge area that we're

looking at it's it's very hard to

pinpoint anything in such a dense

terrain yes it was woods are specialized

our CIP resources were in the area and

they were doing a foot search I'm afraid

I can't speak to that right now I'm

sorry I can't speak to that either well

I mean there's obviously a certain

amount of relief that we were able to

locate these people and and hopefully

bring some closure not only to the

victims of the homicides but to the

people of Gilliland Fox Lake Cree Nation

New York Landing Wilfred warlike nation

it's it's it's huge to be able to

hopefully give some people an

opportunity to exhale and to hopefully

eventually go back to normal and not

being afraid of who's out in the woods

anymore actually I don't have specific

numbers with me I can tell you we did

put a lot of resources up the first week

as you were all aware last week I made

an announcement that said we were

scaling down which we did but we did

leave as I had said at the time as well

some specialized resources in place to

follow up on anything we found and

that's exactly what we did I don't have

any confirmation anyway to substantiate

that at this point it was found in the

in the same general area I don't have

that information

it's very very dense brush is what I can

tell you very thick very difficult to

work your way through there's no trails

it's it's just very thick brush very

dense and it's a huge area we were

searching before we didn't have any

information to pinpoint us to a specific

search area where we could do a much

more detailed search the items we did

find on the shoreline gave us that

opportunity to pinpoint that search and

therefore do a much more detailed search

of the area I can't speak to that right

now I'm sorry

you'd have to talk to my colleagues in

British Columbia they're investigating

the homicides themselves I don't have

any information of those I'm afraid not

Raymond is silly tiny Lobos a trade

downs before a Rhema they pay to see

Travis trailer so he put the Tyvek

vehicle there shows come saw dogs at a

very modest sell the the Traverse I said

said party I really don't know we

haven't tabulated it I'll be honest with

you I don't have those numbers for you

at all it's it's a far more detailed

search but no we weren't you can't go

through the brush arm-in-arm it's way

too thick but we were able to to put

more people in that area and do a much

more detailed closer search pattern so

to speak looking for very specific items

and smaller it's a smaller grid for lack

of a better term again the homicide

investigation is ongoing from our

through our colleagues in British

Columbia will be liaison with them to

know when we can release what details we

can thank you very much
