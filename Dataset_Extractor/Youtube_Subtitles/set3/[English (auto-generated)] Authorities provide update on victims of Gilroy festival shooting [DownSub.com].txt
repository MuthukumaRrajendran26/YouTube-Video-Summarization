a good evening my name is bill Murphy

public information officer with the

garlic incident this is gonna be our

incident update for July 30th as in

previous updates the chief smithy from

Gilroy Police Department and deputy

Special Agent in Charge Craig fair from

the FBI we'll have some comments we'll

follow that with an opportunity for some

questions and again as we've provided

updates continuously we'll continue to

provide updates as new information

becomes available but bear in mind the

emergency phase of the incident has

passed and we're progressing through the

investigative phase of the incident so

we appreciate the patience with that

I'll turn it over to chief Smith for you

but I'll give you some additional stuff

as far as updates on our investigation

as of this afternoon the investigation

is obviously ongoing it's going to be

ongoing for quite a long time I thought

we are making some progress for instance

today this afternoon we started a

process to try to start getting vehicles

back to people who had their vehicles

within that crime scene area and so as

they clear certain areas to the park and

they make those vehicles available there

was a process where people were being

reunited with the vehicles by getting

escorted in so that's a that's a

positive for folks that have losses

I told you yesterday afternoon at the

press conference that you were executing

a search warrant on the suspects car

that we found parked just northeast of

the park that has been completed and I

know some of the reports included that

this gentleman had purchased the weapon

that was used in the shooting and he had

also purchased the shotgun so we knew

that he was associated with those two

weapons during the search warrant of the

car the shotgun that he had purchased

was located so we've now accounted for

both of the weapons that we knew being

purchased recently also I was asked a

question yesterday regarding a bag

ammunition or a bag in the creek and

yesterday we had a very large number of

people from if the Santa Clara County

search and rescue sheriff's deputies in

the FBI that did a sweep of the creek

very detail that sweeper the creek from

one end to the other as I can confirm

that they have they did locate a bag

that had additional ammunition in it I

in the area when they were doing that

sweep

I want to talk a little bit about

because we keep mentioning that we

believe there may be a second subject

involved so we weren't sure what level

that person person's involvement was we

have no indication that it was actually

a shooter but we had several people that

thought that he was with another person

I that investigation into that piece of

this has been a high priority for us

because we want to put the community in

people's minds at ease as to whether or

not there's actually another person out

there that they meet you'd be worried

about I our investigation is leading us

more and more to believe that there was

not a second person involved I don't

think I could say that with absolute

certainty at this point because we're

still following up leaves because people

who say I saw this or I saw that we want

to follow every single one of those

leads all the way through but we have

been able to track his movements around

town leading up to the incident

including multiple different stores and

locations that he visited prior to

engaging in this shooting incident and

in every single one of those cases we've

been able to retrieve video and he was

by himself he was not with anybody else

so that is sort of supporting the

thought now that he acted on his own but

again I don't want to dissuade any

witnesses or any people that saw things

or have any information from continuing

to come forward because we don't want to

rule that out as at least a possibility

until we've exhausted every single link

that is provided to us

I think that that's really all the

updates that I have for you I you know I

I would continue to ask for the

community's patience because this is a

long process I you know that crime scene

area is acres and acres and so I know

it's inconvenient for some folks I also

want to encourage witnesses to continue

to come forward to continue to visit the

website that is set up for downloading

photographs and video and any any

information that somebody has no matter

how irrelevant it may seem it could

potentially be very very important so we

want to continue to encourage people to

call in and I know there's more people

that I'm sure saw things that are

watching this please please continue to

do that

and that's that's what I have is your

update for this afternoon I I'm gonna

turn it over so we can get a little bit

more of an update as to personal effects

and the evidence collection process

going up out at the park

Thank You chief good afternoon my name

is Craig fair I'm the deputy special

agent charge of the FBI in San Francisco

we continue to provide assistance to the

Gilroy Police Department in the city of

Gilroy and the District Attorney's

Office here we continue to try to

understand who the shooter is

what motivated him and if he was aligned

with any particular ideology you hear me

talk about ideology that's important

because depending on how he might be

aligned or not aligned that has

different legal and investigative

implications and takes us down very fast

again depending on that ideology we're

still reviewing social media we are

doing forensic evaluation of digital

media we're continuing to conduct joint

interviews with the Gilroy Police

Department I want to talk a little bit

about evidence response and where we are

with that we have a fairly sizable

presence as of today working the crime

scene working in the hospitals working

at the coroner's office we have roughly

40 evidence response personnel

technicians working in the field doing

three-dimensional mapping of the crime

scene working with the victims in the

hospitals working with medical staff and

also working at the coroner's office the

crime scene itself I will tell you is

going to take anywhere from three to

five more days to process it's much more

vast than we thought every day we

proceed a little further and make more

progress realize it's going to take just

a little bit longer so I would ask

everyone to be very patient with that

it's very very important us that we work

as quickly as possible but at the same

time we have to be exceptionally

deliberate methodical be exceptionally

detail-oriented in the collection of

that evidence so that it could withstand

the scrutiny of for example the trial

later on effect if that need be

I want to talk a little bit about

personal affect this is very important

to us there's a lot of personal effects

on soon we want to get that back to the

public as soon as possible for us what

that is going to require is going

through in divining from the totality of

items out there what our personal

effects and what our evidence and as we

determine certain items to be personal

effects and have no evidentiary value

that value we will package that and we

will bring that to the Family Assistance

Center which is located at rucker

elementary school 325 santa clara avenue

and we expect that we will start doing

that commencing that tomorrow there will

be a public notice that is put out if

you go to the fbi.gov slash san

francisco website you will see a victim

assistance application so anyone who is

at the event believes they left personal

effects at the event can go to our

website and fill out a survey providing

their name other contact informations

and what they believe they left at the

event itself again as the chief

mentioned photos and videos that would

go to fbi.gov forward slash Gilroy

fbi.gov forward slash Gilbert that's all

I have for now thank you

right we'll open it up for a few

questions no I don't I don't have a lot

of specific details but he went shopping

at a number of storms in town I I could

not tell you what he was but I don't

have that little of detail what he was

first saying but you know most stores

now have video and so the investigators

have been able to retrace Neal back and

then going back from the time of the

incident and they have him in several of

our local stores

I don't know that I'm really prepared to

comment on that because I don't have

enough of the detail it certainly seems

to me that it was pre-planned but how

long how widespread and whether there

was any additional component of the plan

I just don't know at this point so what

about if you are undocumented and you

want to share photos or videos to the

law enforcement and you are you know

worried about your personal information

being shared later on or you know being

anonymous as far as immigration status

related to being a witness you know I

tried to work very hard in our community

to put our community of the ease about

that we don't ask somebody what their

immigration status is we're not really

concerned about that that's that's a

federal function in your Police

Department and we're investigating a

crime and I certainly would hope I think

if you were to talk to anybody in our

community here in Gilroy that we've

worked with that they could tell you

that we're good to work with and that

they should not be concerned about that

we have we had we've had a number of

submissions for the video and still I

have not seen them and I have not

received the analysis of those just yet

we have no reason to believe at this

point that he was targeting any

protected characteristics of already

class

well I think that that is gonna depend

on a number of things principally review

of digital media historically has been

very revealing in terms of somebody's

mindset ideological beliefs intentions

we've got to we've got to give it to the

computers the towers the thumb drives

the phone to get a holistic picture of

of him who he was in touch with what

sentiments and thoughts he shared with

others or he's catalog for his own

consumption the answer to that is it

depends right it depends on how quickly

we can get into the phone it also

depends on how the ease with which we

can enter into any of the other digital

media there is no early indication I I

can't comment on that because I don't

know the answer the presumption is yes I

initially know what you're asking but I

don't have an informative answer to that

I do believe that it was only that

initial three officers that engage the

suspect when this occurred

you know I placed them on administrative

leave I just did not want to put them in

a position of having to come back to

work and and deal with all this I you

know I think it's a very emotional thing

for them it's one thing to be involved

in the shooting but then they were also

in the middle of the carnage of the

people that were shot and then

immediately went into you know the

rendering aid mode and those two things

combined I think for anybody is a very

difficult thing to go through

yeah you know as far as the release of

video that's a new California state law

and we I had one Greek conversation

about that this morning I can I'm gonna

have to really look into how we're gonna

be able to meet that because the volume

I don't know what it is yet but I'm

assuming the volume of video is going to

be significant in the video that we

released previously to California Public

Records Act requests has required us to

go through and read a fun involved

parties out

I quite frankly for a department our

size I don't know how we're going to do

that yeah I have personally not seen any

of the video

I suspect that the video is going to

give us yeah I believe the three

officers that were involved with a fully

uniformed officers they were on one of

the what we call a rogue team whose

responsibility is to Rove a certain area

at the park to deal with any issues that

come up

[Music]

no I I think I think it was more of the

big box stores but I don't I don't have

a list I just heard that faith tracked

them so I don't I couldn't tell you what

stores but my impression was that it was

local big-box store

I'm sorry that they are all veteran

officers in the question as far as

releasing their name you know I probably

will do that I haven't decided when we

would do that I would really prefer to

look after the best interest of those

officers and get them the help that they

need and then make that decision

right I would expect that we will

release their news there is no

indication of that at this point in the

I mean obviously that's something that I

was concerned about that I thought about

at this point there's nothing in the

investigation that leads me to believe

that that's the case but yeah it's good

question thanks Josh

the tool originated just subsequent to

the Boston bombing because of the volume

of videos and stills that came in we're

talking hundreds of thousands so we

needed a tool process that information

that will go back to our FBI

headquarters where it will be co-located

it'll be analyzed by teams of analysts

and agents back at our headquarters to

try to pull together some of those a to

give us an accurate appraisal of what

might have happened the time flow the

people flow show how the shooter came in

and how

Sarat crowd and provide other other

records video documentation

I don't have that information so I have

not personally been out there so I'm

going based off of three things that I

get i but it sounds like the movement

would have involved his car was located

northeast of the festival grounds I mean

it sounds or it seems reasonable that

what he did was moved up through that

Creek which is pretty heavily wooded

there's also running water in it he made

it down to a fence line because the

entire festival grounds was fenced in

except for they he grassy points into

the festival and then some used some

tool I don't know what tool did cut a

hole in the fence and that's how he

gained access into the festival grounds

they're hearing yesterday

as far as well the search warrant on

Churchill I do not know I haven't gotten

the briefing of what they recovered from

there and it's a car the only thing that

I was concerned about was the shotgun

which is what they gave me and so I

don't know if there was anything else

relevant to for them that was taken out

of that either as far as the victims I I

don't have a current status was given a

status earlier and actually this morning

that several people have been released

some people were still in the hospital

and I I don't know the number but there

was someone that was still in very

serious condition maybe more than anyone

critical I don't know

I do not know that at this point let me

I want to close because I need to get

going but just for the press for all of

you I've gotten requests from probably

just about every news agency in the

country or can you do this can you do an

interview can you and and I want you all

to know that I'm not not not doing those

because I don't want to but as you can

imagine we have so many people and so

many things going on that I'm being

pulled in a lot of different directions

which is part of the reason why when you

ask me very detailed questions I'm not

at that level I don't have that level of

detail we're doing so many different

things I'm expecting over the next day

or two or three that my role for that

will start to decrease a little bit and

I'm hoping to be able to free up some

time and if I can free up some time I'm

going to try to start honoring some of

those requests so that we can do more

personalized interview with some of you

the shotgun was purchased also in Nevada

and as far as the ideology and the

accounts I'm not prepared to do that

because that's one source of information

but we have so many different sources of

information and they don't all align

you know I I really don't know I have

heard that as a rumor I I can't confirm

that yet she doesn't be delete this I'm

sorry you need to leave I do not

hi my understanding is that two of the

victims Oh the suspects okay

I'm sorry yes he was he was killed at

the scene he was not transported so as

the chief said and I mentioned at the

beginning our our goal is to get you

information as quick as we can possibly

get it to you and that's the next best

conference with that said it is

scheduled for Thursday at the same time

at 4:00 p.m. same location if anything

occurs between now and the Thursday

press conference we will be sure to get

that information out and we'll continue

to have the media line available to you

thank you all for coming

you
