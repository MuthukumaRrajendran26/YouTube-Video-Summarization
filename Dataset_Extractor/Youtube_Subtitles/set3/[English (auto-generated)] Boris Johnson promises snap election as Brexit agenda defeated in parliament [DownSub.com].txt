order would the eyes to the right

328 the nose to the left 301

[Applause]

not a good start Ingres order the eyes

to the right

328 the nose to the left 301 so the eyes

of it the eyes have a unlock to speak

[Applause]

about the consequences of this vote

tonight it means that Parliament is on

the brink of wrecking any deal that we

might be able to sway

[Applause]

and control of the negotiations to the

EU and that would be more differ more

delay and more confusion you themselves

would be able to decide how long to keep

this country in the EU and since I

refuse to go along with that plan we are

going to have to make a choice Mr

Speaker I don't want an election the

public wants an election but if the

housemates for this bill tomorrow the

public will have to choose who goes to

Brussels on October the 17th to sort

this out and take this country forward

everybody knows that if the right

honourable gentleman is the Prime

Minister he will go to Brussels and beg

for an extension

rustles the bonds and we will have years

more arguments over brexit and by

contrast mrs. big everyone knows that if

this government is in charge and we go

right go to Brussels I will go for a

deal and I believe I will get a deal

[Applause]

don't leave anyway on October the 31st

the people of this country will have to

choose Mr Speaker the leader of the

opposition has been begging for an

election for two years he had crowds of

supporters outside calling for attention

I don't want an election but if MPs vote

tomorrow to stop negotiations and to

compel another pointless delay to brexit

potentially for years and that would be

the only way to resolve this and I can

confirm that we are tonight tabling

a motion under the fixed term Parliament

[Applause]

technically mr. speaker on a point of

order I welcome tonight's vote we live

in a parliamentary democracy we do not

have a presidency but a prime minister

Prime Minister's govern with the consent

of the House of Commons representing the

people in whom the sovereignty rests

there is no consent there is no consent

in this house to leave the European

Union without a deal there is no

majority for no deal in the country

as I've said before if the Prime

Minister has the confidence in his

brexit policy when he has won he can put

forward he should put it before the

people in a public vote

[Applause]

he wants the table emotion for a general

election fine get the bill through

[Applause]

in order to take no deal off the table

[Applause]
