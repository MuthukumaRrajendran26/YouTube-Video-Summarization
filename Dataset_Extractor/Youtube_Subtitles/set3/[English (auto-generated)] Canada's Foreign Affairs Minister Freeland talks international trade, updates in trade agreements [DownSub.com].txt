Moreno I am president of generis Canada

today we are very pleased to host the

Honorable Christopher Island Minister of

Foreign Affairs and today I would like

to recognize the strong support that we

have received from the capella

government many and in particular for

Minister Freeland has been a strong

advocate of manufacturing and

particularly of the sheet industry over

the last couple of years in terms of

Trade and support election industry I

would like to highlight of course a new

nasca lifting the steel tariffs of that

were imposed through the 232 and also

the improvements in the trail remedy

system so Thank You Minister for that

this has been very very very important

for us also two weeks ago we announced

in summary that to analysis is making an

investment of 36 million dollars in our

facilities in summary and actually in

Calgary and the federal government has

provided an important support of 16

million dollars for investment that will

help us to create new jobs so 90 new

jobs will be created because of this

investment but also the internal are

going to help us produce new products

that are needed but by our oil and gas

industry and also will help us to

improve our productivity and efficiency

in all our needs

also I would like to recognize and thank

for the approval of trance mountain and

LNG Canada is a very important project

for awesome for our ending Calgary we

all know and understand importance of

the development of the resources but

those resources are also a strong engine

for the economy in Canada a new job that

are created all around the country

Daenerys is one of the better examples

with our facilities in Ontario and in

Alberta so respect that more of these

projects are approved but also become in

place and our Commission's because there

is no other industry like

oil and gas industry that is as

competitive but also follows the highest

standards in terms of quality health

safety and environment

conversation today

learned a lot and let me start by

acknowledging we are on the traditional

territories of treaty seven people of

southern Alberta some of the in

playground places that we see laughs

important for you Canada a pour moi

Texan Elmo Arcos do not travel Elena a

concern or later Heath serve less sexy

on does not consume on a pave beaucoup

of Atlanta streets it is really a huge

pleasure for me to be here today

Alberta is my home province and the

energy sector here is really really

important to me and the steel and

aluminum sector across Canada is really

important to me as Guillermo said we

have had cause to work very closely

together both with companies and with

labour and I do want to recognize and

thank the union representatives who were

here today the steel workers who are

here we're a very important part of our

effort as well we worked closely with

this industry with Canadian the Canadian

steel sector as Guglielmo said also with

the energy sector on NAFTA and during

our NAFTA negotiations and we work

closely together in our fight to get the

two three two tariffs on Canadian steel

and aluminum lifted

I'm so delighted that we succeeded

thanks to our United and collective

effort in getting those tariffs lifted

and it was just really a great moment

for me to be here today

meet some of the people doing those jobs

that getting those tariffs lifted were

so personally important for and that the

negotiation is personally important for

and also to see the fantastic work

people do here every day extremely

competitive extremely productive and

learning about some of the investments

that are going to make this operation

even more productive and competitive in

the world now Steve oh cool I'm ready to

answer your questions

so we give a lot of careful thought to

all of our travel advisories everywhere

in the world I would strongly encourage

all Canadians before you travel anywhere

to take a look at our travel advisories

they are they are put together with a

great degree of care and attention when

it comes to Hong Kong I want to cite

precisely what we have said we have said

now when it comes to Hong Kong we

encourage people to exercise a high

degree of caution the travel advisory

spells out why that high degree of

caution is appropriate as people know

there are protests happening in Hong

Kong and there is some violence around

those protests and so I think it is

common sense for Canadians to take great

care I do also want to say that there

are 300,000 Canadians who live in Hong

Kong and I want to assure them and their

families that we are very focused on

them and on their welfare

to talk about what the Canadian

government did in the Christian Baxter

case to help secure his

I can't comment on that

apart from saying three things first of

all you know this case has had a happy

outcome and I am delighted and frankly

relieved and I wish the best to him and

to his family and loved ones who I'm

sure are going to have a great weekend

but I would I think this is also a case

that should remind us all to exercise a

high degree of caution when traveling to

dangerous parts of the world there's

been a happy outcome here let's not

allow this to cause us not to be careful

I'll or you see play quantum chemistry

of Baxter to hood of neo neo Canada a

certain to Stephanie's

OC prep play contant

Boothbay OC himepcy a truly diplomatic

an idea

kyon fait du travail a Schaffner usual

see if I nail sail you grew up in the

moon do Lebanon so let me just add that

I also would like to thank the Canadian

diplomats who have worked quietly and

hard on this case as they do on all

consular cases and I would also like to

thank the government of Lebanon this is

a good outcome and I'm really

believed

well my shoe back sweetie Abdul Gani

yesterday's Ballack and I think again

you can control on the shown beside

their house so was what was mr. Baxter

in concealment

too late I said to NASA Prive Papa Don

le c'mon tell me

you rude ass you ever awaken idea to set

in bomb casita acre Lou Canada 8 a

community say on that forw

take effect don't touch conifer don't

set affair so this is a consular case

it's a private matter and it's not

appropriate to offer details but let me

say that I can assure Canadians

that the Government of Canada behaved

absolutely correctly in this case as we

do in all consular matters and I just

want to reiterate that I am personally

relieved by this outcome and I am sure

mr. factors Baxter's family and loved

ones are as well

gross it's been a year since the

problems with Saudi Arabia happened what

progress has been made in repairing of

the damage

also do you have a date for women okay a

lot of questions there let me start by

commenting on arms exports to Saudi

Arabia following the really horrific

murder of Jamal khashoggi in a consulate

in a NATO ally of Canada's Canada has

decided to review all of our arms export

permits to Saudi Arabia during the

period of this review we are not

authorizing we are not signing new

permits it's a complicated situation and

work is ongoing and I do want to

reiterate for Canadians that during this

period of review were not signing new

permits I did have a chance to meet with

onions calomel the UN Special Rapporteur

working on this case last month when I

was in London in terms of the

relationship with Saudi Arabia the

comments that Canada made supporting

human rights are and and the rights of

human rights activists very much

including women and feminist activists

these are comments this is an approach

Canada takes around the world Canada is

a country that is proud to speak up for

human rights and we're proud to support

human rights activists very much

including women's rights activists

feminists around the world even while

acknowledging of course that Canada is

not perfect and we have a lot of work to

do at home this is a time in the world

when human rights including media

freedom are under a lot of pressure

and I really believe that it behooves

Canada as a country that values human

rights so much it does behoove us to

speak out for people who do not enjoy

all the liberties that we do that is

something that Canada will continue to

do around the world even as we

appreciate that sometimes it comes with

a price I believe the price for not

speaking out is even higher because when

we don't speak out what we see is

abusers of human rights are emboldened

and the abuse becomes greater and if you

look back in history I think the moments

when countries have not spoken out our

moments that subsequent generations have

looked back on with regret having said

all of that Saudi Arabia is an important

partner for Canada and we continue to

work with Saudi Arabia on a number of

different issues at a number of

different levels we continue to have

contacts with the government of Saudi

Arabia I spoke with my counterpart in

Osaka at the g20 meetings my cabinet

colleagues have contact with their

counterparts and that's of course also

entirely appropriate

mr. there's a great deal of concern with

that in Alberta

regarding China where are we in terms of

China's continued I am very aware of

that concern as a person who has herself

swathed quite a few acres of canola and

I spend a lot of time talking with

Canadian farmers across the country

including farmers in the prairies

including farmers who are who seeds and

harvest a lot of canola one of the

things I'm going to be doing here in

Alberta is spending some time talking to

farmers and I also stay in close touch

with the Canadian commodities firms in

the international commodities firms that

work in Canada so I am very aware of the

issue it was an issue it is an issue

which we are raising consistently with

our Chinese counterparts I'd like to

also really thank and congratulate my

colleague Jim Carr the minister of

international trade who has been working

hard at seeking additional markets for

Canadian canola that's an important

effort as well I think one of the things

we learned in the NAFTA negotiations

with the United States is no matter how

close a friend or a partner we have it's

never good for any country or any

industry to depend on a single client

I think Ghoulie Adamo here on behalf of

tenaris would say to us he likes to have

a number of clients and I think our

country needs to have diversified

trading partners so that's something

we're working on - as for Canadian

canola it let me also just say Canadian

canola is fantastic it is healthy I cook

with canola oil for my family every day

that I'm home

and while it is important of course to

go through all the scientific and

technical processes I'd like to assure

everyone around the world who buys

Canadian canola that it is a great and

healthy product and I do want to assure

Canadian farmers that we are working

hard to open up new markets for Canadian

canola hand-in-hand with the industry

and that we are also continuing to work

with China on this issue it is of course

of mutual benefit for both China and

Canada for Canadian canola both or the

seeds the meal the oil for all of that

to be sold to China China does have a

need for oil seeds so it's an issue of

which we're going to keep working on I

was exactly a week ago able to meet with

Minister Wang Yi my Chinese counterpart

in Bangkok on the margins of the ASEAN

meeting and it was a positive step that

we were able to meet and we will we we

agreed that we would continue talking

thank you

before you ask your question can I just

coughed so that I don't interrupt we are

doing a lot and in that meeting with

Minister Wang Yi while of course it was

a meeting that addressed a broad range

of issues as is appropriate given the

relationship between China and Canada

which covers a broad range of issues of

course my priority was and is the

detentions of Michael clover again

Michaels favor

Canada continues to be very concerned

about this it's a positive step that I

was able to express Canada's concerns

directly to Minister Wang Zi we are also

continuing to work with our allies

around the world these detentions are

not purely of concern to Canada they are

of concern to many countries most

recently on Tuesday in Toronto I met

foreign secretary Dominic Rob the newly

appointed British Foreign Secretary

Canada was the first country he traveled

to for a bilateral visit and in our

meeting as Secretary Rob and I said

afterwards we did discuss this issue and

I took the opportunity to thank

secretary robb and the United Kingdom

for the strong and public supports they

have given us in advocating for Michael

over again Michaels favor and I do just

want to say on a personal note

at the beginning of this conversation we

spoke about consular chases I think

consular cases are painful for all

Canadians they're certainly very

personal for me

these two detentions are very particular

because of the arbitrary nature of those

detentions and I do want to say how much

respect and admiration I have for

Michaels favor and for Michael Cove rig

they are two brave Canadians who are

facing a difficult situation through no

fault of their own and they are behaving

with they're conducting themselves with

incredible grace and tenacity they're

showing real Canadian grit as are their

families for whom this is also an ordeal

and I would just like to say how much I

admire them and I think that that is the

feeling that the overwhelming majority

of Canadians share
