so somebody excuse me somebody had to do

it I am the chosen one

somebody had to do it so I'm taking on

China I'm taking on China on trade and

you know what we're winning because

we're the piggy bank we're the one that

all these countries including the

European Union wants to rob and takes

advantage of European Union 200 billion

dollars China more than 500 billion

dollars sorry I was put here I was put

here by people I was put here by people

to do a great job and that's what I'm

doing and nobody's done a job like I've

done now with China rather wait for a

little more than a year and try and get

sleepy Joe Biden to negotiate with

instead of President Trump

maybe but I don't think so you know why

they're losing too many jobs too fast

they had the worst year in 27 years but

I think it was actually 52 or 54 years

that the worst year they've had in a

half a century and that's because of me

and I'm not proud of that but you know

what they want to negotiate and sleepy

Joe doesn't have a clue sleepy Joe said

Oh China is wonderful well China is

wonderful for China but I'm wonderful

for the USA

they want to make a deal it's got to be

a deal that's good for the United States

where they want to make a deal probably

we will make a deal but if I didn't do

that and I'm not doing that somebody

said it's Trump's trade WA this is in my

trade war this is a trade war that

should have taken place a long time ago

by a lot of other presidents
