I think before accusing protesters for

anything try to look at the real problem

and how the government turning how they

turn my nine students and to our demons

this is a real problem the source of the

problem we are trying to solve the

problem that they are trying to solve

they're trying to attack us or trying to

just turn a blind eye to us and it

doesn't help we are just trying to fight

for what we already have

what hong kong is we just want someone

to stay Hong Kong we are not demanding

for something else or something extra

yeah that's it if all our ways always

put our peaceful way it's not answer

that by the doctor man I've been there

most of our fourth also a Podesta may go

of more foreign voices

of all the ways to to let the first

government to answer our first our

request
