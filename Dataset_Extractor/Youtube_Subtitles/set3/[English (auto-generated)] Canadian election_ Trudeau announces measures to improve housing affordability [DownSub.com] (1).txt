Herbert Nikki McDonald Ryan Windsor

Jonah Gowans Peter Schwartz off and

Michelle Kaur field my friends in every

election we get to make an important

choice about the future of our country

we get to decide what kind of future we

want to build together in 2015 after a

decade of failed conservative policy

Canada's economy was flat economic

growth job creation wage growth all were

stalled thanks to a Conservative

government that believed cuts and

austerity were the answers to everything

Canadians chosen new team that was

willing to invest in people and in their

communities we know that even though we

live in the best country in the world

better is always possible and while

there's more work ahead of us than

behind us we spent the last four years

moving forward and we've got the record

to show for it

poverty is weighed

unemployment is at historic lows and job

creation is way up and it's because our

team rejected conservative cuts and

austerity and chose instead to invest in

the middle class and people working hard

Randy Ranma he knew the devil so - and

are making a real difference in people's

lives and this fall Canadians once again

get to vote for the kind of Canada they

want to live in

we've all got a choice to make keep

moving forward and build on the progress

we've made or go back to the politics of

the hardware years the Conservatives

like to say they're for the people but

then they cut taxes for the wealthy and

cut services for everybody else but as

Canadians well no that's the wrong

approach because you can't cut your way

to prosperity that's why we chose to

move Canada forward by investing in

families workers and communities by

having faith in Canadians in four short

years Canadians have created over a

million jobs we negotiated new health

accords with the provinces and

territories the new Canada Child Benefit

is helping parents with hundreds of

dollars tax-free

every month and we've lifted 900,000

Canadians out of poverty including

300,000 kids we know there's still lots

more work to do

one thing I hear a lot from young people

here in Victoria is that they can't even

imagine buying a home right now owning a

house should be a realistic life goal

it's where you set down roots where you

raise a family where you grow old but

young people hoping to buy their first

home just like their parents did a

generation ago are facing a tough

housing market that's why earlier this

year we launched the first new

first-time homebuyers incentive which

provides Canadians with up to 10% off

the purchase price of their first home

we took a big step in the right

direction but we know a lot of people

are still struggling especially in

places like Victoria or Vancouver where

the cost of housing has skyrocketed due

in part to housing speculation by

foreign owners so today we're announcing

that a new Liberal government will

expand the incentive to give even more

help to people living in Victoria the

Greater Vancouver area and the Greater

Toronto Area in those markets we will

increase the value of a qualifying home

from approximately $500,000 to nearly

$800,000 and we're also sending a

message that Canada is not a place for

those who wish to speculate in the

housing market to tackle the effects

port foreign speculators are having on

the affordability of homes in our

biggest cities we will also introduce a

modest 1% annual tax on residential

properties owned by people who are not

Canadian and do not live in Canada and

that's on top of local taxes already in

place I want to make it clear though

that Canadians living abroad or

permanent residents in Canada will not

be affected in any way

we're doing this because we want our

markets to stay stable and affordable

now conservatives talk a big game about

making life more affordable for

Canadians these days but let's not

forget that they voted again

the first time homebuyer incentive when

they had the chance under a Liberal

government we will continue to invest in

families while finding new innovative

solutions to the challenges facing

Canadians because at the day at the end

of the day politics is about people it's

about you maybe you're a recent grad or

a new Canadian or maybe you're raising

your kids or living your golden years

out in retirement whoever you are

you deserve a real plan for the future

we've done a lot these past four years

but the truth is we're just getting

started

Canadians have an important choice to

make will we go back to the failed

policies of the past or will we continue

to move forward

that's the choice it's that clear and

it's that important

I'm from moving forward for everyone

particularly then Nestle to the moon

just your CPV your opponents are all in

Toronto preparing for a debate tonight

this at the beginning of this campaign

did you not think it was worthwhile are

worth your time to be there to debate

them just because the campaign is

starting I know that you're gonna be at

a debate on the 7th but that's three

weeks from now

did you think that it was wise to wait

three weeks before you debate your

opponents I am very much looking forward

to the three opportunities we'll have

during this campaign to debate with the

other leaders I think there are really

important choices for Canadians to make

really important conversations to have

but I'm also really really happy to be

here on Vancouver Island this morning to

meet with families like Lisa and gray

and others and talk about what we're

doing to make life more affordable for

Canadians later today I'll be in

Kamloops and after that in Edmonton

tonight and the opportunity to get out

across this country speak with Canadians

and listen to them and talk about how

we're going to build a better future for

everyone and how we're going to choose a

better future for everyone is that the

core of what this election is all about

for me and I'm going to keep doing that

this is about today's debate

and you're not there I am very much

looking forward to being in Edmonton

tonight I'm very happy to be here in

Victoria today very happy to be

continuing to talk with Canadians and of

course I look forward to the opportunity

to debate against my fellow leaders in

the three occasions that we'll be we'll

be doing in this campaign morning Teresa

Wright Canadian Press you said in the

past that as a practicing Catholic that

you are personally opposed to abortion

do you still hold that view my view and

they've been very very clear about it is

that every woman in Canada gets to

choose what she does with her own body

with her own reproductive rights

no one can force a woman to choose when

or with whom to start a family it is her

choice that is my core conviction and

that is how I have actually led

government over the past four years and

ensured that every single candidate

running for the Liberal Party agrees

that defending women's rights and

women's right to choose is unequivocal

for the Liberal Party we proclaim a

politicians are on abortion when they

have committed not to reopen the debate

as both you and Andrew Shearer have done

in English and in French please I think

I've been extremely clear that my

position is that every single candidate

for the Liberal Party of Canada will

always as MPs or ministers or whatever

defend the women's rights unequivocally

that is a choice I made and it's a

choice that is extremely important not

in the abstract but in the concrete to

millions of women across this country

they need to know the

their leaders will be there to defend

their rights that is something that I've

made clear on and I think is up to

Canadians to determine whether or not

other leaders have been equally clear

comes to medical assistance in dying we

recognize that this is a deeply personal

extremely important choice the Canadian

families often need to go through that

is why I feel that the government's

responsibility is to establish the

balance in the right way between two

very important competing

responsibilities that of protecting our

most vulnerable and at the same time

respecting people's rights and choices

getting that balance right was very much

what we worked on over the past 4 years

with our bill on medical estar law on

medical assistance in dying we always

knew however that there would be a

continued evolution and reflection in

the courts and in society about the next

steps to take and we welcome the fact

that the court has

pronounced itself on this we look

forward to reading very carefully the

court judgment to decide what our next

steps will be but we will always look to

strive that right balance between

respecting people's rights and

protecting our most vulnerable oconee

confidence so they can speak to the RCMP

about potential obstruction of justice

shouldn't these two former senior

be able to give evidence to the police

without being muzzled by cabinet

confidence we actually took an

unprecedented step in giving out a

waiver that allows for all matters all

issues relating to this matter to be

discussed at committee to be

investigated to be followed up on this

was something that we did that is

unprecedented because we know that it

was important for people to be able to

examine what happened in this matter and

that's why we took that step and

yesterday you said you respect decisions

made by professional public servants

namely the decision of the clerk to deny

RCMP access to witnesses and cabinet

professional decision of the Director of

stand up for the public interest to

stand up for people's jobs that's what I

did that's what I will always do

Canadians know that I will be there to

defend their jobs every step of the way

Mercedes Stevenson Global News president

Trump is making an announcement on

flavored vaping products today possibly

banning them it's something that

Canadian pediatricians have called for

as well are you looking at a potential

ban on flavored vaping products in

Canada I can tell you that Health Canada

has been engaged with this issue over

many months in consultations working

with experts and researchers to

determine the right path forward we've

already taken a number of steps on

vaping and harmful tobacco use and we're

always looking to do more to keep

Canadians safe but our decisions will be

made based on evidence based on data and

we will have more to say as Health

Canada continues to do its work of

keeping Canadians safe including from

the dangers of vaping with CBC News high

prices high housing prices in Vancouver

and Victoria and the GTA have been a

problem for a long time so why didn't

you tackle this in your budget why are

you waiting until now during an election

campaign actually we tackled this in a

number of ways from the very beginning

of our mandate one of my first round

tables in in Vancouver was around the

high costs of of housing and the

measures that a federal government can

do to make sure that housing is more

affordable the first one of those

obviously is a national housing strategy

that puts forward forty billion dollars

of the federal government re-engaging in

housing to ensure that rentals that new

homes are more affordable for people

right across the country but we

recognize there is more to do and that's

why in our budget in 2019 we put forward

the national first-time homebuyers

incentive which actually gives

10% off up to 10% off the price of a

home for a first-time homebuyer that's a

program that applies right across the

country what we recognize and what we're

announcing today is that there are areas

in this country as you named Viktoria

Greater Vancouver Greater Toronto where

the housing prices are so significantly

higher than the national average that

there needs to be extra help through

that at the first-time homebuyers

incentive that's why we're moving

forward on creating an extra incentive

in those areas for higher housing values

and how are higher higher income levels

so that more people can afford their

first homes there is a real challenge

across this country people being able to

afford their first homes and that's why

this government has done things

concretely in budget 2019 and continues

to announce that we will move forward

even further to help Canadians afford

their homes you're calling it modest if

it's modest what goods are going to do

we have seen from British Columbia's

example that even a modest tax can have

a significant impact on speculation

foreign speculation in housing markets

one of the knock-on effects though of

the BC initiative is that the that has

pushed capital to other parts of the

country where there isn't that that

modest speculation tax that is why we

feel it is important to create a

national measure right across the

country based on BC's success with it to

ensure that foreign speculation doesn't

make housing less affordable for

Canadians who as we know are looking for

places to live West Shore voice news the

NDP have a strong hold on the island and

the Greens think they have some room to

grow what does the voter on Vancouver

Island look to in the Liberals where do

you think your chances are we continue

to put forward a strong plan to move

forward on housing affordability as we

have today on growing the economy in a

way that both creates jobs as we have

seen Canadians create a million jobs

across the country over the past

for years at the same time as we've

lifted 300,000 kids out of poverty

900,000 canadians total we know that to

move forward in both protecting the

environment and growing the economy goes

together we've been a government that

has has done more for protecting the

environment which is something that

matters deeply to Vancouver Islanders as

well as people right across the country

than any other government so I'm very

pleased to be able to put forward an

incredibly strong team of seven great

candidates on Vancouver Island to give

people on Vancouver Island the

opportunity and the choice to be part of

a government that's going to continue to

move forward for all Canadians Prime

Minister Mary Griffin with cheque news

you're starting the first full day here

on Vancouver Island in this writing just

two things climate change is at the

forefront of many people's concerns your

government has bought a pipeline how do

you lay the concerns of people who have

real anxiety and concerns about climate

change which is a major issue on this

island and how would you expect to punch

through this election

knowing that climate change is at the

top of mine for so many here on

Vancouver Island I think Canadians

understand that we need to both grow the

economy and protect the environment at

the same time and indeed you cannot grow

the economy unless you are protecting

the environment we have to move our

economy towards greener towards cleaner

and that means using all our resources

to invest and to pay in that transition

it doesn't serve anyone to leave tens of

millions of dollars on the table because

we can't get our resources to markets

other than the United States right now

it doesn't serve anyone to be putting

more oil by rail to more oil by tanker

truck when we know that pipelines too

well secured marine area well service

marine areas are the safest way to

transport and to export our natural

resources we know that investing all the

profits from the trans mount and

pipeline expansion into the clean or

energy transition is something that all

Canadians understand and here on

Vancouver Island you have demonstrated

both an understanding of how important

it

to protect our environment while

developing our natural resources

responsibly and that is something we

were going to continue to do as a

government Yesi thermode he say hi my

name is Greg knows this it'sit's it's

tougher than it looks
