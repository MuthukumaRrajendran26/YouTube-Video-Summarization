Thank You Carol

Thank You Charles thank you very much

Brandon for a fantastic fantastic well

organized campaign I think it did a lot

of credit as as Brandon has just said to

our party to our values and to I our

ideals but I want to begin by thanking

my opponent Jeremy

by common consent an absolutely

formidable campaigner and a great leader

and a great politician Jeremy in the

course of twenty hussies in what I mean

20 hustings or hustings style events it

was more than 3000 miles by there's

about 7,000 miles that we did criss

crossing the country you've been

friendly

you've been good-natured you've been a

font of excellent ideas all of which I

propose to steal and above all I want to

thank our outgoing leader Theresa May

for her extraordinary service to this

party and to this country it was a

privilege

it was a privilege to serve in her

cabinet and to see the passion and

determination that she brought to the

many causes that are her legacy from

equal pay for men and women to tackling

the problems of mental health and racial

discrimination in the criminal justice

system Thank You Teresa

thank you and I want to thank all of you

all of you here today and obviously on

everybody in the Conservative Party for

your hard work for your campaigning for

your public spirit and obviously for the

extraordinary honor and privilege that

you've just conferred on me and I know

that there will be people around the

place who will question the wisdom of

your decision and there may even be some

people here who still wonder what quite

what they have done and I would just

point at you that and of course nobody

no one party no one person has a

monopoly of wisdom but if you look at

the history of the last 200 years of

this party's existence you will see that

it is we conservatives who have had the

best insights I think into human nature

and in the best in service in sense into

how to manage the jostling sets of

instincts in the human heart and time

and again it is to us that the people of

this country have turned to get that

balance right between the instincts to

own your own house your own home to earn

and spend your own money to look after

your own family good instincts proper

instincts noble instincts and the

equally noble instinct to share and to

give everyone a fair chance in life and

to look after the poorest and the

neediest and to build a Great Society

and on the whole in the last 200 years

it is we conservatives who have

understood best how to encourage those

instincts to work together in harmony to

promote the good of the whole country

and today at this pivotal moment in our

history we again have to reconcile two

sets

two noble sets of instincts between the

deep desire of friendship and free trade

and mutual support in security and

defence between Britain and our European

partners and the simultaneous desire

equally deep and heartfelt for

democratic self-government in this

country and of course there's something

received that they're in irreconcilable

and it just can't be done and indeed I

read in my Financial Times this morning

devoted reader than I am seriously it's

a great great great great British great

British brand I read in my financial

times this morning that there are no

incoming leader no incoming leader has

ever faced such a daunting set of

circumstances it said well I look at you

this morning and I ask myself do you

look daunted do you feel daunted I don't

think we I don't think you'd have

remotely daunting to me and I think that

we know that we can do it and that the

people of this country are trusting in

us to do it and we know that we will do

it and we know the mantra of the

campaign that has just gone by in case

you've forgotten it you probably have it

is deliver brexit unite the country and

defeat Jeremy Corbyn and that is what

we're going to do

[Applause]

I know I know some wagon was already

pointed out that deliver your knight and

defeat was not the perfect acronym for

an election campaign since unfortunately

it spells dud

but they forgot the final E my friends

IVA energize and I say I say to all the

doubters dude we are going to energize

the country we're going to get bricks it

done on october 30 was going to take

advantage of all the opportunities that

it will bring in a new spirit of can-do

and we are once again going to believe

in ourselves and what we can achieve

like some slumbering giant we are going

to rise and ping off the guy ropes of

self-doubt and negativity with better

education better infrastructure more

police fantastic full fibre broadband

sprouting in every household we are

going to unite this amazing country and

we are going to take it forward I thank

you all very much for the incredible

honor that you have just done me I will

work flat out from now on with my team

that I will build I hope in the next few

days to repay your confidence but in the

meantime the campaign is over and the

work begins thank you all very much

[Applause]
