and then released we want to commend our

hospital staff all the way from our er

physicians and nurses and technicians to

we called the code yellow alerting

people that that we needed backup we

want just want to commend them for the

for the great job they did also

commending city of Dayton police and

first responders so we know they're on

line of treatment for people coming in

so we just wanted it to come them for a

job well done

we have an organization that we work

really acknowledge the police department

dayton police department their quick

response we were very thankful for that

and first responders on behalf of pack

we just want to let the community know

that we've been here from the start

we've been counseling family members we

have a variety of resources we are here

and we will remain here so we just want

to let you know that this is a community

effort and we're doing everything we can

to help out in a situation like this

okay guys questions yes well certainly

it's a Sunday so some of the businesses

were are you know are typically some of

them are take Sunday and Monday off

because it's mostly local but it's up to

each business if they want to open the

street will be open this afternoon the

organ district is one of the safest

places in the whole region

you know these senseless acts of

violence that occur have been happening

any place and I don't mean to scare

people but frankly I mean we're at a

situation now in our country that you're

really you know these are so random

there's no place that you know what you

could say oh I just don't ever go

anywhere so as far as the safety of the

district it's one of the safest places

in the whole region I don't think we

have that information yet you know as we

get more updates we'll continue to

continue to update you there some

security members businesses

in the Oregon district who actually

either recognize the shooter or to

notice something out of place and went

out and confronted the shooter before

you can get in those businesses we don't

have any of that information to report

on yet at this time as we continue to

get information about the the shooting

we will certainly tell you but we don't

have any of that information yet I have

not we've had folks that have been

reaching out to victims as they've come

in and I plan on meeting with those that

are able I mean they're going through a

very difficult time in the coming hours

do we know that we don't know that for

certain we're in the process of that

look I mean Dayton has gone through a

really tough year three months ago early

in the morning the day after Memorial

Day I think we had not quite this many

cameras but a discussion about 14

tornadoes that ravaged ravaged our city

and now to you know be awakened in the

mo of night to a mass shooting and the

250th shooting in our country this year

happening Dayton what really goes

through my mind is one seems completely

preventable and you know I just want I

just question when is enough enough and

so you know as we're continuing to do

everything we can for the victims for

community for families you know that's

where our focus is and it will continue

to be there and I continue to be amazed

about the grit and resiliency of this

community the challenge that it has

taken on on just in the past few months

and the love and support that comes from

people is something that keeps me going

as mayor and makes me so proud to do

this work

just and next night I can at some point

will be able to tell you exactly how

many shots were fired by officers and

exactly how many shots were fired by the

suspect but but I can't give you that

information just yet there were multiple

rounds about the direction yeah we'll

get to two more details in a later

conference but but for this conference I

can't release that we have identified

the suspect and we will get that

information to you soon we are in our

investigative process and that takes

precedence we understand that the public

wants to know who this person is and

that will be released and obviously

we're working very hard to give the

public an answer as to what the

motivation might have been for this

we're investigating all all information

all leads and and we'll go where the

where the evidence takes us at this

point we're aware of of one shooter

what we'll get more of that information

to you I can tell you like the mayor

said earlier this is a this was a 223

rifle with with a high-capacity magazine

and extra magazines yes of course you

know we have just just like we have

police support quickly in the district

we'll continue to have folks around and

look you know we're what please we know

the community wants to come together so

for this 8:00 p.m. but vigil we know

we'll have that sight coming what were

you doing there officers how many

officers were were there the same amount

of officers last night as there was

Friday

you should just say there were there

were several officers who were working

in the Oregon district in the immediate

vicinity which is you know we're all

very fortunate that they were there and

they were able to shorten this timeline

of violence to less than a minute and we

we regularly have officers specifically

assigned to to the Oregon district it's

a high concentration of people and we

want to make sure that everybody stays

safe so that's our goal so that's why we

we we typically have officers patrolling

there especially around times we'll get

more information to you

yeah yeah I can tell you're the the

investigation you know right now takes

takes precedence over over people

knowing I you know knowing immediately

the public will be will be told who this

person is and it's it's important for us

to try to establish to try to identify

all the evidence and impossible

motivation in this in this crime because

I think the the victims the families of

the victims need to know that so that's

the priority

I have no information on that his family

been notified I can't tell you that the

the coroner's office provides a

notification to Mexican there there's

always security in the or conditioner

I'm sorry I don't have a count on the

number of people that have come we've

had a pretty steady group you know folks

coming in and out and you know of course

as as families are notified

we immediately make sure that they have

the support that we can offer with

coping and other issues but also have to

have a victim advocate for each each

family is and is put in place as well oh

yes I'm sorry and thank you and uh

police encourage you to gather impact

have been every single one of these as

well

well I think the most important thing

for people to know is what a resilient

and gritty city we are and I use those

terms affectionately we have seen a lot

of issues in our community and what

amazes me about this city and this is

this you know this tragic incident is no

different is how quickly our community

that comes together how our community is

so connected and how just the number of

people want to do something and you know

we saw this in May after the tornadoes

we see this again today and then I think

the other thing for you know I think I

met like you know over 50 mayors across

the country who have reached out because

sadly this isn't something that only the

city of Dayton has experienced and

what's what's really shocking to me is

just the number of people that have

personal experience of this going and on

in their communities and it's it's sad

to me that now Dayton is one of those

communities as well I did see the tweet

and the press the I think the White

House office has called us I have

correct yes the White House Office is

called my cell phone I was on another

call at the time but we have talked to

the White House and but not not the

president specifically I've talked to

senator Brown and governor DeWine as

well oh I'm sorry and I'm sorry thank

you thank you and representative Turner

has called me as well I can't speculate

on that frankly we'll have more

information in the coming hours and well

you know I don't want to speculate on it

I can't I can't really communicate on

that until we have a name for you guys

yes you're like becoming a regular

reporter for a Dayton good to see you

yeah I can tell you the all the

fatalities were outside I can't speak to

that just yet

we can't really comment on any of that

you know we will be able to to let you

know just that won't be right now it's

in the Oregon district outside do we

have a timeline for the next press

conference or will learn more about the

investigation for police sure so our

next press conference will be at 1:00

p.m. you know in like we can't tell you

what we're going to say we try to learn

as much as we can we try to tell you at

that time so at 1:00 p.m. today

how are the tasks be

and forgive me I didn't catch the first

part of that question I will say this

the the Dayton Police Department is

conducting the investigation we've had a

lot of assistance from outside resources

FBI has been here from very soon after

the incident occurred and and they've

assisted with the investigation so there

are a lot of resources that that other

agencies and organizations have provided

and that will all be included in this

investigation I I can also add that

after the one o'clock we are confident

we'll have a news briefing at 3 o'clock

where we can provide a little bit more

information as far as the the

investigation goes it may not be all the

answers just yet but but we'll try to

get as many to you as we can and I did

want to thank all of the the other

agencies who responded this is a mutual

aid event when something like this

happens so we had we had police officers

from all surrounding jurisdictions as

well as the fire response dayton dayton

fire department response and there was a

mutual aid request there so there were

medics from from a lot of other

jurisdictions too so we appreciate

everyone's assistance in this response

we can't really talk about that right

now

so gave you the numbers about how many

were injured and how many been

discharged

so can you talk about what you were

treating at Miami Valley

we treated a combination of gunshot

wounds as well as injuries from people

who were fleeing the scene

I saw the information I can give you at

this time some victims is sustained

multiple gunshot wounds I saw the

information I can give it this time I

can't speak to that I'm sorry

we don't we don't have like all of the

information to share with you

I think preliminary it seems to be a

diverse group of people I mean I mean

about the disease it's a diverse group

you know yeah we'll have that later in

the afternoon all right I appreciate you

all and your coverage we'll see you back

here at 1:00 if we have more information

when we have what we what information

we'll have we'll give it to you at 1:00

and thank you for keeping the prayers of

the community of the city of Dayton in

your hearts and thoughts

you
