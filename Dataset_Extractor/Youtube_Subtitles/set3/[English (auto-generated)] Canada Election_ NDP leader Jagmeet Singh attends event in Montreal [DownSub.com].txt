here daily multinational

so I want to take some time to be able

to chat with you all and be able to hang

out so give me a give me a second long

and I'm gonna chat just a bit more in

English now just sure you can speak both

I should also throw in some Punjabi Jake

we can see new Punjabi on the earth see

how arigato

okay Punjabi vhagar so I can speak three

languages at least I can speak a couple

more actually we'll get to that

reference no I really want to talk about

one of the things I know that a lot of

students are faced with it's its student

debt and it can be pretty crushing and I

think about when I was going to school

and when I was going through a tough

time when I was in university my brother

had to come and live with me so I was 20

years old taking care of my little

brother who's 15 and we went through

some tough times and friends and family

helped out when we're going through

those difficult times they stepped up

and you know fends my brother's friends

parents would cook food for us when we

didn't have food and we were struggling

because it was tough to pay the bills we

got through those tough times all on our

own I'm not a self-made person I got

here today because people help me out

lots of friends lots of families and

lots of strangers who didn't even know

that I was going through a tough time

but when I was going through a really

tough time for me I thought about

education as my way out as a way to kind

of find a way to support my younger

brother and my sister and take care of

my mom and dad and when I tried to look

at my options I thought about going to

professional school to go to graduate

school and I thought maybe if I become a

professional I could get a solid job and

when I applied to law school I finally

randomly went from science to law school

but when I went to law school the law

school tuition fee was eight thousand

dollars a year and I went to one of the

top schools in Canada and that same law

school today costs about close to thirty

thousand a year just for tuition and I

think about you know a younger jyg meet

faced with thirty thousand year tuition

there's no way I could have afforded to

do that my parents ended up going

through bankruptcy because my dad's

illness meant he couldn't work and we

were really in a tough financial

position there's no way I could have

afforded to spend thirty thousand

dollars a year for tuition if I was

going through that right now and I think

about all the young people that should

be hopeful about the future and I'm now

feeling crushed by the weight of student

debt and I think about what mr. Trudeau

has done over the past four years

in four years students have paid

interest on their student loans to the

tune of three billion dollars so federal

loans are not just prime their prime

plus sometimes 3% so you got students

that are basically making money for the

federal government the federal

government office students that to me is

pretty shameful and then we compare mr.

Trudeau last year wrote off corporate

loans guess how much all those corporate

loans were six billion dollars so on one

hand mr. Trudeau says okay if you've got

a corporate loan if you're a massive

powerful multinational corporation and

you've got loans

I'll just waive those loans six billion

dollars but if you're a student mr.

Trudeau said I'm gonna make profit off

your debt so we've got to do a lot but I

want you to know one thing on day one

the first thing we're gonna do one of

the first things were gonna do on day

one of a new democratic government we're

gonna immediately lift all interest

waive all interests on student loans

right away step one right away

I mean that's just a basic starting

point there's no way we should be

charging any interest on students who

are on who have loans but we're gonna go

beyond that we want to forgive loans we

want to replace loans with grants and

our goal our ultimate goal is this we

shouldn't be giving out loans you should

be giving grants but ultimately when

someone starts school from kindergarten

all the way to their career

there should be no barriers there should

be no barriers in their education and

that means free tuition for all that is

our goal

so we can change the direction of our

country we can tackle the climate crisis

that is so crushing and it is something

that is sapping the spirit of hope and

optimism other young people we can take

on climate crisis but only if you have

the courage to take on the big polluters

to take on the powerful corporations we

can expand our health care to include

medication for all and then dental care

for all mental health services eye and

hearing vision and care care we can do

that but only if you have the courage to

take on the big farming they absolutely

they do they absolutely do brother

brother you spoke last time at our event

we had brother listen listen my friend

come let me give you a hug for a second

come here brother brother come here

listen it's not it's not the best idea

we've got all these young listen we've

got all these young people here sir

we've got all these young people we've

got all these and what you're doing you

yellow this is not a good look you know

you're not actually helping the cause

out by yelling like this you're making

it look bad it's not actually good this

is not helpful brother this is not a

good look you're not doing a good thing

right now this is not helpful okay okay

so my friends we can take on the

powerful corporations and we can build a

better future we absolutely can stand up

for human rights wherever there's a

violation we stand up loudly and proudly

to defend human rights across this

country and across the world will

denounce any sort of human rights

violations that's not very helpful my

friend but we can have a chat afterwards

thank you so much for being here

and I'd love to chat with you after it

thank you so much no see thank you not

right now I'm not we're gonna take some

when I I'll speak to you right

afterwards

I'll speak to you right afterwards if

the media have some questions I'm happy

to take those questions right now

Abigail Beeman Global News mr. Singh you

have obviously had a warm reception here

on campus but this was your big push to

show Quebec that you're here for them

and you've been here for a day and a

half and you've only made four stops and

this was the biggest with just a hundred

and fifty people so why not have a

bigger rally why not get out to more

people attend more events I'm really

proud of our announcements we made

recently we announced two really

exciting candidates environmentalists

who are well known across Quebec who

have come to the new democratic party

because they see in us a party that not

only fights a climate crisis but also is

committed to fighting social justice and

fighting against the inequality so

really proud of those announcements we

made we put out our really bold plan

that shows our respect for Quebec and

our belief that we can work together the

progresses of Quebec and the rest of

Canada can come together and build a

better future so I'm really proud of

that work we've done we're gonna

continue to campaign hard Quebec is

incredibly important for us these

students here and they are so important

for us because these this is our future

and spending time with those folks is a

big part of why we're doing the work we

do and I've seen you interact with many

students but that's the most that I've

seen you talk to people in Quebec since

you've been here so why not have bigger

rallies why not have more events since

your time is limited in a campaign yeah

we'll have more events that we're

excited about the event so we've got

lined up we've got a whole campaign in

front of us 35 days so we're gonna

continue to campaign really hard I'm

really proud of the work we've done so

far and we've got

lots of work that's in front of us that

were going to be doing and we've got

lots of more announcements are gonna be

making but really proud that we've got

candidates like Sophie like other

candidates that are here today I want to

name so don't make mistakes but we've

got we've got a great team when working

really hard Christian singing Oh Joe

SEMS CTV national news this morning mr.

Ferland as well as mr. Buller East said

that they were separatist but at the

moment they're putting that aside in

their Federalists because there's not

really the appetite in Quebec it seems

like there is a bit more of an openness

from you as the NDP leader that there

has been in past to talk about

candidates separatist pass and to just

be more open in general is this an

attempt to try to reach out to more

Quebecers potentially to try to grab

people who may have previously supported

the greens or the bloc we're really

proud of the fact that people are

welcome to our party who may have had

different positions in the past but

believe now that there's a path forward

where we work together with the rest of

Canada we build a bridge between

progressives in all parts of Canada with

progresses in Quebec to fight things

like the climate crisis to expand our

health care system to tackle the crisis

around housing these are things very

important and I welcome anyone who sees

in the New Democratic Party a path to

working together with all of Canada to

building a better brighter future the

one thing that joins everyone together

as New Democrats and when they join our

party they know it's our job and it's

our priority to work towards building

bridges and working together and that's

what people are saying when they join

our party and that's what I'm confident

that folks who join us have that belief

and that's important to me obviously the

NDP needs support in Quebec any

government does if they want to try to

get to Parliament is this though an

attempt to reach out to more people who

may not have supported the NDP before

who may have supported the bloc but now

see that the party isn't quite as

successful as it once was and maybe are

looking to the NDP well Jack Layton

started this tradition he started this

tradition of saying you know there's

folks in Quebec that are proud of being

Quebecers they're proud of this

beautiful land and they want to work

with people around Canada to build a

brighter future so he reached out of

hand and said if you care about building

a brighter future for everybody let's

build this together so he reached out

that hand

and I feel like that might have been

that that vision of Jax might not have

had the continued energy that it needs

so I wanted to really into that vision

into that vision of building bridges and

working together and bringing Coe back

together with the rest of Canada and

that's what I'm doing

mr. Singh I'd like to follow up on the

fact that the PPC leader is now going to

be allowed into the debates do you think

and one of the arguments might be it's

important to hear these voices even

though you may not agree with them so

there's there's on one side their

freedom of expression and hearing people

out on the other side there's hateful

and divisive speech that just foment or

feed hatred and I made it really clear

that mr. Burney A's statements the

things that he stands for are hateful

and divisive and tear apart people and

those do not deserve the platform and I

made it really clear I do not believe he

should have been a part of the debate

because of the damage that he can cause

with already the rise of of that

divisive type of politics that hateful

type of politics we do not need to give

someone like mr. Bern mr. Bernier as a

platform and that's why I said very

clearly I think that's wrong

[Applause]

is there anything you could potentially

do or show is there anything you could

potentially do or show as a leader than

your opposition to this would you

consider pulling out of it out of the

leaders debate because of that you know

unhappiness that you show with Miss them

letting him in I will be going to the

debate because I want hate to know that

I'll never back down from fighting AIDS

hi I'm Allegra Mendelson from the McGill

international review the NDP has a very

brief section on foreign policy in their

platform in countries like China India

and Russia are hardly mentioned if at

all how will the NDP increase Canada's

presence in international affairs and

work with key players to keep Canadians

safe and promote Canadian values abroad

thank you very much for the question

I think Canadians are really proud of

our history of being peacekeepers being

folks have pushed diplomacy just

touching on a number of those issues

when it comes to China right now we've

got two Canadians that are being

detained in horrible conditions and it's

our priority to make sure that they are

returned we also need to call out the

human rights violations that go on in

China and we'll continue to do that you

mentioned India as well currently in

India we've got a government that's

promoting a very divisive type of

rhetoric and they've gone into Kashmir

and really oppressed the people there

this is something where there was a

media blackout cell phones and and

telephones were cut off media wasn't

allowed to go in but the ability for

communities to communicate was also shut

down not to me is an example of a very

repressive move it's very dangerous and

Canada has to play a role in denouncing

those types of behaviors so wherever

there is any sort of human rights

violation I think Canadians should be

able to count on us to say what is wrong

to call it out and I'll continue to do

that

hi hi mr. Chuck Meade I am sadaqa huija

from the post-millennial and I have a

couple of questions for you

so Justin Trudeau's recently faced

allegations today from Andrew Shearer

that he took faith Goldie for drinks and

mr. Andrews shares also got met with

faith Goldie and had interviews what is

your opinion on the situation I mean

that's just an example of really really

Smith's wrong someone like faith

Goldie's promoting also that type of

hateful rhetoric promoting hate towards

people hate speech in some cases I would

think that her language almost gets that

level that's deeply concerning and not

surprising but definitely deeply

concerning what is your opinion on

transferring shares to workers

resembling of what corbin tommix is

promoting in the UK well I've promoted

and I really believe in cooperatives

that people should be able to jointly

own companies I think it's a powerful

way to give power back to people I

believe unionization is a powerful way

for people for workers to fight for

fairness and equality at a workplace I

haven't looked at the specifics around

around that proposal but I think we need

to really address inequality inequality

is growing massively and we're seeing

that the results of inequality growing

is that we've got wealth being

concentrated in very few hands and more

and more people are struggling it's

becoming harder to make ends meet and

we've got to tackle inequality and some

of the ways that we're gonna do that is

ask the very wealthy to pay their fair

share we're going to increase the amount

that wealthy contribute to society

I don't think taxes are a bad word I

think their contributions and

investments in building a better society

and that's why we're going to put in

place a super well tax on those who have

fortunes of over 20 million dollars

hi Abigail again I just want to give you

an opportunity to clarify your comments

earlier at the end of the last question

that I asked you you said that you

weren't going to say a candidate's name

for fear of making a mistake and it

appeared that you didn't know Miz

masseuse name beside me membership I got

this move as many candidates in the room

I don't want to miss any of the

candidates so you know all of your

candidates of course of course yes yes

okay didn't appear that way yeah I know

I just we know all the things is when

you're at an event it's very delicate

you might name some and then you miss

some so I think that's why I was

referring to okay thank you very much

everybody

appreciate it okay
