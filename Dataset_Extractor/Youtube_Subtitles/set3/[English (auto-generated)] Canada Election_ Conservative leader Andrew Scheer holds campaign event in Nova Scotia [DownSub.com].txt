and we are about to start a wave of

change that's gonna carry us all the way

through I told Chris when he chatted

with me a few months ago about the

nomination I said you know for us in

Saskatchewan happens right here in West

Nova and I am sure that that big blue

wave is coming that big blue wave is

going to start in Atlantic Canada carry

us all the way through central Canada

the prairies all the way to BC and give

us a new Conservative government on

October 21st noose a volcanic stone to

do me occasions attempt it do I put

about to Eve 2015 was tough for our

party but we've gone and gotten great

candidates great fantastic candidates

like Chris who has a history of

representing his constituents who has a

history of putting people first in his

riding and he's going to take the

expertise and the experience that he had

here at the provincial level all the way

to Ottawa and he's going to be part of a

new Conservative government after this

elections over

[Applause]

[Music]

well the Liberals are mired in scandal

and corruption we are putting forward a

platform that is speaking directly to

people's needs leaving more money in

their pockets so they can get ahead that

is the message of this campaign late

making life more affordable we've been

unveiling our policies since day one and

I know we have a lot of doors to knock

tonight and a lot of signs to pin so I

won't even be able to get through them

all I'll keep it short though we're

putting more money back in the pockets

of Canadians by repealing the carbon tax

that's going to be job number one

we're helping Canadians get ahead by

removing the GST and HSC off of home

energy and hydro bills we're lowering

the first income tax bracket from

fifteen percent down to thirteen point

seven five percent more money in your

pocket we're going to help people save

for their children's education by

increasing the grants that the federal

government puts in for our esps to help

make post-secondary education more

attainable for so many Canadian families

and we have a real environmental plan

that will actually lower greenhouse gas

emissions take the climate change fight

global and once and for all stop the

practice of cities and towns dumping raw

sewage into our rivers lakes and oceans

that's a real environmental plan Sumati

news I have all I know say blue top we

pour the system this on tape Roman Co

this morning we announced more support

for provincial health care systems and I

know as someone who had my mom had a lot

of different types of illnesses in her

last few years one of the biggest things

affecting Canadians across the country

is wait times and so often before

patients can even get treated for what

they're facing they're waiting weeks and

months just for the tests and we have so

many people who aren't getting the help

they need because they haven't been able

to have the diagnostic test that will

tell the doctors what it is that they

need to do and that's why this morning

we announced that we would Institute a

new fund to help provincial governments

replace or purchase new MRI and CT scan

equipment

we're gonna do all of this as we get

back to balanced budgets because we as

conservatives know that massive deficits

that last for years and years put

pressure on social programs means higher

taxes after this election when Justin

Trudeau doesn't need your vote he'll

still need your money and we know he's

gonna raise those taxes he's gonna raise

income taxes he's gonna raise the carbon

tax and we can't afford to let him do

that we can't afford four more years of

Justin Trudeau's so tonight I want to

thank you all for being here thank you

for supporting Chris we know we're gonna

win elections like this the

old-fashioned way

door-to-door lawn by lawn small business

by small biz we just stopped in at a

place called the Annapolis Brewing

Company has anybody ever been there whoa

met a guy there named Doug who said he

was gonna be here but he got the time

mixed up he thought it was five o'clock

and he thought he was back would it be

able to take it so he's over at the

Brewing Company but he told me he could
