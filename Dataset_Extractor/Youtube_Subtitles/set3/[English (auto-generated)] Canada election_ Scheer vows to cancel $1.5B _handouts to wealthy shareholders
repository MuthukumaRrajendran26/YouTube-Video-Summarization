thank you very much Aaron merci beaucoup

saying gone pleaseö deftly CI Hamilton

it's a great pleasure to be back in

Hamilton I really want to thank Zico and

his family for letting us use his space

this morning this is a fantastic example

of a family-owned small business that

provides jobs an opportunity for people

in the community it's always great to be

back in southwestern Ontario what I'm

hearing in Hamilton today is exactly

what I hear everywhere I go in this

country people are working harder than

ever but they're just not getting ahead

everything keeps getting more expensive

and there's often not enough left at the

end of the month and that Justin Trudeau

is making things worse now in fairness

there are some people who are better off

with him as Prime Minister not everyone

is falling behind the wealthy and the

well-connected are doing just fine when

Loblaws called Trudeau jumped at the

chance to hand one of the wealthiest

corporations in Canada twelve million

dollars to buy new fridges he was

prepared to fork over 18 million dollars

to build an airport and Cape Breton for

members of a private golf course and

only back down when taxpayers complained

he also wrote off millions of dollars in

taxpayer funded loans to the Irving

family one of Canada's wealthiest and

back in February in the middle of the

S&C Lavin corruption scandal he handed

blackberry a check for 40 million

dollars and when the CEO was asked

whether or not his company needed this

generous taxpayer handout his answer was

short and sweet

no that's why today I'm so happy to

announce that as Prime Minister I will

eliminate at least 1.5 billion dollars

in taxpayer handouts to wealthy

executives shareholders and foreign

companies will keep that money from

going to the wealthy and well-connected

who need it the least and will put it

back in the pockets of hardworking

Canadians who need it the most

1.5 billion dollars by conducting a

thorough review of all business subsidy

programs and rooting out the programs

that leave Canadians with no benefits a

new Conservative government will also

review innovation programs to make sure

they support Canadian companies with

patents technologies and economic

benefits that remain in Canada I want to

make it clear that regional economic

development agencies are here to stay in

fact we will strengthen them we need

these agencies to focus on real economic

development and on helping small and

medium-sized businesses to grow unlike

Justin Trudeau I will make sure all

regional development agencies are led by

ministers from the regions they support

our review will be focused solely on

eliminating grants for those who don't

need the help because that's what this

election is all about who do you trust

to put more money in your pockets so you

can get ahead our campaign to help

Canadians get ahead is already in full

swing

and I've already announced several new

measures that a new Conservative

government

we'll take to make life more affordable

dial The Millionaire is working for

billion-dollar corporations can get this

a plan for every Canadian to get ahead

for your retirement you shouldn't have

to be a billionaire to get your

government's attention instead you

deserve a government that knows how hard

you work understands how much you

already pay and has a plan to help a

government and a prime minister his

first priority will be to help you get

ahead thank you very much I see

Platteville Castillo happy to take

impressions CBC News can I just give you

a quick clarification is it 1.5 billion

dollars annually or just 1.5 billion

dollars in general it is annually there

are estimations that that put the amount

of money that the Government of Canada

spends on these types of programs as

high as some that some indicate as high

as seven billion dollars and we believe

with this type of review establishing

these types of criteria we can save

Canadian taxpayers about at least 1.5

billion dollars every year well you know

just running through a few of the

examples already we can see that that it

wouldn't take long to get there we have

the multi million dollar loans to the

Irving family which the government wrote

off 12 million dollar freezers to

Loblaws 40 million dollars for

blackberry 49 million dollars for the

Canada Kuwait petrochemical company we

have the 950 million dollars for super

clusters which are not evaluated for any

type of performance criteria there's 1.6

billion dollars of taxpayers money to

the oil and gas industry but they didn't

ask for on the eve of an election so as

you can see it won't take long to get to

that type of whatever savings we say to

say in Multan annual yeah days

Newsome try coffee on comfort today in

question is those were all one-time

payments to various whether it's

corporations or to what you listed there

but they're not built into the budget so

I'm still not quite sure how you get to

the 1.5 billion because those were one

time well we get to the 1.5 billion by

establishing the crib the criteria that

government programs in the future will

not go to wealthy executives to line the

pockets of shareholders or for foreign

country or for foreign companies and we

believe that by establishing these types

of criteria that the types of programs

that many of these funds were delivered

under would would not be going to those

types of companies and that's where we

come up with the savings do Canada she

unique sure so I've always said that I

will defend and promote projects that

are in the national interest is that we

have respect for provincial areas

jurisdiction and the the other side of

that coin is that we also have respect

for federal areas of jurisdiction but

this can be accomplished in in a manner

of collaboration with the province of

Quebec and I know that Quebecers like

Canadians would prefer to buy their oil

and gas from Canadians not from American

companies or from Algeria there is no

reason why we can't be energy

independent in this country when we have

so many resources available to Canadians

we don't want to be sending our consumer

dollar to the American economy or to

other economies and I know also that

Quebecers prefer that oil and gas is

transported through pipelines and not on

railways we've seen the types of

tragedies that happen in the past and

I'm prepared to work with the government

of Quebec to establish the energy

corridor which will address these types

of concerns around environmental issues

around

consultations with indigenous Canadians

it will create a win-win scenario for

the province of Quebec evacuating

province to Quebec at a zoek de Provence

the rest of Canada

it will allow Western Canadian energy to

our stretchiness CTV News a week into

this campaign no conservative premiers

have appeared alongside you and

Ontario's premier Doug Ford says he's

too busy to do so even though you're

heading back to so-called Ford country

later today I'm wondering why aren't any

of these conservatives premiers showing

up next to you you know we have a great

message we're campaigning we've got

volunteers from every walk of life from

every background coming up helping us

out on our campaigns we've got great

support at local levels with with all

different types of public figures and

I'm excited that type of momentum our

campaign is generating and I look

forward to the results on October 21st

when the people in Ontario do federally

what they did in Ontario which is

replace a scandal-plagued Liberal

government that has run massive deficits

raise taxes engaged in corrupt practices

with will get rid of that and bring in a

government that respects the taxpayers

dollar you still haven't answered why

conservative premiers aren't appearing

alongside with you or haven't until now

so which premiers will during the

campaign which conservative premiers

have committed to campaigning alongside

you and when the focus here is about our

supporting our kin it's getting our

message out to people all over this

country in every region we're going to

win seats and provinces that have that

haven't had conservative premiers in a

while we're gonna win seats in every

region in this country we're hearing

every day from people who voted liberal

in 2015 and disappointed with what they

got and are voting conservative in 2019

that's what this campaign is all though

I'm focused on getting my positive

message for making life more affordable

out to Canadians so they understand how

a Conservative government will make sure

that they get ahead Ron Burgundy's don't

levira abbadabba okay I don't have a

click ready this is super comfy overview

CEO mr. Shermer click return with all

the Nationals so far in this first week

you've announced 920 billion dollars

worth of programs today 1.5 billion

dollars with the cuts the deficit stands

at 15 billion dollars so if you're still

promising to balance the books can we

expect to the reckless campaign

all about where the cuts will be you can

expect for the rest of the campaign that

we will continue to make announcements

about how a Conservative government will

make life more affordable so we can

leave more money in the pockets of

Keynes so they can get ahead we'll also

show Keynes exactly how we'll accomplish

the goals of returning back to balanced

budgets so the government stops

borrowing money Justin Trudeau has added

billions of dollars to the national debt

which means more and more of your tax

dollar is going to pay the interest to

banks and bondholders so it's important

that we get back to balanced budgets

will do that over a responsible period

of time a five year period and will show

Keynes exactly how we're going to do

that we cocl occurred legume all equally

come on equilibrated abuja or mint on

Quebec open a sample 411 Jews our album

so just as a follow up with today's

announcement does that mean if that

you're elected prime minister that you

won't give any money to Canadian

corporations to help them out as I said

we estimate there are estimations

analysis that shows that the government

spends about as high as seven billion

dollars on the types of programs to to

assist Canadian companies expand and

grow here in Canada well we believe is

we can eliminate about 1.5 billion of

that at least 1.5 billion of that if we

establish the criteria that we will no

longer and give money to rich

corporations highly profitable

corporations that goes to executive

bonuses or that leave the country we

believe that by establishing that

criteria we can continue to support

things like regional development

agencies and and the types of innovative

partnerships that protect strategic

industries in our country but we can

eliminate about 1.5 billion dollars of

the wasteful spending that's going to

the well-connected and put that money

National Post 2004 your first federal

campaign you campaign on eliminating

corporate wealthy it didn't do that

why should we well this campaign is

about what a conservative government

will do in the future this is our

commitment we believe that this is

essential to ensure that government

dollars is not wasted on highly

profitable companies that that is used

to pay executive bonuses or line the

pocket of shareholders or for companies

that don't create or protect jobs here

in Canada by establishing this type of

criteria in these government programs we

can save taxpayers 1.5 billion dollars

and put that money into measures that

make life more affordable for them well

a Conservative government will of course

promote programs that celebrate Canada's

multicultural aspect that tackle people

who promote hate online or in any type

of forum and that means ensuring that

our police agencies have the tools they

need especially the RCMP level if we are

looking at groups in particular that

spread hateful messages across the

country and of course our government

will continue to support those

initiatives to do just that hi mr. shear

Janice Dixon The Globe and Mail the

Liberals say they're only submitting

big-ticket items from their platform

and the independent reports won't come

out until the full platform comes out so

they're not releasing them as they go

what's your reaction to that and would

you commit to the next election doing

the same and submitting your

announcements as you go mm-hmm

well of course we're very pleased with

the way that our campaign is unfolding

and we believe that by including the

costing at the moment of the

announcement it's better for Canadians

so they can have the details right away

obviously the Liberals have a terrible

fiscal record that they are ashamed of I

believe that's why they're not

participating in the very process that

they themselves set up even even at that

though we know that Canadians can't

trust anything that Justin Trudeau is

promising

he made specific concrete promises in

the last election campaign that he had

no intention of keeping that he broke

those promises he has lied to Canadians

about his role in the SNC lavell an

affair he continues to lie to Canadians

he's continuing to spread falsehoods

about his ability to waive cabinet

confidences as it relates to the RCMP

and their relationship in this scandal

so even at the end of the day even at

the end of this campaign even when they

put their platform oh I would have

Ramona what I hear from Cannes that they

don't trust Justin Trudeau he's not as

advertised they know he's not going to

follow through with any of his

commitments we may new some click on Tom

past is that we are prepared to sit down

with the province of Quebec and examine

how a Conservative government can work

with the provincial government to ensure

that the immigration system meets the

needs of Quebecers I know that one

specific proposal that I've heard that I

believe that we can accomplish is the

duplication on on labor market opinions

as it relates to temporary foreign

workers that's something that I'm very

interested in pursuing there are other

aspects of miss Sheila goes a letter

that I think you know conservatives can

dear may soon on a report the important

it running me Rabson from The Canadian

Press you've talked a lot about

asserting federal jurisdiction getting

pipelines build getting to a yes how

does how does asserting federal

jurisdiction get you over the the court

challenges and that that's stopped

in many ways the trends mountain

pipeline there's another core challenge

how does just asserting federal

jurisdiction actually gets you to a yes

when there's courts that are saying that

you have to have to pass certain bars

mhm

that's an excellent question because you

are right to point out that in many

cases the courts have found that this

Liberal government have not engaged in

the indigenous consultations properly

and so what I would say to that is

twofold one on the consultation process

it's about having a robust engaged

process right from the beginning and

that that means as I called on the

government to do establishing a personal

representative of the minister to have

robust and dynamic consultation

processes to and then is that you we can

show the courts that we have fulfilled

the government of Canada's obligations

under the duty to consult the second

thing and this is something that is so

frustrating for people who are out of

work in the energy sector

it's about fast-tracking some of the

questions that have been raised by by

people who oppose the project

fast-tracking those cases to the Supreme

Court referring those types of

jurisdictional questions to the Supreme

Court right away so we can get certainty

instead of watching these court cases

move slowly up and up being appealed we

would have taken that directly to get

finality on those decisions and take

this opportunity to point out it's

extremely disappointing for all

Canadians who recognize that our

economic well-being depends on a

thriving energy sector that this

government failed to stand up for for

itself really in the trans mount case

failed to submit any types of support

for that case as it was working its way

the same limitations on and going

forward as I said we know nothing has

good morning mr. schirra Theo Judas

Bloomberg News since we're talking about

corporate handouts today in the last

November the Liberal government

introduced and very expensive capital

cost allowance measures for businesses

to invest if you become Prime Minister

will you maintain those allowances for

capital cost we will maintain the types

of competitive tax policies that ensure

that we are tracking investment from

around the world to create jobs here in

Canada that is the core message of today

it's about making sure that government

policy encourages growth here in Canada

and and and measures that we know we

have to take here to make sure that

Canada is competitive as it relates to

other jurisdictions who are making

similar moves will absolutely maintain

those types of those types of

initiatives and of the seven billion in

subsidies that you mentioned are all on

the table in a in a review are there any

subsidies that you think are actually

you know good well one of the things

that we will accomplish is about having

a better understanding of exactly what

exists under government right now there

are such a myriad of programs under many

different departments without any clear

direction or

in many of them and one of the things

that this review will allow us to do is

have a better understanding a better

evaluation of the programs that exist as

I mentioned we are going to ensure that

regional development agencies are there

are strong are robust in the regions in

which that they operate and that they

will be run by a minister who actually

comes from that region and so we will

continue to ensure that where there are

strategic industries or integrated

supply chains or the types of industrial

research benefits that do exist under

certain types of government agreements

that those continue but that we have a

better understanding of all the

different types of programs because we

are talking about billions and billions

of dollars and so often as I mentioned

no evaluation of the impact that is

actually made on Keynes no evaluation of

whether or not jobs are actually created

or protected here in Canada that's what

this review is aimed at doing so that we

can put that money back in the pockets

of hard-working Canadians we allow state

again would you

i think a lot of good i know a lot of

canes were concerned and outraged when

they saw that Justin Trudeau gave them

Barty a hundreds of millions of dollars

without any assurances that that money

would go to keeping jobs in Canada a

very outraged when they saw

bonuses that were paid out to executives

at Bombardier what we're saying here

today is that the types of grants or

loan rate offs that don't protect jobs

that don't keep jobs in Canada or that

don't create jobs here in Canada would

be eliminated because they are not a

good use of taxpayers dollars the types

of strategic innovation funds or the

types of programs that do accomplish

that goal all Canadian companies will

continue to be able to benefit from but

we're going to go through these types of

programs with a careful eye to make sure

that your your hard-earned tax dollar is

not going to line the pockets of highly

profitable companies or to benefit

shareholders or to go to other countries

to benefit job growth and job creation

and other countries that's the criteria

that we're going to establish a we are

well when we're talking about things

like strategic industries or integrated

supply chains like the aerospace sector

which have a variety of programs that

that that that do have an impact on

ensuring that Canadian companies can

stay competitive as it relates to global

competitors than all Canadian companies

including Bo Bardi would be eligible for

that but what we're talking about here

today is the types of you know

multi-million dollar loans that get

written off or the types of grants to

companies that aren't used to create or

protect jobs here in Canada instead they

benefit the executives they benefit the

shareholders or in many cases and some

of the

cases I've listed here today leave the

country I don't think Canadians

hard-working canes want to see their

hard-earned tax dollar go to those sorts

of things and that's exactly what this

review is about well again what worked

what we saw there was a collapse of a

sector wide collapse of a North American

integrated supply chain that during the

the height of the global recession and

that was not a one-off to any one

particular company it certainly was

integral in keeping jobs here in Canada

what we're talking about here today as I

mentioned multi-million dollar loan

right offs to wealthy families twelve

million dollars to Loblaws to replace

freezers forty million dollars for

blackberry that the CEO of blackberry

said they didn't even ask for for 1.6

billion dollars of taxpayers money to

the oil and gas industry that they

didn't ask for but people in the oil and

gas sector want is a regulatory process

that gets pipelines built so they can go

back to doing what they've always done

which is use private private sector

investment for that industry to grow

that's what we're talking about here

today getting back to that type of

economy here in Canada CBC Hamilton so I

obviously steel as a massive employer

here the Liberal government's seems to

be quite proud of the way they handle

the kind of those retaliatory tariffs

how would your government protect steel

workers Canadian stores here in Hamilton

from similar steps being taken by other

trade partner well I don't know why

Justin Trudeau would be proud of what he

did on the steel file it took him it

took him months to get those tariffs

lifted he signed a deal on NAFTA I took

concession after concession after

concession accepted a weakened NAFTA

than what he what he started off with

and at the end of that did not get steel

and aluminium tariffs dealt with under

the NAFTA negotiations had to take it

took them it took him a great deal of

time which put tremendous strain on

steel companies here in Canada we've

also heard from representatives of the

steel industry that they are very

frustrated the way the government has

handled the programs that were meant to

support them because of the retaliatory

tariffs and that the funds that were

collected under the retaliatory tariffs

have not been adequate

provided to the very companies that were

affected by it so I can assure you that

a Conservative government I come from

Regina there's a large steel plant in my

writing that makes specifically

pipelines we will absolutely support our

steel industry by getting our energy

sector back up onto its feet and by

dealing with with Donald Trump from a

position of strength instead of

accepting all these concessions and at

the end of the day accepting a deal on

on steel that really does give a lot of

control over that to the Americans that

they can be really the drop of a hat so

these are the types of things that we

would work on to strengthen Canada steel

industry here in Canada we said

workers have supported the NDP's climate

change plan saying it supports both

industry and jobs and the environment

how would your government walk that line

supporting workers and spurring the

environment you're talking about

pipeline

yeah well one of the things that makes

many industries in Canada much more

difficult to operate under it is the

carbon tax and by eliminating the carbon

tax we will make sure that companies

that operate here in Canada are more

competitive as it relates to other

countries that don't have carbon taxes

we will also get pipelines built again

which again a great deal of Steel is

required for those types of big projects

and we will invest will create a

framework for investment

technology and not taxes so that means

that Canadian companies can benefit from

innovation from research and development

from the new types of products that will

come from things like the green patent

tax credit and the green expansion

accelerator those are things that

support investments in technology and

the steel industry will benefit greatly

from that while at the same time

inventing the new types of products new

types of technologies that will be

required to lower greenhouse gas

from Hamilton Mountain News

cast aside the negative comparisons to a

Doug Ford and the perception that a

federal conservative Mint would slash

program spending and and transfer

spending mm-hmm well we made a very

clear engagement on transfers transfers

for health care education and other

important social programs will only ever

increase under a conservative government

we've made that commitment

it is our guarantee will can maintain

the current formula which means

increases of at least 3 percent every

single year and when GDP and economic

growth are higher than that those

transfers will be higher as well if we

want to talk about negative comparisons

the people of Ontario know what happens

when scandal-plagued liberal governments

are able to run deficits and raise taxes

for years and years and years it creates

exactly the type of mess that the people

Ontario saw just recently and the very

same architects of the Kathleen Wynne

Dalton McGuinty governments are now

working for Justin Trudeau and

implementing the exact same policies and

so the people of Ontario know that on

October 21st they have the ability to

limit the damage to those types of

disastrous policies to just one term and

so that we can limit the damage to

important social programs and I believe

that they are going to make that choice

just follow up I should the opportunity

arise during the campaign do you think

it would be a benefit to do some

campaigning with mr. Ford

you know I'm where we have our campaign

plan it involves making exciting

announcements about how we're going to

make life more affordable and how we're

gonna lower taxes and and make sure that

people can live out their goals and

achieve their dreams that is what our

campaign is all about I've had a

tremendous amount of pleasure traveling

across the country meeting with people

who voted 20 liberal in 2015 regret that

decision and are now voting conservative

in 2019 you can feel it at the doors it

can feel that the events people are

excited for a change on October 21st and

that's exactly what we're going to give

them like Sontaran merci beaucoup
