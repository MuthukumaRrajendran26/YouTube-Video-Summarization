trust thank you thank you long good luck

go get it

we could use him in the bullpen maybe

and that would be good that would

guarantee it good luck great season

you've had tremendous season Mariano was

born the son of a fishing boat captain

on the coast of Panama he learned to

play baseball on the mudflats of the

Pacific with a cardboard love a bat

fashioned from a tree branch and a ball

made out of rock string and tape there

wasn't a lot of money for playing

baseball he excelled at the sport at the

age of 18 he started playing in the

country's top adult lake in a critical

game with his team losing badly the

coach called him over and asked Mariano

to do something that he had never really

done before could you pitch Mariano mo

insisted that he could not but when he

took the mound an amazing thing happened

the crowd witnessed an incredible

performance

his opponents did not get a single run

for the rest of the game and a legend

was starting his team won an epic

comeback victory big deal at that time

and after that as teammates contacted a

scout and told him that he had a tryout

in Panama City with the world's most

famous baseball dynasty the New York

Yankees with barely enough money for the

bus ride home

Mariano set out on a journey that would

define his life and inspire countless

millions around the globe at his first

dry out in worn-out shoes and a borrowed

glove Mariano threw nine fast balls it

was the only pitch he knew how to throw

after a few more tryouts the yankees

offered him a contract to play their

farm team the Gulf Coast Yankees do you

remember that

Mariano the Gulf Coast were they a good

team not bad right

he got in an airplane and came back to

America a few months later in August

1990 mariana threw his first no-hitter

that year he had an average er a of 0.7

teen so that doesn't mean one that means

like one seventeenth of one that's not a

lot did you lose how do you lose a game

well I guess you score no runs right boy

oh boy

in 52 innings he had point 17 which is

unheard of over 22 games soon thereafter

Mariano married Clara which was an even

more important thing for him to do and

truly and he said it many times you are

the love of his life you know that you

feel that right I hope he tells you that

they will soon celebrate their 20th

wedding anniversary congratulations

[Applause]

after five years playing in the minors

in 1955 Mariano made it to the big

leagues in his second season with the

Yankees Mariano delivered 130 strikeouts

in less than 108 innings while facing

425 batters he allowed only one home run

with an ER a of 2.09 the Yankees made

him a closer for the 1997 season that's

when it really started happening that

year he accidentally threw a pitch he

had never thrown before then he tried it

several more times again and again kept

working and at the last second his

fastball who was really an incredible

thing became the cutter he had suddenly

developed that lethal pitch which are

people throwing that pitch today because

I've never noticed they seem to they

don't have your success I can tell you

right they don't they may be throwing it

but it doesn't work quite the same way

and many players would come to consider

it the greatest pitch ever in baseball

it would break many records and many

bats in a 1999 game against the Atlanta

Braves his cutter snapped a big strong

guy Ryan Klesko I know him well as a

player he's a big powerful guy and he

broke his bat three times in one plate

appearance that has to be like a record

in 2001 Mariano's heavy fearsome pitch

destroyed 44 bats in less than 81

innings and I used to say I tell people

I've never seen a guy break so many bats

it's called a heavy heavy pitch and I

asked Mariano why and he really didn't

know just was the way it was right it's

just the way it happened it's from God

it's from God when he retired the

Minnesota Twins presented him with what

would become one of the most prized

possessions a chair made out of their

shattered bats

[Applause]

in 1998 1999 and 2000 World Series

championships

Mariano closed out three consecutive

World Series victories and delivered 14

strikeouts and seven saves he gave up

only two runs 259 batters and you got to

remember you're playing against the best

team so this isn't like palying the low

level this is the best team and he had a

very unusual trait he did better against

the best teams and he did incredibly in

the playoffs game after game when his

entrance music Enter Sandman filled the

arena fans went wild knowing that the

game was all but over his dominance on

the mound mesmerized fans teammates and

unfortunately for them it mesmerised the

competitors in Game seven of the 2003

American League Championship Mariano

entered at the top of the ninth with the

score tied five to five he held off the

Boston Red Sox for three straight

innings without giving up a single run

helping secure the series for the

Yankees he was named the Series MVP not

surprising

one of the most memorable moments of

Marianas career was the final game of

the old Yankee Stadium this is a last

game in Yankee Stadium when he took his

place in history as the final man to

pitch in that shrine to American

baseball and I spent many a day in that

Stadium and night and it was special

with Moe on the mound for the ninth

inning

not a single hitter from the Baltimore

Orioles made it to first base he secured

yet one more Yankee victory and that day

the old stadium became the house that

Ruth Built and that Rivera closed out

over the course of 19 seasons you have

to hear this to believe it

I didn't even know it I knew he was the

best but this is crazy

Mariano broke the major league baseball

record for the most games finished and

saves made he has the best ER a earned

run average in the past 100 years

2 point 2 1 in the regular season and an

even more astounding point 70 that's

less than one run in the postseason when

again you play the best teams these are

the hot teams these are the teams that

are just beating up everybody and you

had less than one run point-seven it's

amazing he made more than 2 times as

many saves as the next best pitcher in

postseason and a true clutch pitcher he

was always the best against the most

talented hitters amazingly the 527

batters he faced in postseason games hit

only two home runs and scored only 13

runs against him I think you guys want

him quickly we have to get him get him

in uniform you know you're getting ready

just sign him up blonde

Mariano helped lead the Yankees to five

World Series victories was named the

World Series MVP in 1999 and this year

he became the first person unanimously

elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame

unanimous that one hurt

so just out of curiosity Babe Ruth was

not unanimously elected babe the babe

didn't make it what was his problem he

did pretty good too

you mean babe was not unanimous well he

had some other difficulty so yeah yeah

that's pretty good Mariano that's I've

heard first unanimously the babe huh

we love the babe what a swing the babe

had that old corkscrew swing right

nobody could figure him out either

throughout Mariano's incredible career

he remained a humble man guided by a

deep Christian faith that inspires

everyone around him as he says he has

always remembered that the Lord doesn't

care about wealth or fame or the number

of saves somebody has we are all

children of God and the Lord cares about

the goodness and love in our hearts

that's all well well that is different

than the babe I would say I don't know

if the babe ever said that

that's pretty sure he didn't maybe in

his last year he said it nearly two

decades ago

Mariano founded the Mariano Rivera

foundation which has provided hundreds

of scholarships for underprivileged

children along with school supplies for

countless students and is currently

building a learning and community center

in New Rochelle New York where I can

tell you from being in New York what

you've done in New Rochelle has been

incredible incredible after retiring

from baseball Mariano and his wife built

an evangelical church and today Clara is

its pastor I'm gonna have to come listen

to you sometime I could use it that's

good

Mariano was naturalized as a US citizen

in 2015 and of course he serves as

co-chair of the President's Council on

sports fitness and nutrition Mariano

Rivera has made extraordinary

contributions to American sports culture

and society he is the most dominant

relief pitcher in the history of

baseball and more than that he

lived the American dream and shines as

an example of American greatness for all

to see and I'd now like to ask the

military aid to come forward and present

Mariano Rivera with the Presidential

Medal of Freedom and before we do the

actual presentation I'd like to have

Mariano just say a few words and I know

most of those words are going to be

addressed to his family because I know

how he feels about his family

nobody loves their family more than

Mariano please bye

[Applause]

Wow amazing uh mr. president thank you

for so I would like to say thank God for

a wonderful day you know always be here

in presence in a mr. president thank you

for all those words and remarks the

first lady Thank You mr. pence Karen

thank you for being all of you for being

here present but my wife my kids and my

families rest of the family friends

without you guys supporting the prayers

we got from now mr. mr. t mr. Joe Torre

benefit for a lot of those prayers

and for me it's an honor and a privilege

to receive this the word is a matter of

freedom which amia all ideal yes try to

be the best and do the best for them for

America you know one thing that I had to

remark is one remark when I came here in

1990 I came to Tampa Dean spoke no

English I mean Ivan spoke I didn't speak

now

forget about 1990 you know

the reason what I did that because I

mean in the team they were a lot of

players that spoke Spanish so I got a

little comfortable and then try a little

bit to learn the language my second year

in baseball I was in Greenville North

Carolina where most of the people didn't

speak any Spanish especially my team is

the evening I was a little younger so

the guys that spoke Spanish and the team

will hang out with the older guys and I

was left I think I was hanging out with

the guys friend of my team Cooper and

another way guy Bob Taylor those two I

I asked because I was frustrated times

could I go to bed crying no because the

game but because I was frustrated

because I couldn't speak the language I

couldn't speak English so therefore I

told those two teams of mine I said I

don't care how much you laugh and I

don't care how much you make fun of me

but please I give you the permission to

laugh and do that but teach me teach me

the right way by my surprise they never

laugh on me and they teach me by the end

of the year I was able to communicate

with my manager with my teammates and I

was the happiest man in baseball and

from that I would say that my career

took off and I was able to realize that

I can do something for others because I

knew

the language now I can relate with

someone that's going through the same

process that I have been but at the same

time there yes learning English is the

first thing that we should do and I did

and for that being a being American

I'm so proud and honored that are coming

from a small town beautiful town

beautiful country called Panama and live

with my family here and understand the

language being everything that we go

through I'm proud to be an American
