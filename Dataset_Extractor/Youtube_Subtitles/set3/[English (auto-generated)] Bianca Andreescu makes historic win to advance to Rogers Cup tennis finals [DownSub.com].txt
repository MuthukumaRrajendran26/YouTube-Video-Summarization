she's 19 years old and is clearly making

her mark is hundreds of fans file into

the grandstands to see Bianca undress

Canada's tennis rising star I love her

drive her tenacity and her passion it's

so inspiring she's awesome I even talked

to people in Europe yesterday and they

say be really got a good Canadian girl

game

people and I think that's what the game

needs today with Canadian flags in hand

fans were on the edge of their seats as

the Mississauga native secured her

position in Sunday's final of the Rogers

Cup beating out in two sets American

Sophia Kenan

she played great came through stuck it

all out and came out with a big win at

the end taking in a piece of history as

the teenager becomes the first Canadian

singles player in 50 years to make it to

the final since fate urban won the

tournament back in 1969 having the crowd

behind me this week I'm really thankful

for that because without their support I

don't think I would have been in the

finals this week proponent offered these

words following the match it was a good

battle you know I'm I knew it's gonna be

a tough one going you know she's a she's

the favorite here and yeah obviously the

crowd wasn't for me earlier this year

the Mississauga native reached a

career-high singles ranking of 22 as

ranked by the Women's Tennis Association

she's racking up the accolades and

Canadians couldn't be more proud when

you look at these kids that are 17 18 19

playing on the world platform and

excelling it makes us all proud to be

Canadian
