today we're here to announce that

criminal charges have been laid against

the driver of the West burrow station

fatal bus collision from January 11th of

this past year the charges that have

been laid are three counts of dangerous

driving causing death and 35 counts of

dangerous driving causing bodily harm

but I can tell you as we've gone through

this investigation

keeping the families up to date on

developments has been a key priority for

us and our investigative team I know

that this is likely difficult news for

many people to hear I want to express my

deepest condolences to all of those who

have their lives change on that tragic

day you were always top of mind as this

investigation progressed the Ottawa

police collision investigators worked

relentlessly to assess a mass of

information to determine the cause of

that tragic event on that day that

impacted our entire community our victim

crisis unit has worked every step of the

way with the community with our own

police community and first responder

community to make sure that the supports

were there for the people that needed it

as we progressed through this incident

as court proceedings are unfolding we're

mindful that the community and the

police continue to grieve about this

incident

so as I indicated it was a very complex

investigation that took time

one thing we knew was that this was a

very traumatic incident for our

community and our community and our

Police Service took that very seriously

so we led an exhaustive investigation

that included technical aspects that

included reconstruction that included as

I indicated interviewing of about a

hundred people hundred different people

some involved some witnesses and that

takes time and we knew that it was our

responsibility to do an absolutely

thorough job what that thoroughness did

is it allowed us to at this point be

able to release these charges and

present the person before courts within

I think the last week or so we did we

made a determination that we would be

ready to proceed with charges today no

sir it was completely to do with the

investigation we've been very fortunate

to work with the crown attorney's office

to tell go through all of the

information that we had

in relation to this investigation and

the determination that we've made in

conjunction with the crown attorney's

office is that the actions of the driver

that day did meet a criminal stress hold

and that's why those charges are in

front of you too as a result of our

thorough investigation it's been

determined that there is no criminal

liability by the city in terms of how it

contributed to this accident and in that

there will be no charges laid against

the city and there will be no more

further charges coming out of this

investigation
