you've likely heard it before the writ

has dropped but nothing is actually

being dropped the writ is just an order

being issued by the government which

officially begins an election before an

election in Canada a writ needs to be

issued for each riding Reds are sent to

returning officers by the chief

electoral officer after the Prime

Minister calls for an election the Reds

must be sent out at least 36 days before

Election Day the writs include the date

to enter candidate names for nomination

polling and advance polling dates a date

for an official vote count and a writ

return date once a Member of Parliament

is elected the returning officer fills

out their name on the back of the rib

and sends it back to the chief electoral

officer
