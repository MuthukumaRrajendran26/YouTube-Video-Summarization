[Applause]

thank you everybody thank you and

vice-president Mike Bettes thank you

very much incredible and hello to

Fayetteville it's great to be here in

North Carolina's ninth congressional

district with the hard-working Patriots

who believe in faith family God and

country thank you thank you

tomorrow you'll head to the polls to

elect a congressman who always puts

America first Dan Bishop I've just come

from a meeting with North Carolina

officials representing communities hit

by Hurricane Dorian and I express the

unwavering solidarity of the American

people we are behind you 100%

the prayers of our entire nation are

with the citizens of North Carolina

South Carolina Georgia Florida and

everyone else that was in the storm's

path and I will say I was called by the

government of the Bahamas and we're

helping with the bomb as they were hit

so hard

or hit so hard who would believe it we

pledged the full support of the federal

government through every step of the

rebuilding process and I will say North

Carolina in our country probably got hit

the hardest that was a little bit of a

surprise but I know one thing about

North Carolina you can take it and

you'll build it quickly and you'll build

it beautiful and you'll be back sooner

than anybody ever thought and it'll be

better than ever right no doubt about I

also want to give a special recognition

to the many non-governmental

organizations doing so much to help

people recover from durian in particular

Franklin Graham he's a wonderful guy

and he's got an organization Samaritan's

Purse based right here in North Carolina

and the work that Franklin is his family

and all of those that are with Franklin

Graham we want to thank them is special

great people great people Thank You

Franklin

thank you credible job he does such a

great job all over wherever there's a

problem you see Samaritans person

Franklin and his people we love the

people of this state and we will never

ever leave your side North Carolina will

truly recover so fast I know you people

so well let's not even talk about it

let's not even talk about it we're here

tonight to discuss the extraordinary

progress we're making as a nation and

how to ensure this amazing resurgence

keeps on going and going strong

in just over two years we've taken this

big beautiful ship and it's being turned

around very quickly nobody thought this

would happen you know we won the

greatest election certainly one of them

but maybe the greatest but we won one of

the greatest let's say won this way I

won't be criticized they'll say you know

George Washington had a great election -

the fake news right

[Applause]

but we won one of the greatest elections

in history and because of that and you

would be in big trouble if we didn't I

can tell you that you'd be instead of

going up we were heading in the wrong

direction we have the number one economy

anywhere in the world

and every time I meet a foreign leader

almost every time they say

congratulations on what you've done with

the economy I said I didn't do it I just

said a certain path the people of the

United States did it

number one anywhere in the world

and they tried to do the recession thing

you know they tried the Russia thing

that didn't work they tried many other

things I always say the media and their

partner the Democrats

[Applause]

I wouldn't mind fighting the Democrats

but we really have to look at it so to

sum it's the media and the Democrats

it's one and the same we're rebuilding

our military defending our sovereignty

and reclaiming our dignity as a nation

America is winning again and America is

respected again they respect America

by the way I have about like 10 women in

the front row and you come from North

Carolina and they travel all over the

place hold up your hands he's a great

women I see them so much and I must say

they have other things to do they look

rich as hell to me I don't know how many

is this how many rallies have you come

to they can't count they said all of

them except for two that's a lot of

rallies and it all emanates from this

area that's so great well at least you

won't have to travel so far for this one

right thank you very much for being here

we really appreciate it well we

appreciate it we appreciate it thank you

really incredible people but you know

we've created six million new jobs since

election day and I couldn't say that in

my initial rallies because nobody would

have believed it six million new jobs

more Americans are working today than

ever before in the history of our

country almost 160 million Americans

nobody would have thought that was

possible

we wouldn't have been able to say it

actually we've now had 13 straight

months of wage gains of at least 3% so

the people that work so hard you

remember I used to say during the

rallies before we won people worked two

jobs three jobs and they made less money

than they made 21 years before and now

wages are going up the economy is doing

great and jobs have never been better so

importantly more than seven million

Americans have been lifted off of food

stamps

nearly 600,000 Americans entered the

labor force last month alone think about

and the unemployment rate for

african-americans just reached another

brand-new yesterday

all-time low in the history of our

country

[Applause]

how do you lose that debate remember I

used to say what do you have to lose

well now you have the best unemployment

numbers employment and unemployment

numbers that you've ever had as

african-americans as asian-americans as

Hispanic Americans the best numbers

we've ever had

and by the way African American youth

unemployment has also reached the lowest

level ever recorded in history

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

and the labor force participation rate

for women is at the highest level now in

15 years

and soon will be 35 years and soon I

promise we'll probably end up being

better than ever I can tell you the

unemployment numbers for women are the

best they've been now in 72 years so I

always say kiddingly I'm sorry I didn't

make it historic but you know what it's

gonna be historic very soon

that'll be historic for us and here in

North Carolina over 230,000 more people

now have jobs and small business

formation has skyrocketed by more than

25 percent but the Radical Democrats

want to dismantle demolish and destroy

everything that you've gained and they

will do it and it won't take that long

and that's why we need Dan bishop and

Greg Murphy we need them we need them

going down to Congress and helping but

they can do it it's also why we need

four more years it has to see this like

a plant we've changed things right Keep

America great we've changed things but

it's got to grow it's got to develop

those roots and once it does it's going

to be very hard for them to destroy what

we've done very hard and that's really

what I I consider this election look we

had a very very special day in 2016 it

was a very special time

it's an incredible day an incredible

month an incredible year and I don't

know that you can ever compare anything

to it but I can say this 2020 is

essentially just as important because

they'll try and take it away whether it

has to do with religion our evangelicals

are here tonight and they're all

[Applause]

and what we've done for them and for

religion is so important you know the

other side I don't think they're big

believers and not big believers in

religion that I can tell you you listen

to some of them they're trying they're

trying to put out little statements

they're not working too well those

statements are a little bit sort of not

too good huh what is the word we want to

use here little now they're pushing a

little hard and it's not play it's not

working to stop the far-left you must

vote in tomorrow's special election so

important or get your votes in early I

think a lot of who voted early for Dan

Bishop good well that's good but the big

thing is tomorrow tomorrow's the

election and you'll get out to protect

your family you must defeat open borders

and you have a Democrat named Dan

McReady and

he wants open borders he wants sanctuary

said he's not going to protect your

Second Amendment

he's doing nothing on you SEC you know

North Carolina is a very big Second

Amendment

and Dan bishop Gregg Murphy these guys

they're going to protect your Second

Amendment but one of the biggest issues

in this election is in fact sanctuary

cities MacCready supports sanctuary city

policies that force prisons and jails to

release criminal aliens directly into

your neighborhoods get out go ahead go

into the neighborhood go into what's

your neighborhood where do you live

Rutherford County okay so how do you

feel about having them release hardened

horrible criminals into Rutherford

County I don't think so

[Applause]

but your whole state it's honestly can I

be honest it's crazy what's happening

this whole thing with sanctuary cities

and you go to California which is so

many sanctuary cities they don't know

what's happening out there you have

people that want to get rid of those

sanctuary cities they just aren't able

to do it with the people that get

elected a lot of illegal voting going on

out there by the way a lot of illegal

voting in August McCready said it was

quote the right call to set illegal

alien criminals loose in the great state

I'm using the words great state he

doesn't of North Carolina with the

support and encouragement of McCready

sanctuary jurisdictions in North

Carolina have released thousands of

dangerous criminal aliens into your

communities and you see it music

the charges against these freed

criminals include sexual assault robbery

drug crimes kidnapping and homicide

murder why would you do it why would you

do it what is it explain it

just recently Mecklenburg County set

free an illegal alien charged with first

degree rape and crimes against the child

support for sanctuary cities is

disloyalty to American citizens and

McCready wants sanctuary cities with all

of their protections for people that are

serious criminals tomorrow is your

chance to send a clear message to the

America hating left and that's got to be

and by the way we're building that wall

and it's going up very big

and you think it's easy to get money

when you have the entire Democrat Party

and they control the house so we want to

change that we want to flip the house

we'll get so much

it'll be amazing what we can do for our

country we don't want dangerous criminal

aliens roaming free in North Carolina we

want to take care of it this state

should be a sanctuary for law-abiding

Americans not for criminal Ehle our

great Republican candidate Dan Bishop

will fight with everything he has to

stop sanctuary cities and defend the

people of this great state dan come on

up then bishop everyone get out and vote

come on up there

[Applause]

Cavanaugh received and everybody

love the country they love you diamonds

and self

[Applause]

they are incredible incredible people

thank you very much thank you what a job

and they're doing very well I have to

tell you that our shared Republican

agenda is pro-worker Pro jobs pro-family

pro-growth and 100% pro-american

[Applause]

and by the way so is Doug Collins and so

is John Ratliff thank you fellas thank

you

two incredible fighters also for decades

our leaders put global interests and

special interests ahead of your

interests you know that better than

anybody and this state knows it better

than anybody they traded away your

factory sold your future squandered your

tax dollars sacrifice your security and

bobbed us down in one foreign debacle

after another but all of that is changed

we're respected again they're all saying

oh gee I hope he doesn't do this or that

they've taken advantage of us for years

and I have to say sadly in many cases

it's our allies that took the greatest

advantage of this country but now you

finally have a president who understands

that I'm not supposed to be the

president of the world I'm supposed to

be the president of the United States

[Applause]

to bring back our jobs from other

countries we passed the largest package

of tax cuts and reforms in American

history we've cut a record number of

job-killing regulations no president no

matter how long they serve has gotten

anywhere even close to what we've done

with regulations and that's one of the

reasons their economy is so good and we

have tremendous potential upward and

China wants to talk they want to talk

China's lost three million jobs

thousands of companies are leaving China

the supply chain is crumbling because

they can't pay the tariffs and our

country has taken over things that you

would have never thought as an example

hundreds of billions of dollars have

been and are coming into our country in

the form of tariffs and China is eating

the cost which the fake news doesn't

want to tell you

[Applause]

and out of the tens of billions of

dollars that we've taken in because of

the fact that our great American patriot

farmers have been targeted by China

they've been targeted because they know

the farmers like Trump

I love the farmers so they targeted the

farmers and I said to sonny perdue

Secretary of Agriculture Sonny how much

was it last year and the year before or

tell me it was twelve billion dollars

and was sixteen billion dollars and out

of the tariffs that we've taken in we

gave to our farmers for distribution

hopefully very good distribution

hopefully very even distribution we've

given them twenty eight billion dollars

so that their home so that their home

nobody would ever do that

nobody would ever do that I can tell you

that right now and our farmers know we

have to fight I see it all the time

where some of the networks that are

crazy they have a group of farmers in

some cases they have groups of women

they say what do you think of President

Trump we like them a lot well with them

all the way and they want to turn off

the cameras they go crazy but with the

farmers you know that you ever see that

the ten women what do you think of

President Trump we love them

[Applause]

what would I like to put you on

television should not tell you right

back

and they can't turn off those cameras

fast enough but they say to the farmers

you voted for President Trump are you

happy and every one of them said he did

things that nobody has ever done before

who would think of getting 12 billion

plus 16 billion

twenty eight billion dollars because

they've been targeted that's the amount

I asked Sonny I said Sonny what's the

amount they took out of our farmers and

with 16 billion in the year before 12

and I said Sonny we got to make that up

and we made it up who would do that

nobody would do that first of all nobody

else ever had tens of billions of

dollars pouring in from China because

it's always been the other way around

China has taken advantage of our country

for decades decades and I guarantee you

one thing none of these Democrats

whether it's Pocahontas or sleepy Joe

none of them would be able to do a thing

about it

and nobody would ever think of helping

the farmers who have been targeted by

China China made 500 billion dollars

over the last number of years on a

yearly basis they steal our intellectual

property so many other things so now

it's just different

and now it's working the other way and

tariffs are a beautiful thing when you

know how to use them they're a beautiful

thing

[Music]

and I want China to do well and I hope

they do well but they've had now the

worst year in 57 years I wonder why I

wonder why and hopefully it all work out

we'll see we're gonna be talking next

week we're talking now are they going to

be coming to the United States in two or

three weeks and we'll see what happens

but unless we're going to make a good

deal or a fair deal for our country

let's face it we cannot go back to a

situation we're giving hundreds of

billions of dollars to China becomes

standard fair not gonna happen we can't

do it and we have many other countries

also but we'll worry about them a little

bit later plenty of others plenty of

others they've taken advantage of our

country like you wouldn't believe and

I've been saying this for many years I

was saying this when I was a private

citizen they take our jobs they make our

product they sell the product into our

country with no tax no nothing so we end

up with closed factories no jobs no

taxes no nothing and these other

countries gained as an example Mexico I

must say they've really helped us at the

border the Democrats will not do

anything about these horrible open

loopholes which would be so good

so we're doing it a different way and

Mexico is now patrolling with 27,000

troops they never had two troops to it

our border and you saw the numbers today

we're down approximately 57% but our

country could fix it so easy if the

Democrats would sit with me for 15

minutes but they don't want to do that

because they want to have open borders

they want to have drugs pouring into our

country you have to have a wall and you

have to stop it and when you look at

what's happening with human trafficking

and it's mostly women they traffic in

women and they pour through our borders

well every inch of wall that we put up

is vital and were putting up miles and

miles and we intend by next year at the

end of the year to have anywhere between

400 and 500 miles of wall built and this

is serious wall this is the real deal

serious wall

and I want to thank our new Secretary of

Defense

Marv Kasper for the job he's done and he

views it really as a national security

threat and you have to what can be much

more threatening than people that want

to pour across our borders and we have

the worst laws we have the weakest laws

in the history of any country you can't

do anything to stop them you have a

program catch and release you catch them

and then you have to release them and

they're supposed to come back to court

in the next three four five six years

and nobody shows up and the Democrats

don't want to fix it so we're stopping

them so we don't even have to worry

about Court

we ended the last administration's cruel

war on American energy the United States

is now the number one producer of oil

and natural gas anywhere in the world

and for all of these crazy people but

they're not so crazy they know what

they're doing they talk about Russia

Russia Russia Russia is not too happy

about that did a primary source of

income is oil and gas and now we're

bigger than Russia bigger than Saudi

Arabia we're bigger than everybody and

we're doing great so they're not exactly

happy the Russian hopes was a pure hoax

you saw that with call me the other day

yet every leading Democrat running for

president pledges to ban the energy that

drives our economy and wage and under if

you look at what's going on your way of

life is under assault by these people I

mean I go out and sometimes I get these

huge audiences and I wish we could have

gotten a larger arena than this we tried

I was even willing to stand out in the

rain and get my hair soaking wet but

they said it was a little bit out of

your district and I said I don't know if

it looks good being out of your district

but I was willing to do it I would have

taken it I would have been very proud to

have done it it would have shown it's my

real hair at least there wouldn't be

pretty

where's my hair may not be great but I

will say it's better than most of my

friends who are the same age a lot

better

a lot but I do you know we had a

different location as you all know and

we said let's do this one it's bigger

and we put screens outside for all of

the people we have screens and

loudspeakers and everything it's really

amazing what's going on out there but

after years of building up other

countries we are finally building up our

country that's the bottom line

and the last administration with Biden

and Obama at the helm

they tried to ram through one of the

worst trade deals ever negotiated the

trans-pacific partnership you could have

kissed many of your industries goodbye

TPP would have gutted the American auto

industry it would have been even worse

than NAFTA and we know how bad NAFTA was

all you have to do is even to this day

look around at all those empty plants

where people move down and companies

move down to Mexico not under the US MCA

we got to get Nancy Pelosi to put it up

for a vote

make it bipartisan she'll have

tremendous Democrat support the farmers

wanted the union's wanted the

manufacturers want it and by the way

600,000 manufacturing jobs in this

country remember you would need a magic

wand you can't do that anymore well we

do but we've got to get us MCA put up

for a vote by the Democrats but in my

first week in office I proudly withdrew

from that job destroying TPP catastrophe

and we're replacing one of the worst

trade deals ever made by any country you

can go back as far as you want NAFTA the

disaster of NAFTA so whatever you do

start talking to you people we need a

vote on the US MCA that's United States

Mexico and Canada and they've already

voted they want it and we want it and

it's great for the farmers it's great

for everybody

we're also aggressively combating a

problem that you have in North Carolina

problem that we have in almost all

states the opioid epidemic last year we

saw the first nationwide decline in drug

overdose deaths in nearly 31 years and

at the center of the American drug

crisis is the border crisis criminal

cartels smuggle vast quantities of

lethal narcotics across our southern

border including heroin meth cocaine and

fentanyl a hundred thousand people a

year die from what comes across our

southern border and we can't get the

Democrats to help us in sealing it even

tighter we gotta get them we gotta get

him we gotta get them so if you want to

stop with the drug smugglers the human

traffickers the vicious ms-13 gang

members are by the way thank you to ice

these people go into those

[Applause]

they go into those nests we call them

nests these are vicious vicious people

we go into the nest with our ice people

and you know for them it's another day

at the office there aren't too many

people in this room that want to do it

for a living let me see that guy could

maybe him maybe her right maybe her but

it's a rough job and they get so little

praise for the job they do so dangerous

these are these are many killers in

those gangs and we're taking them out of

our country by the thousands ms-13 and

as you know Democrats even want to give

free health care to illegal immigrants

as long as I'm your president I will

never ever let them occur at stake away

your healthcare and give it away free to

people that have entered our country

illegally we can't do that it's a

tremendous incentive to come in

Democrats also want to bring in

unlimited numbers of foreign refugees

from overseas all at the expense of

supporting their own communities

Republicans no matter what you do where

you are we want people to obey our laws

we want people that are going to help

our country the Democrat Party has never

been farther outside of the mainstream

every major Democrat running for

president supports a massive government

takeover of health care that would raid

Medicare force private doctors out of

medicine and lead to the rationing of

life-saving treatments and you know

they're going to take away your private

health care your private insurance 180

million people will lose with what they

want to do it's a disaster

you know it's like did you ever really

sort of feel where you don't even have

to treat people nicely you don't have

any choice you'll have to vote for me I

can leave right now I can say North

Carolina I've had it with you I'm

leaving right now

and you know what you got to go out and

vote what are you gonna do put one of

these crazy people running our country

again

but it's never been so far left I told

the story the other day about a

businessman I saw one of the biggest in

the country you probably know his name

one of the biggest he's hated me for 20

years that I've hated him also okay

now they're gonna go out tomorrow

breaking news Donald Trump hates people

and you were sort of right about that I

never liked this guy and I see him in

the White House and I say what are you

doing here and he goes mr. president see

now he calls me mr. president he used to

call me something else

mr. president I'm fighting for your

victory I said you gotta be kidding he

goes honestly you're doing a great job

but also if this radical left gets in

they're gonna take away everything and

they're gonna destroy our country and

for the first time I like this guy

[Applause]

my administration is defending your

right to chitters the plan and the

doctor that is best for you remember

President Obama 28 times

remember 28 times they counted them and

there's much more than that I would

imagine that you can choose your plan

you can choose your doctor it didn't

work out that way did it Obamacare and

we're keeping Obamacare alive we got rid

of the individual mandate the worst part

of Obamacare

we're keeping it and running it as well

as it can but the premiums are too high

the deductibles are through the roof

it's ridiculous and we're coming up with

Lindsey Graham and all of the folks were

coming up with a great health care plan

that if we take back the house that's

why Dan and Greg if we take back the

house if we keep the Senate maybe even

increase it a little bit wouldn't be bad

and on the assumption we keep the

presidency you're gonna have great

health

[Applause]

thank you we almost had it

we had a man campaigning for eight years

to knock out Obamacare when he voted it

didn't work out that way did it we had

it we would have had it but we're gonna

end up actually with a better plan

sometimes through adversity things work

out better we're gonna end up with a

better plan you watch will always

protect patients with pre-existing

conditions also always yep my work our

ambitious campaign to reduce the price

of prescription drugs has produced the

largest decline in drug prices in more

than 51 years virtually every top

Democrat also now supports

late term abortion

[Applause]

ripping baby straight from the mother's

womb right up to the moment of birth and

if you look at Virginia the governor of

Virginia he was even talking about

essentially you would say an execution

he was talking after the baby is born

the doctor will talk to the mother and

they'll make a decision as to whether or

not that baby lives this is a radical

Democrat idea

and that's why I've asked Congress to

prohibit extreme late term abortion

because Republicans believe that every

child is a sacred gift from God

[Applause]

Democrats are now the party of high

taxes high crime open borders late term

abortion and socialism they're

socialists the Republican Party is the

party of the American worker the

American family and the American Dream

everyday we're making good on the motto

promises made promises kept in fact we

are keeping even more promises by far

than we made or then we promise so many

more so many more so many more you know

what we did with respect to people that

are very sick or terminally ill right

right to try school I love the name

right to try we have some of the

greatest doctors in the world labs in

the world hospitals in the world and we

have incredible medicine that's

prohibited from being used until it gets

approval and sometimes that approval can

take many years and I said wait a minute

if a person is sick and they've been

trying to get this for forty-five years

instead of a person sick and maybe

terminally ill why aren't we letting

them try this new technology and so many

things are happening and we did right to

try and it wasn't easy but I was helped

by Lindsey and a lot of great people a

lot of great people

[Applause]

all of them helped mark help so much all

of them helped Greg we have had

tremendous success we had so many people

wanting to help but it was complicated

believe it or not because the country

didn't want the liability I said you

know what you do you draw up an

agreement taking away the liability he

said that's a good idea the insurance

companies and the drug companies were

very unsure there's been going on for

many years I got it done the results

have been unbelievable right to try

things that we never even talked about

we're getting done and you know maybe

one of the biggest things is within

about a month we'll have close to 180

federal judges including Appellate

Division judges

including two great new Supreme Court

justices justice Neil corsets and

justice Brett Kavanaugh who they put

through hell we passed something that

they've wanted to do for half a century

we passed v a choice so when you're

great when you're great and honored

veterans are waiting in line for three

weeks four weeks five days ten days two

months they go to a private doctor we

pay for the bill and they get themselves

taking care of instead of dying which

was happening and we also passed VA

accountability on behalf of our great

veterans that means when they treat our

veterans badly and they wouldn't have

done it in prime time I can tell you but

when they treat our sick and troubled

veterans badly we can say you're fired

get there

it's called va accountability that's

another one they've been trying and in

all fairness the unions made it very

tough civil service made it like almost

impossible

everyone said you'll never get it done

we got it done I want to thank the

Republican Senate I want to thank some

incredible people in the House of

Representatives and Kevin I want to

thank you because that was a great job

you did on that one Kevin McCarthy we've

achieved record funding for the US

military 700 billion dollars last year

716 billion dollars this year 738

billion dollars and you know I'm a big

believer in budgets but we had no choice

we had to rebuild our military with all

that's going on today with China with

Russia with radical Islam with

everything that's happening we had to do

something and you know budgets are fine

I love budgets and we'll get to that

don't worry about it but we had a

rebuild our military was totally

depleted it was totally depleted and now

we have beautiful new f-35 Zef 18

new ships new missiles new rockets we

have new everything I came back with

Admiral Brown the United States Coast

Guard and some of the other folks and

they were saying that the new Coast

Guard cutters how good a job has the

Coast Guard done during these hurricanes

and I said Admiral how good are the new

Coast Guard cutters he said they're the

finest in the world sir we have to find

and they had old broken equipment that

they had to keep going on her shoestring

they have brand-new Coast Guard cutters

we had to do it we had to do it there's

always time for the other but we had to

do it we've rebuilt our military we've

taken care of the great people that work

in our military we gave them a raise a

beautiful raise they were so entitled to

[Applause]

and I also got other NATO members to pay

an additional 100 billion dollars over

the last year and a half that they

weren't paying they were delinquent

we're supposed to protect them and they

don't pay I'd say he can't do that you

can't do that you got to pay NATO

now we're finally making immensely

wealthy countries pay the cost of their

defence we're negotiating with a lot of

them think of it we have these immensely

wealthy countries and they're paying for

a fraction of our costs to defend them

how did that happen and you know what

the biggest excuse is when I got home

and I'll say King you got a pay or mr.

prime minister you got a pay or mr.

president you got a pay you know it's

costing us billions of dollars to

protect these wealth you know their

biggest thing is cuz I can't understand

how we did this for so many years

decades decades you have been defending

all of some I won't mention names

because I don't want to embarrass

anybody

forget it some of the wealthiest

countries and there were and when I say

king president Prime Minister Queen no

matter what I say you know what they say

but nobody's ever asked us to do that

before that's the only excuse because I

say to them why would we do this why are

we defending you you're immensely

wealthy you compete with us on trade we

have lousy trade deals that we're

renegotiating many of them and

ultimately all of them why are we

protecting you mr. president

well well I don't know I don't know but

you know what their answer is because

you've always done it that's not a great

answer so we're taking in billions and

billions but I got a hundred billion

dollars and the Secretary General of

NATO Sultan Berg is my biggest fan he

said until President Trump you had to

see the day no cost of spending was

going like this and ours was going like

this we were defending many countries

that treated us very badly on traded

very unfairly we were defending them and

now it's changing around 100 billion

dollars they're not happy and then I

read what her Obama is more popular in

Germany than Trump he's gotta be I'm

making people pay their bills he's got

to be you know the day that I'm more

popular than him I'm not doing my job

the big story they like him more in

Europe than they like Trump I think they

should hundred billion dollars more

they're paying to protect America's

security I would through the United

States from the horrible one-sided Iran

nuclear deal

[Applause]

we paid them a hundred and fifty billion

dollars for that piece of work I

withdrew it and we put sanctions all

over the place and they're a much

different country and let's see what

happens but I can tell you that like to

get back to business because they're not

doing very well when I came into office

Iran was a real terror 18 sites of

confliction they were behind every one

of them in the Middle East and who knows

could have been elsewhere and I said

we're not going to do it 150 billion

dollars

President Obama paid and one point eight

billion in cash who ever saw a million

dollars filed up as a promotion in

hundred-dollar bills it's a lot it's a

big now take a million dollars and make

it 1.8 billion dollars in cash I'm

actually more impressed with that number

than 150 billion dollars you want to

know the truth 1.8 billion dollars in

cash so we got taken to the cleaners so

I terminated the deal

and I recognize Israel's to capital and

opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem

which every president said there were

and I also approved for Israel the Golan

Heights and if you really think about it

I said to people what's more important

the Golan Heights or the capital of

Jerusalem by moving our embassy there he

said neither sir what you've done in

Iran is more important than both of my

said you know I guess you're right when

you think about it so we've done a good

job all of us together as a movement

we've done a great job for Israel for

years you watch as your politicians

apologize for America now you have a

president who is standing up for America

and we are standing up for the people of

North Carolina

[Music]

you must never forget that the 2020

election is about one thing Younes true

not about me it's about you it's about

your family your future and the fate of

your country that's what we did in 2016

they came from the hills and the valleys

they came from the cities they came from

all over the place and people were

saying these fakers back there that was

saying what the hell is happening but I

knew it was going to happen because we'd

go out and would see these rallies the

likes of which nobody has ever seen

before ever ever ever in politics ever

in politics a vote for any Democrat in

2020 and a vote for any Democrat

tomorrow in North Carolina is a vote for

the rise of radical socialism and the

destruction of the American Dream we are

entering this campaign with the best

record the best results the best agenda

and the only positive vision for the

people of North Carolina and I've said

it and I say it loudly and proudly I

don't believe there's been any precedent

or any administration that has done more

in two-and-a-half years then we have as

it grew up then we

when you add it all up nobody's done

what we have our first task is the giant

victory tomorrow right here in the great

state of North Carolina with your

support tomorrow we take the first steps

to firing speaker Pelosi and winning

back the house in 2012

we need everybody to get your friends

get your family get your neighbors and

get out and vote for Dan Bishop and get

out and vote for Greg

Murphy you got to get out tomorrow and

vote together we will lift millions more

from our horrible horrible situations

that have developed over the years look

at what's happening to Democrat run

cities every single one of them we're

going to lift millions more of our

citizens from welfare to work dependence

to independence and poverty to

prosperity with your help we will elect

more republicans to Congress to create a

safe modern fair and lawful system of

immigration we will enact trade deals

that result in more products proudly

stamped with the four beautiful words

made in the USA

boom made in the USA if you want made in

America I don't care what do you like

better

made in America or made in the USA go

ahead

wait ready we'll go made in America then

made in the USA what do you like better

made in America made in the USA

okay so I think we know that answer so

in 2016 we had in my opinion the

greatest phrase in the history of

politics make America great again

right now we're within moments hopefully

of having despite what you heard a few

weeks ago maybe we're heading or they go

like please please let that be recession

please they're willing to give up their

results because they think it'll help

them win the election they're not gonna

win the election

don't forget we're doing this and still

fighting the unfairness of China and

other countries or trade what happens

when that gets fixed and other things

get fixed where we're setting new

records and we're fighting trade deals

that were fighting military deals that

are unfair to our country think what

happens when it all gets fixed we have

ourselves a country that's going to be

so strong but we had a phrase make right

make America great again the best I

think it was maybe the greatest 2016 but

we've done a lot and now they're very

close to setting a new I think it's the

100 an 18th time that we will have set a

new record with the stock market right

many many times many many times I can't

be sure that media but it's a lot okay I

always have to preface it because

they'll do headlines headlines chip

didn't tell the truth or they love it so

I always I've gotten extremely cautious

so we have the greatest phrase of all

time I think even the fake news media

would agree make America great again

mega mega country make America great

again

now now we've largely we still have a

year and a half a little bit less can

you believe it like can you believe it I

stood in the White House with the first

lady that first night and I said wow

look at this that's the bedroom of

Abraham Lincoln you have to see this

it's so perfectly done and so the way it

was that's the bedroom of the great Abe

Lincoln I mean honey can you believe

this that was the first night and now in

less than a year and a half the first

term will be over think of that I

announced today that we got the soccer

world cup that's a big thing who else is

going to do it but it's we've got a

problem it's in 2026 Jionni Infante who

was a great guy and we announced it in

front of the press and 2026 and I said

well wait a minute under the normal

rules I'll be out in 2024 so we may have

to go for an extra term

[Applause]

oh they're going crazy they're going

crazy tomorrow you're gonna see

headlines jump once an extra term I told

you I told him he wants it he wants an

extra term ladies and gentlemen we told

you we told you he's a dictator we told

you now now I'm only kidding I'm all

okay

but we actually have the World Cup it's

the biggest sporting event in the world

and we got it and that's great we're

working it also with Mexico Canada

giving them some of the games we're

gonna have a great relationship with the

World Cup it's a big deal really great

Bob Kraft helped me New England Patriots

people great Tom Brady had a pretty good

game the other night

[Applause]

and how good a coach whether you like it

or not I know you'd North Carolina but

how good a coach in all fairness right

is coach Belichick how good how good is

he

how goodness I know you want to be cool

but it's pretty good right we have to

appreciate genius we all like genius but

we're going to achieve new breakthroughs

in science and medicine

finding new cures for childhood cancer

and ending within ten years the AIDS

epidemic in America that shocking to

hear that but we can do that we're going

to do that definitely credible the

strides that we've been we will defeat

the Democrat effort to drive up the

costs of houses cars health care and

education by liberating Americans from

their endless push for job-killing

soul-crushing Washington regulations as

an example we're trying to get the car

companies gonna give them a little bit

of extra energy and they'll be able to

build a car that consumers can buy which

will be better than the car they make

today and you'll save three thousand

five hundred dollars think of that it'll

be safer it'll be better you get to save

three thousand five hundred dollars

it'll be less costly and we're gonna try

and get that done and then they were

forcing you to buy light bulbs of course

the fortune so I signed something a

couple of days ago that gives you the

right to continue to use the

incandescent light and I don't know

about you much less exposure I don't

know about you but I don't know I'm not

a vain person I know I have no vain

people especially these incredible

ladies in the front but I look better

under an incandescent light than these

crazy lights that are beaming

but you know somebody told me that as

you know they're much more expensive

bulbs and for what you say but they said

that if a bulb breaks it's considered

almost like a waste site it's a very big

thing bulbs the new bulbs they're very

dangerous with all of the gases at all

and I said well what's the point what

are you saying well we're saying if we

continue that production they can buy

whatever they want to buy but you're

going to save a tremendous amount of

money and you're gonna have a light

that's better

and there is a big danger in fact they

have labels don't break this bulb what

are you gonna do you're gonna throw it

away I promise I won't break it on the

new one so you're gonna hopefully buy

the new ones but you can buy the old

ones too and you can save a lot of money

and you can even look better we will

defend privacy free speech free assembly

religious liberty and the right to keep

and bear arms

[Applause]

above all we will never stop fighting

for the values that bind us together as

one America will be one united nation we

support protect and defend the

Constitution of the United States we

stand with the incredible heroes of the

law enforcement Thank You Laura we

believe in the dignity of work and the

sanctity of life we believe that faith

and family not government and

bureaucracy are the true American Way

like you we believe that children should

be taught to love our country honor our

history and to always respect our great

American flag

and we will live by the words of our

national motto In God We Trust it'll

stay there we stand on the shoulders of

American patriots who crossed the oceans

settle the continent tamed the

wilderness revolutionized industry

pioneered science won two World Wars

defeated fascism and communism put a man

on the moon and built the most

exceptional country in the history of

the world we are great Americans and the

future belongs to us the future belongs

to you with your help your devotion and

your drive we are going to keep on

working we are going to keep on fighting

I'd like to find a little bit less but

these people they just don't stop they

just keep coming at you in waves they

are unfortunately not the best people

and we are going to keep on winning

winning winning we're gonna keep on way

we are one movement one people one

family and one glorious nation under God

America is thriving like never before we

may have right now the greatest economy

in the history of our nation and ladies

and gentlemen of North Carolina the best

is yet to come

together we will make America wealthy
