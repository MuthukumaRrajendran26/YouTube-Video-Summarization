you've probably heard the term

gerrymandering it's when political

parties intentionally manipulate

electoral districts in their favor it's

common practice in the US but does it

happen in Canada and for that matter how

are canadian districts determined we

really don't have the same

gerrymandering problem that they have in

the United States one reason is that

electoral districts in the United States

are largely drawn up by state

legislatures by politicians in Canada

redistricting happens as soon as

possible after the ten year census the

last redistricting was completed two

years after the 2011 census those new

boundaries were in place for the 2015

federal election the work of determining

federal ridings is done by ten

independent commissions one for each

province the members are appointed and

can't be politicians or belong to the

Civil Service this is Pauline Benj

she teaches Canadian politics and

elections at the University of Toronto

the appointment process I would say is

opaque so we don't know what the

person's qualifications are or whether

they have even any party affiliation

there is no Commission for the Yukon

Northwest Territories or Nunavut since

each territory has only a single

electoral district at the moment there

are 338 Federal ridings as the most

populous province Ontario holds the

largest number of ridings commissioners

determine what size a riding should be

by divvying up the population into equal

sized chunks that number is the

electoral quotient the number of voters

in each riding if all ridings are of

equal size as of the last redistricting

that number was 111 thousand one hundred

and sixty six there are also some

special rules in place first each

province has to have at least as many

seats in the house as it has in the

Senate so what happens with Prince

Edward Island it's got four seats in the

Senate and so no matter what Prince

Edward Island is getting four seats in

the House of Commons

remember Pei is entire population is is

about the quotient of a hundred and

eleven thousand people second each

province has to have at least as many

seats in the house as it had in 1985

those rules plus the rapid population

growth in the West compared to Atlantic

Canada mean politicians need more votes

to win a seat in Western Canada the

situation of under-representation of

Alberta particularly is has been a long

festering sore if it has electoral

districts running well over a hundred

thousand and some provinces have an

average electoral district number of

about 75,000 it's hard to disagree that

Alberta has a legitimate beef if it

feels like certain politicians have a

leg up in certain ridings

it's because of something called

community of interest which groups

together like minded voters many

Canadians still do have questions about

whether is there is fudging of the

electoral districts and the answer is

yeah there is some reason for that

because the Electoral Commission of the

province can decide not just based on

change of population but also what is

termed community of interest let's say

there are five or ten streets very

closely packed and those people consider

themselves a community call it bluer

village blur west village

then there's then there needs to be a

good reason to break that up the next

ten years census is due in May 2021

after that it's back to the drawing

board
