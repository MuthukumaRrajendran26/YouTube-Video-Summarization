the Canadian federal election is

officially underway during the 40-day

campaign leaders will cover a lot of

issues as they attempt to win over

Canadians the economy will be a big one

here are five economic issues will

likely hear about number one climate

change and the economy expect each party

to present detailed plans on how to deal

with the environment the environment is

something that we call a valence issue

which means that everybody wants it to

be good and strong and so where the

disagreement is and help us to achieve

that and so on both of those issues the

question for voters will be which party

is actually most credible to act on

these particular issues the Liberals

will look to build their carbon pricing

plan whereas sheers Conservatives want

to eliminate the carbon tax number two

pipelines and Alberta

voters in Alberta looking to help get

more oil to global markets will be

watching parties closely on the issue of

pipelines and all parties will be vocal

on their plans what say the Liberals

need to do is to say that there are

credible actors on the economy and

credible actors on the environment and

that's a bit of a difficult needle to

thread number three jobs unemployment

across the country is at a record low

which is a plus for the Liberals what we

know what economic voting is that when

the economy is good the incumbent is

rewarded when the economy is bad the

incumbent is punished and everything we

see about the Canadian economy at this

moment suggests that the economy is

actually quite good the rest of the

parties are touting that things could be

better the Conservatives are promising

to lower taxes and the NDP is pledging

300,000 new jobs number for child care

the NDP has promised to invest a billion

dollars in affordable childcare in 2020

with plans to grow that investment

annually the Liberals announced the

maximum childcare benefit will increase

to six thousand six hundred and thirty

nine dollars for each child under the

age of six the Conservatives say they

will make maternity and paternity

benefits tax-free providing a non

refundable tax credit of 15 percent

number five cell phones internet and

mobile bills will be a popular topic as

well this election so far the Green

Party has pledged to mandate affordable

cell phone plans

the NDP says they will impose a price

cap on monthly bills and the Liberals

are also proposing either a cap or

requiring service providers to offer

mobile virtual network operators
