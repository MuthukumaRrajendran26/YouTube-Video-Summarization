a to Daryl from if sews because he's

kind of got his finger on the pulse of

what Canadians are thinking and feeling

as much as anybody in this country

poling of course doesn't tell a whole

story but it gives us a bit of a

snapshot of where people are at and what

issues are important they're all in in

the work that you've been doing in the

lead-up to this campaign what issues

have risen to the top for Canadians

there's been five that say people say

are the most important issues number one

is health care probably won't play a big

role in the campaign number two is

affordability which all of the parties

are talking about right now

number three relates to taxes which is

really a subset of issue number two

social inequality is a big issue in the

minds of the public so progressive

voters will be very interested in

hearing party answers on that and

interestingly enough given the focus of

some of the advertising we looked at

climate change is number five climate

change it could that be the sleeper of

this campaign for a lot of people it is

the dominant issue it is the only issue

for someone like Elizabeth May and the

Green Party but could it rise from where

you're finding it at number five to too

much more prominent in this campaign

well it depends on whether the parties

want to talk about it interestingly

enough prior to us and sea level and and

some of the things that have happened

over the last couple of months I was

anticipating that it would be a pretty

big issue you've got one side of the

equation the progressive side that wants

to talk about the carbon and you've got

the Conservatives on the other side that

want to talk about the tax and they

really wanted to have that fight but

what's it seems to have petered out a

little bit on in the run-up to the

election now given where the Green Party

is going with with their position and

giving where the NDP is going in order

to be able to attack the progressive

side of the Trudeau agenda you might see

it raise its prominence through the

course of the election campaign

what about attitudes towards politics

and politicians generally all the

parties have variations on the theme of

we're in this for the people which seems

to be a deliberate sort of anti elite

message why is that what is it that

they're tapping into once it's a

phenomena that we see worldwide

in which there's a whole group of the

population that believes that the

economy is rigged it's working on behalf

of a very exclusive group of the

population that decisions get made and

the public really doesn't understand why

they're being made or why they're in

their interests and they've decided to

couch it in these terms of the people

versus everybody
