so it's been about four days since their

last sighting these are two apparently

very close friends who I've been charged

with or being charged with murder

possibly a triple homicide they know

into there a long time at this point of

course they want to stay off the radar

they're hiding somewhere I doubt very

much a hiding in plain sight in other

words they're not going to be in Calgary

or Edmonton Alberta mixing with a

population they're hiding somewhere

probably in a barn or if you know an

abandoned cabin or in an abandoned

vehicle somewhere where they won't be

seen but that can't last very long

because they have to have access to food

resources money and they'll also need

access to social media because that's

something that's very very important to

people of that age group and so that

will that will also drive them to get

into an area where it's populated where

they can you can get connected to the

Internet I have a certain level of

survival skills that can help them but

they won't stay there very long

I suspect after as many days you know

probably going to find a shelter where

they can be inside you're probably

already doing that what they're

interested in doing is not being caught

and they're trying to figure out the

next move the safest move for them now

this can go different ways you know the

law enforcement has been in contact with

their parents they've been they've been

developing profiles of these two young

men not just about their past and their

troubled past and their their problems

in in school in high school and so on

but also you know who's the strongest of

the two and who's the leader who might

be the leader of the group one of the

whether their strengths and what are the

weaknesses if they get to a point where

there's gonna be a negotiation they'll

be able to negotiate on stronger basis

and our CP is very good during this so

that I am sure that they're developing

that and you also want make sure that

the parents are cooperating in case

these young men reach out to their

parents you could go a variety of ways I

mean you you could have you might get

tired of being on the run and just turn

themselves in there Mike they might just

walk into some stranger's home and say

hey were that were the guys please call

the police but we want to turn ourselves

in it could go that way it could go did

they call the place and they meet

somewhere or they could be as rude out

well even though they're close friends

will time make a difference and I

believe it will I I think that you know

they're different personalities even

though they have a lot in common

they have different strange different

weaknesses and I think that one will

probably dominate the other a little bit

or not physically but in terms of

attitude and the ability to manipulate

the other a little bit I suspect that

they all stay together as long as they

can if not all the way through this so I

would always encourage public to

participate in looking but if they see

anything strange that they report it I

know it creates a lot of miss leaves but

it's also important if you know in order

to save lives
