that as Prime Minister I will make e.i

maternity leave benefits tax-free when a

new mom goes on mat leave often they're

already giving up up to 45% of their

salary and then the government comes

along at the end of that and taxes some

of it back so the government shouldn't

tax parents for the time they take to

care for and bond with their new child

when they're already making such a huge

sacrifice so a new conservative

government will provide a non refundable

tax credit of 15% for any income earned

under the e.i maternity and parental

benefit programs so someone making

around $50,000 who goes on AI maternity

leave benefits would save around $4,000

directly in their pocket to help pay for

all the new costs that come with having

a new child

well I wouldn't lift a finger to try to

get jihadi jack back to Canada he's in

prison now that's where he should stay

that's where he should remain Justin

Trudeau's position on this is very well

known he has indicated that returning

Isis fighters can be rehabilitated and

should take poetry lessons we believe

they should be held accountable for

their horrific crimes we don't know why

the Trudeau government had officials

reach out and offer consular services in

the past that's very disturbing so as I

said I believe he's in the right place

right now he's in prison he should stay

there
