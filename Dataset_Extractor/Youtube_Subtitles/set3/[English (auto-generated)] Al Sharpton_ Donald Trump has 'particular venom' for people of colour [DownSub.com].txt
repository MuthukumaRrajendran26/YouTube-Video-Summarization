little did I know that mr. Trump was

going to on the eve of this attack the

congressman from this city and not only

the congressman but the people of this

city in the most bigoted and racist way

he attacks everybody I know Donald Trump

he's not mature enough to take criticism

we can't help it he's like a child

somebody say something he reacts he's

thin-skinned and not really mature that

well but he has a particular venom for

blacks and people of color

he doesn't refer to any of his other

opponents or critics as infested he does

not attack their districts he attacks

Nancy Pelosi attacks Chuck Schumer he

attacks other whites but he never said

that their districts of their states are

places that no human being wants to live

the fact of the matter is Elijah

Cummings district is the most

well-educated and middle class aspiring

district of blacks in this country and

he doesn't even know what he's talking

about Elijah Cummings is a respected and

well regarded member of Congress and for

him to be angry at mr. Cummings because

mr. Cummings has the moral standing to

question how migrant children are being

treated at the border is an abomination

to me
