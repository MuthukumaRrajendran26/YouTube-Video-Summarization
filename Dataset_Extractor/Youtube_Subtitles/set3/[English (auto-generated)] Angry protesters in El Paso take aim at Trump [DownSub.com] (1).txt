keep in mind the last time President

Trump visited El Paso it was February

and back then he was using the city as a

prop as he railed against illegal

immigrants and called for the

construction of a border wall today he

came with a much different message but

he did not receive a warm welcome even

before President Trump arrived in El

Paso residents gathered to send a clear

unmistakable message this is not a

welcoming of Donald Trump this is a

testing of him I don't think he's coming

here as the comforter in chief I think

he's coming here as a divider in chief

five days after the racially motivated

shooting claimed 22 lives grief has

slowly transitioned to anger aimed

squarely at Trump he's not welcome on

pivot he repents until he asked for

forgiveness Fernando Garcia helped

organize the rally

he's one of many who blamed Trump for

inciting violence and anti-immigrant

anger across America we said it before

even before this terrorist that that

there was a war there's a war against

immigrants fueled by presidents it's an

invasion Trump's long-standing claims of

an invasion of migrants we're talking

about an invasion of our country is one

of several talking points echoed by the

alleged el paso shooter in a manifesto

when Trump arrived in El Paso he avoided

the glare of the cameras visiting

briefly with the injured and the

families of the victims while just a few

blocks away in the full glare of the

Texas Sun El Paso residents mourned and

rallied calling on a president who

didn't see or hear them to understand

the impact of his words

hate speech gotta treat each other as

one and Trump is not helping as Trump

left Washington to come here the

president refused to accept any

suggestion that his words may have

consequences no I don't think my

rhetoric has at all I think my rhetoric

is a very it brings people together at

the memorial to the victims

we asked El Paso's mayor to respond to

that I can't comment on I mean he's I'm

sitting here focused on 22 folks from

our region who have perished and in an

evil act

Trump's anti-immigration speech here in

February lasted for roughly an hour and

a half that is almost the same amount of

time he was scheduled to be on the

ground today

consoling victims of a racially

motivated gun attack
