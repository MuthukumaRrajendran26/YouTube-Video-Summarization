so we need to have a real discussion on

immigration we need to have a real

discussion also on balancing the budget

we're the only party was ready to

balance a budget in two years and we'll

do that because we'd be able to cut

foreign aid yes our country must be

there to help other countries when they

have a humanitarian crisis or also an

environmental disaster but it is not the

role of the government to give 2.3

billion dollars to African countries to

fight climate change we need to bring

back that money here in Canada that's

why the name of our bodies of people

party we are putting people first

Canadian first and we have board reform

that will help us to balance the budget

why it's so important to balance the

budget because it is not fair for the

future generation right now they will

have to pay they will have to pay these

huge deficit and they won't receive any

services so to be responsible we need to

balance the budget and we'll do that in

two years and after that we'll be able

to lower taxes to every Canadian we will

give them they will save thirty five

billion dollars a year with our tax

reform and that's important it's it's a

ball reform and all together I think

we'll be able to have a freer and a more

prosperous country we need to do this

reform we need to be able to speak to

Canadians about the real changes the

real reforms than we must do in this

country speaking about reform we want to

help Canadian families and we want them

to save 338 dollars a year by abolishing

the cartel in the dairy poultry and milk

were the only party with happiness that

has a strong position of that it would

be fair for everybody and also you know

Canadian won't pay twice that they are

paying right now for meal poor to be a

meal and AIDS they will save a lot of

money it would be fair also for these

producers because they would be able to

export their products in other countries

now they cannot with that system this

Supply Management cartel so all our

policies if you look

our policies are very different than the

earlier political parties and if you

believe in freedom in free market if you

believe in in people

that's the People's Party of Canada we

are there to be sure that we'll have a

bright future in this country and as you

know we are paying now twenty six

billion dollars only on the interest on

our death we need to stop that imagine

what we can do with twenty six billion

dollars a year so that's why it's

important to balance the budget and I'm

saying to Canadians look at the and

Russia R and the Liberals look at their

platform you know a life competition you

look at our platform and their platform

and Russia is saying you know it will

give you a tax rate over there another

tax rate over there for us we don't do

any pandering what we're doing right now

it's based on what we believe and we

don't do any compromise with our

principle that's very important and

that's why we're doing politics

differently we don't try to pander to a

province or to a region in this country

we don't try to pander to a special

interest group I'll give you another

example

pipelines pipelines it's very important

for the future of our country and for

the unity of our country as you know 25

percent of our Berton are saying that

they're looking for a separation I don't

like that as a Canadian we must be

united and the only way to be sure that

you know would be able to build

pipelines in this country and the only

way to do that is to use the

Constitution section 92 10 where the

only party with a strong platform on

that we know that it's safer to

transport all that gas by pipeline than

by trains it's safer for the environment

but also for the population for

Canadians

so let's have a real discussion about

all the issues that are important for

this country and you can count on us you

can call that the default to us and our

candidates all across the country and

our candidates also will debate with the

other candidates in their writing in

their region that's important and I hope

that personally I'll be able to debate

with Justin Trudeau and intuition and

the other leaders I'm ready for that

very ready for that we're waiting for

the final decision by mr. Johnston next

Monday and I hope and I'm pretty

optimistic

that will be there because without us it

won't be a real debate there are about

the same on a lot of policies so it's

important and I'm looking at this

campaign I think we will will make a

huge surprise the 21st of October so I

want to thank you very much for your

attention
