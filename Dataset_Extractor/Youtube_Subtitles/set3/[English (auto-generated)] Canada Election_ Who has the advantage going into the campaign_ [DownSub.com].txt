global radios the home of Charles Adler

who has his Charles Adler tonight a

program and he's joining us as part of

our pre election coverage Charles it's

so good that you could be here can you

give us your sense of who benefits most

from a 40-day campaign shorter than the

one four years ago who has in your view

the advantage going into this the the

advantage when it's a short campaign is

the incumbent so in this case it's

Justin Trudeau's liberals that the fact

that they wanted to get it almost as

close as possible to the five weeks

which is the minimum which would have

been this coming Sunday shows you that

there's a little bit of a trepidation in

the Trudeau camp Donna in this segment

that you just did what was most

fascinating to me was the conservative

strategist because right out of the gate

he was talking about obstruction of

justice financially did your job and

corrected him and saying that they

weren't doing a and obstruct the RCMP

wasn't doing an obstruction of justice

investigation they were poking around to

see if there ought to be one but I think

that that's what the Conservative Party

will be talking about on both social

media and conventional media planting

the seed that the Trudeau government is

corrupt and I think corruption is a word

that plays very well in the conservative

camp certainly with the conservative

base and you know the the the wounds

that the Liberal Party have suffered in

the last year last four years have been

largely self-inflicted the SNC saga

chief among them that the the the

opposition only had to sit back and

watch it unfold look you know the the

opposition is blessed with a woman who's

not a member of the Opposition Geordie

Wilson Raybould she's out there the

media constantly wants to interview her

she's got a lot of credibility she had a

lot of credibility at that committee

hearing most Canadians got to see either

the entire testimony that she offered or

sound bites of it they're still very

available and they get downloaded a lot

on on YouTube so the fact that Judy

Wilson rebel did what she did and it

would appear from the latest global male

story it would confirm that there is a

there there that it wasn't just a spat

between Jodi Wilson Raybould and the

prime minister in the fact that Jane

Philpott also left also adds to all of

it but I think it'll be impossible

for the Prime Minister to go through

this 40-day campaign without being

peppered with questions from the media

and of course during the the one english

debate that he's agreed to in the the

two french debates I think SNC Lavin was

behind them they thought it was but I

think it's it's very much front and

center right now you know I want to ask

you two things about that one

you talked to a lot of listeners on your

radio show across the country how many

people were paying attention to the

detail of that SNC level and story

because let's face it there is a lot of

detail and a lot of nuance and you had

to get deep into the weeds to kind of

fully understand what deferred

prosecution agreements are and all of

that and secondly how many people have

already made up their minds you know

there are a lot of liberals who say well

people have made up their minds already

we don't really need to convince anybody

else because people have decided you

know it's a it's a fantastic question

the reasons fantastic question is

because there is no body today not yours

truly or anyone else who can give you a

really really solid answer we'll get

Darryl Bricker on shortly from ipsus and

he'll give us some sense of it but the

idea that we know what's on people's

minds that they've made up their minds

that's why elections are so fascinating

why that's why this is the great cup of

politics we won't know whether they made

up their minds on this or anything else

until October 21st and the other

question is so you're a disaffected

liberal who has voted last time and the

turnout last time was 68 I think 68

percent almost 69 percent which is very

big for a federal election a lot of that

driven by young voters and people who

were energized by the liberal campaign

and by Justin Trudeau if you're now

disaffected and not sure you want to

park your vote there where do you go

this is another fascinating question for

the campaign because the greens this

week were a complete mess whether it was

the the hot-button of abortion even

separatism came up yesterday so the

greens that seem to be all over the map

the NDP don't even have candidates and a

third of their their writings and so

you've got nowhere for them to go safely

no no we're a progressive voters it is

disaffected with the Liberals can go and

feel really really safe that the Greens

or the NDP have any kind of shot at

power and when you're a voter

generally you want your vote to count

voting for parties that are not likely

to be part of the powerplay aren't

terribly interesting unless people do

start to believe them we'll find out in

the coming weeks whether or not there's

a good chance of the minority government

if there's a good chance of minority

government yeah you'll see if some

progressive voters disaffected with

liberals go to either the the greens of

the NDP at the moment I'd say the Greens

have the best shot at picking up voters

and one reason for that is Elizabeth May

I think Elizabeth May is one of the most

popular political personalities in the

country and despite the the gaffes this

week I would still give her the lead

here especially after the debate I think

Elizabeth May is a fabulous debater and

I think she'll acquit herself extremely

well in the English language debate and

she is now the veteran going into this

federal campaign right she's been at it

the longest compared to the other two I

think she's a relatively safe place for

a progressive to parca vote if if

they're not happy with Justin Trudeau

but you know a big discussion among all

progressive voters will be do you want

four more years of Harper because that's

how it's perceived that the

Conservatives will bring back Harper

well those progressive voters who wanted

to throw Harper the heck out that's

going to be a very important question

for them and they will if they're not

happy with Trudeau many of them will

hold their nose and say vote for Trudeau

anyway vote for the Liberals because

they don't want the Conservatives to

come back you know there are a lot of

people who think maybe a minority

government is not a bad thing for this

country right the average Canadian I

don't care whether it's west east or

middle likes the idea of limiting power

and they believe that whether they're

conservatives who are running the show

or liberals that they perform better

they're more accountable to the public

when the gun is literally to their heads

every day in a minority situation
