and this morning at First Baptist Church

Toronto I now wish to invite the poet

laureate of Toronto mr. Al Morris to

read a poem he has written for this

occasion Thank You captain days of July

the Danforth honoring the dead and

wounded celebrating the life in our

streets along the flowering Street a

face moves by a glance I seem to know

did I see her a day ago a month a year

in this same place a young woman could

she be a student from a class of mind

but then a small girl maybe nine or ten

with her parents passes me and shakes up

all my wandering the dance of her steps

makes walking clay and turns my heart

the other way from baffled thinking to

the thing all around me the Danforth

blue and gold with flowers in the tall

sky the people's noise that seemed to

die smothered by thought picks up anew

the sound of life comes back how

luminous the feast this Avenue serves us

all whether we come in a festival or

grieving moment the common human assent

to life to pleasure is set down here in

front

of us if we can we take it if we're in

too much pain

the street is content to offer and wait

it seems to no dark moments come and

only those who share their meal with the

dead can grasp the power to heal and to

be healed a quiet hum throbs in us as we

see the breads the fruits books clothes

the prism of the shops new forms and

colors that nothing stops the juice the

shine of life that spreads to all of us

admiring it now from those who work to

make it who will stop and eat inhale and

view as we do when their turn comes our

vow is kept here that life is good and

will be good for all a gift to all about

that our loved ones who have fallen

silent make to and with us fulfill thank

you poet laureate allow me to echo some

words you just shared with us and only

those who share their meal with the dead

Congrats the power to heal and to be

healed

a quiet hum and this opportunity allows

us to reflect and think about in our

hearts in our minds and our spirits the

lives that were lost but the

continuation of life on their behalf

thank you so much the enormity of grief

and sadness over the past year have been

overwhelming for all of us this has been

a defining moment in this community and

in our city I see many city officials

here who shared so much in that loss as

well and we are more grateful for the

life that we have more aware of the

people around us and more mindful of the

ways we are called to contribute towards

the building up

of our communities and the community of

Danforth in particular which holds a

special place in the lives of so many if

I can put my two cents worth we not to

live lives of isolation we are not

isolated but we are to insulate insulate

each other from the violence and from

the tragedies and from the hate and from

the judgment that does not belong in our

wonderful diverse community in our

diverse city in our diverse nation

nowhere else in the world can we live in

harmony and in peace than the City of

Toronto

you should give yourselves a hand for

that so let this moment not of isolation

but of insulation of care and love with

each other let this moment and our

gathering be a reminder and a

rededication of all that is good in us

and in our city may we continue to

support the families of those who've

passed those who have been injured and

those who have witnessed this incident

those neighbors and those first

responders who were on the scene helping

I always say while we are all running

from the tragedies of first responders

is running to the tragedy so we can be

safe thank you to our first responders

thank you

fire thank you paramedics Thank You

officers

yes we say thank you thank you for your

continued service and protection in our

city and we are proud of you a sir mich

ceremony like this helps us to break

down the walls of isolation as we

mentioned which used to keep us

separated but we are in this together in

our process of insulating each other our

pain and our grief brings us together

and allows for us in this shared space

to share kindness and compassion and to

encounter each other in this journey of

life and faith so as a symbol of our

unity allow me to invite you to take a

moment and to greet someone you don't

know someone standing or sitting near to

you would you please say hello exchange

your name and share why you've chosen to

be here today let's do so now if we can

and yes we are not just neighbors we're

not just friends we are common humans

together on this planet to work in

harmony and unity for each other and we

are family we are brothers and sisters

and we must care for each other before

we conclude there is a chalk at the

various tables which you are welcome to

use to create messages of hope love and

support to the families and to the

community just to the very back you'll

notice them there and on the sidewalks

within and outside this park as well you

can also express as I saw this wonderful

young girl over there is doing right now

as we gather in community following the

ceremony

there'll be baked goodies somebody say

Business Improvement area please linger

continue the conversations allow me to

meet you and shake your hand as well and

please express your support and

appreciation to the frontline responders

support also and so to this end this
