are you doing nice to see you see - so

tell me why no pun intended

pun intended tell me why Backstreet Boys

fans keep coming back for more I mean

personally I was 7 years old when I came

to a first Backstreet Boys concert lost

my mind and when I come when I go to a

show again as a 29 year old I feel

exactly the same what is that what is

that power that you guys have over your

fans you know and I just hopefully say

it's a testament to the great music that

we've been able to be with some amazing

writers Max Martin that's helped us

create some of our biggest hits

throughout the year and throughout the

years and also I think you know it's

that I think hopefully that we bring

these in our fans back to that moment

when they first heard that song and the

memories that they created with us

whether it was their first kiss or their

first love or whatever they were going

through at that time and then most

importantly maybe it's because there was

a one guy in the group called Howie D

the Latin one in the group that makes it

makes them really want to come playing

games and so nostalgia of course is what

you're talking about you guys play a

huge role in bringing back all those

memories does it feel like the 90s or

some like all of a sudden everywhere now

including with like the DNA has done so

well and I mean it hit number one and

then the last time that happened was

with black and blue in 2000 so do you

feel that part of that success is

because of this 90s nostalgia that's

coming back and targeting Millennials

absolutely after you have credit to this

whole resurgence of 90s music and and

all the other artists that are out there

doing very well as well it's it's it's

awesome that our fans are now at that

point where I don't know what they're

whether they're at the points in their

lives where they're just older now

having kids wanted to get a you know a

little mommy time away from the kids and

you know relive their teen years or

whatever that was back in the 90s but

we're embracing it we love it like I say

it's like you said it's it's it's really

helped us almost to a point have you

know lightning strike in a bottle twice

which is amazing because a lot of

artists especially when they have

success that we were blessed with that

magnitude trying to get that again twice

is very hard and

you know I think it's just we were able

to even the highs and the lows of

everything going on we just carry that

torch hoping that one day we would get

back up to where it is now and we were

very blessed with a great song called

don't go breaking my heart

the first thing off the album and it's

just a true testament to our fans just

wanted to you know continue here in our

music and so when you look out into the

crowd and you see these people you know

maybe in their in their late 20s or

their early 30s even 40s and they're all

there screaming your names those are the

same people who were there as tweens and

teens yeah how do you feel when you see

that it's amazing it's very overwhelming

it's very flattering I coined a phrase

many years ago keeping the Backstreet

pride alive and our fans do that they

come out and they are in that moment

even nowadays they're they're going back

to their their teen years again they're

there somehow in other their pitch of

their voice gets back up to that

frequency so how another but they just

are loving it and they just you know

they give us the energy every night to

perform these songs we performed oMG

thousands a times and it's through them

that you know even when I'm out there

I'm not I don't have the energy to get

on stage and really feel like I'm gonna

put on a great show I just look out in

the audience and I see their faces and

they're glowing and they're just smiling

and singing and dancing along that's

just an infectious energy that nobody

can deny to want to put on a great show

with absolutely well thank you so much

for your time thank you great seeing you

as you're seeing in Montana I love the

shirt thank you
