September 27th 1967 I was here promoting

the motion picture and one would say but

we're in in T Oland

and how come at the lakeshore Motel

where's the salt how does this get the

Easy Rider of it is it just was there

that's when the story came and I paid

attention to it why I have to do this

journey why I have to save these girls I

just like didn't think about my children

I think I bought my sister and myself

how we were just hung out to dry and we

can't let that happen and there's all

you know right now and in the country

there's an idea of trying to repair

family of the idea family whatever

happens he's paying a car than that

right miss hope I'm just realizing I

don't know enough about anything to say

no
