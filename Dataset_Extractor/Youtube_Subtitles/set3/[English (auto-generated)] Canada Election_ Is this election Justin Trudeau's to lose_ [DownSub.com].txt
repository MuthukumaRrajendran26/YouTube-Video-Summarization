well let's go to Mercedes Stevenson who

is outside waiting for the prime

minister Mercedes you're going to be

heading off almost immediately on the

40-day campaign with the Liberal Party

with Justin Trudeau this will be a

different campaign for him than it was

back in 2015 there's no talk of sunny

ways this time this really is his

election to lose isn't it it is and you

know what it would be historic Donna if

he lost it because typically Canadians

give governments after one majority

mandate another turn it may not be

another majority but it's usually a

minority and in fact only twice before

in Canadian history has there been a

situation where someone lost after a

majority and getting that for the first

time 1878 and 1935 so certainly the

pressures on there for Justin Trudeau

but he also has the advantage that

Canadians recognize his name they

recognize his brand he doesn't have to

come from behind now the downside of all

that is he has to run against his own

record broken promises on things for

example like electoral reform the SNC

Laval on scandal which was so counter to

that sunny ways brand and the promise of

transparency and today with that Globe

and Mail story alleging again that

there's obstruction that there's not

transparency in the government that

they're not releasing documents and

there's people who voted for Justin

Trudeau and we know this cuz they've

told it to pollsters and we've heard it

anecdotally saying they thought he was

different so they may not vote for him

this time because they believe he's

different but will they be willing to

give someone else a chance that's always

a higher risk in a voters mind

particularly when they don't feel they

know the other candidates as well so an

advantage in being an incumbent because

he's no longer coming from behind but

also the disadvantage that you can't

promise you're something radically

different than the status quo and it's

always easier to poke holes than it is

to build up so I think how you're going

to see Justin Trudeau framing this is

not give me another chance or give me a

chance it will be let me finish what I

started let me continue the things that

you chose the first time let me have a

chance to implement them and is really

being framed as an election that is

about choice they will see the

sir Vuitton's and try to position them

as going backward and going to Stephen

Harper they will try to contrast that

against the premiers in the provinces

like Jason Kenney or Doug Ford

particularly in Ontario they will try to

play against Ford's numbers here he's

not been popular and they will say do

you want that federally so that's the

advantages and disadvantages that Justin

Trudeau has coming in but he's a very

strong campaigner because Donna remember

in 2015 no one expected him to win and

he delivered a significant majority yeah

it certainly came from behind back then

a Mercedes we're just waiting for the

prime minister we've got a one-minute

warning so we expect to see him shortly

and hear from him just quickly where

where the leaders go is indicative of

where they think they have the strongest

chances and can make gains where is he

going today we're headed out to you

Donna we're going to be in Vancouver

tonight I'll be on that plane there is a

big campaign rally planned with a former

a television anchor who's running out

there a high-profile female candidate

and certainly Vancouver is gonna rank

really high for the NDP the greens and

the Liberals in this campaign it is one

that they need to take any of them if

they want to do well so I think you're

gonna see all of those three parties

spending significant time out there

starting with mr. Trudeau this evening

and so British Columbia will be a

battleground what's the other big

battlegrounds we should be looking out

for so the other big battlegrounds you

want to look out for are Quebec where we

know from the most recent polling this

morning the Liberals are significantly

ahead but the Conservatives have really

been pushing their ground game they're

trying to gain the NDP needs to at a

minimum maintain something they've been

struggling to do hopefully convince more

seats from their perspective to be able

to do half decently so that's gonna be a

major battleground whether it's Montreal

or especially up around Quebec City and

in northern Quebec there's some ridings

in play there that could be three and

four-way splits the other area is the

GTA as we call it the Greater Toronto

Area or the 905 which is the area code

there there's a lot of swing ridings

there and undecided voters and ridings

that flip back and forth between the

Conservatives and the Liberals they'll

be driving very hard in that area and

that of course is where jug meat Singh

is launching from today he's in London

Ontario but this will be

really unique collection in terms of

seeing elections particular ridings

where there's three and four-way splits

between the parties we've usually seen a

three-party system in many cases mostly

- but those splits that could hive off

just a little bit of the vote could flip

ridings in unexpected directions because

of the way that our political system

works in Canada and it's interesting you

know you talked about where the party

leaders are going the Conservative Party

of Andrew Shearer is in the air along

with our at McGill Beeman and the rest

of the reporters on route to troll

Riviera Quebec and we've been told that

their plane was rerouted to Quebec City

because of fog don't usually expect

weather to be a factor in a campaign is

happening in September you know I mean

really if the winter snows a can be a

devil but fog has already derailed plans

for the first day of campaigning for

Andrews here that can't that can't be a

can't be a happy day for those campaign

that can you you wonder you know the

whole thing is it an omen they'll say no

but no campaign wants to start off with

a bump like this especially when they

wanted to pursue the SNC laugh line it's

not their fault they've not done

something wrong it's fog but campaigns

are funny things the littlest bump the

littlest change can affect people's

perception they're highly unpredictable

that's why we go into it saying well

here are the polling numbers and Darryl

certainly can speak to this but you

don't know what the outcome is going to

be because of those unexpected things

you remember the conservative campaign

bus that broke down a couple of

elections ago and it became seen as a

symbol for the conservative campaign so

nobody wants that

they're going to have to try to turn it

around obviously it's a minor thing but

it's fascinating in politics how minor

things that there aren't even mistakes

the campaign has made can be delivered

and that people here we are talking

about the fact that they can't land

because of the fog yeah they're

unpredictable things and you know
