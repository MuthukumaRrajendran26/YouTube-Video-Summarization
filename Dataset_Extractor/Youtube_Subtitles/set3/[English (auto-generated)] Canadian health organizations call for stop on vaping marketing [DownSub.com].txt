today my organization along with five

others are her to ask for immediate

action on vaping products I'm joined by

colleagues from the Canadian Medical

Association Quebec Coalition for tobacco

control physicians for a smoke-free

Canada Canadian Lung Association and

Canadian Cancer Society to start dr.

sandy Buckman president of the Canadian

Medical Association we'll highlight our

call to action good morning everyone my

name is dr. sandy Buckman and I am

president of the Canadian Medical

Association we're one of the

organizations here today to call for a

stop on the marketing of vaping products

at the CMA we've been working for

decades toward the goal of a smoke-free

Canada what Canada has led the way when

it comes to regulating the marketing and

packaging of tobacco the same needs to

be done for vaping especially when we

know the use is on the rise among

teenagers and the long-term health

effects are still not known with

flavours like mango and vanilla and

flashy displays on convenience store

counters vaping products are appealing

to many teens they're seeing these

products they're curious about them and

they think they're it's nothing but a

harmless habit that they're not as bad

as traditional cigarettes but we know

that many cigarettes you solve some

flavors to deliver higher concentrations

of nicotine than you find in traditional

cigarettes because they mask the bitter

taste it's also not currently clear on

vaping packages what substances or

ingredients these products contain or

what chemicals users may be consuming

there's also strong evidence from

Canadian and US research that vaping

leads to cigarette smoking especially

among teenagers in short youth vaping

has become a public health crisis and we

need action now health needs to be a

priority in this election I echo the

call of all our partner organizations in

urging all federal political parties to

commit to an urgent in term order on

vaping market

let's not reinvent the wheel we've

learned many lessons from tobacco

control wasting time on this can only

increase the risks of Canadians Thank

and vaping products Act which legalized

the sale and promotion of vaping

products with nicotine in Canada in May

2000 in 18 treats tobacco products very

differently from vaping products whereas

tobacco advertising is only allowed in

adult only venues and through

publications sent to named person

advertising for vaping products can be

placed anywhere and can be broadcasted

widely this promotion of vaping products

has also exposed our youngsters to the

buffet of fun fruity flavors found in

well good morning my name is Terry Dean

of the kadai the president and CEO of

the Canadian Lung Association

organization is very concerned about the

alarming trends associated with vaping

use amongst youth and the emerging

evidence recently about the impacts on

lung health well we still have much to

learn about the long term health effects

there's enough current evidence today to

say that this is not a safe product it

is a product that we need to ensure is

properly restricted most facing products

contain nicotine which is highly is a

highly addictive drug thick attunes

nicotine use may lead to a lifelong

struggle with dependence and may act as

a gateway to smoking traditional

cigarettes for young people the health

impacts of smoking have long been

documented and remain the leading cause

of death and disability in Canada we

cannot risk reversing the progress that

ISM made on tobacco control by addicting

a new generation likewise the aerosol

and paper products is not harmless some

of the chemicals and vaping products can

shown to cause cardiovascular disease

lung injury COPD and certainly an

exacerbation of people who suffer from

asthma in the United States several

cases of pulmonary illness and death

have been reported as a result of vaping

I'm sure you heard the news from London

yesterday we do not need to wait for a

death in Canada to war dachshund to

protect the lungs of Canadians and

ensure everyone can breathe with ease

the time to act is now thank you now see

my name is Rob Cunningham I'm a lawyer

and senior policy analyst with the

Canadian Cancer Society there needs to

be an immediate interim order under the

Department of Health Act to reduce youth

baby there should be restrictions on

e-cigarettes and similar to existing

restrictions on tobacco advertising

there should be a ban on all additives

and flavors unless specifically

authorized and there should be a maximum

nicotine level as we've already seen the

European Union in short there needs to

be an immediate interim order to reduce

youth vaping with measures on

advertising flavors and nicotine levels

as illustrated by my colleagues were at

a crossroads in Canada our organizations

have shown the existing regulatory

environment to be insufficient in

protecting young people in Canada vaping

rates among youth are skyrocketing and

we're seeing associated health problems

such as respiratory conditions both here

in Canada and elsewhere in the world we

need immediate action and commitment by

all federal parties to create restraints

in a system where marketing is rampant

you for being enticed with attractive

and fun flavors and hooked on harmful

products that don't have the necessary

health warnings or safe nicotine limits

will we allow a new generation of young

people to become addicted to nicotine

and an increased risk for health

problems or will all political parties

commit to using an interim order within

60 days of forming government and

address this problem head-on

thank you I open the floor for questions

yesterday's no-one's proposing a ban on

e cigarettes e-cigarettes are intended

for adult smokers unable to quit but

we're having skyrocketing rates of youth

vaping and the regulatory controls that

we have in Canada are much less than we

have in other countries there's no

reason to have advertising for these

products that kids are exposed to on

billboards on television on social media

that's an easy change that could be made

similarly with respect to nicotine

levels the European Union does have

maximum contain levels and they find a

balance that with respect to the

regulation we don't have in Canada at

this point

I think it speaks to the the concept of

not reinventing the wheel we've been

here before

in trying to get control of tobacco

products and we need the same kind of

promotion and regulation that we did for

tobacco over the years that really

worked particularly in the early part of

of the 2000s we saw that restricting

promotion and marketing to youth really

made a significant difference in

decreasing smoking rates so we're

calling for the same thing here we just

have to reduce we're not calling for an

outright ban as was just mentioned but

we really have to reduce the promotion

and marketing to youth so we don't see

those increased health risks that are

associated with vaping marketing I didna

see on the marketing's of santa but some

common buku prehistoric see cyber mara

marketing ebook oppressively a desert

peanut a modest man it's just a mali

sole keeper beneath the sea Priscilla I

don't see any clear by Alicia we had a

ban on baby products in Canada but we

still had vaping stores in almost every

neighborhood it was a gray market it was

a tolerated gray market I think one of

the reasons it was tolerated although

this was never made explicit was because

of some Supreme Court rulings have been

made that we're addressing the potential

for harm reduction and the right of an

individual to have access to a product

that could potentially benefit them so

what we do not want to go back to an

illegal gray market we would prefer to

have a properly regulated market that is

within legal health directed but why not

alright then it's I think for decades

we've been asked why not just buy set

ban cigarettes and I think if we thought

this would be an effective public health

strategy that would it actually

arrived at the what our desire which is

reduced use minimum eyes use maybe end

of use we would be advocating it

we don't think at this point that

substituting a commercial market with a

black market will achieve those public

health kills if you are ever to give it

as changes that a ban would be effective

at achieving that then you might find us

calling for something different there's

a few issues obviously surveillance data

is one of the big problems we don't know

how big the problem is this thing is

evolved very quickly over the last

several months one thing that would

occur with the restriction is that we

would start to gather evidence to

understand what is usage where are these

issues hospitals will start reporting

when they have the incidents showing up

so we have to start to do our

surveillance data in order to inform

policy today it's locking so we're

thinking we can work our way into this

but we have to start immediately to

start gathering the data to inform

policy to inform actions it can and to

your point in question about the delays

the consultation process can be

time-consuming but we're seeing swift

action elsewhere in the world

recognizing that this needs immediate

attention and an interim order can be

used and that would be regulations that

could be in place for 12 months up until

we get more permanent regulations in

place but we see a problem now it can be

addressed immediately and the

consultation and the consultation

process can happen in the background but

we need something to protect youth in

Canada right now we can't wait and have

further delays and just add I think

there's an increasing recognition by

governments of the urgency to take

action in June there was published a

study in Canada

that found that youth fate being

increased by 74% in a single year among

16 to 19 year olds from 2017 to 2018

before and after he cigarettes with

nicotine were legalized in Canada and

promotion began in the United States

they've just released the first 2019

data showing yet a further spike you

know approximately 20 proximate 11

percent 2017 21 percent in 2018 27

percent in 2019 among high school

students so it's going up we're very

concerned about what the data may show

in 2019 in Canada and that's why it's

essential that government's move as soon

as possible and just to elaborate on a

previous question promoción illicit

alleged only boutique special is a boy I

do cinema soca pot ain't up did don't

said so I'll call that people say come

so there would not be a ban on

advertising or promotions in adult only

specialty Bake Shop s-- that would still

be able to continue so in in terms of

the flavors the and additives it's it's

very much based on the approach that's

used as part of the federal act for

tobacco products

the idea is to ban everything except

what's explicitly permitted that's what

we do four flavors in tobacco and that's

why we have we don't see

and flavored cigarettes or cigarillos

anymore in terms of vaping products we

expect that some additives or some

flavors might be allowed for example

tobacco flavor for vaping products we

expect probably some of the additives

that are known not to be necessarily

particularly problematic we know that

some of the additives currently in

vaping products are particularly

problematic known to known to be a

serious irritant to to to the lungs and

so in that sense the idea is just to go

with a precautionary principle and and

we expect that this once we have this

interim regulation in place for their

studies for their consultation and I in

time there would be a safer and more

effective framework that would be

established in terms of the nicotine

content twenty milligrams per milliliter

is the European directive it's being

enforced now for a number of years there

vaping products are sold there and - and

you know just to add to something one of

the most promising clinically clinic

random trial in terms of cessation for

vaping products used a dose that was 18

milligram per milliliter and so there's

quite uh it's quite obvious that we

don't need these very high doses in in

in the market when we're talking of

non-therapeutic products again the

vaping products that are being sold on

the market that we're trying to target

that are encompassed as part of this the

current act have not been certified as

medicines any manufacturer can go and

use the the other regulatory process to

get their products certified as

medicines for cessation nobody's there

to stop them you're allowed to promote

those products and you know there

there's efficacy trials that need to be

done and in in many cases most provinces

both public and private insurance will

cover some of the payments for that so

it's beneficial for smokers one has to

ask themselves why why why

isn't the vaping industry now going the

certified medicine route we aren't aware

of any information more than what I

think everyone else is aware of that's

been in the standard press it's the it's

the linking of vaping products to the

potential for serious lung disease that

is the concern it raises a red flag just

as the several hundred cases in the US

plus the six or seven deaths so that's

why we're we're all concerned because

there are definite health risks

associated with anything it does it can

lead to addiction right it is it's can

be a gateway a gateway drug for nicotine

some of the other health consequences

include of they being include the

adverse effects on brain development

particularly youth on pregnancy it does

have risk of cardiovascular disease it

does have risk of lung disease in

addition there's evidence that suggests

that it also can affect the mucous

membranes of the mouth and other tissues

that lead to biologic changers that are

linked to cancer so we're raising this

and this has to happen now again we have

long experience with tobacco and tobacco

products so I think it's really

important to take the prudent cautious

approach and get the interim order in

place so that we can we can undertake

appropriate policy and regulation

worse I mean if someone was baby would

if cannabis you know well you know again

we refer to the earliest we have this we

have this gray market in vaping products

we have this gray market and illegal

market in cannabis and now it's been

regulated we're calling for the same

thing with vaping products
