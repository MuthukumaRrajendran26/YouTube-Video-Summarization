the Canadian Armed Forces that's

expected to change within a couple of

weeks as Matthews has submitted his

release papers and the military is

expediting that request multiple

to be seen as taking action in this case

and against anyone espousing white

nationalist views especially amid

allegations that the forces are not

doing enough to quash radical behavior

in the ranks Matthews remains under

investigation at this time

chain of command first became concerned

about him after something he uttered

back in April the military police then

began to investigate in July getting out

Matthews from being charged by military

police or facing military justice

questions about whether he was under

surveillance at the time of his

disappearance or whether his firearms

warning about him and the FBI says they

have no comment
