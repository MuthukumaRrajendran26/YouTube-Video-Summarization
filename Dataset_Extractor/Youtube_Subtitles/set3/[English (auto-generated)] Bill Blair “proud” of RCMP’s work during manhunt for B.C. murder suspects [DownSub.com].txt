you know the RCMP will will make all

operational comment on on the

investigation and and and the evidence

that's being collected and it would be

really inappropriate to comment on that

but it does give me an opportunity to

tell you how proud I am of the enormous

work that went into to that manhunt you

know that those terrible heinous crimes

really concern Canadians and and and and

the the pursuit of those individuals

believed to be responsible for those

crimes you know was an enormous

undertaking by the RCMP and they never

quit

they never slowed down they never lost a

pace they just stayed right at it until

they got the job done and we're very

proud of that dono I used to work in

that profession I know the type of work

it requires really quite extraordinary

and and I think all Canadians can and

should be very proud that of the work of

their federal police services and you

know the the evidence when they're

bringing it back to the lab if I may you

know the those are difficult crimes to

really figure out precisely what

happened and it requires an enormous

amount of work in in in in finding the

individuals but also to collect the

evidence so that we can answer for the

families and for the community those

important questions about why and how

this took place and and much of those

answers will come from this facility it

will come from the extraordinary work of

the scientists who work here who will

get that that physical evidence and then

apply their incredible expertise in

knowledge using the extraordinary tools

available in this facility to get those

answers and and you know even though

there is no likely trial and now in this

proceedings those answers are all still

important and I have every confidence in

the RCMP to get us those answers the new

lab is modern state-of-the-art it's

equipped with some of the most

extraordinary technology available to

forensic scientists anywhere in the

world it's also designed and and of

course we're proud of that because what

this work needs to be done in a way

which is environmentally responsible in

this building meets a LEED Gold standard

the highest standard of environmental

sustainability for a building each year

the post this lab will process thousands

of requests from police agencies across

the country in areas such as DNA

toxicology trace evidence Allen C

anti-counterfeiting firearm and

tool-mark identification and I can tell

you as a police officer that the and

from experience in these services

criminal investigations cannot proceed

without the important work that will be

done in this facility they are vital in

court proceedings as you can imagine

they identify convict and they can also

eliminate and exonerate suspects in

curtain crimes they can link crimes

where no suspect has been identified and

ultimately the work that goes on in this

lab enhances Public Safety significantly

it ensures criminals will be brought to

justice

and it helped makes for a safer

community the investment in this

facility is coming at a time of

heightened concern about crime in the

area and across the country as we have

heard unfortunately gang activity and

violent gun crime in particular are in

people's minds and in communities right

across Canada and certainly here in

Lower Mainland BC and in the Surrey area

I know this is a very serious concern

for the residents I've come here many

times with my colleagues who I wanted to

acknowledge who have brought to the

concerns of the constituents that they

represent to Ottawa and and demanded

that we respond in an appropriate way

we know that in large urban centers

across the country certainly in my town

in Toronto that the availability of

handguns in the hands of people that

would commit violent crimes and because

of their concealed ability because of

the larger capacities of their magazines

you know they are deadly in in in an

urban environment where people use them

to commit violent crime and and to

advance criminal purpose through

violence and and so doing everything

possible to restrict the access that

individuals have to those guns if you

want to prevent those crimes you have to

do a number of things and I think

interdicting the supply keeping guns out

of the hands of people that would commit

crimes with them and also people who are

suffering perhaps from mental illness or

psychosis who might represent a danger

to themselves and to others 75 percent

of the people who died from firearms in

this country died as a result of suicide

and so interdicting the supply of guns

that go into the hands of people that

would commit violent crimes with them is

an important part of the work but it's

not the whole job and and so we have to

look at a number of other measures the

demand for those guns in our communities

there are significant things we must do

in order to reduce the demand for those

guns and to change the social

circumstances under which that violence

takes place well I have been asked to

look at the efficacy of a total ban and

I believe that there are some very

effective measures that can and should

be taken with respect to additional

restrictions to prevent guns from

getting into the hands of criminals we

know many of them are smuggled across

the border that's why we've invested

nearly 19

dollars in interdicting the supply of

firearms coming across the border and

we're going to continue to make those

types of investments because that's the

significant source of guns we live next

door to the largest handgun Arsenal in

the world but we also know many guns end

up in the hands of criminals as a result

of being stolen either from retailers or

legal gun owners and so ensuring that

people undertake secure storage of those

those weapons so that they're harder to

steal harder to obtain is important part

of the work that were that we're

undertaking and finally we also know

that the likelihood of getting caught is

and is a significant deterrent as well

and so the important work for example

that's going on right here in this lab

where they do ballistics testing and and

race serial numbers and facilitate

proper trace investigations of the

origin of crime guns can also lead us to

those individuals who choose to purchase

guns legally and then sell them

illegally another important and illegal

source of guns is going into the

criminal community there's no one simple

solution there's a thousand things we

must do and let's do them all well and

that's our commitment
