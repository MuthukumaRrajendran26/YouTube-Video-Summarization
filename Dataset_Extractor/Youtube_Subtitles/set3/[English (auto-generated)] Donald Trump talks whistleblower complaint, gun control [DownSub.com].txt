can try and help Texas with this

terrible flooding that they've been

having so we'll be talking to a lot of

people and meeting a lot of people

that's going to be at Ellington Air

Force Base and we're going to use this

some of you are coming with me I guess

we'll be going to Houston and we'll be

it's a very nice big stadium packed full

of people with a miniature Modi of India

as if I'd go with them and I've accepted

and we're going to have a good time with

Prime Minister Modi we have a here's a

tremendous crowd so that will be in

Houston and then after that I'm going to

Ohio Pratt Industries is opening a 1

billion dollar plant and I don't mr.

Platt always a great Anthony I told them

if he does something really spectacular

I'll go and cut the ribbon anybody

invested a billion dollars in Ohio

so that's Pratt industries they're great

people is a great company headed by a

very great businessman from Australia so

they're bringing a billion dollars into

Ohio and I said I'd go and cut the

ribbon and here it is we're ready to cut

a ribbon it's a great plan so we look

forward to that then we're coming home

and then we have a lot of work at the

United Nations during the next week

nothing's ever off example completely

but I have no intention of meeting with

Iran and that doesn't mean it doesn't

happen on the reflexive of verses but we

have no intention is not set up we're

meeting with a lot of leaders we have

about 15 meetings set up but Iran is not

one of them mr. president mr. president

we had a great conversation the

conversation I had was largely

congratulatory was largely corruption

all of the corruption taking place

there's largely the fact that we don't

want our people like Vice President

Biden is done creating - the big

corruption already in the Ukraine and

Ukraine Ukraine's got a lot of problems

he the new president is saying that he's

going to be able to rid the country of

corruption that I said that would be a

great thing we had a great conversation

we had a conversation on many things in

fact I believe Ukraine put out a

statement yesterday saying that we

covered many different topics it was a

warm and friendly conversation we back

tie-back Ukraine from the beginning but

I'm very upset that other countries

aren't doing the same Germany should be

spending much more friends all of the

European Union should be spending money

why are we spending money and they're

not or at least they're spending very

little by comparison so I'm not happy

about that

I would have no problem with Rudy's a

very straight shooter as Rudy wants to

see the same thing there's a lot of

other people with respect to Ukraine

Ukraine has had a tremendous corruption

problem somehow they were involved in a

lot of different things in took place in

our country and hopefully it could be

straightened out and I will say the new

president we had a very good talk the

new president got elected based on the

fact that he would end corruption that

was probably his number one thing do you

think somebody was spying on you on that

call with Ukraine

well this whistleblower or whoever it

was because it sounds like it's not a

whistleblower you can't have that happen

to a President of the United States the

conversation by the way was absolutely

perfect it was a beautiful warm nice

conversation and it was put out last

night also by Ukraine but you can't have

people doing this and you can't have

people doing false alarms like this and

you know when the president speaks to

the head of another country he has to be

able to speak to those people and those

people don't want to know that they're

being recorded or that you have a

stenographer working you don't want to

have to hear that you can't do that to a

president and you can't do that to other

countries but with all of that being

said we had a very great conversation

very straight very honest conversation

I hope they can put it out

well I don't say anything but whenever I

speak to a bar and leader I assume there

are many people in the line

I don't assume I'm talking to the leader

anytime I'm on the phone with a foreign

leader many many people are on the line

sometimes they take people sometimes

they're doing a stenographer

but I also sooo assume many people are

on the line from the other side so if

I'm speaking to a country they also have

people in the line so who would say a

thing like what you say now I will say

this I said absolutely nothing wrong it

was perfect

listen to me listen listen listen to me

listen to me

I assume many people are on the line I

know that before I make the goal and

that's what you have intelligence

agencies everybody listening that call

was a great Co a perfect call a perfect

ball what wasn't perfect is the horrible

thing that Joe Biden said and now we

made a lie what he said he never spoke

to his son I mean give me a break he's

already said he spoke to his son and now

he said yesterday very firmly I think

you son of course you spoke to his son

so he made them to say good thing he

never spoke to his son he spoke to his

son but more importantly what he said

about the billions of dollars that he

wouldn't give them unless they fired the

prosecutor and then he bragged about how

they fired the prosecutor they got the

money

[Applause]

not a separate are very busy I'm going

on the floods today the floods are very

important to me and climate change

everything is very important but today

I'm going to Texas on the flood then I'm

going to use it on the big rally it's a

rally for Prime Minister Modi and the SP

to do it of India and I look

well not only Ukraine take a look at

China they took a tremendous amount of

money out of China

now they ever took over in China

negotiation he would sell us out look at

all the money he paid in China the son

he knew nothing

the son is a stiff he knew nothing and

he's making hundreds of thousands and

millions of dollars and he did the same

thing in Ukraine he knows nothing this

is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden

did and then he said he never spoke to

his son does anybody believe that one

but then he also said long before that

he did speak to his son so he lied again

but what he said is that he wouldn't

give I think it was billions of dollars

to Ukraine unless they fired the

prosecutor who was looking at his son

and his son company the company that his

son works with and that's trade this on

this thing and I'm not looking to hurt

by I'm not even looking to hold and do

it to be honest but he said a very bad

thing he said a very foolish thing now

me or the other hand my conversation

with the president the new president of

Ukraine was perfect they put out a

statement last night they said the same

thing it was a warm friendly

conversation there was no quid pro quo

there was nothing it was a perfect

conversation president when you bring up

when you bring up to Biden

because I want Germany and I want France

and I want the European Union to put up

money and I didn't delay anything we

paid the military aid to the best of my

knowledge listen to me I gave so much

for tu brains and Obama did go back and

check your records and you know what you

should do also as can you Philip why

anybody should be allowed to buy a son

without a background check

we're looking at it right now we're

studying it very hard it's an issue that

frankly Congress is wasting all their

time when nonsense we're studying very

hard if Congress would ever get back to

work we can work something but Congress

is doing all of this nonsense this

garbage that they're doing and I'll tell

you what they don't have any time but

Democrats in Congress they're doing

nothing I'll tell you what they're going

to lose the election you know why

because they're not doing anything are

you going to make a decision this week

on a gun proposal are you what well

we're working very hard with some

Democrats the problem I have is that

Jerry Nadler and all these people they

keep wasting time in Congress over

nothing they're studying nothing the

Muller report was perfect Corey

Lewandowski was magnificent everybody is

perfect they're wasting time they

couldn't accept the Muller report they

couldn't accept that defeat they can't

now accept the fact that we have the

best economy we've ever had it we may be

hitting another all-time high expanding

background checks to all commercial

sales do you support expanding

background checks on how to do things

the problem we find is the Democrats

have very little time to talk because

they're wasting their time you take a

look at what they're doing it's a total

waste of time and they know it they

bad

what we're working with joe manchin the

senator and we're working with Pat

Dooley and we have a lot of people

working of it and we'll be seeing it I

say over a period of time the problem

that I have is the Democrats in the

house especially they're totally

unavailable to talk because that

hearings all day over something that's

already been won by us they made up a

story it was a false story it was a hoax

and frankly we have to get to the bottom

of how it started but they are wasting

all of their time on a home got a job

and I could do things if I wanted but I

don't want to do that we're so strong

despite Jay pal but Jay Powell is not

helping us other countries have lower

interest rates with the Prime Minister

the law but he has the rate he put lux

it's very simple he lifted the rates far

too quickly and they lowered them far

too slowly and it's a shame and the

Russian boneheads in your administration

whose jobs are safe not too many who to

be not there any bonus we have a great

up day what we really now have a great

administration but what we have is a

great cabinet our cabinet is done a

great job

now he is a great gentleman Joe he's

doing a fantastic job and I know one

thing he's only gonna do what's right

but he is doing a fantastic job and he's

only going to do what's right but just

so you understand the conversation I had

with the president Ukraine was

absolutely perfect and people better

find out who these people are that are

trying to subvert our country because

here we go again he's a bad people but

the conversation I had with the

president of Ukraine was absolutely

attend it was perfect now what you have

to do is look at the corruption on the

Democrat side take a look at how the

whole witch hunt started now they want

to try and start another witch hunt but

unfortunately this one is reverting now

to Joe Biden because he's done some very

bad thing and I'm not even looking to

hurt him to be honest he needs all the

help he can get I'm not looking to hurt

him I'm not looking to hurt his family

but the corruption and what he said is

it terribly
