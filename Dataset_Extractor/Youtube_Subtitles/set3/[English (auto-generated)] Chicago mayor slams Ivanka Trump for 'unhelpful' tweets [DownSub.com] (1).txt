well she got the numbers wrong she got

the location wrong that's the danger of

trying to govern via tweet by sending

doesn't know what they're talking about

and getting the fundamental facts wrong

that they could easily figure out if

they had the decency to actually reach

out to us if they wanted to be a

constructive and engaged partner
