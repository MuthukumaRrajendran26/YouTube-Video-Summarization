first day back to work for city

councilors had no shortage of fireworks

things seem to be going smoothly during

the day up until the point award 11

councillor Jeremy Farkas attempted to

add a motion to the agenda which would

have called for increased transparency

in city spending essentially contracts

and expenses that exceed $10,000 the

city would need to disclose that now a

move such as that would have required

the support of two-thirds of city

councillors it didn't have it and will

now have to wait for another meeting it

was at that moment when things really

went off the rails

especially for mayor Nenshi and

councillor shanshu new but I asked the

question the clerk you don't have to be

so bitchy I'm sorry to be quite frank

with you parliamentary why don't you

apologize thank you over I'll have to

ask you have you removed sir go ahead

okay are you gonna withdraw that comment

because you can't insult other members

of council all right then I'm gonna have

to ask you to leave no I'm gonna have to

ask you to leave council eat you and you

have to sit down you don't make the

rules here sir I'm waiting for answer

no you're not because that was in you

know you have a point of privilege

called against you sir and you have to

respond to the point of privilege again

the rules don't change so you either

have to withdraw your comment or you

have to leave those are your choices but

that's not a swerving no it's insulting

sir okay others like okay that is you so

yes I'm sorry I say something insulting

but stop being a little kid sir every

time you say something of privilege here

you have to stop Council assume day one

of a council back in the fall as a

reminder what did the councillors say

after that meeting Matthew

yeah Dallas afterwards the mayor and

councillors Shuai they seemed to calm

down a little bit but they were sort of

sticking to their guns after the session

was done and our cameras caught up to

them and hear what they had here's what

they had to say I think what's important

for my colleagues on city council to

remember is that citizen X citizens

expect better

they expect folks who are prepared who

know what they're doing who have done

their homework who are not grandstanding

and who are focused on what's right for

the city not on what may or may not be

right for their political career it's

very frustrating we have so-called a

leader of a city camisole continuously

only one have one opinion that's his and

nobody else matters that's now right I'm

not only one few minutes after what I

have said you heard that other

councillor also challenged him as well

basically on the same point so the other

councillor I have spoken to they feel

the same way it's just that they is the

mayor yes there you have a Dallas day

one of the fall session councillor Chu

and Mayor Nenshi not getting along I

don't want to say for certain but I'm

not sure if they're going to be

exchanging holiday cards at this

December
