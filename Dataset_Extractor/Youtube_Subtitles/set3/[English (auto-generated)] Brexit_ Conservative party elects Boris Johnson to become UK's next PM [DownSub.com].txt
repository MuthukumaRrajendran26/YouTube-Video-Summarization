I've been hugely proud as chairman of

and professional party working together

to deliver a fair and efficient election

we've held hustings in 16 towns and

cities right across the United Kingdom

in every region and in every nation our

candidates have covered some 3,000 miles

taken over 400 questions and answered

hours and hours worth of questions in

interviews culminating in that fantastic

event at the excel just last Wednesday

and we have welcomed thousands of our

party members and friends and family to

hear directly from our candidates and in

a first for a political party we held an

online live hustings open to everyone in

our country and indeed beyond I want to

pay tribute to the team at CC HQ in

particular for running both the

membership ballot and these fantastic

hustings and I also want to thank my

parliamentary colleagues for their

support through that process in

particular the members of the 1922

committee brilliantly led by Charles

Walker and day Michelle Gilliam who have

been of attorney officers throughout

this process and have given us such an

efficient professional and effective

start and run through this process and

Conservative Party Thank You those

members our friends our family and our

colleagues who have undertaken a solemn

duty in choosing our next leader who

will be this country's next prime

process a chance to choose our leader is

a privilege and I believe our party has

risen to that task

finally I want to take this opportunity

to say a thank you to our current

Tereza may her leadership of our party

in our country over the last three years

something that was never going to be an

easy task and it is now our paramount

that we come together that we unite as a

party for our country to deliver in the

national interest to get behind our new

leader and our next prime minister to

deliver on the result of the referendum

and to deliver for the whole of the

hand you over to the wonderful co-chair

of the 1922 committee Dame Cheryl

of May the Prime Minister the right

honourable Theresa May announced that

she would be standing down as leader of

our party on the 7th of June and over

the past 46 days

ballots of members of parliament and

then worked with the party chairmen and

the electoral reform services to present

the final two candidates so all

qualifying members of the conservative

and unionist party could vote for our

new leader

Brandon and in particular to the party

board and the party staff for all their

sterling work on the hustings and also

the ers who have conducted a very

professional operation collecting and

Counting the votes from home and abroad

in my co-chairman Charles Walker with

him it has been a pleasure to work and

top of the 1922 Committee

offices of the 1922 committee Sir

Geoffrey Clifton Brown Bob Blackman and

Nigel Evans all together here today and

our own parliamentary staff who have

given up their spare time to help

successful election finally I would like

to thank all those party members who

voted and those who stood in the

election and particularly my colleagues

Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson who

despite the challenges of a contest run

in the glare of Press comment and public

scrutiny I believe have emerged as

worthy candidates for the position of

leader

enough but in in the honored tradition

I'm going to ask my beautiful assistant

announcements it's called teamwork I

[Applause]

thank you very much

well thank you very much good morning oh

boy thank you

[Applause]

Thank You Carol

okay thank you so much thank you sir

Thank You Charles thank you very much

Brandon for a fantastic fantastic well

organized campaign I think it did a lot

of credit as as bad as has just said to

our party to our values and to I our

ideals but I want to begin by thanking

my opponent

Jeremy by common consent an absolutely

formidable campaigner and a great leader

and a great politician Jeremy in the

course of twenty hussies in war I mean

20 hustings or hustings style events it

was more than three thousand marred by

there's about seven thousand miles that

we did criss crossing the country you've

been friendly

you've been good-natured you've been a

font of excellent ideas all of which I

propose to steal and above all I want to

thank our outgoing leader Theresa May

for her extraordinary service to this

party and to this country it was a

privilege

it was a privilege to serve in her

cabinet and to see the passion and

determination that she brought to the

many causes that are her legacy from

equal pay for men and women to tackling

the problems of mental health and racial

discrimination in the criminal justice

system Thank You Teresa thank you and I

want to thank all of you all of you here

today and obviously all everybody in the

Conservative Party for your hard work

for your campaigning for your public

spirit and obviously for the

extraordinary honor and privilege that

you have just conferred on me and I know

that there will be people around the

place who will question the wisdom of

your decision and there may even be some

people here who still wonder what

correct what they have done and I would

just point out you that and of course

nobody no one party no one person has a

monopoly of wisdom but if you look at

the history of the last 200 years of

this party's existence you will see that

it is we conservatives who have had the

best insights I think into human nature

and in the best into the best insights

into how to manage the jostling sets of

instincts in the human heart and time

and again it is to us that the people of

this country have turned to get that

balance right between the instincts to

own your own house your own home to earn

and spend your own money to look after

your own family good instincts proper

instincts noble instincts and the

equally noble instinct to share and to

give everyone a fair chance in life and

to look after the poorest and the

neediest and to build a great society

and on the whole in the last 200 years

it is we conservatives who have

understood best how to encourage those

instincts to work together in harmony to

promote the good of the whole country

and today at this pivotal moment in our

history we again have to reconcile two

sets

these two noble sets of instincts

between the deep desire for friendship

and free trade and mutual support in

security and defense between Britain and

our European partners and the

simultaneous desire equally deep and

heartfelt for democratic self-government

in this country and of course there's

something received that they're in

irreconcilable and it just can't be done

and indeed I read in my Financial Times

this morning devoted reader than I am

seriously it's a great great great great

British great British brand I read in my

Financial Times this morning that there

are no incoming leader no incoming

leader has ever faced such a daunting

set of circumstances it said well I look

at you this morning and I asked myself

do you look daunted do you feel daunted

I don't think we I don't think you live

remotely daunting to me and I think that

we know that we can do it and that the

people of this country are trusting in

us to do it and we know that we will do

it and we know the mantra of the

campaign that has just gone by in case

you've forgotten it you probably have it

is deliver brexit unite the country and

defeat Jeremy Corbyn

[Applause]

I know I know suck some wagons already

pointed out that deliver your knight and

defeat was not the perfect acronym for

an election campaign since our portion

aliy it spells dud but they forgot the

final E my friends efore energized and I

say I say to all the doubters dude we

are going to energize the country we're

going to get bricks it done on october

30 was going to take advantage of all

the opportunities that it will bring in

a new spirit of can-do and we are once

again going to believe in ourselves and

what we can achieve in like some

slumbering giant we are going to rise

and ping off the guy ropes of self-doubt

and negativity with better education

better infrastructure more police

fantastic full fibre broadband sprouting

in every household we are going to unite

this amazing country and we are going to

take it forward I thank you all very

much for the incredible honor that you

have just done me I will work flat out

from now on with my team that I will

build I hope in the next few days to

repay your confidence but in the

meantime the campaign is over and the

work begins thank you all very much

quarry
