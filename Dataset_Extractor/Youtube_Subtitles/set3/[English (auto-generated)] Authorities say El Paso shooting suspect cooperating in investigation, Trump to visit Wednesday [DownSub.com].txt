we are going to be giving a briefing on

the latest information regarding this

tragedy we'll take questions at the end

in Spanish first I want to thank the

community for the understanding and

their patience and the way they've

responded to this terrible incident we

want to also recognize and thank the

first responders for removing the bodies

from the scene yesterday around 1500

around 3 o'clock that was a priority for

us as a priority for our mayor and our

council it was Prodi because the

families and the dignity associated with

getting the bodies removed was an

extreme priority for our entire staff

lastly I think it's an item that may not

I don't think it's as important to some

of the other things but it's still

something that we're paying attention to

the parking lot and the and the evidence

has to be gathered unfortunately there

will still be a few more days before we

get information out and when people can

go in and collect their their vehicles

I want introduce the mayor DiMarco who's

next he'll be followed by chief Greg

Allen and then Mario D'Agostino and then

we'll take questions at the end

Thank You Tommy

since this morning I've been notified

that two more lives have been lost

I think it's been publicized in my heart

my prayers our prayers go out to the

families eight of the individuals who

have lost their lives come from our

sister state of Chihuahua Mexico

well boarders may separate us our grief

transcends them we're one region and we

will honor every victim like they were a

member of our community El Paso is a

family and we must continue to stand

united as our region heals I could not

be more proud of our city from the

offers for free funeral services to the

lines to donate blood to the

overwhelming crowded vigils throughout

the city El Paso has shown that we are

much stronger than Saturday's attack I

have issued a local disaster declaration

yesterday activating all

available estate recovery efforts

various state and federal officials have

contacted offering resources for our

community this was an act of domestic

terrorism fueled by hate

an evil individual I will not assist in

promoting or embolden his agenda nor any

movement that he would be associated

with our diversity is what makes us

special we are three states two

countries in one region and as I've been

saying there is no other city or region

like El Paso claudus now let me cover

one other item that you will ask about

President Trump called me yesterday he

was very gracious in the call you all

know of my history with the President as

I've defended El Paso he was very

gracious offered to help in any way he

could and it was a brief call and

nothing nothing overly specific I made

no request at that time I said we're

waiting to see what settles he's coming

out here on Wednesday and I want to

clarify for for the political spin that

this is the office of the mayor of El

Paso in an official capacity welcoming

the Office of the President of the

United States which I consider is my

formal duty

I will ask President Trump to support

our efforts with any and all federal

resources that are available our

recovery is no small task together we

will rise out of this tragedy and I'm

here to ensure that we receive every

state and federal resource that is

available to us that we need I will

continue to challenge any harmful and

inaccurate statements made about El Paso

we will not allow anyone to portray El

Paso in a manner that is not consistent

with our history and values

throughout our community bienvenidos is

displayed for all our guests and

visitors it is a message that has

defined our community for over 350 years

I will not allow this evil senseless act

of violence to change what our community

represents I'd like to call on chief

chief Allen good afternoon everyone my

you get to you reach out we have a

number seven seven nine 1800 that will

get you the help you need locally and

there's no charge to that service

thank you

I tried to preempt your question with my

remarks I represent the office of the

mayor of El Paso Texas this is not a

political visit as he had before which I

did not visit with him but I was noted

from the podium as I recall and and he

is the president United States so in

that capacity I will fulfill my

obligations as mayor of El Paso to meet

with the president and discuss whatever

our needs are in this community and hope

that if we are expressing specifics that

we can get him to come through for us

I'm already getting the emails and the

phone calls and that's why I'm saying

what I'm saying now I would appreciate

it people would save their time and not

necessarily have to send

yes I understand but we're not dealing

with that right now we're dealing with

the tragedy of 22 people who have

perished by an evil hateful act of a

white supremist supremacist that has no

bearing or belong in El Paso it was not

done by an El Paso

noel past one would ever do this and I

can't I don't know how we deal with evil

I don't have a textbook for dealing with

evil other than the Bible I'm sorry

we're going to go through this but he

but the president is coming out and I

will meet with the president and I guess

for people who have lots of time on

their hands I'll deal with their emails

and their phone calls

I can't go into those details right now

that would be too revealing of the

investigation that's still ongoing right

now we haven't even cleaned of fully

cleared the crime scene they were still

gathering evidence at that particular

location I'm sorry

it was bought in near his hometown in

Allen Texas I don't have the exact

details of that right now

you know the weapon was purchased

legally it's a 7.62 caliber weapon that

could be two varieties of weapons 7.62

by 51 which is a NATO round 7.62 by 39

would be Russia Russian Kalashnikov

caliber the what well you'll have to

contact our PA well our PIOs will

provide that information but they'll

have to clear with the investigative

unit right now to see if that's

permissible

right now he has no bond he's under a

charge of capital murder in general that

that determination is clear by the

district attorney's office they work

with the investigators to come up with

the appropriate charge if that's the

case then it was approved by the

district attorney

from the police department perspective

we're doing okay we have the employee

assistance programs available eh n is

also assisting with that and I'll let

the fire department comment on that side

yes thank you

the fire department we have we did set

up debriefing teams instantly

immediately following the scene

we do have eh EAP assisting them as well

we do have our international

firefighters they're coming on scene

next week they'll be doing debriefing

going station to station talking to them

seeing if there's any effects we've had

all the positive communications with

them and we are monitoring

like I can give you a general he took

about 10 to 11 hours traveling for

mallet Texas to a Paso as soon as he got

here he was lost in a neighborhood after

that he found his way to the Walmart

because we understand he's hungry and

that's about as far as I can go without

getting into too much detail was he

cooperating yes he cooperated from the

beginning none of this had to be anyway

course from me more threats or anything

like that he volunteered most of the

evidence that we were able to utilize at

this time no he I can't make comment on

that directly again that's part of the

investigation

that's a good question because I see

it's eight on one of my faculty list

here but I've got seven on the list will

people writing to you so right now it

looks like seven confirmed from the list

with the deceased actually all that I'm

sorry

no not to the investigators I ask that

question again this morning right now he

basically appears to be in the state of

shock and confusion I'm sorry we don't

know that right now

I'm sorry with Jim I repeat know that we

haven't ascertain that right now that's

what we suspect he did right now thank

you
