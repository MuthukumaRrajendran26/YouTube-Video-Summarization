I wanted to come and give you some kind

of update to see let you know where we

are but we are trying to talk to this

male I'm trying to let him know that he

can end this peacefully now we've called

him multiple times he has picked up the

phone a couple times but he has not

answered so we've been trying to work

with a family member but right now we

have not been successful despite several

attempts to talk to him both on a

loudspeaker on a bullhorn and on

telephone we have been not been able to

make contact with him thus far we're

trying to get him to come out peacefully

but right now he refuses to do so I have

to get back over to the scene I will

answer a few brief questions and then

the mayor might have some comment and in

others may have comment but right now I

have to get back over because the

critical thing to tell you that I did

not tell you because I have you know

some situations where I'm worried about

potential hostage situations so we've

got to get that resolved alright

commissioner can you tell us the how the

two officers who are inside are they

doing we believe they're okay and I'm

not going to say much more about that

right now

out of concern for their safety right

now so we believe that this male is in a

certain part of the building I won't

tell you where they are where he is

right now so that I don't endanger the

officers on the scene in any way but it

is a very volatile situation that is

still unfolding so as a result there's

but so much I can tell you about what's

going on inside of their property safe

with the fact that even when I was on

seeing he fired multiple rounds many of

which that struck the SWAT truck and

buildings across the street and that's

long after I got there long after it

started so he was continued to fire it

is a grave concern to us but we are

trying to communicate to him that we

want him out safely even going as far as

telling him that the officers are going

to be okay and that there's nothing that

we can't work through but right now we

are not successful so

back over there I'll answer just a few

questions and then I got to get back

over just you're talking about the

angels that's what I just went in there

so I didn't get a chance because of

proximity to make it to Einstein I'll

get up there a little later thankfully

everybody's gonna be okay I did speak to

all three that are here and you know

they're all in good spirits

you know we're concerned about this

whole situation right now we're not sure

and so I don't want to say that and be

wrong north from a tactical standpoint

that we want to make that assumption

there were people who were taken into

custody initially okay and there may be

even someone in custody inside but right

now what we know is this male is holed

up inside and he is not since I've come

here in the last 20 minutes or so

there's no indication that he's trying

to surrender right now we do know he's

still alive there's no question about

that

because of the shots that keep ringing

out so we're very concerned about you

know the neighborhood we're very

concerned about our police officers but

again we're doing everything within our

power to get him to come out all right

commissioners you said you've been in

touch with his family well I mean we're

just trying to do right now is do as

much as we can

to resolve this peacefully and so

without getting into all of that at this

point we're trying to use and leverage

everything possible multiple attempts to

talk to him by myself and others trying

to assure him that I'm out front

you know we has the highest assurance

he's not going to be harmed when he

comes out but normally I wouldn't even

take this posture but I got police

officers in a very volatile situation

you know I've got to be with my people

or that's the bottom line so I have to

get back over there I don't know

I had the opportunity to speak to the

six officers they're all in good spirits

and obviously it was a very traumatic

experience for them I was talking to one

of the officers had the graze wound to

the head and he had two little boys it

looked like they were 9 or 10 years old

eight or nine years old and kept on

thinking about how their lives were to

change just with a little bit more

difference in space and I just our

concern right now is for them and for

their families and we'll sort out all

the other stuff once the scene has been

resolved over at the over-over the

shooting of where the shooting took

place and we're just thankful I'm a

little angry about having someone having

all that weaponry and all that all that

firepower but we'll get to that another

day that's all about the officers and

their families right now and god bless

them and God God saved them all

thank you
