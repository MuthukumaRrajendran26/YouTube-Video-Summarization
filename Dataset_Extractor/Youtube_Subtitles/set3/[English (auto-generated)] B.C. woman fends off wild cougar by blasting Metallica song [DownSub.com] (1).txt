the Vancouver Island woman's heavy-metal

moment is going viral she was out on a

hike with her dog when a cougar began

stalking them when yelling didn't scare

off the big cat she blasted Metallica

from her phone a move that worked and

got the attention of people around the

world including the band

here's Kiley Stanton it's a drumming he

kind of do to hit play I hope for the

best just right away it sends a message

that was deagle and strategy a couple of

weeks ago while out on a walk in the

woods where she happened to come across

this there's a cougar I just suddenly

felt like something was watching me

gallant did everything right pulling her

dog Murphy in close and waving her hands

in the air trying to appear large and

loud get out of here

but he just stayed and he just stared at

me for the longest time and I decided I

needed to do something a little more

intimidating a lifelong Metallica fan

Gallants found her iTunes and went to

her favorites knowing just the song

don't tread on me and I thought that's

the message I gotta send this kitty a

few notes into the DA and he quickly

backed off he literally turned and took

off in the bush and was gone but since

posting about the experience on social

media she's been far from being left

alone her story now getting

international attention I've had

probably oh gosh over a hundred radio

stations and new stations contact me in

the last week it's been insane and

Canada over the weekend it's even making

the rounds on the late-night talk shows

this woman came face-to-face with a

cougar and then played Metallica on her

phone to chased it away

the news eventually making its way to

the band at the center of it all I got a

phone call and this deep deep voice said

hi Denise this is James Hetfield of

Metallica an experienced glandt can only

describe as a dream come true just over

the moon while this may have been her

quick thinking or perhaps even Murphy

the Lance likes to think it was a song

that saved her life

that's the stuff now more meaningful

than ever oh that's good I love it I'm

gonna have to download that song yeah

you might just never know when it will

come in handy she was so calm I love

that she got home safe in yeah talk to

James Hetfield's that's a 300 deal it's

amazing

Thanks
