good morning my name is corporal Julie

Kragh Shane I'm the media relations

officer here for the RCMP in Manitoba as

the search for cama cloud and Breyers

Miguel ski continues we were able to

provide the following update last night

at approximately 5:00 p.m. the RCMP

received a tip that two males matching

the description of the wanted suspects

were seen in your landing Manitoba York

Landing is approximately 90 kilometers

southwest of Gilliam and is only

accessible by air or via a two-hour

ferry crossing in the summer there's

also a rail line that runs approximately

25 kilometres south of the community

based on the information received the

RCMP immediately deployed multiple

resources to the community including the

emergency response team police dog

services containment team members major

crime services and air services assets

officers searched the the York landing

area throughout the night and continue

their efforts today the Royal Canadian

Air Force is also assisting today with

the search our officers are on on the

ground have not made contact with the

individuals and so we are not yet in a

position to confirm that these are the

wanted suspects our goal today remains

to safely locate apprehend and identify

the individuals we understand that this

is a trying time for the community of

York landing and that there's a lot of

uncertainty we want to remind residents

that we have a lot of police resources

in the area and that our priority is

their safety we ask them to remain

vigilant to stay indoors as much as

possible with their doors locked and to

report anything suspicious by calling

their local police immediately thank you

okay I will take some questions

there's been complaints that

there was a confirmed sighting in split

lake and this was prior to the Gilliam

the the vehicle being sent on fire and

Gilliam I am not exactly sure but I know

there was a confirmed sighting in split

Lake and that was prior to the vehicle

fire there's been a lot of complaints

about a lack of information being shared

by police and that that's leading to

some rumors being spread online can you

speak to that I think right now we've

been putting out as much information as

possible like every day we've been

putting out confirmed details because we

want to be the source that the the

public and the media comes to so that

it's verified and accurate details

I think that some of the misinformation

being spread over social media does

create issues and so we just want to

remind everybody that if there is

something you see on social media

contact us send it to us so we can

confirm that you know what right now our

priority is to try and identify and

locate these two individuals so we can

confirm who they are so you know

everything we're still looking at every

possibility in this investigation does

it take away from your investigation

when you hear rumors or people come in

saying we think we spotted them on the

perimeter or elsewhere does that hinder

your investigation or take away from it

because resources are then having to go

to that well we're making a plea to the

public to send in tips and to call us so

we want that so if someone does see

something or know something yes

definitely call us and we will look into

that and then as soon as we can confirm

details of that we will let you know

escucha pizza party up there the

confidence get a porn set Castillo plus

walk Nazi sorry go ahead the Air Force

is now involved why now

well the military has been assisting us

but today they are going to be there

with their plane to assist in the search

we're trying to get as many resources

that we have available to us there so we

can identify who these individuals are

how is the bear clan help I'm just gonna

let her

right now we got a credible tip in York

landing and so right now that's what

we're investigating not that I know of

any credible tip sigh but I can't say

for sure if there's been tips coming in

because we've had them like over 200

tips coming in can you talk about the

bear clans help Bernie can you speak to

about the bear clans help in this search

in the past few days I can't speak

specifically because I'm not entirely

sure of exactly where the tip came from

and all that but I can say that we are

asking the public to keep you know

letting us know calling in tips giving

us information and if the bear clan is

one of them for sure to keep doing that

you elaborate on a kind of tip you

receive in your planning right now all I

can tell you is that we got a credible

tip in the York landing area and so

that's where we deployed resources so we

can try and identify who these

individuals are can you speak to the

challenges

it's very similar to like the search

area is very similar to Gilliam like its

northern Manitoba so it is challenging

terrain lots of force

lots of muskeg waterways everything like

that this has been a week possibly that

they've been up in in northern Manitoba

or even longer what kind of toll would

that take on somebody who might not have

a car who's possibly out in the bush

well right now I mean we can speculate

over different sorts of things but right

now we're what we want to do is just

identify especially right now this tip

and see who these individuals are we

want to identify them we're using as

much resources as possible putting them

in the area to confirm that that's

correct right we want to we need to find

them and identify them and then go on

from there

or the Nursia members our team members

that are up there it's been challenging

for for the RCMP members up there and

all all the resources that are up there

searching

however our number one priority again is

to find these individuals so that we can

at least go from there

chief constant said there's been heavy

winds and that might have hampered some

of the drone activity has weather

conditions dr. dinner kind of hindered

some of your efforts in these

communities as for weather condition

conditions definitely so the logistics

even I think this is northern Manitoba

so when we get a tip it's not just you

know you can drive there in 20 minutes

this is okay now we need flights we need

to get our members out there so the

logistics of that the darkness the

terrain all that is is obviously things

that are tough to deal with can you

speak to how many resources you guys

have up there I know you've given us

quite a list over the past few days but

obviously more extensive people like

people going up again more members being

added every day or are you guys kind of

at your search capacity I would say like

I can't speak to specifics but yeah we

have members going in all the time

depending on the circumstances and what

is happening so it's it's a lot of

resources being deployed right now

last week wearing right now I believe

the last it's well over 200 I don't know

specifically how many but still lots of

tips coming in and we still urge the

public if they have any information they

see anything to please call us

so right now in regards to resources and

manpower we are ensuring that our

members get relief and we're having a

lot that's why we have so many resources

deployed all the time in regards to

start your second question I think

there's been lots of additional training

for members as well so that you know we

ensure that our members are up that are

up there are able to to do this job and

to to deal with the challenging terrain

and everything like that

make contact with these two individuals

have any of your members actually had a

sighting of them

so right now we have not made contact

with them so we still need to try and

locate them and identify who these

individuals are we have asked the

community to be vigilant to stay indoors

to to lock their doors and to call us if

they see anything suspicious

so you did say that there had been one

confirmed sighting in split Lake

possibly that this Constable's up there

had stopped a car can you get us that

information as to whether or not that

was the same sighting or if it was I can

get that information for you and was it

RCMP that asked the bear clan to help or

did they do you have any information

about I don't know helped you guys with

or the specifics on that and hopefully I

can get that information all right thank

you very much
