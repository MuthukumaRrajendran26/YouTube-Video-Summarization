Canadians will have a clear choice to

make this October between a new

Conservative government one that will

live within its means to put more money

in your pocket so that you can get ahead

or re-elected Liberal government under

Justin Trudeau who has spent the last

four years making life more expensive

while rewarding his friends and

punishing his critics now Trudeau

can't run on his record he can't

possibly defend all of his broken

promises massive deficits tax increases

and ethical and corruption scandals

that's why he's dredging up divisive

social issues trying to distract

Canadians from his litany of failures as

of today Trudeau will not attend to

important leaders debates the Maclean's

magazine CTV debate and the monk debate

on Canada's foreign policy these debates

shape how Canadians make their decision

at the ballot box and Trudeau is trying

to basically shut them down because he's

afraid to defend his record by refusing

to attend these debates Trudeau wants to

force their cancellation and Rob

Canadians of an opportunity to see him

held to account this is wrong and this

is a lack of leadership so I urge Justin

Trudeau to show some courage show up to

defend his record and his decisions over

the last four years

decision

they say Katra Daniel any merci beaucoup

she provoked SEO hi mr. sheer thanks for

taking our questions we were hoping to

seek some clarity from you today

you've said in the past that your MPs

would be able to introduced bills on

matters of conscience and you said

you're 100% behind that so can you

clarify today whether backbench MP s

will be able to introduce motions or

bills on issues touching on abortion or

same-sex marriage and if you would allow

a free vote for both your caucus and

cabinet on such matters

well I've always been very clear nothing

has changed for our party on this issue

this is the same we operate under the

same policies as the previous

Conservative government under Stephen

Harper which is that individual MPs have

the right to express themselves on

matters of conscience but that a

Conservative government will not reopen

these divisive social issues

and so that is our position that has

always been our position case and can

have confidence these issues will not be

reopened under a future Conservative

government and it's really just the

Liberals who are pushing this trying to

distract from their record of failure

corruption and scandal trying to dredge

up issues from long ago that are an

attempted to buy Keynes and distract

from their own scandals so our position

on these issues has always been very

clear our party Constitution grants

recognizes the the rights of individual

MPs but it also recognizes that a

Conservative government will not reopen

these types of issues and I wasn't sure

that happens wait - remedy a no-show

thank you for taking these questions can

you go past a little bit the talking

points and talk about your own faith

your critics and rivals have emphasized

that you've grown up in a deeply

faithful household you maintain a deeply

faithful house well can you talk about

that and reconcile how your personal

faith fits with the abortion question

well I think it's very clear that as

Prime Minister of Canada I will govern

for all Canadians and while every

independent Worsham will they face

punishment from you you know I know the

Liberals are trying to create

hypothetical situations I I have worked

with my caucus over the last two years I

know that we're all focused on the

things that unite us our caucus

understands that there is a diversity of

opinion on this among Canadians and and

we are the only party that recognizes

or their personal believes do you still

believe that the ability for partners to

procreate is essential to marriage as

you want to stole the House of Commons

so my personal views are that all

Canadians have inherent dignity all

human beings have inherent dignity and

Worth and I will always support quality

rights for all Canadians including LGBT

Canadians this issue was settled long

ago it was an open question and members

of all parties had different positions

on it today it is the law of the land

and I will always uphold that law Sir

Simon Dingley from CBC News you say your

your views on same-sex marriage as

defined by law have changed how have

they personally change your own views on

this issue mm-hmm well as I said my

personal views are that LGBT cain's have

the same inherent South self-worth and

dignity that is every other Canadian and

I'll always uphold the law and always

ensure that they have equal access to

the institution of marriage as it exists

under the under the law this is an issue

that was settled 15 years ago and it is

completely hypocritical for the Liberals

to to try to bring this up now to divide

Canadians to use this issue for

political partisan purposes especially

when it was put out by a member of

parliament who himself had voted against

same-sex marriage so clearly Canadians

have moved on from this issue it was a

matter of debate 15 years ago it has

been settled I will recognize that it

has been settled and my personal views

are that every single human being has

the same inherent self-worth and dignity

I'll always stand up for the Equality

rights of LGBT Canadians there are many

there are many ways to support the

community

I myself have put forward a motion in

the House of Commons calling on the

government to do more to ensure that

gays and lesbians who face persecution

around the world are able to come to

Canada to to be free from that type of

persecution I'll continue to advocate

for that as Prime Minister I also

represented our party in the historic

apology to civil servants who are

persecuted because of their sexual

orientation I was very proud to be able

to do that on behalf of my party

so I'll continue to support the

community and as Prime Minister Keynes

could have confidence that all can you

every

regardless of their faith their race

their ethnic background their sexual

orientation or their identity has the

same equality rights is a co-ed wha

suitengu rama conservator just to

clarify so some Quebec conservative

candidates chose to run because they

were assured that there would be no

bells no motions no discussion of the

abortion issue whatsoever in a

Conservative government so what do you

say to those candidates now that some of

them are concerned that that may not be

the case well I don't believe I don't

accept the premise of the question the

nothing has changed for our party our

party position on this has always been

the same and members of parliament who

are running for re-election and new

candidates know that we are the only

party that respects the difference of

opinion on this and many other issues we

believe that we are a big tent party and

we welcome people who have different

perspectives on it on any number of

issues but when we come together we work

as a team and that is the the the the

certainty that Canadians can have

confidence in that a Conservative

government will not reopen this issue

and that I is Prime Minister will oppose

measures that reopen this issue and that

is something that Canadians can be sure

of and it's really just the Liberals who

are trying to bring up these types of

divisive social issues to distract from

their own hit and their own

of scandal their hidden agenda for

higher taxes and for future scandals

that this is the same playbook that

they've run since 2004 when I first ran

for Parliament every election cycle as

we get closer to the election they try

to spread fear amongst Canadians on

these types of social issues it has

never been the case where a Conservative

government has allowed this type of

issue to be reopened and that will

continue to be the case under under my

leadership as Prime Minister mr. fear

regarding the the 2005 video of your

position opposing same-sex marriage at

the time do you look back on what you

said then and have any regrets I mean

you use an analogy of a dog's tail and

not in your speech opposing same-sex

marriage how do you view your own

remarks in that video and and how have

you changed if you've changed well as

you'll remember this was a debate that

was held in 2005 it was a major change

to an institution in our country and

many people expressed their views in a

number of on each side of this issue I

know that many Liberal MPs current

sitting Liberal MPs voted against

same-sex marriage the issue is settled

my personal views are that every single

Kane has the same quality rights under

the law and I will continue to uphold

that and I think it's you know - it's so

hypocritical for the Liberals - to reach

back 15 years ago to try to divide Kane

it's not an issue that is settled that

Kane's know is not going to be revisited

in a desperate attempt to distract from

their failures and their scandals so I

will always as Prime Minister stand up

for equal access under law for all

Canadians including LGBT Canadians let's

defend their rights both here and abroad

no I mean I think sorry that was more

than the other other issue that you

brought up our party supports their

equality rights of all alkanes including

LGBT canes and and there's no question

that there were not be attempts to to

revisit that issue I can be very very

clear on that sir speaking of being

clerk can you be clear when your opinion

changed on this issue and why this issue

was settled in 2005 the Parliament had a

vote Cannes Heather say and in two

elections and Society has moved on past

from that and and I accept that and and

as Prime Minister I will always uphold

the law as it stands which grants that

right to to LGBT Canadians as I said you

know it's it's it's a question of as

Prime Minister I will ensure the

Equality of Rights of all LGBT Canadians

and I have always believed that that

there is inherent dignity and inherent

self self-worth in every single human

being this is an issue that was decided

by Parliament 15 years ago 14 years ago

I accept that and I think Canadians are

I think most gains were surprised that

the Liberals were attempting to dredge

this type of thing up I mean it's no

coincidence that every time we get close

to an election cycle the Liberals search

for these types of things to try to

divide Canadians that that speech was

given in the House of Commons in front

of the television cameras for Hansard it

was arguments that were being made by

similar types of arguments that many

people were making other arrogance were

made on other sides of the issue a vote

was held it was settled Keynes who moved

on I've moved on

we're focused on ensuring that the

Equality of Rights of all Canadians are

will always be upheld

Pascal name papili lately tax a living

sure it's always been my position that

we will cancel the carbon tax so there

won't be a need for provinces to prepare

lawsuits to the Supreme Court because

we're going to scrap it and and so the

voters in in provinces where the carbon

tax is being imposed can have confidence

that job one for a Conservative

government the first piece of

legislation that we will propose will be

called an act to cancel the carbon tax

so we know that the carbon tax is making

the cost of living higher and it's not

doing anything to reduce greenhouse gas

emissions we also know that the Liberals

have a hidden agenda on this tax

Catherine McKenna just the other day

alluded to the fact that she was going

to raise it after the next election then

tried to walk it back and then gave the

excuse as to why she wasn't answering

questions was because she was worried

about winning her own seat so that tells

you all you need to know about the

Liberals plan for the carbon tax it will

go up it will make life more expensive

it will do nothing to reduce emissions

and that is why we're fighting so hard

against it and that is why our first act

will be called an act to repeal the

carbon tax as I said the other speech

that I gave in 2005 was it was done in

Parliament in front of the television

cameras on Hansard I mean for the

Liberals to try to put out that they

unearthed it somehow you know the

it's it's it just speaks to their level

of desperation and and hypocrisy these

are arguments that were being put

forward by many people who help views on

this issue as Canada was about to change

are very fundamental of a very important

institution in our country that issue is

settled we accept that we accept the

fact that LGBT Canadians have access to

marriage laws in Canada we will always

uphold that this is an issue that was

settled long ago

it is only liberals who are trying to

bring it up again to divide Canadians

and to distract from their own record of

scandal and corruption thank you very

much like as I said you know the these

were these are conversations that were

being held at the time these are

conversations and arguments that were

being put forward by others in in

mainstream publications at the time

obviously today these are not the types

of things that we would bring up again

these are these are not issues we were

we would revisit in anyway this issue

has been settled back in 2005 Canadians

had their say parliament has passed the

law I will always uphold that law and

ensure that LGBT Canadians have the same

access under it

thank you

Oh

you
