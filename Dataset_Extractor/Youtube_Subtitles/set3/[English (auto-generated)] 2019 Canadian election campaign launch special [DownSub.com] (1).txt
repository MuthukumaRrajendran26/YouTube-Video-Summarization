this is a global news special

presentation good morning Canada it is

about to kick-off the 43rd federal

election campaign will get underway

within minutes we are waiting for Prime

Minister Justin Trudeau to walk into

Rideau Hall in Ottawa the official

residence of the governor-general and

asked her to dissolve Parliament which

will begin the process of issuing the

writs of election a writ is that formal

written order instructs the returning

officer in every electoral district to

hold an election to elect a member of

parliament and in this country there are

338 of them and whoever wins a majority

of those seats forms the next government

unless of course no single party gets a

majority in which case we'll have a

minority government which is something

certainly in play this year we're going

to continue to watch Rideau Hall there

hello I'm Donna Freese and thanks for

joining us we're so happy you could be

with us on this Wednesday morning

whether you're watching us on TV online

or listening to us on global news radio

if you're a political junkie there are

lots of them in this country this is

your moment the country is in for 40

days and 40 nights of non-stop political

drama and if you're not into politics

hey lek I I get it but here's my pledge

to you we are here to make this whole

process as informative as interesting

and as painless as we can so that you

are armed with as much information as we

can deliver to help you decide who to

vote for and in the end of course your

vote counts that's what this is all

about every single vote counts it's your

country this is your chance to play a

role in who runs it it is a privilege

and a right

billions of people shear Mike look at

sure is in London Ontario where the NDP

leader jug meets Singh is this morning

and Richards us Minh is in Victoria BC

that's where Green Party leader

Elizabeth May will be kicking off the

green campaign and our chief political

correspondent David akin is in Winnipeg

my hometown yay because he was involved

in provincial election coverage there

last night and in our Ottawa studio we

have some wise political minds liberal

strategist Richard

ma honey the NDP strategist and McGrath

jean-luc cook his presidents of the

Green Party and a candidate in this

election and in Toronto we have

Conservative strategist Fred de Laurie

also in Toronto pollster Darrell Bricker

from it sews and with me here in

Vancouver is Charles Adler host of

Charles Adler tonight on the global news

radio network hi there Charles hey so

let's start with Mercedes Stevenson at

Rideau Hall Mercedes we have fixed

election dates now we knew the date was

going to be October 21st we just didn't

know when the campaign would officially

start why today September 11th what kind

of calculation goes into picking the

start date for a campaign well that's a

great question is whenever the parties

believe it will be more advantageous the

party in power so they're looking at

internal polls they're looking at do

they have something they want to drop on

the opposition or perhaps something they

want to have avoid being dropped on them

and there was an awful lot of

speculation around this Donna people

thought they might go on Sunday then

there was the hurricane out in Atlantic

Canada they thought perhaps this coming

Sunday and the reason why sunday is

that's traditional it's usually on a

Sunday morning they couldn't do it on

the same day as the Manitoba election

and a lot of people thought they

wouldn't do it on 9/11 but obviously

they think that will not be a

calculation for voters when they

ultimately cast their ballots on October

21st one of the interesting things I'm

sure the Prime Minister is going to be

asked about today is that report in The

Globe and Mail alleging that the RCMP

we're looking into potential obstruction

of justice in the SNC lavell a scandal

and we're not able to ask questions or

obtain documents from certain witnesses

because of cabinet confidence they will

have to suspend that investigation once

an election starts if it was indeed

under way so they'll be questions about

whether that may have been a factor they

didn't want to go for as long as the

Conservatives did that remember

nine-week campaign in 2015 doesn't tend

to turn out well for incumbents but they

also didn't go for the shortest possible

time so here we are 40 days from

Election Day and Mercedes political

junkies are saying they think this could

be perhaps the most dynamic most

unpredictable election in a long time

because there are five parties running

nationally six in Quebec what's your

sense of what we're in fourth

well the term that I've heard from every

major political party is the Wild West

that this is going to be a Wild West

election no one knows what's going to

happen and that's true of any campaign

if you look back to 2015 people thought

it was really Tom Mulcair's election to

lose and instead you ended up with

Justin Trudeau who is in third place

coming in with a majority government so

anything can blow up on the campaign

trail but here are some key differences

with this election

number one the NDP potentially falling

out of third place number two the Green

Party really emerging as a National

Party that could become very serious and

potentially hold the balance of power if

there's a minority government beyond

that you have social media powerful in a

way that it never has been before

one tweet can go viral within seconds

and we have the existence of third

parties groups like Canada proud that

aren't political parties but they are

trying to influence the outcome of the

election and that's where we also see

things like disinformation and concerns

about foreign influence that we really

haven't seen in Canadian elections

before alright Mercedes Stevenson

outside reader hall we're gonna come

back to you let's go to David akin our

chief political correspondent who as I

said is in Winnipeg where the provincial

Conservatives won second majority

government there in an election last

night that'll be a boost of course for

the federal conservatives as they head

into this campaign David you've seen how

much the tide can turn in a single

campaign we watched that happen in 2015

with Justin Trudeau turns out 78 days

was great for him because he was able to

go from underdog to prime minister how

much do campaigns matter in 2019 yeah

campaigns matter a whole lot I mean

that's why they do them and certainly

think about to that 2015 campaign we

thought Thomas Mulcair was going to be

Prime Minister in the summer of 2015 he

was leading the polls he was doing very

well but of course in 2015 there was an

appetite for change and eventually the

campaign for the Liberals mattered they

were very effective in 2015

primarily using social media Facebook

that sort of thing to find voters get

them out to the polls that was even the

Conservatives will can see that they got

out campaigned online

gonna be a little different this time

Trudeau has going to have to defend a

record that's a bit dodgy Mercedes was

just talking about this RCMP SNC lavell

an investigation that's going to be

weighing on them the Conservatives are

smart and they've got a lot of money

they have the most money of anybody in

this campaign they're gonna use it to be

very targeted with online ads ads on

television networks and as I think we've

all heard they've actually got someone

to write a song the guy who helps Bryan

Adams write a song has been hired to

write their campaign song so they're

spending money everywhere they can

because campaigns matter we're just

gonna come back to in a sec that David

we're watching the Prime Minister Justin

Trudeau and his wife Sophie

Gregoire Trudeau walking hand-in-hand to

the Governor General's residence Rideau

Hall and he will go inside for this

appointment with the Governor General

who will dissolve the 42nd Parliament

and issue the Ritz for the next federal

election which will begin I guess the

moments those writs are issued so that's

a this is a formal process that takes

part camera it takes place cameras not

allowed in there as this happens we do

expect though the Prime Minister will

emerge and not too long from now and

come out and set the tone for the for

the campaign and take some questions as

well we're gonna hear from all of the

party leaders today after the campaign

is officially launched David let's go

back to you what do you having having

covered all of the the ups and downs

through this Prime Minister's four years

in office what do you think is his

greatest vulnerability as he heads into

this campaign

[Music]

I think that the liberals were most

vulnerable from the left side on the

progressive side listen they're still

working with Stephen Harper's climate

change targets four years ago Prime

Minister Trudeau promised electoral

reform that's a real favorite with green

and NDP voters he's been slow to take

action on pay equity I could go down the

list on things on the left side of the

spectrum that he's vulnerable on that's

where I think it's it's going to be

toughest for him he is blessed in a

sense right now that the parties on the

Left are really fighting over fourth

place that's the New Democrats they're

broken and we heard they they still need

130 candidates and the Green Party is

moving up that's a strengthened Green

Party but you know if they win four

seats that would be a real surprise so

Trudeau's lucky in that sense that he's

not going to see a very sustained attack

on his left flank and I think as they

say that's where he's chiefly vulnerable

if the Conservatives start talking about

the promises broken on deficits debt

reduction that sort of thing I don't

think they're going to get a lot of

traction with voters we saw that I think

in 2015 that mild deficits which is what

we still have relatively speaking

voters have by and large shrug so tough

for the Conservatives you're gonna have

a hard time chipping away at Trudeau's

right flank he's wide open on the left

flank

all right David akin thank you as we

watch for the prime minister to emerge

from rideau hall let's go to our Michael

Couture who is in London Ontario today

he'll be covering the NDP campaign he is

with NDP leader jug meet Singh Mike jug

beat Singh only recently won a seat in

the House of Commons he is the underdog

going into this campaign does he see

himself that way yeah he definitely does

and all of this talk that we've heard so

far throughout the show by Mercedes and

David saying that the underdogs in the

last two elections were really the ones

that came up and outperformed the others

his music to the ears the NDP in fact

Charlie Angus you know one of those

stall words of the NDP most recently

said this feels a lot like 2011 where

everybody count that counted them out as

the third-place party the problem is

though if you look at the polls in the

reality on the ground is it doesn't look

like they're going to emerge from third

place whatsoever

some have even dubbed this they save the

furniture tour because of where they're

going and how they're going about it

consider this sauna they've got a plane

for this campaign this national campaign

for only thirty of the forty days the

rest of the time they're gonna be on a

bus and they say that it's the

concentrate in areas like southwestern

Ontario where we are now lower B C

mainland and of course Vancouver Island

those are all areas where the NDP is

extremely strong and whether or not

they're actually gonna try and spread

their wings and gain too many seats is

really the question but whether or not

he sees himself as as the underdog I

think the expectations are extremely low

for Doug meeting right now and he

probably relishes that and trying to

prove a lot of people wrong whether or

not though he will connect with voters

and whether or not he can grow the seat

count here is another question

altogether there are some rumblings of

you know getting the seats up to 26

that's actually down from 40 for where

we are right now Donna so they do have

that underdog mentality in fact the back

of his bus is the back of jug meat sings

with his hands raised almost like rocky

wearing a leather jacket so he's trying

to fully embrace that underdog mentality

and whether or not he'll win the fight

on October 21st is another question

altogether

you know Mike David they can mention

that the NDP still needs to nominate a

hundred and thirty candidates is that

number did I hear that right we just

heard from the party today they have 253

as of today they're hoping as of

September 13th on Friday to have 271

anybody who can do the math knows that's

well short of the 338 that you need for

a full roster trying to get people to

join the NDP is a real question will

they just be filling their roster with a

number of paper candidates that's a

possibility the part the party promised

they won't be just paper candidates

remember famously Ruth Ellen Barroso

InBev team asked you know Jay was the

one that one famous one during the

orange wave of 2011 who was a paper

candidate in one don't think that's

going to happen in this election but

they are having a really difficult time

raising and recruiting candidates and

anybody who knows politics knows that's

a real problem especially during an

election campaign all right Mike look at

or with the NDP campaign in Ontario for

now thank you let's go to Richard's us

Minh in Victoria

he's with the green campaign that's

Elizabeth May will be making her debut

in the campaign in Victoria it's a real

stronghold for the Green Party which has

become a provincial force across this

country electing MLAs in a number of

provinces more of a force of politically

in this country than it's ever being

Richard a federal a what really are the

hopes for the Green Party in this

election Donna the Green say they're

running a coast-to-coast campaign but

really this is a campaign focused on the

coasts especially here in Vancouver

Island you mentioned provincial II the

Greens hold the balance of power in the

BC legislature with three MLAs the party

is targeting every federal seat on

Vancouver Island there are six seats

right now the Greens

hold two of them those are six that they

have their eyes on there will be a lot

of time spent here those two MPs or

obviously Elizabeth May the leader and

Paul Manley who recently won in a

by-election the party is optimistic that

they can make inroads here on Vancouver

Island then you go all the way to the

other part of the country where the

party has their eye on Prince Edward

Island where right now they are the

official opposition and the provincial

legislature there they have hopes in

three of the four ridings in PEI they

also have eyes in New Brunswick where

they have three provincial

representatives again these are all

breakthroughs for the Greens who a

decade ago had just one representative

and Elizabeth May across the country and

so they're focused and federally on New

Brunswick the one blip is Ontario where

a Mike Schreiner one as an MPP in

Ontario and Guelph

the party and Elizabeth May will be

focused there during the federal

election

to hopefully pick that up federally as

well it's been a rough week Oh Donna for

the greens a lot of these sort of

hot-button issues have come up and

Elizabeth May keeps talking about how if

anybody's elected for the greens they

will have three votes Oh Pierre nan tell

who is now a green MP in Quebec came out

yesterday saying that he would vote very

quickly for Quebec to separate if he

could and there should be another vote

you know national unity obviously isn't

on the ballot here but it's one of those

issues that will come after Elizabeth

May through this campaign as she's asked

about rogue statements made from

candidates across the country through

the campaign all right Richard Sussman

in Victoria with the Green Party

campaign thank you so much well there

are no lawn signs up yet but wait for it

they will be soon if you're involved in

politics you know the unofficial

campaign of course has been underway all

summer long the party platforms are not

all out yet but some pre campaign ads

are and they lay out the slogans and the

themes of what's to come

here's a taste of them I got into

politics to help people like the people

I've served here in Papineau for more

than a decade people who work hard to

make ends meet parents who want to build

a better life for their kids Canadians

who want our country to stand for

something positive in a world that's

grown darker conservative politicians of

a different approach when we raised

taxes on the wealthiest 1% so we could

cut them for the middle class they tried

to stop us when we created the Canada

child benefit that gives hundreds of

dollars a month tax-free and regular

families across the country they tried

to stop that too and now we've got a

real climate plan that will reduce

and put more money in your pockets and

are even trying to fight that the

conservatives like to say they're for

the people but then they cut taxes for

the wealthy and cut services for

everybody else in October we've got a

choice to make

keep moving forward and build on the

progress we've made or go back to the

politics of the Harper years I am for

moving forward for everyone

my plan for Canadians lower the cost of

living and leave more money in your

pockets I believe that Canadians across

this country are so frustrated because

they're working so hard and they're

following all the rules but they feel

like they're falling further and further

behind or that they're barely getting by

I have a plan to lower the cost of

living to make life more affordable to

leave more money in the pockets of

Canadians for their kids for themselves

or for their aging parents because it's

time for you to get ahead people tell me

I'm different from the other leaders and

I am I don't work for the wealthy and

well-connected

I don't think government should be run

for their benefit like it has for

decades

I believe that government should work

for all of us

investing in healthcare

cutting costs or families and tackling

the climate crisis not just saying the

right things but actually doing them now

that's different

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

we're going to dig into those election

ads and some of the party platforms with

some strategists and much in just a

moment we want to remind you you are

watching live coverage of election

decision I guess 43 we're about to

kick-off the 43rd federal election

campaign and we welcome all of you who

are watching online listening on the

radio or watching us on TV across the

country let's go to our Abigail Beeman

who is with the Conservative leader

Andrew Shearer we wanted to check in on

that campaign his campaign a plane is

already in the air and we've just been

told that it was headed to 12 Riviera

Quebec but has been reroute it has to

land in Quebec City because of fog so

right out of the blocks the

Conservatives running into a little bit

of trouble not getting to the

destination that they'd hoped our

Abigail Beeman is on the campaign plane

she hopped on board at Ottawa Airport

and she recorded this just before she

went on Andrew Shearer heads to both

Quebec and Ontario today hitting two key

battlegrounds on day one of the campaign

the Conservatives will launch their

campaign in 12 Riviere now this is a

seat that the Conservatives have not

held for decades but it's one they've

had their eye on for a while it has been

held by the NDP since the orange wave of

2011 and the incumbent is running again

but the Conservative candidate is

well-known a former mayor for that city

now the overall message of the

conservative campaign is around

affordability the campaign slogan it's

time for you to get ahead and you will

hear ender Shearer talking about how he

plans to make daily life more affordable

for Canadians over and over again

throughout the campaign for the next few

weeks after Quebec Shearer heads to

Woodbridge Ontario that is a riding that

the Liberals won narrowly in 2015 and

it's part of a key battleground that

you'll hear about over and over

throughout this campaign the 905 the

seats around Toronto or the Greater

Toronto Area Conservatives will spend a

lot of time there trying to win back

seats they lost to the Liberals in 2015

back to you Donna

all right Abigail Beeman saying swell

the point of campaigns is to convince

you a certain candidate and

a certain party has the best plan for

running the country it is the party

strategists who help plan how to do that

and communicate the platform figure out

a way to win your vote let's go to our

panel of wise political minds and

strategists we've just seen the ads and

all the parties want to be seen as in it

for the little guy being seen as in

touch with what the people want

all of them are already busy attacking

their opponents too sometimes saying

things that aren't actually true as much

as putting forward their own ideas

Richard MA honey let's start with you

the liberal slogan is choose forward but

the ad that's come on already keeps

looking back Trudeau even mentions the

previous Prime Minister Stephen Harper a

number of times you know Justin Trudeau

beat him last time why can't he just let

that go and really move forward well

because I think campaigns are about

choices and in the liberal strategy to

talk about choosing forward what you're

setting up is a choice for Canadians a

choice between building on the progress

that mr. Trudeau has had over the last

two years to focus on the child benefit

for more money in people's hands putting

raising taxes on the well to do to

finance that dealing with the challenges

of climate change as opposed to what Mr

Shearer and the Conservatives represent

which is really a continuation of what

the Harper years were so that's a choice

and I think you'll hear that dawn

throughout the campaign not just this

week but right and talked over twenty

first elections are about choices and

you can expect mr. Trudeau to highlight

that all right Fred de Laurie in Toronto

what's the strategy to broaden the

conservative tent and coax enough voters

to take a chance on Andrew Shearer will

you be touting his skills and policies

or spend a lot of time attacking his

opponent Justin Trudeau I'll be talking

about their plan to make Canada more

affordable to help families and

individuals of course it's it's a

challenge to not always talk about mr.

Trudeau's problems that he continually

continuously falls into we found out

today that the RCMP is investigating as

obstruction of justice of mr. Trudeau

and his government and Canadians are

going to want to be talked

sure but we want to stick to the

positive as much as we can mr. mr.

shears going to travel the country he's

going to be talking to voters across

across the coast one of the interesting

things is we've already knocked on over

four million doors we've had individual

conversations with Canadians and our

local campaign teams are ready to

continue hitting those doors and talking

to people that's what our focus is going

to be just a fact check that a little

bit I think the RCMP is looking into

potential obstruction of justice not has

not launched an official investigation

just to clarify the Globe and Mail story

but how does how does the Conservative

Party broaden the tent

what is it do you think that Andrew

Shearer brings to the table that can do

that that Stephen Harper didn't well mr.

Harper was Canada six longest serving

the Prime Minister so let's not forget

that he was very successful he lost the

last election correct Mr Shearer will be

will be presenting a very

forward-thinking platform during this

campaign will be fully costed and

budgeted he's going to put that out and

it'll be very appealing to Canadians and

to its messages it's going to be focused

on putting money back in Canadians

pockets to lowering taxes and helping

every Canadian that they can all right

Ann Ann McGrath you knew Democrats are

not in exactly a strong position as this

campaign kicks off a lot of candidates

still not nominated in ridings in some

polls the greens are now coming out

ahead of the NDP what's the strategy to

turn things around for the NDP well

first of all I have to say that election

campaigns excuse me are a really good

opportunity to sort of level the playing

field and give Canadians an opportunity

to see the leaders in a less mediated

way than than between elections I

thought that the campaign ads were all

actually quite good and lay out the

issues very well and you can see that

Janet sings campaign is going to be

focused on talking about whose side

whose side we're on and I think that

Canadians know the NDP they know what we

fight for they know what we stand for we

know they know who we stand with and I

think his campaign is going to really

highlight that

he's very warm and and has a kind of a

very good way with people he's very

engaging and his enthusiasm is

infectious so I think Canadians are

gonna get their first impression of him

in this campaign and they're gonna like

what they see and they're gonna see that

he's he is in it for them I think that

the slogan is perfectly appropriate with

respect to any of the challenges that

the that the party faces right now you

know I've been in a lot of campaigns and

money has never been our you know we've

never have gone into a campaign flush

with money sometimes have been better

than others but certainly I have seen

campaigns where we have been outspent

significantly and still done better than

people expected so I you know while I

accept that there are some challenges

there I believe that we will overcome

them and with and and regarding the

number of candidates you know you talked

before about paper candidates I don't

think there is any party that hasn't had

paper candidates in the past and in some

cases those so-called paper candidates

have not only one but have gone on to be

really elected time after time and been

excellent representatives for their

parties and for their constituents all

right and regrets thanks let me go to

Jean Luc Cooke from the Green Party John

Luke your party is the one with apparent

momentum going into this campaign the

greens are polling higher than ever

before in this country you need to

translate that into votes and that means

drawing votes from other parties who are

you targeting predominantly a varies

from riding to riding we have some

writings which are traditional liberal

strongholds or obviously we're drawing a

lot of support from there obviously the

Green Party sees Canadians is not being

partisan the vast majority of Canadians

don't subscribe to either or any

political party so we are really going

after the voters who aren't committed

who aren't locked in voters who are

looking for for a change they don't want

to hear the banter of a different

political parties they want to know how

the country is going to move forward

address the major challenges of our time

climate change being one electoral

reform would be a great way to to

address that and I think that the green

party slogan really reflects this not

left not right forward together my

colleagues here whatever the result of

the election looks like probable

minority government the Green Party is

going

is going to need to work with all the

political parties to tackle these

problems all right gentlemen cook thanks

and thank you to all our strategists

we'll keep you holding there as we wait

for the prime minister to emerge from

Rideau Hall and the Ritz are finally

been issued in the campaign is underway

before we get to that I want to thank

you all for joining us for this live

news special on global news and on

global radio we're being simulcast a

global radio to the home of Charles

Adler who has his Charles Adler tonight

a program and he's joining us as part of

our pre election coverage Charles so

good that you could be here and can you

give us your sense of who benefits most

from a 40-day campaign shorter than the

one four years ago who has in your view

the advantage going into this the the

advantage when it's a short campaign is

the incumbent so in this case it's

Justin Trudeau's liberals that the fact

that they wanted to get it almost as

close as possible to the five weeks

which is the minimum which would have

been this coming Sunday shows you that

there's a little bit of a trepidation in

the Trudeau camp Donna in this segment

that you just did what was most

fascinating to me was the conservative

strategist because right out of the gate

he was talking about obstruction of

justice you naturally did your job and

corrected him and saying that they

weren't doing a and obstruct the RCMP

wasn't doing an obstruction of justice

investigation they were poking around to

see if there ought to be one but I think

that that's what the Conservative Party

will be talking about on both social

media and conventional media planting

the seed that the Trudeau government is

corrupt and I think corruption is a word

that plays very well in the conservative

camp certainly with a conservative base

and you know the the the wounds that the

Liberal Party have suffered in the last

year last four years have been largely

self-inflicted the SNC saga chief among

them that the the the opposition only

had to sit back and watch it unfold look

you know the the opposition is blessed

with a woman who's not a member of the

Opposition Judy Wilson Raybould

she's out there the media constantly

wants to interview her she's got a lot

of credibility she had a lot of

credibility at that committee hearing

most Canadians got to see either the

entire testimony that she off

or sound bites of it they're still very

available and they get downloaded a lot

on on YouTube so the fact that Jodi

Wilson rebel did what she did and it

would appear from the latest Globe and

Mail story it would confirm that there

is a there there that it wasn't just a

spat between Jodi Wilson Reybold and the

prime minister and the fact that Jane

Philpott also left also adds to all of

it but I think it'll be impossible for

the Prime Minister to go through this

40-day campaign without being peppered

with questions from the media and of

course during the the one english debate

that he's agreed to in the the two

french debates I think SNC Lavin was

behind them they thought it was but I

think it's it's very much front and

center right now you know I want to ask

you two things about that one you you

talked to a lot of listeners on your

radio show across the country how many

people were paying attention to the

detail of that SNC level and story

because let's face it there is a lot of

detail and a lot of nuance and you had

to get deep into the weeds to kind of

fully understand what deferred

prosecution agreements are and all of

that and secondly how many people have

already made up their minds you know

there are a lot of liberals who say well

people have made up their minds already

we don't really need to convince anybody

else because people have decided you

know it's a it's a fantastic question

the reasons fantastic question is

because there is no body today not yours

truly or anyone else who can give you a

really really solid answer we'll get

Darryl Bricker on shortly from ipsus and

he'll give us some sense of it but the

the idea that we know what's on people's

minds that they've made up their minds

that's why elections are so fascinating

why it's why this is the the great cup

of politics we won't know whether they

made up their minds on this or anything

else until October 21st and the other

question is so you're a disaffected

liberal who has voted last time and the

turnout last time was 68 I think 68

percent almost 69 percent which is very

big for a federal election a lot of that

driven by young voters and people who

were energized by the liberal campaign

and by Justin Trudeau if you're now

disaffected and not sure you want to

park your vote there where do you go

this is another fascinating question for

the campaign because the greens this

week were a complete mess whether it was

the the hot-button of abortion even

separatism came up yesterday so the

Greens seem to be all over the map

the NDP don't even have candidates and

1/3 of their their writings and so

you've got nowhere for them to go safely

no no we're a progressive voters it is

disaffected with the Liberals can go and

feel really really safe that the Greens

or the NDP have any kind of shot at

power and when you're a voter generally

you want your vote to count voting for

parties that are not likely to be part

of the power play aren't terribly

interesting unless people do start to

believe them we'll find out in the

coming weeks whether or not there's a

good chance of a minority government if

there's a good chance of minority

government yeah you'll you'll see if

some progressive voters disaffected with

the Liberals go to either the the greens

of the NDP at the moment I'd say the

Greens have the best shot at picking up

voters and one reason for that is

Elizabeth May I think Elizabeth May is

one of the most popular political

personalities in the country and despite

the the gaffes this week I would still

give her the lead here especially after

the debate I think Elizabeth May is a

fabulous debater and I think she'll

acquit herself extremely well in the

English language debate and she is now

the veteran going into this federal

campaign right she's been at it the

longest compared to the other two I

think she's a relatively safe place for

a progressive to park a vote if if

they're not happy with Justin Trudeau

but you know a big discussion among all

progressive voters will be do you want

four more years of Harper because that's

how it's perceived that the

Conservatives will bring back Harper

well those progressive voters who wanted

to throw Harper the heck out that's

going to be a very important question

for them and they will if they're not

happy with Trudeau many of them will

hold their nose and say vote for Trudeau

anyway vote for the Liberals because

they don't want the Conservatives to

come back you know there are a lot of

people who think maybe a minority

government's not a bad thing for this

country right the average Canadian I

don't care whether it's west east or

middle likes the idea of limiting power

and they believe that whether they're

conservatives who are running the show

or liberals that they perform better

they're more accountable to the public

when the gun is literally to their heads

every day in a minority situation all

right lots to have

in the next 40 days Charles were going

to come back to you thanks Charles

mentioned Darrell Bricker so we're going

to go to Darrell from if sews because

he's kind of got his finger on the pulse

of what Canadians are thinking and

feeling as much as anybody in this

country poling of course doesn't tell a

whole story but it gives us a bit of a

snapshot of where people are at and what

issues are important they're all in in

the work that you've been doing in the

lead-up to this campaign what issues

have risen to the top for Canadians

there's been five that say people say

are the most important issues number one

is health care probably won't play a big

role in the campaign

number two is affordability which all of

the parties are talking about right now

number three relates to taxes which is

really a subset of issue number two

social inequality is a big issue in the

minds of the public so progressive

voters will be very interested in

hearing party answers on that and

interestingly enough given the focus of

some of the advertising we looked at

climate change is number five climate

change it could that be the sleeper of

this campaign for a lot of people it is

the dominant issue it is the only issue

for someone like Elizabeth May and the

Green Party but could it rise from where

you're finding it at number five to too

much more prominent in this campaign

well it depends on whether the parties

want to talk about it interestingly

enough prior to us and see lava live and

some of the things that have happened

over the last couple of months I was

anticipating that it would be a pretty

big issue you've got one side of the

equation the progressive side that wants

to talk about the carbon and you've got

the Conservatives on the other side that

want to talk about the tax and they

really wanted to have that fight but

what's it seems to have petered out a

little bit on in the run-up to the

election now given where the Green Party

is going with with their position and

giving where the NDP is going in order

to be able to attack the progressive

side of the Trudeau agenda you might see

it raise its prominence through the

course of the election campaign

what about attitudes towards politics

and politicians generally all the

parties have variations on the theme of

we're in this for the people which seems

to be a deliberate sort of

anteye elite message why is that what is

it that they're tapping into once it's a

phenomena that we see worldwide in which

there's a whole group of the population

that believes that the economy is rigged

it's working on behalf of a very

exclusive group of the population that

decisions get made and the public really

doesn't understand why they're being

made or why they're in their interests

and they've decided to couch it in these

terms of the people versus everybody

else all right Darrell Bricker from

episode

thanks so much we're gonna come back to

you as we wait for the prime minister to

emerge from Rideau Hall let's go to

Mercedes Stevenson who is outside

waiting for the prime minister Mercedes

you're gonna be heading off almost

immediately on the 40-day campaign with

the Liberal Party with Justin Trudeau

this will be a different campaign for

him than it was back in 2015 there's no

talk of sunny ways this time this really

is his election to lose isn't it it is

and you know what it would be historic

Donna if he lost it because typically

Canadians give governments after one

majority mandate another turn it may not

be another majority but it's usually a

minority and in fact only twice before

in Canadian history has there been a

situation where someone lost after a

majority and getting that for the first

time 1878 and 1935 so certainly the

pressures on therefore Justin Trudeau

but he also has the advantage that

Canadians recognize his name they

recognize his brand he doesn't have to

come from behind now the downside of all

that is he has to run against his own

record broken promises on things for

example like electoral reform the SNC

Laval on scandal which was so counter to

that sunny ways brand and the promise of

transparency and today with that Globe

and Mail story alleging again that

there's obstruction that there's not

transparency in the government that

they're not releasing documents and

there's people who voted for Justin

Trudeau and we know this cuz they told

it to pollsters and we've heard it

anecdotally saying they thought he was

different so they may not vote for him

this time because they believe he's

different but will they be willing to

give someone else a chance that's always

a higher risk in a voters mind

particularly when they don't feel they

know the other candidates as well so an

advantage in being an incumbent because

he's no longer coming from behind but

also the disadvantage that you can't

promise you're something radically

different than the status quo and it's

always easier to poke holes than it is

to build up so I think how you're going

to see Justin Trudeau framing this is

not give me another chance or give me a

chance it'll be let me finish what I

started let me continue the things that

you chose the first time let me have a

chance to implement them and this really

being framed as an election that is

about choice they will see the

Conservatives and try to position them

as going backward and going to Stephen

Harper they will try to contrast that

against the Premier's in the provinces

like Jason Kenney or Doug Ford

particularly in Ontario they will try to

play against Ford's numbers here he's

not been popular and they will say do

you want that federally so that's the

advantages and disadvantages that Justin

Trudeau has coming in but he's a very

strong campaigner because Donna remember

in 2015 no one expected him to win and

he delivered a significant majority yeah

it certainly came from behind back then

I'm Mercedes we're just waiting for the

prime minister we've got a one-minute

warning so we expect to see him shortly

and hear from him just quickly where

where the leaders go is indicative of

where they think they have the strongest

chances and can make gains where is he

going

today we're headed out to you Donna

we're going to be in Vancouver tonight

I'll be on that plane there is a big

campaign rally planned with a former a

television anchor who's running out

there a high-profile female candidate

and certainly Vancouver is gonna rank

really high for the NDP the greens and

the Liberals in this campaign it is one

that they need to take any of them if

they want to do well so I think you're

gonna see all of those three parties

spending significant time out there

starting with mr. Trudeau this evening

and so British Columbia will be a

battleground what's the other big

battlegrounds we should be looking out

for so the other big battlegrounds you

want to look out for are Quebec where we

know from the most recent polling this

morning the Liberals are significantly

ahead but the Conservatives have really

been pushing their ground game they're

trying to gain the NDP needs to at a

minimum maintains

they've been struggling to do hopefully

convince more seats from their

perspective to be able to do half

decently so that's going to be a major

battleground whether it's Montreal or

especially up around Quebec City and in

northern Quebec there's some ridings in

play there that could be three and

four-way splits the other area is the

GTA as we call it the Greater Toronto

Area are the 905 which is the area code

there there's a lot of swing ridings

there and undecided voters and writings

that flip back and forth between the

Conservatives and the Liberals they'll

be driving very hard in that area and

that of course is where drug meets Singh

is launching from today he's in London

Ontario but this will be a really unique

election in terms of seeing elections

particular writing where there's three

and four-way splits between the parties

we've usually seen a three-party system

in many cases mostly - but those splits

that could hive off just a little bit of

the vote could flip ridings in

unexpected directions because of the way

that our political system works in

Canada and it's interesting you know you

you talked about where the party leaders

are going the Conservative Party of

Andrew Shearer is in the air along with

our Abigail Beeman and the rest of the

reporters on route to troll Riviera

Quebec and we've been told that their

plane was rerouted to Quebec City

because of fog don't usually expect

weather to be a factor in a campaign

that's happening in September you know I

mean really if the winter snows a can be

a devil but fog has already derailed

plans for the first day of campaigning

for Andrew Shearer that can't that can't

be a can't be a happy day for those

campaign that can you you wonder you

know the whole thing is it an omen

they'll say no but no campaign wants to

start off with a bump like this

especially when they wanted to pursue

the SNC Laughlin it's not their fault

they've not done something wrong it's

fog but campaigns are funny things the

littlest bump the littlest change can

affect people's perception they're

highly unpredictable that's why we go

into it saying well here are the polling

numbers and Darryl certainly can speak

to this but you don't know what the

outcome is going to be because of those

unexpected things you remember the

conservative campaign bus that broke

down a couple of elections ago and it

seen as a symbol for the conservative

campaign so nobody wants that they're

going to have to try to turn it around

obviously it's a minor thing but it's

fascinating in politics how minor things

that there aren't even mistakes the

campaign has made can be delivered and

that people here we are talking about

the fact that they can't land because of

the fog yeah they're unpredictable

things and you know credit to everyone

who gets involved in political campaigns

in this country the amount of work and

the amount of miles that have to be

covered in this massive country of ours

which is you know we all love and

fantastic but to run a federal campaign

takes a lot of energy a lot of money and

it can be exhausting so I just want to

pay tribute to all of the campaign teams

and the volunteers out there who are you

know making this thing happen we just

got a two-minute warning that the prime

minister will be coming out of Rideau

Hall we got a one-minute warning about

three minutes ago so I don't know do the

math anyway he's late so not not for the

first time he has a bit of a relative

for not showing up at advance on time

Mercedes

what do you think is his greatest

vulnerability going into this campaign

everyone's talking about SNC I am not

completely convinced that Canadians

across this country had as much time to

pay attention to get into the weeds of

that issue as as you and I did and

people who cover politics all the time

do you think that that is his biggest

weakness right now well you know it'll

be interesting to see because the

question is what's happening with the

police it didn't affect him when the

ethics report came out even though it

was a pretty damning report it didn't

move the numbers in the polls because it

seemed like people who'd made their

minds up had already made their minds up

they polarized on it one way or the

other so they didn't take additional

damage although it did damage them back

in the spring when this was all blowing

up in the news so that could be an issue

if we start talking police investigation

because that's a whole other level but

we'd have to see how it plays out I

think the bigger issue are some of the

promises that he made that he wasn't

able to keep and that contrast between

what he actually promised and what he's

able to deliver

like the bloom is off the rose I think

we're just seeing the Prime Minister and

it's Sophie Gregoire Trudeau

the Prime Minister is walking up to the

podium and we'll talk about his campaign

and set the tone for the next 40 days

let's listen I want to begin by

recalling the victims of 9/11 18 years

ago this morning thousands of people

were murdered in brutal acts of terror

in the United States including many

Canadians today as we prepare to

exercise our democratic rights we

recognize and honor their lives may

their memories be a blessing to us all

now see that we see a big new psmith

dinosaur every doe how much for being

here that goes I stole your uncle please

we'll Nix it on Corrections yeah andand

agreeing to dissolve Parliament then go

to the polls on October 21st in every

election as Canadians we get to make an

important choice about the future of our

country we get to decide what kind of

future we want to build together in 2015

after a decade of failed conservative

policy Canada's economy was flat

economic growth job creation wage growth

all were stalled thanks to a

Conservative government that believed

cuts and austerity were the answers to

everything

the Canadian oash huazhi Novelli Kip

Katie Preta FST Danny Jean which was an

honor to invest in people in the

community weaker men team which even

though we live in the best country in

the world always possible to improve let

me tell you that we have a lot of work

left again we've spent the past four

years improving Needham bullet movie and

we have the track record to prove it

poverty has dropped

the unemployment rate is one of the

lowest what in industries to sell

sebastian and all that is our team he

group in austerity these and moved away

from cuts and austerity that we saw

during the harbor year we decided to

invest middle class and people who are

working hard to get their knee in

people's pockets by cutting taxes for

the middle class and raising them on the

wealthiest 1% we stop sending child

benefit checks to millionaires so we

could send more to the single parent

working two jobs and to the family of

five that falls a bit short

at the end of each month we made the

Canada Pension Plan stronger because in

a country like ours seniors shouldn't

struggle to make ends meet we

renegotiated NAFTA securing trade access

to our largest and most important

trading partner at a time of us

protectionism and unpredictability and

we're conserving more of our nature and

ensuring that our air stays clean and

our water stays safe because we owe it

to our kids and to ourselves to take

care of our environment these are things

that are making a real difference in

people's lives

and this fall Canadians once again get

to vote for the kind of Canada they want

to live in we've all got a choice to

make

keep moving forward and build on the

progress we've made or go back to the

politics of the Harper years

conservatives like to say they're for

the people but then they cut taxes for

the wealthy and cut services for

everybody else me company Canadians

south as Canadians know full well this

is not the right way to approach matters

we are not going to get richer by

cutting this is why our government has

decided investing families workers

we chose to have confidence the Canadian

study and over the past four years

videoed the new votes of more than 1

million new jobs on a negotiated new

agreement on help with provinces

territories we introduced the new family

allocation which is helping parents with

hundreds of dollars per year free of

animality don't was brought out 900,000

Canadians out of poverty and under a

Liberal government the Kootenai devil

Canada will continue at the end of the

day politics is about people maybe

you're a recent grad or a new Canadian

maybe you're raising your kids or living

out your golden years in retirement

whoever you are you deserve a real plan

for your future we've done a lot

together these past four years but the

truth is we're just getting started

so Canadians have an important choice to

make will we go back to the failed

policies of the past or will we continue

to move forward that's the choice it's

that clear and it's that important

I'm for moving forward for everyone

good morning Michele zillio with The

Globe and Mail prime minister what is

your government trying to hide by

refusing to waive cabinet confidant

confidentiality so the RCMP can properly

investigate the role your office plays

in the SNC wobbling case we gave out the

largest and most expansive waiver of

cabinet confidence in Canada's history

news even chiffons Euler Sakina greens

that's actually it's wavy cabinet

secrecy in a fashion that's never been

done before in Canadian history

so are you going to ask the Privy

Council clerk to waive cabinet

confidentiality we respect the decisions

made by our professional public servants

we respect the decision made by the

clerk new respect don't do so we respect

the decisions made by public service and

we respect this server the decision of

the Privy Council clerk to you come here

today having four years after you took

power saying conservatives are not our

enemies they're our friends and

neighbors and yet your party is fiercely

attacking the Conservatives demonizing

them I'm wondering how do you what do

you say to your children when you speak

about Andrews share as I've said many

many times I do not engage in personal

attacks but I will be very very sharp on

distinctions around policy on how one

engages with Canadians and the vision

one puts forward that is something that

Canadians deserve in an election to see

clear contrasts between a vision that is

open inclusive and respectful of

everyone's rights and a perspective that

says there for the people but then

delivers cuts to services and cuts to

taxes for the wealthy I just had to

elect so I'm always going to be quite

clear I'm not going to make any personal

attacks however I will be very sharp

when it comes to policy difference

for the country are quite different

there bull approaches positive and that

cluesive and the conservative Pro quite

frankly is designed based on austerity

and giving tax cuts to the wealthy so

we're going to be very clear with the

Danes the choice they're faced with you

have said you take responsibility yet

you disagreed with the ethics find it

report findings you've got a McClellan

report but in all of this time I don't

think Canadians have heard you explain

what you feel you personally did wrong

what were your mistakes in that affair

could you explain to us what you feel

you where you went wrong my job as Prime

Minister is to be there to stand up for

and defend Canadians jobs whether it's

communities right across the country or

pensioners or families I will always

defend the public interest I will always

defend people's jobs

I've been unequivocal about that from

the very beginning and that's what I

will continue to do morning Teresa

Wright The Canadian Press you've

triggered an election today and you're

asking Canadians to vote for you perhaps

you could tell Canadians why they should

trust you to be returned to power when

we still don't know all the details of

the SNC levelin affair despite numerous

attempts and and some of that has to do

with committees with a liberal majority

blocking those details paper we made a

commitment to Canadians to grow the

economy for the middle class and for

people working hard to join it that was

the heart of the promise we got elected

on we have delivered on that by watching

Canadians create well over a million

jobs over the past four years at the

same time as 900,000 Canadians have been

lifted out of poverty our commitment to

invest in communities our commitment to

support and move forward on giving a

real chance to indigenous peoples to

succeed by advancing reconciliation to

move forward on demonstrating that we

understand that growing the economy and

protecting the environment goes together

every step of the way and it's not a

choice of either or anymore these are

the things that we committed to

Canadians to do and this is exactly what

we've done over the past four years we

are the first to recognize

there's an awful lot more to do and I'm

very much looking forward to getting out

and talking with Canadians from coast to

coast to coast over the coming weeks

about our plans to continue building a

better Canada as we all move forward

today is the 18th anniversary of the

September 11th attacks what would you

say to those who might say that it could

be seen as insensitive to be calling an

election on this particular tragic

anniversary as I said in my words in the

beginning the exercise of our

fundamental democratic rights the moment

to engage in reflecting on how we move

forward with a better future for

everyone is a deeply held value with

which we celebrate the successes and the

tragedies of the past we remember all

the families although individuals lost

and the families affected by the

terrible terrible attacks of September

11 2001 and we move forward in pledging

ourselves every day to a better safer

more prosperous society for everyone and

that's what this election is all about

you were quite clear in terms of the

secularism laws in Quebec you don't

really like the law you think it's an

error you come back to power well your

governments actually go to court against

that particular piece of legislation

they're just well yes bill 21 I think in

a free society we should avoid

legitimizing or allowing discrimination

against anyone themselves are doing the

protesting they are actually taking the

liberal the the caq government to court

that would be our approach as well we're

looking closely at the matter we'll see

how things unfold but for right now the

project if we think it would be

counterproductive for the federal

government to get directly involved as

I've said many times

deeply opposed to bill 21 in Quebec I

don't think that in a free society we

should be legitimizing or allowing

discrimination against anyone I'm very

pleased that Quebecers themselves have

choose chosen to contest this bill in

court to stand up and defend the Charter

of Rights and Freedoms

we have been I have been watching very

closely the process I'm considering the

federal potential actions and at this

time I feel it would be

counterproductive for the federal

government to engage in this process

like I said we're watching closely we

will continue to watch things in a

timely fashion as I said we are

following very carefully the process at

this time we feel it would be

counterproductive for the federal

government to engage in the process with

which Quebecers are underway but we will

continue to monitor closely and evaluate

our position

good morning Zealand with HuffPost

Canada Millennials make up the largest

bloc of eligible voters in this election

how do you plan to try to regain young

people's trust specifically those who

might be disappointed you'd promise to

be different and you turned out to be

just like every other politician

I think Canadians of all ages

particularly Millennials have seen the

transformation of our country over the

past four years as we've both created

economic growth and lifted people out of

poverty as we've moved forward on the

most ambitious leadership ever seen by a

Canadian government on protecting the

environment at the same time as we

continue to prepare for future

prosperity for families right across the

country these are the things that young

Canadians expect indeed that all

Canadians expect

I very much look forward to the coming

weeks we'll we will be rolling out a

very ambitious platform designed to help

Canadians look towards the future with

even more confidence than they already

have in this extraordinary country for

you boil a book this morning could you

give us more details you said you're

going to continue to watch things

closely what might actually make you

change your mind and get involved you

know in a free and open society working

the fundamental rights and freedoms we

can't legitimize discrimination citizens

based on religion or anything else for

that matter so that's why we're

concerned by bill 21 CD québécois and I

said earlier compactors themselves have

already decided to contest this in court

they are defending the charter rights

and freedom you don't and so as a record

myself and also as part of the Liberal

government we're watching the process

closely whether or not we need to

intervene or not mehhhh decision pool is

done that's the state of my

decision-making process right now it may

change but right now there's a legal

process underway all right fine but the

question is you're the PM of Canada are

you going to push it right to the end

I'm trying to understand your overall

thinking at one point would you get

involved doesn't seem quite clear anyway

we can get to that later but let me move

into climate change

you seem to be drawing a very clear

contrast between yourself and the

Conservatives the bloc the NDP and so on

how do you think that message is going

to get across in terms of the look

Canadians

understand full well that climate change

is a real threat not just to our

communities not just to the planet but

also to our economy and so that's which

is already acting in terms of protecting

the environment we've done more on the

environment than any other government in

the history of our country but at the

same time we're helping families and

workers to read to landry skill

themselves for the new jobs that will be

available in much more green and clean

environment and economy

so we're working hard to protect the

environment and to boost the economy has

already shown this over the past four

years do so in the future it's really

too bad that the Conservatives still

don't understand that climate change is

a real threat and they are gonna have to

deal with it eventually once again we're

seeing conservative politicians across

this country spending public money to

deny climate change they're not

investing they're actually saying look

the climate crisis is not such a big

deal we in contrast are going to show

through our actions and our commitments

that Canadians expect leadership

concrete on the federal government in

terms of climate change that's the only

way we can protect future generations

and to retool our economy for the future

so what does that mean well we are going

to be very closely followed just to get

back to the previous question about Bill

21 as I said earlier we're following

closely it would be counterproductive to

intervene

I'm from The Canadian Press on the same

issue you said for now so what does that

mean well I have a well that depend on

whether you're minority or majority

government look it doesn't matter we

will always be working hard to defend

the rights of all Canadians whether it

be in Quebec or elsewhere really

enormous Lee appreciate the Charter of

Rights and Freedoms many Quebecers among

those we live in a free and open society

and a lot of Quebecers are thinking we

shouldn't be legitimizing discrimination

against anybody what do you say to

people who say well you actually are

compromising the values of diversity and

inclusion and so on it seems to me I've

always been quite clear on that I don't

think there's one in Quebec er who is

unaware of the fact that I'm the case

bill 21 they know where I stand

my responsibility is that Prime Minister

is to ensure that we defend the rights

of all Canadians that's why I'm very

pleased to see that compares themselves

are actually taking on the government to

court is it because it's right next door

to your former justice minister now

rival Joey Wilson rabble in 2015 we

launched our election campaign by

attending the Pride Parade in Vancouver

and launched it right across the country

and you may remember that there were

many folks assembled here today and in

the press gallery across the city who

decry that it was a terrible mistake to

not be here in Ottawa for the election

launched by the liberal campaign we

demonstrated that campaigns happen out

there across Canada and launching the

campaign in my second home of British

Columbia felt right both in 2015 and it

feels right right now in 2019 I can't

wait to get out to be C to this

afternoon but I'm very much looking

forward to

getting right across the country in the

coming weeks there are a lot of

Canadians to talk to about the important

choice they're facing about whether we

move forward or we go back to the Harper

years I know that Canadians are excited

about the opportunities ahead of us and

I am excited to roll up my sleeves and

keep working for them every single day

do medicai is also a 15 we chose to

launch our despite the fact that many

individuals said that was a big area of

error on our part that we should have

been in Ottawa alone but we showed that

an election campaign is a cross country

affair not just Ottawa eccentric and so

that's why I'm very pleased to be going

to Bank over today that's my second home

actually in DC and I'm going to launch

my campaign there and the upcoming weeks

I'm going to be Criss crossing this

country to make sure I have all the most

important conversations that can be had

with Canadians with respect to choice

for the future are we going to continue

to move forward are we going to go back

to the Harper years tacking you on

questions of ethics how would you

respond to their critique that you are

inauthentic going into this campaign I

think Canadians know very well that I am

focused on making the right choices for

Canadians and moving forward in a way

that benefits the middle class people

working hard to join it that moves

forward on reconciliation with

indigenous peoples that demonstrates the

only way to build a strong economy

moving forward is to protect the

environment at the same time we are all

in for building a better future for

Canadians and that's why we choose

forward now c30 moment all bunch of

great Canadians

alright there is a Justin Trudeau

shaking the hands of what you understand

some volunteers from the campaign who

are there on the grounds of Rideau Hall

so people like aura Trudeau there with

him about to embark on his second

federal campaign across the country as

he said he's heading to Vancouver almost

immediately and our Mercedes Stevenson

will be hopping on that plane to join

him Mercedes what did you make of this

kick-off to his campaign he was asked

some pretty point-blank questions about

the controversies that he's had to deal

with self-inflicted wounds in his own

government what did you make of his

answers particularly to the SNC affair

and whether why he didn't waive cabinet

confidentiality well some very tough

questions there Donna and frankly he

didn't answer them he stuck to his

talking points when he was asked why he

had not waived cabinet confidence so

that the RCMP could talk to people he

didn't deny that the RCMP were trying to

talk to people which I thought was very

interesting he didn't say I don't know

what you're talking about I'm unaware of

it instead he said look we've given the

broadest waiver of cabinet confidence in

history I don't know if that's true by

the way we do know that past governments

have waived cabinet confidence when

their investigations including in the

sponsorship scandal and Prime Minister

Harper did so during the the Duffy

scandal and there was an actual court

case that came out of that in criminal

charges so there's gonna be a lot of

pressure on him to explain why he won't

waive it he says he respects the

decision of the bureaucrats who have

made this well at the end of the day it

is in fact up to him as a politician as

the Prime Minister to make that decision

about whether he wanted to waive cabinet

confidence in this case I don't think

the answers were particularly convincing

because this is someone who's saying he

is all about transparency and yet he is

unwilling to give that kind of access

that the police have allegedly been

asking for and again I think it's really

interesting that he didn't deny that

there have been questions asked there

that is going to dog him right off the

top

also you heard a lot about that

Hillar ism bill in Quebec this is a

party that has been out there talking

about diversity trumpeting themselves on

that saying how important it is and how

they are the party that really supports

Canadians of all backgrounds and the

discrimination is wrong and he says that

but then he also kind of contradicts

himself by saying at this point he

thinks it would not help for the federal

government to get involved he would not

help for there to be an actual federal

court case but he doesn't explain why

that is so those are contradictions to

his brand they're contradictions to his

promises and I don't think the answers

were convincing so we'll see if they

come up with something better as the

campaign goes on but I think you just

got a taste there of him trying to stick

to his answers trying to avoid wading

into controversy and reporters not

letting him off the hook well in the

question directly what did you do wrong

or you know did you make any mistakes

he didn't even allude to a single

mistake which is interesting because we

all make mistakes right but I guess

first day of your campaign is not the

moment to start admitting to any of them

no especially if you say you take

personal responsibility for what

happened well then if you take

responsibility what are you taking

responsibility for and I've talked to

experts to say part of the reason why he

doesn't want to apologize is because it

actually puts him at legal risk if he

does so because you have to be specific

for what you apologized for but in this

particular case you know he's gone from

saying he did nothing wrong to he

regretted things too there were mistakes

made okay but now we won't talk about

the mistakes people look at that and

they look for authenticity and they look

for ownership and if he doesn't own that

it keeps coming up on the other hand if

he does own it he hands something to his

opponents for them to attack him on but

the fact that he wouldn't even go there

that he was so overtly not addressing

the questions that he was being asked I

think you're just gonna continue to see

those a questions being asked again and

again of course the Liberals are hoping

that the campaign's attention will shift

to something else but they certainly

didn't want to touch any of that with a

ten-foot pole on their first day yep

that's for sure I'm Mercedes helped us

understand a little bit about the

dynamics in Quebec this fence sitting

answer that the Prime Minister gave

about Bill 21 saying you know he doesn't

like it doesn't agree with it but on the

other hand it's

and productive to try and engage in it

in any way right now he wants to have it

both ways

I guess in Quebec and you know that that

talking out of both sides of your mouth

might have worked in the past where

things are more localized but now we're

talking national everything's everywhere

within minutes and even in our broadcast

right we're broadcasting all across

Canada there's people in Quebec watching

this as people in BC watching this

listening on the radio online and he's

saying publicly that they are the party

of diversity that you should not trust

the Conservatives because they don't

support that there's questions about

that they hearken back to the so-called

snitch line from the 2015 campaign on

barbaric cultural practices that the

Conservatives put out which was very

damaging to them the whole niqab debate

the Liberals have always been on the

other side of that and yet here you have

a situation where this bill for those

who are unfamiliar at home bans people

from working in the public sector if

they are wearing overtly religious

symbols like a hijab or a keep up and

that really is very strong part of some

people's identity and now in this case

you're having them say that they can't

do that anymore

so how do you come out and say you're

the party of diversity but refused to

officially challenge this bill he's

trying to divert it and give it instead

to the people of Quebec and saying

they're challenging it okay but where's

his principle as the you know Lee the

leader of the party that says they're

the most aggressive on this and I think

that could be problematic for a man

Quebec but they're worried that if they

attack this bill they will lose

popularity in Quebec and they need to

win there so this is about seats not

principles all right Mercedes Stevenson

we're gonna come back to you outside

Reno Hall there if we can a few if you

have to leave to get on the plane we

completely understand but for that we're

getting so far so good I'll let you know

okay great

we're gonna head over to the NDP leader

Judd meet Singh who is in London Ontario

he's just about to launch his campaign

let's listen acknowledging that were

gathered on the traditional territories

of the UH national the Jota nashoni

had to wonder on and the wind at

people's 18 years ago a terrorist attack

hit the United States and shocked the

world

Canadians reached out with compassion

in care and I wanted to take a moment to

acknowledge those who lost their life

the friends and family that continue to

be impacted by that loss and the first

responders who responded so courageously

friends we're here in London beautiful

city city I spent five years of my life

when I went to Western I gotta say it

was a city where I spend some of my I

had some of my best memories and some of

my toughest this is the city where my

brother I came to live with me I took

him in I took care of him it's a time

when we went through a lot of struggles

I had to work a lot of jobs to make ends

meet and it was during that time that a

lot of friends and family stepped up and

helped me out they helped out with food

and was support and it reminded me of a

very Canadian value I wouldn't have got

through those tough times without their

support and that's what Canadians

believe in we believe in taking care of

one another

now you all know I love Canada and I

believe we can make it even better

it leads to they had a chance to speak

with Jessica Nancy and Jack now jessica

is pregnant and a cancer survivor and

she told me about how difficult it was

and how difficult it is for her to

afford the medication that she needs

without the coverage it's crushing

I met gents Nancy and Jack who are both

retired and they told me about how they

continue to worry about out-of-pocket

health care expenses they don't know

when the next expense is going to come

up they don't know how many how much

it's gonna cost for dental care or if

they need new glasses and then worried

now I believe we can do better for

people like Nancy Jack and Jessica but

we can do that only if we have the

courage to take on the powerful

interests at the very top we can expand

our Medicare system to include

medication for all pharmacare for all

and the extend it beyond that to include

dental care vision and hearing care and

mental health services

we can do that but only if we have the

courage to take on the lobbyists and the

corporate interests we can build 500,000

new affordable homes across this country

and tackle the housing crisis we can do

that but only if we have the courage to

take on money launderers and speculators

that keep out driving and cost of

housing and we can provide a relief for

Canadians who are paying some of the

highest costs in the world for cell

phones and Internet services we can do

that but only if you have the courage to

take on the big telecom lobbyists and we

can fight now we can act now to take on

the climate crisis and build 300,000 new

quality jobs but only if we have the

courage to take on the big polluters and

to end the fossil fuel subsidies

movie bone doesn't behoove Ebola we live

in a country where the rich keep getting

richer the majority of the population

montaj doesn't have access to the same

advantages

we're both conservative and liberal

governments rigged the system in favor

of the rich leaving everybody else

behind us with pretty words and empty

promises he said the right things but he

didn't do them behind closed doors

Justin Trudeau does whatever the wealthy

and powerful corporations want him to do

it's clear Justin Trudeau isn't who he

pretended to be

and as you Sharon the Conservatives are

not the answer they are gonna cut taxes

for the wealthy but they're gonna cut

services that you and your families

count on you'll pay the price with an

even worse worth even more expensive

health care and even more expensive

medication and even worsening climate

crisis miss Amy a shackle x/y only

liberal who will excel dear friends each

election the Liberals and the

Conservatives to sue go make a whole

series of promises but too often don't

follow through so when it comes time to

choose between the interest it is in

general for major international their

choice is quite clear they choose the

big oil companies and the big pharmacy

companies when you want different

results then you have to make different

choices so in this election it's a very

clear choice isn't it who can you count

on to fight for you so this election

comes down to a really clear question

who can you count on to fight for you

when I was a kid

that's right when I was a kid I never

imagined that someone that looked like

me would be running to be Prime Minister

people told me time and time again the

things that I couldn't do but now kids

run up and say seeing you do this I feel

like I can do anything

not since / a tional

[Applause]

we have an exciting opportunity over the

next 40 days we are going to bring a

hopeful message to Canadians that we can

build the country of our dreams a

country where everyone has a place to

call home health care when they need it

clean water to drink and clean air to

breathe good jobs and a bright future

you know everywhere I go I meet

hard-working people who wanted to be

treated fairly and want to build a good

life for themselves and their family

these are the people you Democrats have

always worked for these are the people

I'm in it for thank you

[Applause]

thank you very much and I'm ready to

take any of your questions start with

sorry CTV News over here Kevin Gallagher

so mr. Singh launching your campaign the

polling numbers that we see of course

are lower than those when Tom Mulcair

was voted out of the party pundits are

saying the party's in trouble you know

that you're gonna have a very difficult

time holding on to what you have in the

House of Commons what's your strategy

giving that context well you know we're

looking at what's what's going on right

now in Canada and what I'm hearing for

people is that they're done with

governments have seemed to continually

prioritize making it easier for the very

rich and making it harder for them they

want someone who's gonna stand up and

expand our healthcare system the

questions that I keep on hearing about

how hard it is to pay for medication

really plagued me in and I think about

the fact that we are in this position

because governments have chosen to make

it easier for Big Pharma instead of

making it easier for people and I'm

confident that people will seeing us

champions want to put them at the center

and heart of everything we do

[Applause]

on that subject of affordability of

course we're in London Ontario home of

General Dynamics their contract that has

the labs going to Saudi Arabia a

contract that you would cancel if your

prime minister what would you say to

workers here that depend on those types

of contracts for their livelihoods I'd

say those workers that Canada has a lot

of needs in our own military services

that there's a lot of need that we could

satisfy a lot of contracts we can

satisfy here in Canada and those

hard-working people should continue to

have those contracts here in Canada or

in jurisdictions where there's not a

pressive regime like in Saudi Arabia if

there's any example of a time when we

should be cancelling an arms deal it's

in the example where we've got a country

that's alleged to have committed murder

of a journalist that's involved in an

ongoing killing of the people of Yemen

and that has been implicated in horrible

human rights violations of its own

citizens this is the case it calls out

for ending that agreement but continuing

with contracts here in Canada so that we

continue to maintain those jobs

[Applause]

excuse us a tip on Donald upload this

mangy name because people are applauding

okay good morning so the RCMP seems to

be having difficulty interviewing people

on the SCN corruption scandal if we're

possible to interview those people do

you learn anything new because what we

have already learned yes people have

things to share ministers have

information to share but they don't have

a right to tell their stories because

cabinet secrecy and so a committee are

the RCM ethics commissioner unable to

get this information so commissioner

says like he was approached by ministers

I wanted to share their story

unfortunately they can tell it's

positive because of the cabinet secrecy

rule okay so you want to be the champ if

you will for your average person so does

Trudeau so does the Conservative Party

so I'm wondering what really makes you

different from others why should people

vote for you because you're unlikely to

form a government but Ness you not look

we're gonna have a national we're gonna

be traveling all across but that's a

very good question

yes the Conservatives said they're for

everything your average person but what

do they do when they get in power they

start these cutting services and they do

cuts taxes for the rich they kind of

help them how services take basically

john Boozman

don't the full range of services that

people need so that's quite clear in

terms of a choice if we take a look at

is always a struggle between the big

companies and what do they promote the

interests of the major corporations so

he was going to be there fighting for

you

I'm saying well it's the NDP we've

always done so and we will continue to

do so saying Hannity but Oh a CBC now

till news I just want to ask you

following up to Kevin's question you say

that you know we're talking about

problems with the campaign already as we

head in what do you personally have to

do to move forward and get over a lot of

these hurdles well we're we're showing

people right now with our commitment so

we're committed to changing the way

things are done in in politics we want

to do things differently and I believe

it can be done we've seen the past

number of years the record has been that

governments in Ottawa really haven't

responded to the needs of people I'll

give you one concrete example when it

comes to the cost of medication

something that is plaguing Canadians

something that people are worried about

and we look at the commitments made by

mr. Trudeau he promised to reduce the

cost of medication by a simple change

that would have just set a list of

different countries to compare our

prices to he abandoned that commitment

and we wonder why well in four years he

met with the pharmaceutical lobbyists

over eight hundred and seventy five

times the the great corporate interest

lobbyists and as a result of that he

abandoned a commitment that's a choice

that's not a happenstance or a

coincidence what we're saying to

Canadians is this we are committed to

fighting the powerful interests in

making sure people's knees are put first

and that's what we bring I don't think

that answered the question about you

personally and the hurdles you

personally have to overcome in this

county okay sure

you know sure I face hurdles in my life

historically and I've I face hurdles

maybe now but it's no different for many

people in Canada who face hurdles and

barriers because of their own identity

women continue to face barriers in

advancements in their careers they're

underrepresented in almost every sector

when you look at those at the higher

echelon whether it's in the corporate

culture whether it's in academia women

are underrepresented people are faced

with barriers because of their sexuality

because of the language they speak

because of their identity the religion

those are challenges that many Canadians

face and I can say that maybe I

experience

a little bit of what people go through

and I hope people can see in me someone

that understands those realities and

wants to build a country where there are

no barriers where no one has to face

these barriers base and who they are

they can be celebrated who for who they

are and they can achieve the best that

they can in their lives

[Applause]

ilex battling all with the Toronto Star

the bulkier platform has been out for

now a few months and there's some pretty

big likely expensive promises in it when

will Canadians see a full costing of the

NDP's platform so they can judge whether

what you're promising is feasible or

possible

well I in terms of feasibility it's

really a matter of choices I mean if you

look at the past year mr. Trudeau

didn't do a feasibility study before he

cut the corporate tax rate by 14 billion

dollars to allow the wealthiest

corporations to buy corporate jets and

limousines he didn't study that he made

a choice he didn't really ask people or

consult whether or Canada could afford

to buy a pipeline and he spent 4.5

billion dollars on a pipeline that's

almost 20 billion dollars in money that

was spent to help out the wealthiest not

to help out Canadians we would make

different choices with the resources we

have we take it very seriously we take

our budget very seriously but we would

invest in things like universal farming

care for all building the housing that

people need making sure people are put

at the center of what we do we also have

put forward some of our measures so

we're working with the Parliamentary

Budget Office to put out the costing and

one of the things that we've done

announced recently is to pay for some of

our promises we're ready to increase

revenue and to do that we're asking the

people at the very top to pay a little

more and so we put forward a super

wealth tax which is a tax and those

who've got fortunes of over 20 million

the PBO has announced that that would

raise in the first year close to 6

billion and eventually it could build up

to about 10 billion dollars that's a

commitment to raise funds to to enact

our promises

[Applause]

as I'm sure you know Kiran until

yesterday former NDP MP basically was

saying that if there was a referendum

you would vote for Quebec separation it

should happen as soon as possible I'm

wondering what you think of that and

what if you have any concerns that

somebody who obviously believes in

splitting Canada apart felt at home in

the NDP for so many years well I mean

with New Democrats you know when you

what you get we we are a party that

believes and working extremely hard to

keep this beautiful country together but

at the same time we understand that

Quebec is a unique nation that it's a

unique place and it's that's something

that's very special we celebrate that

what we will do as a new democratic

parties make sure that everyone in our

country all the provinces all the

territories all the nations the First

Nations everyone feels that in Canada

they will get justice they will get

fairness they can build a good life

that's what we're committed to doing

[Applause]

hi i'm i'm collin butler i'm with the

local cbc here in london you you

probably noticed it on your way in

london has a pretty visible problem it

has a huge problem with poverty drugs we

hand out the only city that hands out

more needles than we do is vancouver so

if you were to become prime minister if

your party were to gain power even even

if it had a deciding vote in a minority

Parliament how would it help clean up a

problem that's extremely visible here

where you know there's mental health and

drug problems that no one seems to be

able to solve you touched on a problem

that is really rampant across canada but

yes you see it here in london and

there's a couple of reasons why we're

faced with this problem one there's a

massive gap when it comes to mental

health services it's one of the elements

of our health care that's really

neglected in our health care system and

so one of our responses to that is we

believe that if someone needs mental

health care if they need addiction care

if they need rehab services they should

be able to access that and it shouldn't

mean that only those who've got private

insurance can get into a rehab facility

what I really believe is that if we

develop a head-to-toe health care

coverage it should include massive

investments in rehab and addiction

services it should also include supports

for mental health services so that

people can get the care they need what

we have now is a national crisis when it

comes to opioids and drug use we need to

respond to that crisis as a national

crisis and as well with a health care

response to help the people that are

that are dying it help the people that

need help and care and we can do if you

make better choices how do you make

people care about that I mean there's

people who have they're in full-blown

psychosis in the middle of the downtown

and everybody ignores it I mean no one's

no one's talking about this in the race

so how do you make that a priority so

that everybody's talking about it yeah

so what I've called for is I mean you're

absolutely right this is a national

crisis if there was a thousands of

people dying as a result of Zika we

would have immediately mobilized the

entire country with mobile centers to

respond to that right now there is a

national crisis where thousands of

Canadians are dying because of opioid

use it should be treat

like a national crisis I'm calling for

that on day one of a new democratic

government we would declare a public

health emergency nationally which would

open up a lot of services and supports

to provide care at the front level at

the front lines in addition we would say

we should approach this in a different

way when people are dealing with

addictions these are folks that are deal

with mental health they're dealing with

addiction and they're dealing with

poverty the solution isn't to put them

in jail the solution is to provide them

with care with rehab with addiction

services so that we can solve the

problem and not just continually deal

with the symptoms we care about people

and we're gonna respond in a way that

shows how much we care and how much we

can do when we work together watching

and listening to live coverage of the

federal election campaign take off we

are going to go to Quebec now aware the

bloc québécois are running of course

five parties running nationally six

parties in Quebec and that party six

party in Quebec is the bloc québécois he

Francois Blanchett is the leader of the

party he took over that job a year ago

and he is speaking now let's listen the

party not have one evil eye it will be

faithful to their values not as a

province I'm messy but as a nation Asia

people use a lead organizer you will

recognize as being like you people who

are for who is going to speak on behalf

of Quebecers who is going to provoke

affects interest who is going to provide

some sort of vision for Quebec luring

the phony forward it's not a matter of

attacking people it's a matter of

putting forth a project or proposal so

for two Quebecers to be identified with

those whom they elect they have to share

values one has to do with a profound

attachment to

French another has to do with equality

between the sexes and the third has to

do with the right of women to control

their own bodies we would be responsible

but generous when it comes to

immigration and what we've seen over the

past few years past few moments in the

bigger pardon we have seen there's

already an attack on our values with

respect to secularism

that's something that we inherited from

the quiet revolution and we are going to

stick by it we also want to make sure we

protect our environment within Quebec

and abroad so we need to stress that

there are a number of issues where

Canada over the past few years has not

exactly encouraged Quebec interests one

has to do with Supply Management one has

to do with how we encourage refugees we

wanted to let you listen to a little bit

of the Bloc Quebecois leader

Francois blasts yet the block holds a

ten seats in Quebec in the last

government Quebec of course unique in

this country the bloc québécois unique

party in this country created of course

back in 1991 to separate from Canada so

interesting to see how they fare in this

upcoming election we also want to check

in with the Progressive Conservative

leader Andrew Scheer

we mentioned that his plane was up in

the air when the writs were issued he

was on his way to throw Riviere Quebec

plane had to get diverted because of fog

and land in Quebec City but we're gonna

play some remarks that he made before

the plane took off just so you get a

sense of the tone of the Progressive

Conservative campaign take a listen

well good morning everyone we are

starting off this campaign today knowing

two new things one that the RCMP is in

getting into possible obstruction of

justice charges in the Prime Minister's

Office and to that Justin Trudeau is

doing everything he can to block that

investigation so I'm calling on Justin

Trudeau to do the right thing and

immediately waive full privilege so that

those individuals can testify to the

RCMP at all news of all I plea dish

shows cemente this de beauté the let

comping hey the Chasse investigating

into a possible cross the Liberal

government means to waive cabinet

secrecy my name is Katie Simpson and I'm

with CBC News does today's story in The

Globe and Mail change at all your

election campaign strategy you know we

have been telling Canadians and showing

Canadians how Justin Trudeau has

consistently misled them he has lied he

has look Canadians in the eye and said

things that he knew was not true and we

made the case that he has lost the moral

authority to govern so over the next

five weeks or so we're going to be

outlining our vision for the country to

put more money back in the pockets of

Canadians and let them get ahead but

what today shows is that you just cannot

trust Justin Trudeau he will say

anything to cover up his scandals and

he'll say anything to get reelected and

Canadians cannot believe the things that

he says Shishir dweeby went as we Canada

I've got the default view

okay so missionary table this report we

saw true those support go down what do

you think will be different in this

particular case well this scandal is not

a matter of impact on polls it's a

matter of integrity

thus justice Trudeau is Justin true to

have the moral authority to government

govern rather and over the next five

weeks you can be sure that I'm going to

be asking that question of Canadians why

do you think Justin Trudeau has lost the

moral authority was pretty clear I will

also be putting forward our plan a

government which will live according to

its means within its means which will

put more money in the pockets of your

everyday Canadians so that's what we're

going to do that'll be our message and

I'm sure that our message is going to

resonate with Canadians and that in fact

Canadians want a government which

affects ethic laws do you think the RCMP

should stay out of things during the

election to that suspend its

investigation I would call on Justin

Trudeau to waive cabinet secrecy so

individuals in his office can speak to

the RCMP that's my position do you

believe the Prime Minister when he says

he had nothing to do with a decision to

waive cabinet confidences not at all I

don't believe him at all I stopped

believing him when it was proven that he

lied to Canadians when the ethics

commissioner showed that he lied to

Canadians about his role in this affair

we know that the power to waive cabinet

confidential confidential allottee and

the power to waive privilege in this

case rests with the Prime Minister that

is clear it's within his power to do so

he should do it immediately he should do

it today you're heading to Quebec this

morning will you stand up for people

concerned about Bill 21 I've made my

views on Bill 21 known it's it's not

something that our government would our

party would ever consider at the federal

level we will always stand up for the

rights of Canadians and the rights of

our expression the rights of freedom of

really doing good morning Mr Shearer

this is a lobbyist banovitz from CDC the

ethics commissioners report over the

summer didn't really move the dial with

voters so do you think this latest

development with SNC will well again

this whole scandal isn't about moving

poll numbers this is about showing to

Canadians that Justin Trudeau has lost

the moral authority to govern and

clearly the RCMP

taking this seriously enough to start

investigating individuals in the Prime

Minister's office and that's why it's so

important that just internal take some

personal responsibility and waive that

privilege it's within his power to do so

but I'm gonna make a prediction he's

going to lie about it today he's gonna

continue lying about it just like he did

at the very beginning when he looked

Canadians in the eye and said that he

had nothing to do with this that the

allegations were false he then said that

Jodi Wilson Reybold never came to him

with her concerns we now know that is a

lie as well he said that he was doing

this because of jobs or headquarters of

SNC lavell and we now know that wasn't

true either from the beginning of this

scandal he has been incapable of being

honest with Canadians and he has

consistently been caught in his own

falsehoods he needs to do the right

thing

waive the privilege Canadians can tell

that his refusal to do so means that he

is sight he is hiding something even

worse if he had nothing to hide he would

waive the privilege and he would let the

RCMP do their work we are lady who

stinks with all that money I said you

know Justin Trudeau was lying today yes

he's been lying in the past he has the

authority to lift the whole question

deal with the whole question of cabinet

confidentiality he's refused to allow

his ministers to speak that's because

he's probably hiding something that's

much more serious and what we've already

seen so I'm calling on him today to lift

the whole veil of cabinet secrecy his

campaign we want to welcome everyone who

is listening on the global news radio

network across the country watching us

alive on television and online I'm

joined with by Charles Adler from the

global news radio network Charles Andrew

Shearer in serious attack mode in this

campaign launch making it very clear

what he thinks about Justin Trudeau and

making it trying to set this up I guess

is a very stark choice in in essentially

who you believe he wants make it a stark

choice between what he perceives to be

utter dishonesty he used the word lie

just moments ago in a five-minute riff

he said lie six times he wants to paint

Justin Trudeau is a liar and while

Shearer wants to smile on the

commercials and talk about putting more

money in your pockets metaphorically

speaking I would just want to emphasize

metaphorically speaking he wants to put

Justin Trudeau behind bars he wants the

Canadian public to see Justin Trudeau as

a person who might at some point be

under criminal investigation and that

the only reason he isn't I'm just

speaking from the point of view what the

conservative strategies are though

they're maintaining that the only reason

there isn't a criminal investigation

right now of Justin Trudeau by the RCMP

is because Justin Trudeau abused his

authority to prevent the RCMP from

having access to the information they

need very serious charge although we

don't know what any of that would lead

to we must the RCMP were poking around

there's not an official investigation

underway so the the Tories will torque

it to be absolutely the worst case

scenario but there are still lots of

questions we don't have answered about

the whole essence affair that is certain

and just and that's why I keep insisting

that's the Tory that's the conservative

strategy to portray Trudeau as a person

who should be under criminal

investigation but has abused his

authority and made sure that that isn't

happening the media will keep hounding

him on this The Globe and Mail had the

first question The Globe and Mail went

after him on it and then you had

Canadian press and you had others I just

don't see this question leaving and it

doesn't really matter how many times

Justin Trudeau tries to say that this is

about helping the middle class and

helping kids and all the rest of his

talking points I honestly think that

this particular story from the Global

Mail that they broke last night at the

moment is blowing away Justin Trudeau's

talking points and it's going to be

headline news all day today and perhaps

tomorrow well Andrew Shearer is

certainly going to town saying Justin

Trudeau's a leader you cannot trust

judge meet Singh also saying Justin

Trudeau isn't who he pretended to be so

both of his chief opponents are going to

go after that relentlessly in this

campaign Donna do you find it odd that

considering how vulnerable the NDP is in

Quebec right now

that judge meeting said nothing in

French he answered some questions in

French right but in his in his prepared

remarks that's why I don't think it was

a mistake it ought to be deliberate

because he prepared remarks that right

in front of his face in English nothing

in French that seemed odd to me yeah

interesting I want to ask you about the

whole idea of political leadership and

promises because throughout this

campaign Canadians are gonna be

listening to a whole host of promises we

heard some from Judge meeting today unco

stood so his ideas of you know national

Pharma care and dental care and vision

care and mental health care and

affordable housing and all sounds

fantastic there's no price tag attached

to it at this point we know from the

last campaign that Justin Trudeau made a

lot of promises first-past-the-post

remember that he said so many times is

gonna be the last first-past-the-post

election here we are in 2019 and we're

back at a first-past-the-post election

he promised a balanced budget and even a

surplus yeah and that went out the

window

at what point do you sense among

listeners to your radio show that there

is a malaise a sense that politicians

just say a bunch of stuff and we can't

really trust any of them you know Daryl

breaker will tell you the whole truth

and nothing but the truth

in terms of issues and how people

respond to what their most important

issues in life are as a Canadian health

care climate change obviously

affordability and and some others taxes

however when I talk to my listeners

especially the listeners in Western

Canada whether I'm talking to them on

the phone whether they're messaging me

on Twitter Facebook it really doesn't

matter when my listeners are

communicating with me trust in Justin

Trudeau is at a low right now and I do

think that's why Shearer is picking up

on that that is Justin Trudeau's primary

vulnerability not just about SNC

laughlin but all these other broken

promises that the question for Canadians

in it it might be the ballot question

can you trust the Prime Minister for

another four years well yeah I wonder

and I wonder too if the ballot question

might be just who can you trust when

people are going in to make that final

decision who do I believe anymore right

because there are so many broken

promises on all fronts so I don't want

to sound like there's a lot of you know

cynicism Here I am hungry for political

leaders to stop attacking their

opponents and start presenting the a

case for why they should be elected and

not to defend the politicians but if

they had strong enough personalities and

strong enough credibility with the

public donor I think they'd be making

that case I honestly think the reason

they keep going negative is because

their negatives are rather high with the

public and they feel that's the only way

for them to get ahead is to push down

the other guy all right let's thanks so

much Charles let's go to our panel of

strategists I'm interested in their

takes on this Richard Matt honey what is

it about a kind of you know malaise

about leadership and who you can trust

as a politician are we in a in a bit of

a crisis do you think when it comes to

that I don't know that we're in a crisis

Donna but I do think your points

well-taken I think Canadians are

skeptical about politicians and what

they say and what they do whether

they'll say everything they say what

they will do even politicians with the

best of intentions but when they run for

office and make commitments to their

constituents find out when they get in

office that maybe it's not so easy to

make the changes that they said the

other thing I think you're putting your

your your finger on here is politicians

will UN Charles have been pointing that

politicians will say lots of things to

get elected mr. schirra there was making

some rather let's call them exaggerated

claims and in in polite company that

would that could be called lies

Canadians are skeptical I think about

that from all politicians and I think

we're also skeptical not just about our

politicians but about all the

institutions in our society and whether

or not they're organized in a way that

helps us get by and so forth so it's

part of a larger trend it's a concerning

what it's not good for Canadian politics

if that's there but I would say this I

don't think it's particularly new I

don't think that's unique to this set of

politicians or this leadership well yes

I know it's not new you're absolutely

right about that I just long for a time

when we can listen to party platforms

and not listen to attacks on what

and what the other leader has done wrong

over and over and over again that's what

I I guess when I Fred to Lauri let me

ask you what you think the tone of this

campaign will be fairly negative out of

the blocks today is that what we can

expect lots of attacks

well campaigns take on a life of their

own as they go as we've seen today this

wasn't the plan I'm sure of it

there was no this morning mr. shear

would prefer to be talking about his

platform in his plan but this news story

is quite significant so that shifts and

at the same time it is important that

politicians do take on these issues and

contrast themselves you can't only talk

about your plan you do have to compare

it to the other plans and to the other

leaders so it is it is a part of the

campaign how the tone will go throughout

this campaign we'll have to see I mean

it can all go away fairly easily if mr.

Trudeau just lets these people speak to

the RCMP and gives the documents I was

requested how much do you think trust

might be the ballot question the leader

which leader can you trust again it

depends how this campaign evolves if

that's the case if that becomes the

ballot question Mr Shearer is going to

be a wonderful shape to get a very large

majority government by the way day one

is looking but again a lot it's going to

happen in the next 40 days sure will

okay Fred to Lori thank you so much

we're going to go to Victoria now

Elizabeth May leader of the Green Party

is kicking off her campaign there let's

listen in now so everyone in this room

what do we say yes

yes

[Applause]

yep see hi stuck to all of you

I took I took at just EC don't settle

here today I would like to thank you

from the bottom of my heart for

participating so early in the morning

with the territorial acknowledgment

before we went to national television

but I want to say again how honored I am

to stand on unceded territory of the

song bees of the ascribes of the Coast

Salish people of this territory on which

we are honored to live

- I also javadekar como se off while

Saosin

I'm going to speak briefly in French

about indigenous rights September 11th

is a hard day because my kids were in

New York at the time and it's a big

trauma so Maday we're launching the

campaign so all my love and all my

thoughts to everyone touched by the

tragedy 18 years ago September 11th and

a particular big shout out to Sasha and

Christy I love you guys it's a tough day

but I'm off to the races then I got to

do it so there you go

[Applause]

this is the most important election in

Canadian history this is a chance for

Canada and for Canadian citizens to

decide maybe for the first time in their

lives the first time in our lives that

what matters most is that we vote for

what we believe in and vote for what we

want what Greens will do in this

campaign all of the candidates standing

with me here on stage

oh hey student climate strikers come up

here and join us come on

our pledge our pledge as adults is that

we will never abandon our children the

party veil said fair and long gosh the

Green Party is committed to protect the

future for our children and our

grandchildren and this is not up for

negotiation period we are committed to

protect our society our planet our

nature and our children we have to act

against climate change

how serious the climate emergency really

is and we do the work in order not to

create fear we do that in order to give

everyone hope we have a plan we know

this is a climate emergency and we don't

just use the words about understanding

their meaning how could we in Parliament

have passed a motion June 17th that

we're in a climate emergency and the

next day our government committed to

spend 13 billion dollars on the Trans

Mountain pipeline to drive up greenhouse

gases we will continue to stand firm we

will hold the line

no one can dissuade us from seeing

clearly that we need to move away from

fossil fuels as quickly as possible and

that's Mission Possible news of our plan

is the pencil we have a plan

it's called Mission Possible and it is

possible we can eliminate our dependence

on fossil fuels and in the time that we

need to do it we have like 12 to 15

years to do so we have no choice the

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

Change has given us to do this we have

to jettison partisanship what has

blocked us from action since 1992 when

Canada signed the Framework Convention

on Climate Change it's been petty

short-term political considerations that

clouded the thought processes of people

who knew better it's time for every

so-called leader of every party to join

us and accept the targets that are

driven by science not by politics driven

by courage not by fear driven by hope

for our children's future and an

absolutely solid resolve that nothing

matters more than ensuring our children

and grandchildren can live out their

natural lifetimes in this beautiful

country with a civilization that

supports us safely moment knowing what

you know that we have to commit

ourselves to an overall Society project

it's clear we have to work together in a

non-partisan fashion period we have to

work hard to make sure just like we did

during the Second World War work

together we need an internal cabinet

that can absolutely commit across party

lines to doing what we have to do we can

transform our economy

[Applause]

we can transform our economy we can move

to an economy with a hundred percent

renewable energy feeding an electricity

grid our national infrastructure energy

needs are not pipelines it's a Canadian

grid strategy to ensure creating way

more jobs than any other party is talked

about we'll have millions of jobs

created in retrofitting all our

buildings for energy efficiency in

building that east west and north

electricity grid in turning over and

shutting down fossil fuels and turning

on the Sun the wind the tides the

streams we can be 100% renewable energy

by 2030 it's a job we have to do

[Applause]

and to be clear to be very clear that

means no new pipelines banning fracking

we don't need a single new piece of

fossil fuel infrastructure but we do

need to protect Canadian workers we'll

do that by starting by cutting off the

foreign oil and given the human rights

record of Saudi Arabia I won't mind one

bit telling mr. Irving he can't get by

Saudi oil anymore for the st. John New

Brunswick refinery and we'll find him a

source from Hibernia instead our agenda

is big it is human rights it's also

social justice it is universal

pharmacare it is childcare it is making

sure that our students don't have to pay

tuition anymore and our universities

don't have to go cap in hand to ask

corporations to give them chairs in the

area of corporate profits for that

industry that's over

[Applause]

we are clear as greens

maintenant you come yeah we understand

fully well that we have to eliminate the

hold that our transnational corporations

have on our society it's perverse and it

is in fact what a lot of regulators

refer to the industry they regulate as

their clients we are the clients of the

government of canada we are the owners

of the government of canada we are the

citizens of this country it comes

come sit where as citizens of this

country we demand that our government

works for us not for them and we know

that we cannot achieve a world that's

safe and secure for our children and

ignore injustice that's why the center

of everything we do will be respect for

the United Nations declaration on the

rights of indigenous peoples and a fight

a real fight for reconciliation that we

will not give up till ever again

[Applause]

we also stand for something else we are

early you're talking about how hard we

work we're a hard-working crew no that's

my that's my belts are telling me we are

a hard-working crew every single Green

Party Canada across this country is

prepared to roll up their sleeves and

work to get it done for our kids for our

friends for our neighbors forgot to turn

back when Granta says the house is on

fire the appropriate response from

grown-up leadership is to say all the

little ones go out quickly and get to

safety we've got this we'll call 9-1-1

will put out the fire we'll deal with

this and the people in this country who

don't understand this is serious if I

have to I'm going to throw you over my

shoulders and take you out of the

burning building because we're gonna

save you too

[Applause]

so two Canadians I ask you to consider

how much happier will be with your vote

when you know you're voting for a

candidate a party and a leader who has

your back who earns your trust who never

lets you down who never makes a promise

we can't keep all of our promises are

being costed by the Parliamentary Budget

Office all of them no other party can

say that we are going to present our

platform and we're going to present the

budget after PBO finishes with it we

gave them the numbers in June by the way

it's taking a while we have a lot of

things we're committed to including what

I've mentioned in terms of pharmacare

and universal child care and making sure

that we can bring in a guaranteed

livable income by mid-century so we

eliminate poverty in this country for

good

[Applause]

new some new some new we are committed

to protect our society to protect the

future to protect all the workers who

are currently concerned about the future

most blessed of people on the planet

because we're Canadians and we believe

in our heart of hearts as greens that by

working together across party lines and

asking Canadians to think about if you

really want to change how things look

please change your vote and elect a

green government to Canada thank you

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

so we're gonna go we have we have a

question over here I think it's it's

great vote screens grow votes we are

going to be earning the vote of every

Canadian who is sick of their old

choices or more likely who's motivated

by recognizing that the climate

emergency we saw in 2015 is now multiple

climate emergencies from coast to coast

to coast

we need to act we need to act in a way

that reflects my seriousness of purpose

this is not a campaign slogan it's not a

short-term commitment it's something

that upon which the whole world could

depend on Canadian leadership if only we

got our act together because right now

we are laggards so what's different from

last time well for one thing we have a

lot more greens elected across Canada

official opposition of Prince David

Ireland Paul Manley elected in Nanaimo

ladies myth we have a stronger base

across this country with more volunteers

ready to elect greens in New Brunswick

in Nova Scotia in Prince Edward Island

in Quebec and a lot in British Columbia

so we're pretty excited

[Applause]

oh and Ontario sorry Ontario whoa go

Wells go Steve picked I did not forget

Ontario I'm glad you asked the question

Richard because I've never been so

baffled by questions about things about

which I thought I've been clear for

forever

the Green Party is 100% solvent that we

will not retreat one inch from a woman's

right to a legal and safe abortion ever

that is a commitment we will not let

candidates break a sacred pledge and

every MP who signs the as Paul and I

have done signs the role to become an MP

takes an oath to support defend and

protect Canada I don't know how the

block Heath's get around that in their

head but I won't let any of my

candidates get around it in their head

it's a pledge

I'm the oak there are only two members

of parliament who've been honored with

the Order of Canada I'm one of them I

will fight for my country and there is

no risk whatsoever that a green MP would

fight for separation we fight for Canada

all my conversations with him he's not a

separatist he's a strong Quebec er

within the context of Canada I listened

to his interview with the Quebec radio

station many times listening and he kept

saying I'm a strong Quebec er in the

context of Canada so we will I'll be

talking to Pierre to make sure because

we will not have a candidate who thinks

they can work to break up our country

that's not on we are first and well

first and foremost no other nowhere the

party leaders gonna say this but are you

ready first and foremost we are

earthlings and I know there's some

there's some billionaires who want to go

to Mars and start a settlement I think

we want to do a GoFundMe campaign and

send them now so but in all seriousness

we are British Columbians in this room

we are strong British Columbians but we

believe Canada is a family I loathe the

strategies that have been going on

between Alberta and BC provincially to

make people think we're different we

love albertans they're our family we

love Albertans

[Music]

[Applause]

hey no ad News News mo performed them on

and we profoundly love our Quebec family

I love speaking in French I do the best

I can I'm not great at it but I love the

sound of the language and I love the

Quebec ambience and culture I mean you

know I'm not perfectly bilingual but I'm

making my best effort it's very clear

the Green Party is in Quebec for Quebec

we love Quebecers very deeply but in

we're all part of the same family

we're a part of the same Canadian family

[Applause]

Marc just so you know I'm not

honestly Christine I'm more than ready

we are I'm a seasoned campaigner I have

more experience campaigning than any

other leaders I watched their Kela days

after they're prepared statements and I

mean I mine had a lot of preparation I

may have thought of it while Paul was

talking actually my statement we don't

duck questions we answer them honestly

sometimes my honest answers run on too

long I am not prepared to change the way

I speak or the way our candidates are

encouraged to be themselves that's all I

ask of our candidates tell the truth be

yourself work hard to be nice to the

other guys because we live on the high

road we don't go low so women get

attacked okay

clarify explain what's true explain what

our policies are and move on because

we've got real issues to talk about and

these are distractions it's important to

stand up and make it clear that we

condemn racism it's important to stand

up and say when we say we don't whip

votes that's because we believe in

democracy

and by the way green parties around the

world do this we work by consensus we

listen to each other we trust each other

and as I think is evident up here right

across 338 candidates across Canada we

love each other we are a family too and

we want to make sure that I certainly

want as leader my job is to be the chief

spokesperson we deliberately made it as

the Green Party of Canada was founded on

the same principles as greens around the

world a leader can never be a dictator a

leader can't be in it for power for

themselves a leader is in it in the

principles of servant leadership to work

for this country as hard as we can

that's the job so things have been taken

out of context for sure I hope I can put

it all to bed right now repeating once

again all candidates 1 put your hand up

on your heart put your hand on your

heart way well never allow any retreat

from a woman's right to a safe and legal

abortion

dad all right we're gonna break away

from Elizabeth May and now our Richards

us Minh is in the room they're in

Victoria Richards she is the veteran

campaigner in this election she's been

leader of the Green Party since 2011 she

certainly seems the most upbeat of all

the leaders who launched today what's

your sense of her campaign strategy yeah

Donna the campaign strategy is to get in

front of as many Canadians as possible

but to really focus here on Vancouver

Island where they believe they can have

a major breakthrough based on the polls

they've been seeing and focus on the

other side of the country you heard

Elizabeth May there mention the

provinces in which the Greens have

elected provincial representatives Nova

Scotia New Brunswick Prince Edward

Island one in Ontario and obviously

three here in BC where they hold the

balance of power you're also going to

see a lot of off-the-cuff in Richards

Essman with the Green Party campaign in

Victoria thank you we look forward to

following that entire campaign and we're

going to wrap up now just get some final

thoughts from our Charles Adler from

Global Radio News Network Charles your

thoughts on where we're headed 40 days

ahead of us we're gonna get a lot of

information thrown at us Canadians at

the end of the day I have to make a

choice how do you think the campaign is

shaping up it's shaping up but to me

Donna based on everything we saw today

as two campaigns one an incredibly

hostile negative campaign Shearer vs

Trudeau okay that's sort of them the

main event the other event is for some

people just as interesting and that's

the event aimed at the progressive

voters who do not want to vote for the

Liberals and that's Elizabeth May versus

jugman Singh and Elizabeth May is fourth

people who didn't watching last few

minutes they don't have to have you or

me tell him Elizabeth May is all passion

she's all conviction she's all fun she's

all in and she says she's not fully

bilingual which she isn't but she did

speak in both languages and her prepared

remarks jagweeds Singh did not that'll

be analyzed

today probably to death maybe too much

but the point is Elizabeth may wants to

be seen as the national progressive

leader of the Green Party and I think

she did the best today as far as

presentation she has made it clear just

very quickly she doesn't want to form a

majority government that's true she

realizes that's pie in the sky possibly

minority holding the violence of power

could give the Green Party a lot of sway

well you know she's speaking today in in

Victoria and as Richard Sussman of our

crew and British Columbia said she

according to polls is looking at a major

breakthrough on Vancouver Island

if she gets a breakthrough there and she

gets a few breakthroughs and a few

breaks and other parts of the country

she could be holding the balance of

power all right Charles out there thanks

40 days ahead that concludes our Global

News special coverage of the 43rd
