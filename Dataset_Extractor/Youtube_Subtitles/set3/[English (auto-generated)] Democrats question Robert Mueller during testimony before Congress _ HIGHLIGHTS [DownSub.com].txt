repeatedly claimed that your report

found there was no obstruction and that

it completely and totally exonerated him

but that is not what your report said is

it correct it is not what the report

said and now reading from page two of

volume two of your report that's on the

screen you wrote quote if we had

confidence after a thorough

investigation of the facts that the

president clearly did not commit

obstruction of justice we would so state

based on the facts and the applicable

legal standards however we are unable to

reach that judgment close quote

now does that say there was no

obstruction no in fact you were actually

unable to conclude the president did not

commit obstruction of justice is that

correct well we at the outset determined

we when it came to the the president's

culpability we needed to we mean it we

needed to go forward only after taking

into account the OLC opinion that

indicated that a president a sitting

president cannot be indicted so the

report did not conclude that he did not

commit obstruction of justice is that

correct that is correct and what about

total exoneration did you actually

totally exonerate the president well now

in fact your reports expressly states

that it does not exonerate the president

that does and your investigation

actually found quote multiple acts by

the president that were capable of

exerting undue influence over law

enforcement investigations including the

Russian interference and obstruction

investigations is that correct correct

now director Muller can you explain in

plain terms what that finding means so

the American people can understand it

well the finding indicates that the

president was not that the president was

not a scoping exculpated for the acts

that he allegedly committed

you were talking about incidents quote

in which the president sought to use his

official power outside of usual channels

unquote to exert undue influence over

your investigations is that right that's

correct now am I correct that on page 7

of volume 2 of your report you wrote

quote the president became aware that

his own conduct was being investigated

in an obstruction of justice inquiry at

that point the president engaged in the

second phase of conduct involving public

attacks on the investigation non public

efforts to control it and efforts in

both public and private to encourage

witnesses not to cooperate with the

investigation close quote

so president Trump's efforts to exert

undue influence over your investigation

intensified after the president became

aware that he personally was being

investigated I stick with the language

that you have in front of you which you

which came from page 7 volume 2 now is

it correct that if you concluded that

the president committed the crime of

obstruction you could not publicly state

that in your report or here today can

you repeat the question sir is it

correct that if you had concluded that

the president committed the crime of

obstruction you could not publicly state

that in your report or here today well I

would say you I could the statement

would be that you would not indict and

you would not indict because under the

OLC opinion a sitting president excuse

me cannot be indicted be

unconstitutional so you could not state

that because of the LLC opinion if that

would have been your conclusion OLC

opinion when some guide yes but under

DOJ under Department of Justice policy

the president could be prosecuted for

obstruction of justice crimes after he

leaves office is correct

true thank you did any senior White

House official refused the request to be

interviewed by you and your team I don't

believe so

I take let me take that back I would

have to look at it but I'm not certain

that that was the case the president

refused a request to be interviewed by

you and your team yes yes and is it

that you tried for more than a year to

secure an interview with the president

yes and is it true that you and your

team advised the president's lawyer that

quote an interview with the president is

vital to our investigation

yes and is it true that you also state

quote stated that it is in the interest

of the presidency in the public for an

interview to take place close well yes

but the president still refused to sit

for an interview by you or your team

true true and did you also ask him to

provide written answers to questions on

the ten possible episodes of obstruction

of justice crimes involving him yes did

he provide any answers to a single

question about whether he engaged in

obstruction of justice crimes I would

have to check on that I'm not certain

director Muller we are grateful that you

were here to explain your investigation

and findings having reviewed your work I

believe anyone else would engage in the

conduct described in your report would

have been criminally prosecuted your

work is vitally important to this

committee and the American people

because no one is above the law director

Muller as you've heard from the Chairman

we're mostly going to talk about

obstruction of justice today but the

investigation of Russia's attack that

started your investigation is why

evidence of possible obstruction is

serious to what extent did the Russian

government interfere in the 2016

presidential election could you repeat

that ma'am to what extent did the

Russian government interfere in the 2016

presidential election particularly what

I came to computer crimes and the like

the government was implicated so you

wrote on in volume 1 that the Russian

government interfered in the 2016

presidential election and sweeping and

systematic fashion you also described in

your report that the then from campaign

chairman Paul Manafort shared with a

Russian operative clinic the campaign

strategy for winning Democratic votes in

Midwestern states in internal polling

data of the campaign isn't that correct

correct they they also discussed the

status of the Trump campaign a man

afford strategy for winning Democratic

votes in Midwest

States months before that meeting mana

Ford had caused internal data to be

shared with clinic and the sharing

continued for some period of time after

their August meeting isn't that correct

accurate in fact your investigation

found that mana for brief clinic on the

state of the Trump campaign and mana

Ford's plan to win the election and that

briefing encompass the campaign's

messaging its internal polling data it

also include discussion of battleground

states which mana Ford identified as

Michigan Wisconsin Pennsylvania and

Minnesota isn't that correct that's

right did your investigation determine

who requested the polling data to be

shared with clinic well I would direct

you to the report adopt what we have in

the report in regard to that particular

issue we don't have the redacted version

that's maybe another reason why we

should get that for vol 1 based on your

investigation how could the Russian

government have used this campaign

polling data to further its sweeping and

systematic interference in the 2016 fair

enough

did your investigation find that the

Russian government perceived it would

benefit from one of the candidates

winning yes and which candidate would

that be well it would be trimmed by a

trauma correct

now the Trump campaign wasn't exactly

reluctant to take Russian help you wrote

it expected it would benefit electoral

from information stolen and released

through Russian efforts isn't that

correct correct now was the

investigations determination what was

the investigations determination

regarding the frequency with which the

Trump campaign made contact with the

Russian government refer you to the

report on that well we went through and

we counted 126 contacts between Russians

or their agents and Trump campaign

officials or their associates

would that sound about right I can't say

I understand this statistic and I

believe it I understand the statistic

well mr. Miller I appreciate your being

here in your report from your testimony

and the report I think the American

people have learned several things first

the Russians wanted Trump to win second

the Russians went on a sweeping cyber

influenced campaign the Russians hacked

the DNC and they got the Democratic game

plan for the election the Russian

campaign Chairman met with Russian

agents and repeatedly gave them internal

data polling and messaging in the

battleground states so while the

Russians were buying ads and creating

propaganda to influence the outcome of

the election they were armed with inside

information that they had stolen through

hacking from the DNC and that they had

been given by the Trump campaign

chairman mr. Mann afford my colleagues

will probe the efforts undertaken to

keep this information from becoming

public but I think it's important for

the American people to understand the

gravity of the underlying problem that

your report uncovered and with that mr.

Chairman I would yield back

get back to your findings covering June

of 2017 there was a bombshell article

that reported that the President of the

United States was personally under

investigation for obstruction of justice

and you said in your report on page 90

volume 2 and I quote news of the

obstruction investigation prompted the

President to calm again and seek to have

the special counsel removed close quote

and then in your report you wrote about

multiple calls from the President to

White House Counsel done again and

regarding the second call you wrote and

I quote McGann recalled that the

president was more direct saying

something like call rod tell rod that

Muller has conflicts and can't be

special can't be the special counsel

again recall the president telling him

Muller has to go

and call me back when you do it director

Muller did McGann understand what the

president was ordering him to do I

direct you to do what we have written in

the report in terms of characterizing

and his feelings and in the report it

says quote McGann understood the

president to be saying that the special

counsel had to be removed

you also said on page 86 that quote

McGann consider the president's request

to be an inflection point and he wanted

to hit the brace and he felt trapped and

McGann decided he had to resign McGann

took action to prepare to resign isn't

that correct I direct you again to the

report and in fact that very day he went

to the White House and quoting a report

you said quote he then drove to the

office to pack his belongings and submit

his resignation letter

close quote that is directly from the

report it is and before he resigned

however he called the president's chief

of staff

Reince Priebus and he called the

president's senior advisor Steve Bannon

do you recall what began told them

whatever he was said will appear in the

report it is it is and it says on page

87 quote Priebus recall that McGann said

that the president asked him to do crazy

expletive in other words crazy stuff the

White House Counsel thought that the

President's request was completely out

of bounds he said the president asked

him to do something crazy it was wrong

and he was prepared to resign over it

now these are extraordinarily troubling

events but you found a White House

Counsel McGann to be a credible witness

isn't that correct correct director

Muller the most important question I

have for you today is why director

Muller why did the President of the

United States want you fired

I can't answer that question well I'm on

page 89 in your report on volume 2 you

said and I quote substantial evidence

indicates that the president's evident

that the president's attempts to remove

the special counsel were linked to the

special counsels oversight of

investigations that involve the

president's conduct and most immediately

to reports that the president was being

investigated for potential obstruction

of justice

close quote director Muller you found

evidence as you lay out in your report

that the president wanted to fire you

because you were investigating him for

obstruction of justice isn't that

correct report yes and I go well I stand

behind the report dr. Muller that

shouldn't happen in America no president

should be able to escape investigation

by abusing his power but that's what you

testified to in your report the

President ordered you fired the White

House Counsel knew it was wrong the

president knew it was wrong in your

report it says there's also evidence

president he should not have made those

calls to McGann but the president did it

anyway he did it anyway anyone else who

blatantly interfered with a criminal

investigation like yours would be

arrested and indicted on charges of

obstruction of justice director Muller

you determined that you were barred from

indicted a sitting president we've

already talked about that today that is

exactly why this committee must hold the

president accountable

I yield this so the President refused to

sit down with your investigators for an

in-person interview correct correct so

the only answers we have to questions

from the president are contained in

Appendix C to your report okay so

looking at Appendix C on page 5 you

asked the president over a dozen quest

about whether he had knowledge that

WikiLeaks possessed or might possess the

emails that were stolen by the Russians

I apologize can you start it again okay

sure

so we're looking at Appendix C right um

and a Appendix C page five you asked the

president about a dozen questions about

whether he had knowledge that WikiLeaks

possessed the stolen emails that might

be released in a way helpful to his

campaign

or harmful to the Clinton campaign is

that correct to ask those questions okay

in February of this year mr. Trump's

personal attorney Michael Cohen

testified to Congress under oath that

quote mr. Trump knew from Roger stone in

advance about the WikiLeaks drop of

emails and quote that's a matter of

public record isn't it

well are you referring to the report or

some other public crisis was testimony

before Congress by mr. Cohen do you know

if he told you no I am not familiar with

it explicitly familiar with what he

testified to before Congress okay let's

look in an event described on page 18 of

volume 2 of your report now according

and we're gonna put it up in a slide I

think according to deputy campaign

manager Rick Gates in the summer of 2016

he and candidate Trump were on the way

to an airport shortly after WikiLeaks

released its first set of stolen emails

and Gates told your investigators that

candidate Trump was on a phone call and

when the call ended Trump told gates

that more releases of damaging

information would be coming and quote do

you recall that from the report if it's

in the report I've supported okay and

that's on page 18 of volume 2 now on

page 77 of volume 2 your report also

stated quote in addition some witnesses

said that Trump privately sought

information about future wiki leak

releases end quote is that correct

correct

now in Appendix C where the president

did answer some written questions he

said quote I do not recall discussing

WikiLeaks with him nor do I recall being

a

we're of mr. stone having discussed

WikiLeaks with individuals associated

with my campaign end quote is that

correct

if it's from the report it is correct

okay so is it fair to say the president

denied ever discussing WikiLeaks with

mr. stone and denied being aware that

anyone associated with his campaign

discussed WikiLeaks with stone I'm sorry

could you repeat that one is it fair

then that the president denied knowledge

of himself or anyone else discussing

WikiLeaks dumps with mr. yes yes you

wrote to the Attorney General that quote

the summary letter letter that the

department sent to Congress and released

to the public late in the afternoon of

March 24th did not fully capture the

context nature and substance of this

offices work and conclusions end quote

is that correct again the letter itself

or its terms thank you what was it about

the reports context nature substance

that the Attorney General's letter did

not capture I think we captured that in

the March 27th responsive letter and

this is from the 27th letter what were

some of the specifics that you thought

direct you did that letter itself okay

you finished that letter by saying there

is now public confusion about critical

aspects as a result of our investigation

could you tell us specifically some of

the public confusion you identified not

generally again I go back to the letter

and letter speaks for itself and could

attorney general bar have avoided public

confusion if he had released your

summaries and executive introduction and

summaries I don't feel comfortable

speculating on that shifting to May 30th

the Attorney General in an interview

with CBS News said that you could have

reached quote you could have reached a

decision as to whether it was criminal

activity and quote on the part of the

president did the Attorney General or

his staff ever tell you that he thought

you should make a decision on whether

the president engaged in criminal

activity I'm not going to speak to what

the Attorney General was thinking or

saying if the Attorney General had

directed you or ordered you to make a

decision on whether the president

engaged in criminal activity would you

have so done answer that question in the

vacuum when Donald Trump called your

investigation a witch-hunt that was also

false was it not

I like to think so yes well your

investigation is not a witch-hunt is it

is not on which other when the president

said the Russian interference was a hoax

that was false wasn't it true when he

said it publicly it was false

he did say publicly that it was false

yes and when he told it to Putin that

was false too wasn't it I'm not familiar

with when the president said he had no

business dealings with Russia that was

false wasn't it I'm not gonna go into

the details of the report that along

those lines when the pressure when the

president said he had no business

dealings with Russia in fact he was

seeking to build a Trump Tower in Moscow

was he not I think there there are some

question about when this was

accomplished you would consider a

billion dollar deal to build a tower in

Moscow to be business dealings wouldn't

shoot director Muller yes absolutely

in short your investigation found

evidence that Russia wanted to help

Trump win the election right I think

generally that would be accurate Russia

informed campaign officials of that I'm

not certain - what conversation - you're

referring to well through an

intermediary the informed Papadopoulos

that they could help with the anonymous

release of stolen emails accurate Russia

committed federal crimes in order to

help Donald Trump when you're talking

about that computer crimes and charged

in our case absolutely

the Trump campaign officials built their

strategy their messaging strategy around

those stolen documents I'm generally

that's true

and then they lied to cover it up

generally that's true
