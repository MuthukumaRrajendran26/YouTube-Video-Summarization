[Applause]

[Music]

thank you very much for that warm

welcome everybody let's have a big round

of applause for your next member of

parliament mo bits it's so great to be

back here in Etobicoke ted and i have

gone to so many events over the last few

years ever since i became leader of the

party and since he got the nomination

right here and you know a lot has

changed in just a couple of years when I

first became leader the Conservative

Party of Canada a people would stop me

in airports or hotels or going events

and they'd say you're the new leader of

the Conservative Party aren't you

they give me a polite thumbs-up and

they'd say we're rooting for you now two

years later people stopped me they dig

their fingers into my arms they say

Andrew you just have to win this

election we can't afford another four

years of Justin Trudeau and

affordability is the main theme of this

campaign who do you trust to make life

more affordable put more money back in

your pockets so you can get ahead now I

don't know about you but I certainly

don't trust Justin Trudeau about

anything these days

[Applause]

first there's the broken promises we

just found out just the other day that

Canada is officially ending the

2018-2019 year in a deficit and you

might remember about four years ago

today during the last election campaign

when Justin Trudeau look Canadians in

the eye and he said he was going to be

as honest as he possibly could be he

said he would balance the budget sir

the budget would balance itself in 2019

now we know massive deficits as far as

the eye can see and we all know what

that means it means big deficits today

higher taxes tomorrow

taxes will go up under Justin Trudeau if

he's re-elected that you can take to the

bank

now we also found out today that Justin

Trudeau is not using the Parliamentary

Budget Officer to cost his spending

announcements

that shouldn't be a huge surprise to us

though should it we know that he doesn't

he can't add the numbers up we know that

he is misleading Canadians on the full

costing and I suspect that he is keeping

those costs hidden because he knows that

you won't like the answers that your

taxes will go up to pay for it we

already know his carbon tax is going to

go up as carbon tax is going to go up

making the cost of everything from

gasoline to home heating to groceries

more expensive and that is why before

this campaign even started I announced

that the very first order of business

for a Conservative government after

October 21st will be called an act to

repeal the carbon tax that is job number

one all that leaving a that text to the

combo and passing on sick yeah okuni

back sewer loan for your mom

we know that the carbon tax doesn't do

anything to improve our environment

doesn't do anything to reduce greenhouse

gas emissions it's just a cash grab and

don't let people call it a price on

carbon we all know as conservatives we

all know that a price is something the

market sets it's something that is based

on supply and demand as you and you have

the choice as to whether or not you want

to pay it but when the government sets

it and the government collects it that

is a tax no matter what they try to say

and conservatives will cancel that tax

after this election

we're gonna go one step further we

recognize it in Canada heating your home

in the winter is not a luxury it's a

necessity and just like we don't charge

the GST or HST on things like

prescription drugs or groceries we are

going to take the GST off of home energy

and home hydro bills we're only about 10

days into this campaign and we've

already announced several other exciting

measures to make life more affordable to

leave more money in your pocket we are

going to bring back the green public

transit tax credit to make your morning

commute a little bit more affordable

ladies and gentlemen I see we have a

couple kids here at the front of the

room we are going to bring back the

children's fitness and sports tax credit

to make children's activities more

affordable and because it's never too

early to start we are going to increase

the amount that the Government of Canada

supports our esps from 20% to 30% to

make post-secondary education easier to

attain for families and we are going to

bring in the universal tax cut lowering

the first income tax bracket from 14% to

13.75% saving the average hard-working

couple around 850 dollars a year right

back in your pockets ladies and

gentlemen

I'm often at you know I'm often s and

and rightly so I'm often asked well

where is the money gonna come from to

balance the budget and lower those taxes

and today I announced that a

Conservative government will review all

the programs that Justin Trudeau has

used to give big businesses and we are

going to eliminate 1.5 billion dollars

of corporate welfare so we can put that

money right back in your pockets right

back in the pockets of hard-working

Kania so I see a campaign office here

full of hard-working volunteers I want

to thank you for your support for a

party and for a chance this is how we're

gonna win elections we're gonna take

this message from door-to-door we're

gonna show people with the clear choices

on October 21st we know who's getting

ahead under Justin Trudeau and it's not

hard working moms and dads it's not

small business owners it's not the very

people who build these communities and

create opportunities it's the

well-connected it's the corporate elite

it's the people who have the prime

minister's office on speed dial the

people who can afford to have well-paid

government lobbyists but we're in it for

all of you we're in it for all the

people doing everything right putting

money away paying their bills on time

saving up for their children's future

that's what motivates me every single

day that's what it's inspiring Jill and

me and the rest of the team to travel

across this country spreading this

positive conservative message in every

part of Canada and it is working we're

hearing it at the doors we're hearing in

the coffee shops we're hearing that

people are tired of the broken promises

tired of the scandals tired of the lies

that he's told Canadians and they want a

government that will work for them and

that is a choice this election campaign

ladies and gentlemen we're Justin

Trudeau will abuse the power of his

office to reward his friends and punish

his enemies I will restore ethics and

integrity and shine a light on his

scandal and corruption

where he will call small business owners

tax cheats and accuse them of just

trying to avoid paying their fair share

we will make it easier to be an

entrepreneur easier to be a small

business because we know that's what

creates opportunities in our societies

ladies and gentlemen where he will

impose his carbon tax and make it go up

after the next election we will repeal

it and bring forward a real plan to help

clean up the environment that will

include once and for all banning dumping

raw sewage into our rivers lakes and

oceans where Justin Trudeau will look a

war hero in the eye where he will look

one of our veterans in the eye and tell

him that he was asking for more than he

could give conservatives will respect

the service that our veterans have given

to this country and honor our

obligations to them

and we're Justin Trudeau will raise your

taxes make life more expensive and make

it harder and harder to get ahead

conservatives will run a government that

lives within its means to put more money

in your pockets so you can reach your

goals and your aspirations that is the

choice this elections ladies and

gentlemen now who's with me on making

government work for you who's with me on

eliminating the Trudeau deficit and

who's with me on having a government

that stands up for Canada and Canadians

interests in a prime minister that

doesn't embarrass us on the world stage

let's take this message to every door it

in Tobago centre let's take this message

to every writing in Canada and together

on October 22nd we will wake up to a new

Conservative government thank you very

much ladies and gentlemen
