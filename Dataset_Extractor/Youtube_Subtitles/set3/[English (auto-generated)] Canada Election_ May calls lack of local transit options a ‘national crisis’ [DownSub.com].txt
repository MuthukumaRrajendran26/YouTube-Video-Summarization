I do want to focus today on elements

that affect the climate crisis and

affordability by focusing on what the

Green Party will do for rural and remote

communities

I just finished as as Laura will

remember we we did a 34 city and town

tour of every province in Canada and the

Northwest Territories from February of

this year wrapping up midsummer and we

visited communities here in New

Brunswick we visited at the communities

as I said in every province and

territory and and one territory what we

heard was remarkably similar and we also

came upon what is a national crisis but

which tends to only be identified as a

local concern so when we were in rural

British Columbia or not even rural

Prince George Kamloops we heard how

devastating it was to lose Greyhound

service but everyone thought it was

local we were in Saskatchewan everyone

saw us up

we've lost our bus service and everyone

thinks it's local and in Atlantic Canada

we've lost bus service at the same time

over a period of decades via rail

service has been significantly reduced

particularly if you consider commercial

banks their bank branches are being

withdrawn a lot of services we used to

consider work to be taken for granted

daily Postal Service - our doors

withdrawn so we are also putting forward

in the aid of making sure that rural and

remote communities have the services we

need expanding what Canada Post offers

every Canada post office where we'd

originally planned to hold today's press

conference every Canada post office is

an outreach of the federal government to

every community to make Canada Post

sustainable financially we need to

expand services we need to look at

postal banking the commercial banks

can't get into local communities anymore

apparently to give people the banking

services they need face to face with

someone who knows their needs

either the postal banking system

can provide into post offices broadband

for communities where people don't own a

computer at home and need that service

can provide a spot for a locus for

emergency supports when we face extreme

weather events I'm disappointed in what

the Liberals announced today it clearly

shows that they're hearing the voices of

our own children on the streets but

they're not serious a commitment to get

to carbon neutrality by 2050 is good but

they're putting a promise out there for

30 years from now I need to know what

they're going to do in two years in 18

months I need to know what they're going

to do by 2025 because their current

target and I want to be very clear about

this the current target that the

Liberals are holding to makes it

impossible for them to keep this new

promise you can't set a goal at 2050 of

carbon neutrality and only be thirty

percent below 2005 levels by 2030 which

is their current target it's the Stephen

Harper target they have yet to put a

plan in place to hit that target is it

preferable to Maxine burning oh yes is

it preferable to what Anja Shearer has

offered you bet but it's not anywhere

near what is required and that's why

people if you want green policies don't

be mislead by green washing you have to

vote green if you want a green policy

then speaking
