hurricane durian remains an incredibly

powerful category five storm winds close

to 300 km/h when it made landfall in the

northern Bahamas making it the second

strongest Atlantic hurricane to make

landfall and that's going back several

decades so this is a formidable storm

the big question is where do we go from

here

Florida well getting awfully close to

the center of these strongest winds and

we are expecting this storm to crawl

over the next couple of days and

eventually make a right turn to the

north when that occurs well the

difference between 10 to 20 kilometers

could be the difference between tropical

storm force winds or perhaps much more

on that populated Florida coastline a

lot of lightning you're not gonna see a

better developed storm a better cloud

presentation from space

these are the strongest winds the

highest cloud tops right around the eye

and places like Marsh Harbor complete

destruction from the videos we've seen

so far now the back edge is moving

through of this category 5 it is going

to weaken it'll be slow because the

water is warm but as it weakens the wind

field expands so Georgia South Carolina

and North Carolina could feel effects by

early next week and then perhaps

Atlantic Canada the big steering current

so far has been this Bermuda high it has

helped this system go west as the high

weakens we start to see this trough set

up

there's also another high back towards

the western US but this is what we care

most about this weakness in the big

ridge and that's going to basically

collapse the steering current so the

system crawls and then it starts to move

north as it gains latitude it gets

picked up by the Jetstream and I am

expecting a close call with the

Carolinas and perhaps direct effects on

Atlantic Canada but not until next

weekend that's the latest on Hurricane

Dorian
