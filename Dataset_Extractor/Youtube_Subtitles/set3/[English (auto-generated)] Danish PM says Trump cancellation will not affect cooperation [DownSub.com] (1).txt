it is with regret and surprise that I

received the news that President Trump

has cancelled his state visit to Denmark

on the 2nd and 3rd September I had been

looking forward to the visit our

preparations were well underway it was

an opportunity I think to celebrate

Denmark's close relationship to to us

and who remains one of Denmark's closest

allies I was looking forward to having a

dialogue on the many shared interests

the mukesh has with the u.s. furthermore

the developments in the Arctic region

called for further cooperation between

the u.s. and Greenland Faroe Islands and

Denmark and therefore I would like to

underline our invitation for stronger

cooperation on Arctic Affairs skilled

stance a discussion has however been

very reached about a potential sale of

Greenland this has clearly been rejected

by Kim keelson a position that I share

of course this does not change the

character of our good relations and we

will of course from Denmark continue our

ongoing dialogue with the US on how we

can develop our cooperation and deal

with the many common challenges we are

facing
