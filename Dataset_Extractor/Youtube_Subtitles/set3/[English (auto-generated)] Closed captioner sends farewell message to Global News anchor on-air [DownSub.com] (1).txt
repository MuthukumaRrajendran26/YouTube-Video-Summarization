I just got this email from Dean good

morning Mike

I'm the daytime live closed caption for

global Edmonton yes working out of

course headquarters in Toronto wanted to

send a quick note to wish a all the best

on his last thing on TV some of my

favorite bits to caption are those in

which Shay goes off script and I

especially loved it when he and Holly

get into it I'm sure he'll be making

entertaining radio and I'll miss

captioning him Dean I'd love to see that

guy work one day so I wonder if he's

doing this right now like I wonder what

I just read was captioned by Dean Dean

was captioning himself at he could have

been if he's working right now I'm not

sure he's working right now everything's

happening there's no way for us to know

I guess we know well somebody tell

somebody has CAPTCHA do Brian just put

the captions on Dean are you watching

right now Dean maybe Dean can actually

fill in that thing and say he's watching

right now we're watching where does it

say Brian has Dean responded Brian you

can talk it's okay Dean are you watching

it says that but no what are you

watching has he answered no I guess he's
