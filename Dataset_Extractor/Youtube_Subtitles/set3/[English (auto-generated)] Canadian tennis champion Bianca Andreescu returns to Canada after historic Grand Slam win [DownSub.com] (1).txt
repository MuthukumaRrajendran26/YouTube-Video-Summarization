Oh

a month ago today

well thank you first of all I've been

preparing my sleeve for this for a

pretty long time I mean I'm only 19 but

I've been doing it ever since I was 12

like I said ever since my mom introduced

me to it I think it's helped me

tremendously especially in tough

situations like playing on the finals of

US Open it really really helps me stay

in the present moment especially with my

breathing acting the breathing

is very important and it helps me get in

my zone

it helps me block out a lot of

distractions like the crowd there

Commodus crazy in New York that's why

it's such a special tournament but yeah

I really think the mental side is the

most important at this level

is now

I actually went to the yard sale

yesterday that was my first stop and

I've been getting more recognized in

usual and I came in today

tennis Canada gave me a very warm

welcome which I really appreciate some

thank you guys so yeah it's a little bit

different

yes and it's been pretty hectic I did

Samia in New York I chilled a little bit

yesterday and then now I'm you guys so

it's the elevated

stroller but who said

knowledge we were watching her yeah I

definitely we had a very nice moment in

the locker room she actually came up to

me after the match which I really

appreciate she's had some very nice

things she said that I'm going to be a

very good tennis player and a bunch of

other things I would rather keep it in

time and I'm sure she'd appreciate that

but yeah above all she's such a kind

person and

commercial over

we got that morning from his nephew by

Roswell to show first of all my aunt

Rita

congratulations thank you have you had a

chance yet to sort of I guess celebrate

with family celebrate or somebody had a

grilled cheese sandwich the last three

days have been pretty bad for my diet

but I've been doing a pretty good job

with keeping it up so I think I deserve

a little bit of indulgence but yeah

after the finals actually went to really

nice and in New York

just me and my team and my parents

I'm really glad they were there for two

weeks and now that I'm home celebrate

with some of my friends good to see them

but it's time to move on to the next

time to take after

well or sports today I'll celebrate a

little bit and also my friends but I'm

still focused on what's to come so good

segue there but I'm sure it's hard to

take s next week

well next year we are ten months from

the Tokyo Olympics I thought about what

the Olympics might mean to you you watch

the Olympics growing up and how does

Olympic champion sound big boards

for a couple of years it's a very

special event you get to be a part of a

team and I think it's different than any

other tournament on the tour so if I do

have to play that and it would be pretty

awesome

maybe on the necropsy TV just wondering

have you watch the match yet and what

goes through your mind as you watch it

if you watch it I actually did watch it

this night the night afterwards someone

texted me saying that a replaying the

match so I ended up watching it again I

usually don't like to watch myself play

but I think I I'd only make an exception

for that much just while I still can't

believe that it really I've been

arrested me couple needs to sink in

which is happen that that we can then

enjoy

now I don't know as an intake but

hopefully soon it can sink in and just

with all the eyes of Canada of the

tennis world everyone knows your name no

one's watching you do you feel more

pressure now to perform at any put a lot

of pressure on yourself but do you feel

more pressure going forward not at all

yeah it's definitely the pressure I

thought myself really there's always

going to be - I mean I'm sure Canada

wants me to do very well and most

importantly I want to do very well so I

think that pressure really helps me

honestly I got a chance to speak to

Alicia came and we were talking about

her cold Prince wishes pressure is a

privilege and I really think it is

because it really it motivates me and I

think I'm a perfectionist so if I step

on the corner and I would do my best but

I have that dancing that's all I must

maybe Sportsnet I know everything's been

a whirlwind for you but have you had a

moment to process what this win means to

the entire country of Canada and perhaps

now you being elevated to role model

status is that a role that you accept

yes I do

Michael one of my goals was to be able

to be an inspiration to many people and

I think I'm starting to do that which

means a lot to me if I step on the board

and I show a good example I think it can

drive a lot of people to make even

bigger for a kid I know it's starting to

this board I started to get more

attention because of what happened I'm

the US Open I'm getting some messages

saying

they've never watched hands before but

now they will which is pretty cool and

I've gone some where they said that they

actually started playing tennis because

yeah that's amazing

[Music]

with this historic win you know big

sponsorship deal and it your way of

becoming more financially independence

how will that change your relationship

with Canada or you will have to like

well they've been supporting me since

day one and that's all I can ask or

definitely I have more money now so I

don't think I'm going to have to depend

on anyone really I'm standing on my two

feet alone that's why I have so it feels

good but they're always in the middle of

you know getting the attention and

obviously we saw you on a thirty valid

Ryan and Ellie what was that a first

sight it was so fun Jimmy is such a cool

guy and I'm really glad I got that

experience I still can't believe I was

on that show I didn't think he was a

real person before I actually met him

because I've watched his show many many

times and

[Music]

Janka Devon with CBC sports

congratulations here's what Pam Shriver

the great Pam Shriver said about your

arm she says it's like a top-of-the-line

Ferrari needs to be serviced it needs to

be watched over and put in the garage

you had a physiotherapist with you

injury has been a thing how important is

staying healthy boy dependent before

if I'm healthy that I think I can do

even bigger things in the sport one of

an athlete's biggest and the news I

think is being injured because

like we're sitting on our on our butts

watching people play one more engine and

I don't think any athlete likes that so

I think the main goal right now is

definitely to stay as healthy as I can

because I've been injured quite a bit in

my short career so yeah I'm really happy

that I have a physio with me now

full-time because I think recovery is

we'll definitely find in a private jet

I think uninterrupted and the nature

that they hooked me up so that was that

was really fun

no need to go through customs our

security data I was back home in like 45

minutes which is very convenient so

definitely that would have to be the one

thing that stood out and obviously being

on

I'd be epic analytical engine first of

all congratulations and all the success

at 19 you mastered so many elements of

the game and now you have to start

training formation open what elements do

you feel like you can't still work on to

improve yourself where you need to get

better there's always room for

improvement in anything so I'm just

gonna keep improving my game I know that

it's been working pretty well for me so

far so I'm definitely gonna improve that

I think the shot selection part will

definitely be an emphasis and obviously

I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing

on the mental side of things and get

stronger physically as much as I can I

think that's a crucial part of this this

work too

breakfast television Congrats alright so

in the tunnel right before you came out

we see you kinda just body grab folks no

pressure cool you said it's an

opportunity some pressure what were you

listening to what we see you can have

what was that song summer by Megan

stallion that's definitely the song of

the summer and some of the catches

summer so clearly assess your clutch in

those situations where people kind of

count you out

what do you tribute that to the size and

okay this whole rehab of your years and

whatsoever you buy there how do you

decide

I could barely hear myself they know

they're really it wasn't easy blocking

out the crowd and I think that gave her

an edge to Serena I mean that's why

she's a true champion of the sport she's

not to come back after being down

matches so that was expected and I think

I prepared well before that because I

saw my coach about it and he said if

you're gonna win this match you have to

stay focused much to the end no matter

what happens and I've got five all no.65

game know it's my ball that's yeah at

that moment I just told myself football

record the goal right from the start of

the match is to make her work and before

that at five one of those couple games

going through too much I think I was

really excited because I was literally

walking away from the detainment

it's hard not to focus on that but I'm

just really glad it was how I managed

with those two games I can't because I

think if we wanted some peace has a

little bit of story

you know Clippers Arthur from the

Toronto Star it doesn't just when the US

Open this has been a whole year pretty

good success and escalating system

success you can only kind of focus on

the next thing but has this year and has

the US Open changed the ceiling on what

you can reasonably expect from your

career now we thought about that big

picture for you I hope you can yeah I

have pretty big expectations I've

accomplished a lot in this past year and

I feel like I can do even more in this

sport

now I actually believe that I can do

morphus or after all of this success so

I'm just going to keep striving and

hopefully when many more grand signs

from now on but where does the hunger

come from to keep pushing and keep going

I think it's the passion I have in the

store ever since I've been that bracket

I've loved it and I think it's just

me striving to do better as a plan as a

person I think that's what really gets

me going is just create history and when

as many times as possible become number

one in the world like my mom always says

to me don't forget who you are and dream

big to get big and I think I'd reject

that or I'm pretty a long time now and I

think that's what's conscious leading my

life to my success

hey Bianca Bowman Qureshi consultative

news here two quick questions for you

one it's been kind of a crazy few days -

have you gotten any sleep or are you

running on adrenaline right now I'm

running on a jumper

hearts actually put my eyes but

hopefully after today I can get a good

night's sleep in my bed at home there's

really no place like home so I think I

won't have any trouble over that and you

know when you've won Rogers coffee soft

kind of help people react here but it

kind of talked to a whole nother level

as you were progressing horses - did you

have any idea about how kind of much

hysteria you were causing here in Canada

as were doing your thing down in New

York all I know is the hype on social

media that's all but I've gotten some

phone call saying that there's people

going crazy in in Toronto about what's

been happening these past two weeks and

now I get to witness it in person so I'm

really excited about it sighing couple

of shoes for sports I want to know you

know we all know you've gotten very calm

and confident demeanor now if he didn't

win the US Open what would you tell

yourself motivate yourself you know

mentally to prepare yourself for your

next role well I think just reaching the

finals is motivation enough I love

playing

big crowds I just love everything that

comes with the sport staying in nice

hotels of traveling the world and being

able to need some painful people like

Jimmy Fallon I was on the along the - I

met Ryan Kelly on live with Brian Kelly

which is pretty cool I think all of that

is pretty good motivation for me it just

keeps shining in the back here

congratulations first of all I can

appreciate that it's still so soon after

the victory you haven't really had much

time to decompress or anything but Bear

Kong has been pretty vocal in terms of

wanting to do something for you to honor

you in the City of Mississauga I would

take it there's nothing imminent but as

they've been in discussion interaction

with her or in boats those planes

I'm not directly with me I've just been

seeing

yeah but damn if that happened that

would be so crazy I was not expecting

any of this but its management is pretty

cool and I can't thank everyone enough

really for all the support you guys just

keep helping me strive to do better and

better maybe just fall off as well my

golden girl burger connection this is

why I believe you've been born here and

should move back to Romania with here

family but just underneath the red maybe

after my parents emigrated from Romania

and I grew up there I had an amazing

childhood and then I got into the tech

scam program at the age of 10 I think it

was and then ever since I moved to LA

ecology solution Center Stinson with me

here does there a point in this season

where you felt like you couldn't play

with the best players in the world as

far back as Auckland or it would have to

be after I played Venus Williams I think

that's the moment of my awakening I

guess I really thought that I could play

against these top players on these big

stages like I've always dreamt

and eating walls came around and that's

when I actually believed that I can do

really really big things in this after

digging wells we got your injury lay out

what you do in that time to sort of not

lose the focus that all of a sudden your

conversations work and making a break

we'll come back and play that's I was

doing a lot of things I was working a

lot of my fitness which I think was a

must and I was working on the mental

side of things I was trying my best to

stay as positive as I could

life is not perfect so I think the most

important part of that period office to

have a good mindset going into things I

changed my diet I changed the way I

schedule my tournaments I changed some

of my routines and I worked a lot on

prevention because I think that's very

important thing

and honestly I think it I think it was a

really good thing that happened I've

been playing a lot before that I think I

played like almost 30 matches in three

months so I'm glad I got that chance to

just chill a little bit I mean obviously

I want to be on court playing but I

really believe that everything happens

for a reason

hey how's it going to meet Dan hi

congratulations and kind of more about

some of your show similar to the

Mississauga question Mayor John Tory

this morning tweeted if you want to pray

you can have a parade so just so we can

set aside a day or if you don't quote

some time off work can you have the

parade yeah why not

that would be really cool I don't know

what my schedule is at this point would

I don't know no idea

Bianca the other night at Arthur Ashe

you got pretty emotional when you said

this visualization stuff works and it

sounds that you got pretty specific

about what success look like have you

already studied to think about what that

next visualization and what that next

school looks like

I didn't speak to my coach yet about

that because I usually go over my goals

with him but I kind of have an idea I

wanted to well my next couple

tournaments in Asia obviously so

hopefully qualify for the WTA Tour

Finals in China and practice on three

you're a success this year hasn't just

thrust you into the spotlight

your parents and KOCO but also a person

into this spotlight because of this I

think your mom and KOCO we're trending

at one point online KOCO seems to be

handling it okay I'm just learning how

your parents are handling anything yeah

a lot of attention to especially my mom

I think she has her own buzzfeed pose I

think that deserves her up it was really

funny all the all the tweets my mom has

been getting and obviously my dog Coco

I'm just super grateful again with the

day to have them in my corner and my dad

obviously he's a he's part of everything

that's been that's been going on it's

just so nice to have amazing cares like

them because they still treat me like

I'm me not like anything else they've

been handling everything

super well and help me stay grounded a

mess that's very important so I'm really

it's really important to restock your

cell phones so no more questions for

Jimmy Fallon or Jennifer Lawrence but

the question is we've been part of about

tennis Canada center 11 you know I spent

before we buy 500 pairs prevented their

ceilings or you know talk to them and

I'm sure like events in Fargo yeah they

send me really nice messages they said

that they're very proud and that this

one actually gives them motivation to

keep chugging and doing better so coming

from them and that means a lot and I'm

sure that they're going to do such

things

they've already had but I know they're

they're hungry for more

the opportunity of advice for young

tennis players who want to follow in

your assessment it likes on how you have

made it it's not an easy road that's for

sure but it's a fun one if you really

love playing the sport then go for it

dream big to get fake because that's

what I've been doing ever since I was

little

no dream is to make still follow your

dreams know that there going to be some

sacrifices involved there's going to be

hard work you're not in a lot of

dedication and if you really believe in

yourself and you don't let anyone get in

your way and try to block out

distractions and I think you can do

really big things and obviously strong

yourself with people that's

you notice sacrificing what's your

tennis and personal life balance like or

is it all about this antenna no I think

there should be a very good balance to

have in your life and anything you do

the social part helps me stay grounded I

love to hang out with my friends and to

be surrounded by my family as much as I

can I know that's not always easy

because I'm always traveling but the

chance to come home it's it's always

amazing and yeah I just really think

that's the most important thing

especially if you want to be a

professional athlete is to have that

good balance with social life

Bianca congratulations from young Tara

pens Association and you've been

excellent over year we've seen grow up

since you were 10 years old playing
