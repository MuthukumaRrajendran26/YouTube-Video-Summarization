will be aware that the motion has not

there's everybody good well done yes

isn't he going to order the Prime

Minister agree

[Applause]

I note that the leader of the Opposition

is once again not in his painting well I

think is a slightly symbolic way mr.

speaker 48 hours ago 48 hours ago he was

leading the chance of stop the coup let

the people vote now he's saying stop the

election and stop the people from voting

I think there's only one solution I

think he has become the first to my

knowledge the first leader of the

Opposition in the Democratic history of

our country to refuse the invitation to

an election I can only speculate I can

only speculate as to the reasons behind

his hesitation the obvious conclusion is

I'm afraid that he does not think he

will win I urge his colleagues to

reflect on what I think is the

unsustainability of this position

overnight and in the course of the next

few days
