the first speaker for this afternoon's

press conference is police chief of the

city of Gilroy Scott smithy so I have a

few updates for you in addition to what

I've given the last two press

conferences the first is that you know

the different teams working the crime

scene and developing leads the suspect

vehicle you know through the different

teams working the crime scene and

developing leads we have located the

suspect vehicle that was used to drive

out near the festival we have obtained a

search warrant for that vehicle in there

in the process of serving that warrant

now all right so I don't have a update

on what is in the vehicle because that

hasn't actually happened yet but that

will be happening shortly we also

obtained a search warrant for a

residence in the city of Gilroy it was

associated to our suspect I in that

search warrant was served today I can

again I don't have any details on

anything that came out of the search

warrant but that has now occurred you

know I wanted to address there was a

young man that thought it would be a

good idea to post on social media that

he just shot up that G Fest and so we've

received a lot of calls from people and

emails and concerns that you know this

is an Associated suspect to the Garlic

Festival shooting and this young man his

name is chase Hollow he's 20 years old

but on his postings he lists his name is

chase M killings obviously that got our

attention

so we have located him we have taken him

into custody and we've determined that

he was not involved in the

shooting that he just thought it would

be a fun way to get some attention

apparently alright so for people they're

sending that in or at scene that we have

followed that lead through and

determined that that is not associated

with this event we also have our

District Attorney's Office and other

agencies are working together to open up

a Family Assistance Center to help

victims and people affected by this

shooting and I just wanted to reiterate

that even though I know that went out as

a press release the DA's office Victim

Services Unit the American Red Cross in

the county's behavioral health services

are opening a Family Assistance Center

starting at five o'clock this afternoon

it'll be at the record elementary school

in Gilroy

Recker elementary school is at 325 Santa

Clara Avenue in Gilroy California nine

five zero to zero the services that they

will be providing at that Center would

include grief counseling and emotional

support assistance filing claims for

state funds for payments of medical

bills counseling bills and other

assistance for victims and their

families and referrals to agencies for

providers for medical services

counseling and others and they're gonna

open up today at 5:00 they'll be open

from 5:00 this afternoon till 10:00 this

evening and then they'll be opened for

the remainder of the week through Friday

9 a.m. to 10 p.m. and there will

reassess times in need at that point

time and issue additional hours as

needed

and lastly you know we gotten this

assistance from all these different

agencies and Sheriff Laurie Smith is

here with me today

and obviously this is her County Santa

Clara County and her agency and her

staff has been providing support they

were some of the first responders on

scene and whenever we deal with

something like that you know we have a

mutual aid process and of course we

reached out and made that formal mutual

aid request in the Sheriff's Office has

been really instrumental in helping us

get those resources that we need to

continue to investigate this case so we

very much appreciate that

and I'm going to turn it over and get

another update from the FBI with regards

to the process that's going on on it

Christmas Hill Park

Thank You chief my name is Craig Farah

I'm the deputy special agent charge of

the San Fransisco division of the FBI I

like to thank everybody public for your

patience as we vary systematically

methodically and deliberately process an

extensive and complex crime scene which

will take several more days to complete

this afternoon I want to provide you

with updates on two issues one the

assistance that we are seeking from the

public and to the efforts of our Victim

Services program and what you can expect

from the FBI and the District Attorney's

Office over the course of the next

several days terms of investigative

publicity we're asking for the public

for any information you might have on

the shooting any tips should be called

as a Gilroy Police Department at four oh

eight eight four six zero five eight

three if you have any photos or videos

we have launched a website for you to

send those media files that is WWE

fbi.gov forward slash Gilroy that's WWF

bi gov forward slash Gilroy if you have

any photos or videos you want to share

with law enforcement finally want to

share with you but the FBI is working

with your local DA's office on victims

assistance and providing assistance to

those affected by this tragedy

the FBI victim service division and our

evidence response team will be working

with the DA's office to collect and

return personal effects that are not

considered to be of evidentiary value

and have not been entered into the chain

this process will take time and I'm

asking please for patience while we

identify itemized co-locate those items

so they can be repatriated with the

owners and the families I will provide

you with updates on that process as well

as additional Victim Services as that

information

becomes available thank you

we will now take a few questions

ballistics of the suspects gun match the

bullets and the people who died

so that will be part of the

investigative process there will be as

in most cases of forensic evaluation but

that determination has yet to be made

your gun is still collected as evidence

and it's on-site we have not taken any

steps towards that forensic evaluation

at this point

I have not heard that in any of the

briefings that I've attended thus far

I have not that that's news to me I have

not heard that as to the second suspect

we have not made any progress other than

what I gave this morning we're no closer

to determining whether there was or was

not a second suspect and if there was

what involvement they may have had I

don't have that available in front of me

I'm sorry that would be correct

I have not I have not had a briefing yet

on the outcome of that search warrant or

any relevant information that may have

come out of it we are currently we are

currently undertaking social media

scrubs as well as assessing information

that's derived from other interviews and

investigative techniques that we've

deployed over the past 24 hours

[Music]

so there's a lot of different agencies

involved and I'm not familiar with a

search warrant that was served in Nevada

and I've heard a couple of different

versions of the events as to whether he

was living in Nevada still or whether he

had moved back to California and I don't

have confirmation on which of those is

the actual story at this point well you

know I think that motive is important I

think everybody wants to know why the

answer why I and you know if there's any

affiliation with other people or groups

of people that could potentially pose a

threat in the future I think that all

plays into why that would be important

to understand I can't answer that I have

not had contact with them

we are conducting some of the interviews

in conjunction with with the police

department I can't comment on the

results of those interviews at this

point investigation it's still very

early I can't comment on that right now

events like this are occurring across

the country every weekend and it's up to

those events events coordinators to

determine the extent to which they want

to employ security features this event

was completely fenced in police officers

as well as FBI agents were on scene when

the shooting occurred there was patrols

actively moving throughout the crowd at

the time of the shooting as a result of

that that subject was neutralized within

a very very short period of time

I can only speak to him having a

Facebook account which was recently

opened I can't confirm that

sorry so Robert op around the resident

agent charged at the San Jose field

office for ATF I can tell you the the

weapon that was recovered was a ak-47

variant that is a it's a it's based on

the original ak-47 was imported so

that's I cannot give you the specific

model or anything like that

[Music]

nothing worth that would be a California

law question that I'd have to Drake your

California Department justice for that

just how random were the targets this

gunman the shitty or did he aim at

specific

that's something I don't know at this

point the descriptions that have been

given to me it appeared is that though

it was random but I think we're still

too early in the investigation to be

able to say that definitively a large

number of minorities and people that are

in the hospital right now we are we're

compiling a list today of all the

different victims and all the different

locations I do not have that list yet I

once we're able to look at that list I

think and we could draw conclusions from

that well you know anytime you put on a

large event with a lot of people you're

always concerned which is why we try to

run a very tight closed event where

there's you know control to access and

so do we think about it and do we think

about how we would respond if something

were to happen I would say the answer is

yes

I don't know I don't know that either

I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen that it

will be the end of this press conference

I don't have any information on that I'm

sorry

back back was it backpack found with him

I don't believe what was that okay at

this point we don't have any information

about a backpack it was a little bit

north east of the park off of Laurel

Drive Laurel right

we are finished with this press

conference for this afternoon I

apologize the chief is the place he

needs to go it will be approximately 24

hours from now tomorrow afternoon no

there will be one tomorrow afternoon

like I said I will be relieved captain

Murphy will be taking over and yes he

will be putting out information as is

appropriate after people move out I will

feel questions from the spanish-speaking

media so we don't have conflicting

camera activity
