247 a day the fire department was

dispatched we reported fire in the

church to see behind me after a short

three minute response time our first

arriving companies found a heavy fire

showing from the rear of the church and

they immediately went to what we call a

defensive operation or an exterior

attack again heavy fire through the

church they did an incredible job

the first driving Battalion Chief and

all the companies getting here and

circling the church being able to get

some heavy caliber water streams in

place you can see we have a lot of

aerial master streams in place and that

really is what's kept us has let us hold

this fire it right now we're at two

alarms and a little bit more than that

two alarms what we call special calls so

two alarms plus that's roughly you know

75 to 100 firefighters and 30 to 40

pieces of apparatus we had reports

immediately that all the occupants were

out of the church we did have I know one

person in an adjacent occupancy who was

transported but again this is still an

active firefight and we'll be here

certainly all night we'll have

firefighters here all night but again

just an incredible job by you our

Philadelphia Fire Department

firefighters paramedics and all the

support partners out here

you
