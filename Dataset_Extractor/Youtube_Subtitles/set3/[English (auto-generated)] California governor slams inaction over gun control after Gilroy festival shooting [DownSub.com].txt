first and foremost available to you but

for any questions

it's the extent that I can fill in any

blanks but this had the privilege of

spending time with four of the victims

and their family members met the

grandmother whose daughter was holding a

six-year-old lost their life at a

festival that all of us who grew up in

the Bay Area know well what the Santa

Clara University's down the road from

here into that festival and and here we

are again and again and again and again

an elected official all political

stripes with their version prayers heart

goes out and when you do better as a

country and seemingly for a lot of folks

they feel like nothing's changing it's

pablum and I get that I mean the idea

that a 12 year old then I just met was

shot in the leg she was describing she

was on a jumpy house at a Garlic

Festival and we just moved on with the

morning news and rose garden press

conference and sure we'll hear a few

things the next few nights from elected

officials and fundamentally things

changing so

you know people have versions of what

the solutions are I'm proud of the state

for its leadership over a half a century

um and gun safety we've seen a

significant decline in the gun murder

rate in California compared to other

states but as you all know looks like

this weapon was purchased out of state

and brought into the state of California

these are weapons of war I know some

will suggest these are important tools

for hunting somebody just got back from

Montana and knows a lot of hunters there

alternative means of hunting these are

weapons of war they're weapons of mass

destruction

their purpose is to exact as much damage

on human beings as possible they have no

place in our society let alone in this

country let alone in this state but the

culture has to change you can't just

change gun laws you got to change hearts

and minds there's also an ideology

that's deeply at root here and that

didn't surprise me you know you just

almost could predict telling me a little

bit more about this young man I asked my

staff and immediately sent me to some of

the postings that are now being made

public and was the first week I was in

office but I sat down with my emergency

director thinking we were gonna talk

about preparing for wildfires after the

camp and Woolsey fire and he says you

know what you need to focus on white

supremacy need a focus on hate groups

god is my witness that was the first

meeting I had as governor talking about

murmured she preparedness after those

two horrific fires that was the anxiety

that the leadership of the state had

that needs to be called out clearly and

convincingly starting with the top

present United States needs to call that

out clearly and convincingly not just

because of this incident but because of

what's going on in the United States and

so for all these reasons I came here

connect with this issue try to Express

my deepest regret and sympathies for the

families impacted the lives lost but a

deep desire for this country to exercise

new level of moral leadership which is

missing currently she was comforting me

here was a 12 year old shot who smiled

when I walked into the room I said how

are you smiling you just were shot

she starts describing the courage as she

was running away after she was shot and

kept running and here she is

you know comforting the governor yeah

Wow

I met a young another young woman it was

shot and she's gonna have all kinds of

surgeries and might have hit her a lot I

don't want to get into the details and

she was there with her boyfriend and

describing how he was running towards

her and she was running away from the

shooter what courage about a grandmother

lost six-year-old grandson who is in the

hands of him her daughter encouraged to

visit with me to sit there thank me for

visiting her wow those are extraordinary

human beings and by the way those are

the survivors but you know what their

lives are profoundly impacted we talk

about deaths in this country we don't

talk about survivors in this country and

the impact that it has I met I met a a

woman whose husband was shot she was

shot and I asked her she had connected

with her three-year-old that was there

on the scene she says I haven't yet

three-year-old and she talked about the

courage of the three-year-old who all

she wanted was to go with mommy and

daddy when they got in the ambulance

this is America

what went wrong what's going wrong is

it's it's slow motion it's mass murders

that are happening all across the United

States there's a culture of gun violence

and you know machismo

I mean did anyone ask was this a man or

a boy didn't have to remember all the

punditry they just assumed it was

fascinating last night can you say you

gave comfort to the families I didn't

when they gave comfort to me how do you

just there's no meaning this is you know

I talked about being inarticulate by

saying I'm inarticulate nothing I could

say can change what's happened I don't

know what I can possibly say make you

feel better accept god bless you and I'm

so sorry not only what's happened to you

what's happening in this country in this

state this nation of ours and I don't

know I know we're here for you you know

look I I just you know I've been doing

this 20 years and it's it's just

sickening I I don't think there's

anything more frustrating than people

watching the nightly news and seeing

someone like me come out and expressing

yet again and then you know three days

from now we'll zig and zag on a new

tweet and some other new crisis and you

know we'll be off to the normalization

that occurs every single night in the

emergency room here which is not mass

murders but a typical night in Santa

Clara County and we just accepted it

we've all just grown to accept it and we

have leadership today that just turns a

blind eye to this and won't do a damn

thing to address these issues California

is doing its part

but Jesus these guys the folks in the

White House have been supporting the

kind of policies to roll back the work

we're doing in states like ours to get

rid of large capacity magazines to

address the issues that we're trying to

advance on background checks on

ammunition and you know we can't we can

only do it for our state and then we got

to fight in the courts so we got to

fight these an organized national rifle

so but then you got an entire party it

seems completely bankrupt with no

capacity now and don't claim to be

compassionate if you're participating

complicit Lee in the world you're living

in society becomes how we behave

the lack of resolve I mean it's just an

outrage and you know I can't put borders

up speaking of borders and a neighboring

state where you can buy this damn stuff

legally how the hell is that possible

and I'm I have no problem with the

Second Amendment you have a right to

bear arms but not weapons have got near

mass destruction and you talk to any

nurse here

Democrat Republican nurses they're like

man are you guys asleep at the wheel

what we see every single damn night do

you have a clue the toll this takes on

the human body give me a break you need

these damn things for hunting give me a

break yeah because we're not giving up

or California we're better than this I'm

also in a state where 27 damn percent of

us are foreign-born that's America's

come in attraction and for all the

hatred and the vitriol and white

supremacy out there and this notion of

superiority you know we'll grow out of

that as a nation but we'll have to go

through this and we got to educate a

generation after generation there's it's

caught up in this vortex of hate and by

the way for Tex of hate is very familiar

to folks out here in California so we

had it in the 90s hell we had in the

1890s Chinese Exclusion Act where'd that

come from California but we work through

it we'll work through this but as long

as we're vigilant and we call out those

that are complicit we call out people

that are sitting on the sidelines we

call out people that are excusing

themselves from entering deeply in this

debate and getting involved in this as a

cultural issue not just a weapon issue

and it is but it's also a culture issue

and call it out with clarity and

conviction that's called leadership and

leadership needs to be found everywhere

but there's two kinds formal Authority

and moral authority what's goddamn

absent in this country right now is

moral authority on these issues

yeah always we just passed laws to ban

large capacity magazines set for the

National Rifle Association suit would

have already gone into effect we just

passed a law it allows for the first

state in American history to require

background checks on ammunition

purchases I mean this guy may have

bought the gun in Vegas or whatever I

don't know

Nevada forgive me I don't worry about

the ammunition we require background

check now maybe he would have had I

don't know but it's a second capacity

tear to be able to review and scrutinize

and of course these guys are suing and

they're going to this I don't want to

talk about the judge but it's just

remarkable so you used to be able to

count on the courts and we're gonna have

to monitor that as well you know what

you know I'm sick and tired of that I'm

sick and tired of that every single one

of these times say it's not the right

time these guys come out and politicize

it and you know week goes by and they're

nowhere to be found

they're not focusing on these damn

issues none of them and then they start

with this specious notion well this

particular gun law when I saw this it's

deeper than one particular gun law it's

about advocacy leadership and changing

culture and they're not interested in

that debate they their bank runs on this

they're on the wrong side and people are

losing lives and God forbid it goes to

anyone they love or care about it keeps

happening over and over and over again

on their damn watch so with all due

respect I dia that somehow this is being

politicized because people are sick and

tired of this and don't want to go in

and see a grandmother lost a

six-year-old or a three-year-old I've

got a three-year-old and a six-year-old

how do you sit there as a human being

forget being governor and try to explain

away the status quo where you've got

people that are complicit in Washington

DC aren't doing a damn thing on these

issues a damn thing on these issues and

their pundits that back them up and the

money that's part of all this shame on

them

grandmother and some of other family

members you you visited with today had

showed great strength and bravery even

comfort you could you just tell us a bit

more about your visit with this

grandmother who has already lost so much

and is now fighting her own fight I did

she even visit with me that idea that

her family would even bring me in come

on I mean my daughter went to the Mercer

moon last week because she had six

stitches I'm still getting over that

she's nine she's lost a six-year-old

gone forever her daughter's in another

hospital and she I mean this is insane

only in America only in America and you

know here we go again but we're not

giving up because we're better than this

and this stay will continue to lead

we're gonna do more we're gonna do

better I'm going to continue to call out

people that are unwilling to engage in

the kind of conversation we need to have

not only change gun laws but to change

culture

remember years ago was the question we

got about going to a movie I'm good

friends of mine said I still sit in the

back of a movie theater and I check the

exits before I walk in I mean

so

law enforcement they weren't good they

were great I mean if there's story here

besides the deep deep empathy we have

for the loss of lives and those that

have been injured Wow

law enforcement talk about the brave

talk about folks that deserve our

admiration and so many more lives would

have been lost and it not been for those

officers they deserve so much credit and

all I would say in that respect is they

have your back and you know what I still

feel like only way we're gonna lose this

debate is by not going to public events

I'm gonna lose this debate by not being

vigilant at the same time not just

rolling over and accepting that this has

to be the norm because it doesn't have

to be the norm as long as we change our

behavior and all of us are held to a

higher level in encounter I thank you

guys so much I thank you
