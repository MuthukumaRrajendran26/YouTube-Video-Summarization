hello I'm Erik Sorensen and this is the

West block politics perspectives and

players bold brash Boris Johnson is

Britain's new prime minister he believes

brexit will happen with a new deal at

the UK and the EU will sign so what does

this mean for the UK and Beyond joining

us now from London is the former deputy

chief executive of BBC News Richard Eyre

Richard thanks for joining us

your new prime minister certainly exudes

confidence does a new deal seem possible

as he says by October 31st or is he

setting everyone up for a blame Europe

hard exit no no Eric nobody has ever

doubted Boris Johnson's self confidence

he's he's following and his main pitch

to the nation in the few days since he

became Prime Minister has been that we

should share that confidence in

ourselves as a as a nation if the if the

slogan hadn't been taken by somebody

else already I guess it would be make

Britain great again the problem is that

for those who don't believe in Boris

Johnson

they say that faith isn't enough that

you have to have policies and at the

moment he's only a policy that we know

of is that Britain will leave the EU by

the 31st of October whether or not it

reaches a deal with the EU how we should

reach a deal what that deal should say

it's completely unknown to us and the

fear is that it might be unknown to him

to in simple terms I mean brexit speaks

to creating a border between the EU and

the UK and yet the only land border that

exists is between Ireland and Northern

Ireland of all places speak to why that

is such a hard hurdle to clear the

problem is the EU have insisted that any

withdrawal agreement between the UK and

the EU must include what's called the

backstop in other words an insurance

policy which says that if after many

months maybe even years of trying to

reach a trade deal between the EU and

the UK if those talks fail to achieve a

deal which means that doesn't need to be

a border then the UK will have to

within the EU customs union to enable

the free movement of goods across the

border the moment there's a complete

standoff Boris Johnson has said very

clearly in the last three days there

will be no agreement while the backstop

continues to be part of it and EU have

responded by saying the backstop

absolutely has to be part of a

withdrawal agreement its stalemate who

knows what will happen now Canada is not

a part of that at all but Canada UK

trade could be affected by all of this

there was a trade deal pretty much

finalized but that now seems to be on

hold is brexit already having an effect

on Canada UK trade not yet not actually

the effect over the last two years has

been positive for both both sides

because two years ago the EU including

of course the UK reached a deal with

Canada for tariff free or very low

tariffs trade between our two countries

the problem is that once we leave the

European Union we will not be part of

that agreement which was reached between

the EU and Canada so the UK proposed

that there should be a continuation of

the agreement bilaterally between the UK

and Canada sounds sensible the two

countries should continue to charge very

low tariffs or no tariffs on one other's

goods that sounded great but earlier

this year for fear that prices of all

imported goods were going to rise when

Britain leaves the EU the British

government announced that it would

charge no tariffs on most goods arriving

into this country from any country in

the world

so the Canadians said hang on why should

we grant special access to Canada's

markets for the UK if the UK is throwing

open its doors and welcoming all

countries of the world to import into

the UK without paying tariffs so the

potential deal between Britain and

Canada is now on ice it may be dead if

it isn't resurrected then by the 31st of

October if Boris Johnson keeps his word

and Britain leaves the EU

then Canada will be obliged under World

Trade Organization rules to start

charging significant tariffs on a whole

range of UK goods including food and

drink and that will inevitably push up

prices for Canadian consumers and more

to the point for us it will hit British

exports I want to ask you about the

relationship between say our Prime

Minister and your new prime minister but

first let me start with Boris Johnson

and Donald Trump and the relationship

between the UK and the US and what kind

of an alliance of interests that could

emerge from that now it's true of course

that the two men have much in common

they both have this shock of blonde hair

much-beloved of cartoonists they're both

like nothing more than addressing a huge

audience and telling the audience

whatever it is they want to hear and

both of them have had very colorful

private lives and they both say things

in public that they later regret and

then deny having said them and perhaps

most fundamentally they they both share

a passing familiarity with the truth but

there are very very serious differences

between the two Boris Johnson is

actually pretty bright guy

intellectually he runs rings around

Donald Trump Johnson speaks fluent

French he speaks fluent Italian he

speaks fluent would you believe Latin

surprisingly often using it Donald

Trump's command of even English raises

some doubts they don't share a worldview

it's very unlikely that Boris Johnson is

going to support America's approach to

Iran further trying to isolate Iran

Johnson shares the European view that

you engage Iran with incentives and with

talk to try to secure their nuclear

plans Boris Johnson is at heart a

liberal Richard we only have a few

seconds and I just want to get you just

in those few seconds to say whether you

think that Prime Minister Trudeau could

be out of step with with Johnson and

Trump because she is so unlike them no I

think actually a

Boris Johnson and Trudeau have much more

in common than you might think that both

clever they're both bright they're both

basically liberal a very opposite of

Donald Trump I think Canadians have

almost nothing to fear from an alliance

between Trump and Johnson are nothing to

fear at all

Richard era thank you very much for

talking to us from London you're welcome
