more money back in your pocket so that

you can get ahead

a new volga mall consultative laughs

along same i am a metal applaud our jean

double posh pork evoke we see a

ameliorate VAR accordion now we all know

what the next 40 days is going to look

like for the Liberals Justin Trudeau is

going to go across Canada telling you

that you've never had it so good well

you know what maybe people in his world

are feeling that way but we know that

more and more Canadians are feeling the

pinch and they're worried about their

future and Trudeau's not afraid to

lecture you about how you've never been

better off but we know that that's just

not the case that's not what I hear

everywhere I go whether it's in

Vancouver or Winnipeg or here in the GTA

I keep hearing the same thing things

just keep getting more and more

expensive people are working harder and

harder but they're just not getting

ahead and the facts bear this out we

know that nearly half of all Canadians

are less than $200 away a month from

insolvency we know another third

actually can't cover their monthly

expenses and are falling further into

debt and just yesterday we learned that

Canadian household wealth declined for

the first time in ten years this is the

unfortunate reality for far too many

Canadians today and Justin Trudeau is

just making it worse now we know that

when Trudeau was first elected he

promised he would be different let's

think back to some of those promises he

made in 2015 he said that he would

balance the budget sorry he said the

budget would balance itself in 2019 but

we know that's not the case it didn't do

it

itself he said he would help the middle

class but once the spotlight dimmed and

reality set in the last four years have

shown us that Justin Trudeau is

just not as advertised instead of

helping the middle class he's raised

taxes on over 80% of middle-class

Canadians while he's imposed a carbon

tax that is making everything more

expensive from home heating to gasoline

and groceries and everyday essentials

are more expensive now more than ever

he's run massive deficits that threaten

our social programs while also

threatening other important services and

guaranteeing even higher taxes to come

so in that sense he has delivered he's

delivered higher gas taxes higher home

heating costs higher taxes to enroll

your kids and dance soccer practice or

other after-school activities who gets

ahead under Justin Trudeau who gets

ahead under Justin Jarrell it's not you

it's not you it's liberal insiders it's

people who are friends with high-powered

liberal officials those people get the

special deals they get to skip the line

and they're pushing you out you get four

years of you've had four years of Justin

Trudeau firing whistleblowers letting

corporate lobbyists write the laws and

actually breaking those laws to help his

friends escape convictions for very

serious crimes we found out today we

found out today that not only are the

RCMP looking into possible obstruction

of justice charges but Justin Trudeau is

actually obstructing their attempts to

find out if obstruction of justice

actually happened

[Applause]

Juicin Trudeau a delay Mon songs -

laughs Edison syllable a a encore OGE

encore or should we will continue the

delay show students on pathway even

today he's saying things that just

aren't true he's saying that he doesn't

have the ability to allow Jody Wilson

Rabil to speak the truth or two

officials in his office to speak the

truth but we know that's not true he can

do it

so I'm calling on him right now to do

the right thing if he has nothing

further to hide he will lift that

cabinet confidentiality he will allow

the RCMP to do their job and if he

doesn't we all know that he's hiding

something

Justin Trudeau has lost the moral

authority to govern and on October 21st

Canadians will send him that message

now despite all this ladies and

gentlemen despite the difficulties we've

had over the last four years I am an

optimist and sometimes some of you may

have heard this I know some of our

candidates have heard this sometimes

people say I smile too much and maybe

that's true I do smile a lot but it's

hard not to smile when you have amazing

candidates like Teresa Cruz and Anna

Roberts it's hard not to smile when you

have an amazing diverse exceptional team

of candidates throughout the GTA

throughout Ontario throughout Canada

it's hard not to smile when you have the

right plan and the right policies that

will help Canadians get ahead and I'm

here to say that after four years of

mounting debt higher taxes higher bills

and ever-growing expenses it's time for

you to finally have a government that

gets it it's time for you to get ahead

and the reason why I'm so excited now

that this campaign has officially kicked

off is precisely because after four

years of being neglected and ignored you

the hard-working people of Canada will

finally get to take the stage and be

heard

now making real people the focus of

government is the last thing the Justin

Trudeau wants this government has always

been about Justin Trudeau his style over

substance

his selfies his vacations his insider

connections and his millionaire friends

the well-connected few the Bombardier is

the Loblaws the essence ile avalance

the executives and their lobbyists the

Prime Minister's office who always had

their government checkbook open to them

but for the drivers the commuters the

entrepreneurs the seniors the farmers

the oil patch workers the past four

years have been years of hard work but

higher taxes mounting bills and broken

promises everyday Canadians who are

working harder and harder just trying to

get ahead they are our friends and our

neighbors they are who we are our

colleagues and our co-workers our

parents our siblings our children people

with real struggles that's who

conservatives are in it for

[Applause]

people who just want a break because

they are working hard and doing

everything they can but are only just

getting by that was how I grew up my mom

and dad worked really hard and they

raised my sisters and I in an era of

inflation high taxes and crushing high

interest rates on their mortgage and I

saw firsthand the difficult decisions

they had to make to provide for us the

kinds of decisions every single one of

you make every day these are the real

stories of middle-class Canadians

something Justin Trudeau just does not

understand in any in every corner of

this country people are working hard

struggling and sacrificing for their

kids and for their future they aren't

the insiders they don't have the money

to hire government lobbyists and nobody

has ever invited them to party on a

private island they are doing the best

they can to get ahead and they deserve a

government that will help and our

conservative team has a plan for our

government to live within its means to

put more money back in your pockets so

that you can get ahead

so we're going to start with the

essentials job number one for a

Conservative government all my

candidates and future MPs you need to

know this because job number one the

very first piece of legislation that you

will be asked to vote on will be called

an act to cancel the carbon tax number

one

[Applause]

thank you merci beaucoup you know what

we're gonna go one step further you know

in Canada we don't pay the GST on things

that are determined to be necessities

that's why you don't pay it on things

like prescription drugs or groceries

well living in Saskatchewan and I know

the same is true in most parts of Canada

heating your home in the winter is a

necessity not a luxury we're going to

take the GSC off of home heating and

home energy supply we're going to give

new parents a break going to give new

parents a break when new moms and dads

go on maternity or parental leave they

make a huge sacrifice they give up a

huge percentage of their income so we're

gonna make the e a√≠ maternity benefits

that they receive tax-free under Justin

Trudeau under Justin Trudeau Canada has

become a country of no no to big

projects that bring our country closer

together a Conservative government will

be a government that makes Canada a

country of yes yes to big nation

building projects like pipelines so that

we can get so we can get Western

Canadian energy to Eastern Canadian

markets and get off of foreign oil once

and for all

we're going to fight global climate

change with a real plan for our

environment fighting emissions here at

home and abroad by advocating for green

technology not taxes and once and for

all because it's 2019 we are going to

ban the practice of dumping raw sewage

into our rivers lakes and oceans we are

going to ensure a stable predictable

funding for healthcare and social

services and we're going to make sure

that you can save for your retirement

and plan for your future we're going to

show leadership here at home and on the

world stage so we can proudly fight for

Canadian jobs and stand up for Canadian

interests around the world

so Canada's conservatives have a plan

for you and I can't wait to take our

plan across this country about how we

can help you and make life more

affordable so that you can make ends

meet so that you can build the life you

want for your family

I believe that Canada should be a

country where no matter who you are or

where you live you can build the life

that you want so on behalf of every

Conservative Party in a candidate in

Canada I am asking for your vote on

October 21st

[Applause]

the choice the choice in this election

could not be any clearer it really

couldn't we're Justin Trudeau will abuse

the power of his office to reward his

friends and punish his critics I will

restore ethics and integrity and shine a

light on his corruption where he has

embarrassed us on the world stage I will

represent Canada with strength and

resolve and always stand up for

Canadians around the world

Aloha Krishnan Trudeau new fell apart or

solar planet given massive Ray Kelly
