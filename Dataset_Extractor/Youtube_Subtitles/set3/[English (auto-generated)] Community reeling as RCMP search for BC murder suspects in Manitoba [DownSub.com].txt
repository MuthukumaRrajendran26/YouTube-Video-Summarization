we know that officers from multiple

detachments are on the ground in gilliam

as well as this tactical assault vehicle

just in case cars are stopped and

checked coming and going out of the one

road into Gilliam in town a little more

activity the grocery store and

convenience store have reopened but

people are still very much on edge it's

about the safety of your employees and

if they're not comfortable coming to

work in that kind of environment then

they don't have to come to work we're a

small town we're here to support each

other safety is a concern the Mounties

have warned how dangerous the suspects

are and although no one knows if cam

McCloud or briars mikulski are still in

the area the idea that the two potential

killers are hiding out in town is

disturbing you would see a lot of kits

with their bikes a group of friends

always hanging out you'll be hearing

laughter by now or playing having them

play in the sand and even parents

walking with their kids and it's just we

haven't seen that in the last couple of

days the terrain is also about as rugged

and remote as you can get a challenge

for police to comb why would you come to

the to the dead-end corner of the world

it's the perfect place to get caught in

my opinion Jesse Taylor knows the

terrain he's an outdoorsman and helps

our trap lines we definitely would have

a backpack and you know if we're going

super light you'd take a tarp and you

know this time here do want to

definitely have a bug jacket that

absolutely drive you insane

the insects this time of year not to

mention other forms of wildlife black

bears and wolves roam these parts
