friends we're here in London beautiful

city city I spent five years of my life

when I went to Western I got to see it

was a city where I spent some of my ax

hats and my best memories and some of my

toughest this is the city where my

brother I came to live with me I took

him in I took care of them it's a time

when we went through a lot of struggles

I had to work a lot of jobs to make ends

meet it was during that time that a lot

of friends and family stepped up and

helped me out they helped out with food

and was support and it reminded me of a

very Canadian value I wouldn't have gone

through those tough times without their

support and that's what Canadians

believe in we believe in taking care of

now you all know I love Canada and I

believe you can make it even better

through those to the other chance to

speak with Jessica Nancy and John now

jessica is pregnant and a cancer

survivor she told me about how difficult

it was and how difficult it is for her

to afford the medication that she needs

without coverage it's crushing I met Jen

Nancy and Jack we're both retired and

they told me about how they continued to

worry about out-of-pocket health care

expenses they don't know when the next

expense is going to come up they don't

know how many how much it's going to

cost for dental care or if they need new

glasses and don't worry

now I believe we can do better for

people like Nancy Jack and Jessica but

we can do that only if we have the

courage to take on the powerful

interests at the very top we can expand

our Medicare system to food medication

for all pharma care for all and extend

it beyond that to include dental care

vision and hearing care and mental

health services

we can do that but only if we have the

courage to take on the lobbyists and the

corporate interests we can build 500,000

new affordable homes across this country

and tackle the housing crisis we can do

that but only if we have the courage to

take on money launderers and speculators

that keep us dry of the cost of housing

and we can provide a relief for

Canadians who are paying some of the

highest cost in the world for cell

phones and Internet services we can do

that but only get the courage to take on

the big telecom baggage we can fight now

we can act out to take on the climate

crisis and build 300,000 you quality

jobs but only if you have the courage to

take on the big polluters and to end the

FASTA to substance

[Applause]

the theme that national it is la

more conservative in Aveiro

from cleanest system kavita fish in a

store with a la la' has company four

years ago Justin Trudeau charmed us with

three words and empty promises he said

the right things but he didn't do them

behind closed doors just a choux dough

does whatever the wealth and powerful

corporations want it's clear Justin

Trudeau isn't who he pretended to be and

as you share the Conservatives are not

the answer they are gonna cut taxes for

the wealthy but they're gonna cut

services that you and your families

count on you'll hear the price with the

deep and worse with even more expensive

health care even more expensive

medication and even worse it in climate

difference resume and schwa

clap so keep we were counting to surpass

so this election comes down to a really

clear question who can you count on to

fight me when I was right when I was a

kid I never imagined that someone that

looked like me would be running to be

Prime Minister people told me time and

time again the things that I couldn't do

but now kids run up and say seeing you

do this I feel like I can do anything

we have an exciting opportunity over the

next 40 days we are going to bring a

hopeful message to Canadians that we can

build the country of our dreams a

country where everyone has a place to

call home health care when they need it

clean water to drink and clean air to

breathe good jobs and a bright future

you know everywhere I go I meet

hard-working people we want to be

treated fairly and want to build a good

life for themselves and their family

these are the people New Democrats have

always worked for these are the people

[Applause]
