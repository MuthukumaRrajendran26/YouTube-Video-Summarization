doesn't work each we were told at that

time that there was a cap of three major

drug companies who produce insulin who

control ninety percent of the market who

produce a product which costs a few

dollars for that product and as a result

made last year fourteen and a half

billion dollars in profit at the same

time is one out of four insulin uses in

the United States a rationing their

insulin that's a pretty crazy situation

it typically has retailed me US dollars

twenty six to thirty dollars as opposed

to three hundred forty dollars depending
