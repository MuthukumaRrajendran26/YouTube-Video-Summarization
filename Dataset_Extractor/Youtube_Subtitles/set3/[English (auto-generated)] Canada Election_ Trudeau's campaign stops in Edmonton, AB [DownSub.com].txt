great to see you all hello Edmonton

hello

liberals Thank You Elinor for that

introduction I got a question for you

are there any liberals in Edmonton thank

you so much for the welcome here it's

great to be back earlier today I was in

Victoria announcing our government's

plan to help even more Canadians buy

their first homes because we believe in

moving Canada forward and I'll get to

that in a second but first Edmonton my

friends let's all give it up once again

for an incredible local leader and the

next MP for Edmonton Strathcona Eleanor

you know

just just a few months ago Eleanor I

brought my wife Sophie and me to remedy

cafe alright and I'll tell you the pride

she feels for this community her

dedication to service and her advocacy

for seniors and families are exactly why

she is the right voice for Edmonton

Strathcona liberals

my friends look around look at what

we've created together in 2015 you

believed we could make real change

happen

you wanted a team that would work for

you not for the wealthiest few a team

that cared about the next generation not

just the next election a team that

prioritized people not power and

together guided by our shared values we

built that team with your enthusiasm and

your ideas your positivity and your

energy your hope and your hard work we

have built the most open political

movement in Canada

nefi

my friends this fall we get to determine

the future of our country we get to

decide thank you

we get to decide what kind of future we

want to build together in 2015 after a

decade of failed conservative policy

Canada's economy was flat economic

growth job creation wage growth all were

stalled thanks to a Conservative

government that believed cuts and

austerity were the answers to everything

so Canadians chose a new team that was

willing to invest in people and in their

communities we knew then and we know now

that even though we live in the best

country in the world better is always

possible

and while of course there's far more

work ahead of us than behind us

[Applause]

thank you every day but of course we

know there's more work ahead of us than

there is behind us but we have spent the

last four years moving forward and we've

got the record to show for it

poverty is way down unemployment is that

historic lows and job creation is way up

and it's because our team rejected

conservative cuts and austerity and

chose instead to invest in the middle

class and people working hard to join

we invested in Edmonton families who get

hundreds of dollars every month to help

with the high cost of raising their kids

thanks to our new Canada Child Benefit

we've invested in every single person

who will have soon have a safer trip

across the 50th Street crossing and yes

we've invested in local

[Applause]

[Applause]

and yes my friends we've invested in

local oil and gas workers and our women

and men in the skilled trades who will

directly benefit because our government

stepped up and bought the trans mountain

expansion project now I've made a point

of coming to Alberta and to Edmonton

many many times since I've became Prime

Minister because this province and its

people matter Alberta has been key to

Canada's economic success over the

course of our history but we know but we

know that recently times have been tough

for Albertans and that's led to

increased anxiety for many but just as

you have been there to contribute so

much to Canada over the years so too

will people from the rest of Canada be

there for you

I don't need to remind anyone that

that's just who we are as a nation

therefore our neighbors to support each

other through thick and thin I made a

promise and my government will always

hold by it we will never pit regions of

this country against each other and you

can rest assured that we will always

have your back

[Applause]

Michelle's devotee polish on the P Donna

can involve Eve this fall we've all got

a choice to make

keep moving forward and build on the

progress we've made or go back to the

Harper years

you see conservatives like to say

they're for the people but then they cut

taxes for the wealthy and cut services

for everybody else other than deciding

that they might need to smile more

they have no new ideas for Canadians

they still think you can cut your way to

prosperity but as Canadians know that's

the wrong approach to take

that's why we chose to move Canada

forward by investing in families in

workers and in communities and by having

faith in Canadians

[Applause]

this season here in in four short years

Canadians have created over a million

new jobs we we negotiated new health

accords with the provinces and

territories with historic investments in

home care and mental health we

eliminated 87 boil water advisories and

indigenous communities and our on

schedule to lift all those that remain

the new Canada Child Benefit is helping

parents with hundreds of dollars

tax-free every month and we've lifted

nine hundred thousand Canadians out of

poverty including three hundred thousand

gets

together we did this because my friends

at the end of the day politics is about

people it's about you maybe you're a

recent grad or a new Canadian or maybe

you're raising your kids or living out

your golden years in retirement

whoever you are you deserve a real plan

for the future we've done a lot together

these past four years but the truth is

we're just getting started

so Edmonton you have an important choice

to make will we go back to the failed

policies of the past or will we continue

to move forward that's the choice

it's that clear and it's that important

that's why I can't wait to talk with

Canadians over the next few weeks about

our plan to keep moving Canada forward

I'm asking all of you to stand with our

liberal team where's our liberal team

come on up guys I'm asking you for your

help

it's because of all of you that we won

in 2015 and we need you now more than

ever so please get out there and talk to

your neighbors volunteer with Eleanor or

anyone else here drive people to the

polls make phone calls donate if you can

and most importantly go knock doors on

October 21st help Canadians choose a

government that will fight for you and

with you for a stronger middle class and

for a better Canada for all Canadians

so from coast to coast to coast let's

stand as one voice and let's choose

forward
