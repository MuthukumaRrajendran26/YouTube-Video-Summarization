ever since Neil Armstrong first set foot

on the moon the conspiracy theories

began everybody loved the conspiracy

that's Paul Delaney astronomer and

senior lecturer at York University can

you effectively generate that type of

illusion today the answer is probably

yes but back in 1969 in 1771 the answer

is no conspiracy number one how was the

flag waving in no atmosphere NASA knew

image was everything and if it wanted to

secure more government funding the

public needed to be impressed a flag

standing on the surface of the Moon

which is limp isn't nearly as good a

photo-op they made it look like it was

waving in the wind by installing a

horizontal rod on top of the flag

however the astronauts were unable to

extend the entire way giving it that

waving effect conspiracy number two why

aren't there any stars in the photos a

limited exposure range is the reason why

we can't see stars in any of the Apollo

photos unlike our eyes cameras can take

in only a certain amount of light if the

exposure is too high everything will

look too bright too low everything will

look too dark sun's shining on them they

were reflecting brightly the surface

which was worth being brightly stars on

earth let alone the moon it's the same

brightness they're relatively faint

conspiracy number three the shadows are

wrong conspiracy theorists point out

that since the Sun is the only light

source on the moon shadow angles should

be consistent however when sunlight hits

the surface of the Moon

some of it bounces off meaning the moon

itself becomes a reflective light source

professional photographers refer to this

as a film that's why an astronaut in the

lunar modules shadow isn't completely

shrouded in black the moon's light is

softening the shadow conspiracy number

four why didn't the astronauts die from

radiation exposure the spacecraft's hull

shielded the astronauts from being

exposed to lethal radiation while

traveling through the Van Allen belts

flares in Earth's magnetic field that

trapped solar wind particles

high levels of radiation once cleared

they were exposed to natural background

radiation you certainly wouldn't want

the astronauts on the surface of the

Moon in their spacesuits for days on end

but for the hours we're talking about on

the moon's surface the radiation

environment is comparable to the

radiation environment we have here

conspiracy number five who film Neil

Armstrong stepping on the moon are we

gonna send people to the moon to stand

on the moon and not have a camera

strapped to the outside of a lunar

module NASA put cameras on every piece

of the Apollo spacecraft that's why we

have stunning images like this this and

this you don't go that far and miss the

photo opportunity of the century of

history if you're still skeptical

several photos of the moon's surface

have been taken over the decades showing

Apollo Lunar Module exactly where Neil

Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin parted 50

years ago the notion that a conspiracy

of the magnitudes required needing tens

of thousands of people to stay quiet

about it for decades again you know the

US government sanctions are secret for

more than a few hours generally speaking

let alone for decades
