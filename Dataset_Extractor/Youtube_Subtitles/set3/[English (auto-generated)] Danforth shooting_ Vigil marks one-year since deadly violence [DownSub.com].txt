as a witness that they stand together

with those two families who've lost

their loved ones and the 13 incredible

survivors of gunshots there are hundreds

of witnesses also who were traumatized

as they ran for cover fearing the worst

who would have imagined that the dynamic

exciting summer night on the damn floor

would be lit up with emergency lights

and the wonderful music of joy would be

drowned out with the sound of siren the

sirens of emergency vehicles tonight one

year later our hearts are heavy but our

love is strong and our determination to

overcome is powerful tonight we take

back the night and on and on the

danforth with the power of hope and the

light and the resolve of peace tonight

new sounds will penetrate our hearts our

minds and our memories the sounds of

church bells tonight and in the days and

years to come we will remember them our

great city is strong in its diversity

steadfast in its determination to

continue to make Toronto an incredible

place to live in peace and harmony as we

simply support each other as we share an

encouraging word give a hug or offer a

prayer these deep words will impact the

lives who have been hurt so many will

begin to heal the scars on the bodies

will heal heal before the memories but

those scars also

will heal even though they take a bit

longer tonight we acknowledge that we

are on the traditional territory of many

First Nations including the

Mississauga's of the credit yeah an

initial effect and simple wah in the

hootenanny she me and the wind up

people's and is now home of many diverse

First Nations Inuit and m√©tis people's

we also acknowledge that trauma was

covered by the treaty thirteen signed

with the Mississauga's of the credit and

the Williams treaties signed with

multiple Mississauga's and Chippewa

bands I am Walter Kelly one of the

chaplains for the Toronto paramedic

services tonight we are here to express

our love our support and our sense of

community to the families of those who

are lost to those who are injured and to

those who witnessed unspeakable violence

thank you for being here your presence

makes the difference we help one another

to remember and we help one another to

heal we remember the victims and think

of all those who live with memories of

that night such a cowardly act pales

against the strength spirit and

community that has been displayed since

then and again this evening I will

surely read the names of those whose

lives were lost in this tragedy the

bells of st. Barnabas on the Danforth

anniken church will chime to commemorate

the ages of the two young girls who were

taken from their family and their

friends that night we remember we follow

I don't think any of us will remember

those few and will forget those few

moments with those bells ringing and it

trust it will be a good memory for the

two families that lost two wonderful

children tonight we also want to

remember and think of those who are

injured I have no idea of any or all of

them are here tonight but 13 people were

their lives were changed the impact of

what happened to them will live on for

many many years tonight we also want to

think of them and we want to bless their

families as we remember them and those

who witnessed this horrible event but to

those and and those who were injured we

want to name if they're near you or if

thank you dear members of the interfaith

choir form for this from the

commemoration from the faith community

Hilary may we continue to support

Reis and Juliana families and those who

have been injured we pause and thank

those strangers friends and neighbors

who did all they could to help the

injured

emergency staff of the trauma centers

healing and help to the injured we pray

for those who still need special rehab

therapy and perhaps those who need

special counseling Nelson Mandela wrote

that we have lived it is what difference

we have made to the lives of others that

will be will be determined the
