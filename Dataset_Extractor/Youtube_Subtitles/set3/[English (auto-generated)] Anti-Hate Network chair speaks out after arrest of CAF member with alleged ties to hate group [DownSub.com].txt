to find out that there is this

individual allegedly involved with the

base which is probably the most violent

of the groups out there I'm I'm not

shocked what shocks me more is the last

laksa basical attitude that's being

taken by the Canadian military and

dealing with this well my my guess is

that it is a much bigger problem but let

us assume for a moment that it's it's a

small number well what's a small number

thirty forty fifty they say fifty is a

small number well then how many of those

fifty who are inclined violently might

actually take action based on the

training that they've received the

Canadian military really all we need is

one person we know that they've

identified upwards to 50 violent white

supremists amongst the military ranks

and we have no clue at all what they're

doing with them does that mean for

example that they've identified them and

put them on leave on an administrative

leave have they taken them out of the

military there's no plan that we don't

know anything and and the fact of the

matter is they constitute a clear and

present danger and it's up to the

Minister of Defense to take action and

to let Canadians know what action is

being taken so we can get some level of

comfort from there right now I have no

level of comfort I've been involved in

in dealing with neo-nazis and white

supremists for three decades to me this

is the most dangerous and scariest time

that I can ever recall what about all

the other reports so what about the

other 50 or so members of adam' Waffen

of hammer skins of soldiers of odin

allegedly still in the Canadian military

have they taken decisive action against

them and here's the interesting thing as

well we're into an election cycle so not

only have we not heard from the defense

minister we've not heard from the leader

of the Opposition we've not heard from

the leader of the third party we've not

heard from the leader of the Green Party

can you imagine for a moment if 50

members

Isis were identified as getting military

training and members of the Canadian

military we would probably have a

national nervous breakdown and yet for

white supremists who by the way have

murdered dozens and dozens of Canadians

and Americans in our synagogues in our

mosques and in our churches and on the

streets we seem to be very lackadaisical

about it especially the military and

that's not acceptable it's simply not

acceptable they would like to ask the

Minister of Defence straight out what

are you doing about neo-nazis and white

supremacist in the military tell the

Canadian people don't tell us that

you're investigating don't tell us that

you don't stand for racism that's great

what are you doing about the neo-nazis

and white supremists in the military
