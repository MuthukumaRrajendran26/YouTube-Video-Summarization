a penis is the most reliable and

effective way to achieve female orgasm

because it's sword it's so mighty right

oh my god hi I'm dr. Jen Gunter I'm an

OBGYN I'm also known as twitter's

resident gynecologist let's get to

debunking some health misconceptions and

myths I've got a bowl here all right

what do we got vaginal steaming is

necessary to keep the vagina clean no no

don't steam it all your vagina is a

self-cleaning oven it doesn't need any

help at all and did you know that vagina

steaming is based on the patriarchal

myth that the vagina is dirty it's not

it's amazing

jump steam cranberry juice can prevent

your inner tract infections nope

that's an old myth cleanses and detoxes

are necessary to rid the body of toxins

no not at all these words mean nothing

in medicine this is predatory marketing

and nobody ever even says what toxins

are they're like nothing so no you don't

need a cleanse and a detox you have

kidneys and you have a liver and you're

just fine and you know what I only have

one kidney I'm still fine that's how

good your kidneys are Gwyneth Paltrow is

a trusted health professional you guys

are trolling me how you keep up with the

stuff I read what you're doing and

that's how I get ideas i i i read a lot

of slowly no coffee is a great a natural

way to cleanse your colon no not at all

oh my god keep your coffee out of your

rectum and in your cup coffee enemas are

not a thing and the idea that it could

be beneficial when introduced directly

in your butt and not by ingesting it

orally is so many levels of what the I

don't even know a penis is the most

reliable and effective way to achieve

female orgasm

this is sword so mighty right oh my god

30% of women can orgasm with penile

penetration alone but two-thirds need

clitoral stimulation of some kind in

other ways if a penis doesn't prove

that's great if a penis doesn't do it

for you then there's many other great

ways to achieve an orgasm and obviously

women who partner with women have lots

of orgasms so a penis is not a metric of

female sexual satisfaction 75 percent of

women are satisfied with their sex lives

sadly no that is unfortunately a myth

it's about 49 49 50 percent food can

change the scent of your vagina no no

first of all this implies that the scent

of a vagina needs to be changed a vagina

is glorious and if your partner were

someone who doesn't think so then they

shouldn't be partnering with you just

think about it if you're eating

pineapple it doesn't make your sweat

smell differently doesn't make your

armpits smell differently No so the

vagina it doesn't have some secret

pineapple concentrating mechanism that

the rest of your body doesn't have the

way your vagina smells and tastes is

controlled by this good bacteria that's

in your vagina called the lactobacilli

it's not controlled by food that's a

myth and again it's based on the

patriarchal idea that there's something

wrong with how a normal vagina smells

and tastes so just eat pineapple if you
