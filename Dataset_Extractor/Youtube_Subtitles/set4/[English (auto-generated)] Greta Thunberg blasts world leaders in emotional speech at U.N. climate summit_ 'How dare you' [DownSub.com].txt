Greta your first climate strike was a

lonely event a little over a year ago

and in the intervening time you have

sparked the interest of millions

literally of children around the globe

demanding action for climate change

what's your message to world leaders

today my message is that we'll be

watching you this is all wrong I

shouldn't be up here I should be back in

school on the other side of the ocean

yet you all come to us young people for

hope how dare you you have stolen my

dreams in my childhood with your empty

words yet I'm one of the lucky ones

people are suffering people are dying

entire ecosystems are collapsing we are

in the beginning of a mass extinction

and all you can talk about is money and

fairytales of eternal economic growth

how dare you

[Applause]

for more than 30 years the science

helping crystal-clear how dare you

continue to look away and come here

saying that you're doing enough when the

politics and solutions needed are still

nowhere in sight you say you hear us and

that you understand the urgency but no

matter how sad and angry I am I do not

want to believe that because if you

really understood the situation and

still kept on failing to act then you

would be evil and that I refuse to

believe the popular idea of cutting our

emissions in half in ten years only

gives us a 50% chance of staying below

1.5 degrees and the risk of setting of

irreversible chain reactions beyond

human control 50% may be acceptable to

you but those numbers do not include

tipping points most feedback loops

additional warming hidden by toxic air

pollution or the aspects of equity and

climate justice they also rely on my

generation sucking hundreds of billions

of tons of your co2 out of the air with

technologies that barely exist so a 50%

risk is simply not acceptable to us we

who have to live with the consequences

to have a 67 percent chance of staying

below a 1.5 degrees of global

temperature rise the best odds given by

the IPCC the world had 420 gigatons of

co2 left to emit back on January 1st

2018 today that figure is already down

to less than 350 gigatons how dare you

pretend that this can be sold with just

as usual and some technical solutions

with today's emissions levels that

remaining co2 budgets will be entirely

gone within less than eight and a half

years there will not be any solutions or

plans presented in line with these

figures here today because these numbers

are too uncomfortable and you are still

not mature enough to tell it like it is

you are failing us but the young people

are starting to understand your betrayal

the eyes of all future generations are

upon you and if you choose to fail us I

say we will never forgive you

[Applause]

we will not let you get away with this

right here right now is where we draw

the line the world is waking up and

change is coming whether you like it or

not thank you

[Applause]
