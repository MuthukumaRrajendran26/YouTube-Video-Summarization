all right good morning everybody I'm

datin mayor nan Whaley this Monday

morning I think some of you have seen as

early as 5:00 a.m. this morning and I'm

glad you're here for this 11 o'clock

briefing let me see why everything city

manager Shelly Dickstein the in City

Commissioner Chris Shaw from the Dayton

foundation Michelle lovely obviously

Chief Richard Beall fire chief pain I

have a thing of actually demoting people

sometimes I'm trying to do better and

Dana City Commissioner Jeff Mims we've

had a busy morning this morning just you

know I've been very impressed with the

outpouring of the spirit of the

community last night folks coming

together in the Oregon district the

Oregon district is open a lot of you who

may not be from here we'll talk about

how the oregon district seems closed

just a point of reference it's a local

owned businesses and so a lot of those

local owned business is closed regularly

on Sunday and Monday that is very

typical for them so they're if you're a

regular in Dayton you know which

restaurants are open on Monday and which

ones aren't

and the majority of them that's their

that's their weekend so I want you to

make sure in your coverage I've heard

that a couple of times when folks have

said well it's see they say it's open

but it seems to be closed it's because

it's Sunday and Monday I know that some

of the I know some of the places are

planning on opening just because of this

on Monday even though they're normally

not open but we are respecting what they

have to do to go through as local

businesses I'm gonna turn it over to

chief Beale next to just give an update

there's not much movement on the

investigation this early but wanted to

see if he had any Seve him some time for

some comments this morning thank you

well thank you mayor I do have just very

brief update I will remind you that we

are less than 36 hours into this

incident and its investigation can't

confirm that if all the magazines that

were recovered from the suspect were

completely full and we have not had a

chance to examine that we just know we

have magazines with bullets in them but

if all of those were completely at full

capacity including the loose rounds

found on the ground near him as well as

in a backpack that he carried he would

have had a maximum of 250 rounds in his

possession at the time we can confirm at

least 41 spent shell casings from his

weapon based on their location and his

path of travel that's at least 41

because you could well understand and a

very dynamic and chaotic scene as this

was with people running through the

crime scene with first responders

running through the crime scene with

emergency EMS trailing through the crime

scene evidence can be lost so we can say

at least 41 spent shell casings from the

suspect

so relates to the officers we have

recovered 48 45 caliber shell casings 16

point two three three caliber shell

casings and one shotgun shell casing in

terms of the persons injured we're

getting different information from other

sources a person is treated in the

hospital so we have previously said 27

or some information it's 32 I can

confirm to you that there is at least 14

of those injured whether that numbers 27

or 30 - at least that were injured

through of gunshot wounds so many people

were injured through other means in

their flight from this very chaotic

events there are autopsies currently

being completed by the coroner's office

so that is a process that

is still undergoing and it will be some

time before we out come a-knockin

autopsies and that's really all I have

to share this far this morning next I'm

going to invite a fire chief pain to

come forward and speak a little bit

about some of the first responders from

the fire EMS response good morning

everybody

so at 107 State Fire Department received

their first dispatch to respond to the

organ district we responded with one

fire crew and one medic which is product

this patch protocol for a shooting

immediately upon receipt arriving on the

scene we realized that we had multiple

Momo people down we have graded it to a

mass casualty incident which call for

additional response personnel and

command units and then it was expanded

once again shortly thereafter our crews

transported five five people to the

hospital

b3 with from medic 14 one from medic ten

and Ashley Riverside medic crew

transported another many of those people

that did make it to the hospital self

transported and and so we initiated our

mass casualty protocol we put communion

it's in place we did our triage and our

treatment and then we facilitated the

transfers to the hospitals in a balanced

manner so we didn't overload any one

Hospital

there are 37 total patients treated at

area hospitals and they resulted from

injuries as a result of gunshot wounds

being trampled and then lacerations from

fleeing the scene and broken glass

as you're aware they had nine victims

plus the shooter were pronounced at the

scene as of nine o'clock this morning we

have eleven victims still hospitalized

that's all I have at this time Thank You

chief next I'd like to invite Michelle

lovely to come forward to talk a little

bit about what we're doing with funds

for the victims families and those that

have been affected by this incident

we've been approached by community

members companies individuals just tons

of people wanting to know how they can

help and what they can do and once again

the dayton community is just such a

strong community unfortunately after the

tornadoes and now this just the

community shows once again that word

eight and strong so we have developed a

fund at the dayton foundation and anyone

can give to that it's the Dayton Oregon

district tragedy fund and the fund

number is 80 365 so you can give right

on our website at dayton foundation org

you can also just send a check to the

dayton foundation with that fund listed

in the memo line but we have had a lot

of questions about how we're using the

funds and how much we've collected and

we are just as anxious as all of you to

get our arms around that but we're less

than 24 hours with our fund being open

so we are meeting actually today at noon

to talk to we've had been approached by

community foundations all across the

United States who have been through

unfortunately been through situations

like this so they're providing guidance

to us and we're also consulting with our

Council on Foundations to find out how

we should appropriately be managing

these funds and making sure that they're

put out into the community and the best

way possible

okay I'll now open it for questions

we've had the opportunity to have some

conversation I will say there's just

more conversation needed I will not say

at this point we have clarity of the

entirety of that relationship do the

other two know me and you like to go out

and get the gun out of that car with a

all three original we have no

information at this time to suggest that

they are aware of the weapons or when

they were introduced into this

environment so we have no information at

this time

we don't have that determine with

certainty we do know the shotgun was

recovered in the trunk but exactly how

they were transported the scene has not

been clarified I believe is still being

treated in the hospital he received a

gunshot wound to the lower torso

not close enough not close enough at all

we have a lot of evidence still to go

through just based on where we're at now

we are not seeing any indication of race

being a motive but we are not through

all the evidence and so until we're

through all the evidence we cannot rule

that out but I'm saying we're not seeing

at any at this time that suggests race

community

yeah I think you know I've spoken a lot

about the grit and the determination of

this community and surely the eight

o'clock vigil was no different

you know grieving it's a process and as

the chief said we're probably 35 hours

into this process but you know I have no

doubt that this community and its

resilience and its and its willingness

to see through we've seen through many

things in this community and I know that

they'll come together that we're coming

together strong again here I'm gonna let

Commissioner Medicine Commissioner Shaw

answer this question as well you know

it's very interesting first of all thank

y'all for being here it's very

interesting to see such a sea of so many

people who had their hearts showing on

their sleeves those who are concerned

about the nine victims which I think was

uppermost in terms of everyone's mind

thinking about them and thinking about

their families having some the

minister's say some the kind of things

that they said that helped people

understand our reasons for being here

our goal is to provide as much safety as

we can for our cities you know we

escaped two major tragedies in terms of

a visit from a hate group back a couple

of months ago and we were able to escape

even there you go what 14 to 15

tornadoes without any loss of life as

well and then for this to come and hit

us at such a hard time and you know

we're all still emotional about this in

terms of how we address these issues and

some of they know that we would start

talking about salt weapons you know

being a Vietnam vet and I understand

clearly the damage that those type of

weapons can inflict upon individuals and

they have no place in the hands of

average everyday citizens so we do need

to have more work done at the federal

and state level to make sure that we

minimize the type of situations for the

future okay thank you

yes I agree with what the mayor and

commissioner said mayor is right that

grieving is a process and we've had

great sadness over the last many hours

but now it's really turning to anger

anger about the lack of movement on gun

control we don't we are not the first

community that's been affected by this

gun violence and we won't be the last

but we have got to do something and I

think we're about to work now of pushing

the legislature and the federal

government to move on responsible gun

control in this community in this

country so that's what I want to leave

you know it's a question I've asked more

than once and I don't think we can know

that for certain

it seems to just defy believability he

would shoot his own sister but it's also

hard to believe that he didn't recognize

that was his sister

so we just don't know

Josh I don't have that information

available I'm pretty much we believe we

piece some of that together

we have a lot of you know cellular

information that we haven't gotten

through yet so we do know there were

some communication once they separate it

I don't think we have all those

timelines established yet as best as I

know trying to get in earlier and be

denied into that one yeah there was some

information I mean early on but I

haven't been able to be partying

conversations to to tease that out and

to clarify that but I do know that was

some indication of them being denied

entrance but I can't confirm that with

certainty we are there's a lot of other

things that we're working on today as

well as our federal partners which are

expediting the transportation and

analysis of digital evidence so there's

a lot more going on behind the scenes

here than just following up with various

individuals that we need to interview so

just we have there's a lot of parts in

motion

yeah I'd understand there's information

out in the media we were clearly

exploring every possible piece of

information we have I'm a little bit

reluctant even if there's such evidence

to interpret it 10 years later as

somehow this is indicative of what

happened yesterday so I think we I will

tell you the mistake that is made and

understand your interest to try to get

information out and to help people

understand by by taking pieces of

evidence and coming to conclusion about

its significance creates mistakes large

mistakes at time I've seen it too often

in national incidents peace mailing

information does more to miss inform

than inform so we really don't notice we

have all the information all the

evidence available we'll take one more

question

yeah the officers are still an

administrative leave so they're not

gonna be available for interviews and

I'm sorry your first question was we

said 14 that we could confirm non-fatal

have been treated of the 27 32 and I

think Jeff you had a different number

even so clearly a couple of dozen people

who were treated for non-fatal injuries

14 of which we can confirm work through

gunshot wounds yeah I spoke with the

president yesterday evening he called I

think it was around 6:00 6:30 before the

vote vigil okay

we'll appreciate you all being here I

know you'll be out and about on Fifth

Street and through the community what

we're really gonna take these as

yesterday we did look at every

three-hour clip I don't want to keep on

calling you in when we don't have

anything new and so the investigation

will take longer it'll take longer

periods of time so you'll hear from us

the next time we do have something new

to share

maybe it's problematic is fundamentally

problematic they have that level of

weaponry and a civilian environment

unregulated is problematic and modify it

and modify it to function as a rifle

yeah I you know I'm not the expert in it

I can tell you that it was modified in

essence to function like a rifle that

much I can tell you I'm sure you can

talk to experts out there that how that

gets done and to avoid any legal

prohibitions thank you guys
