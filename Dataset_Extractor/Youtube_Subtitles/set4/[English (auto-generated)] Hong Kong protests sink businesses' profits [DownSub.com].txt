a human chain stretched for dozens of

kilometres across Central Hong Kong

thousands joining their hands and their

voices this latest manifestation of

their pro-democracy movement inspired by

a similar scene exactly thirty years ago

the so-called Baltic Way protest more

than a million Estonians Latvians and

Lithuanians formed what was then the

longest human chain in history part of

their push for independence from the

Soviet Union protesters here using the

same tactic hoping for a similar result

we are here Tonetta well no Hong Kong

people are united and we step up to

fight against the communist regime but

the longer this fight drags on the

greater the casualties three months of

these protests and occasional clashes

with police have had devastating

consequences on the economy in this city

and the ripple effects have been felt

right across the ocean the protests are

having a big economic impact the former

head of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce

notes the Canadian businesses have deep

roots across many sectors of Hong Kong's

economy from finance to retail this

Canadian style restaurant has seen a

bite taken out of its business since the

demonstrations began with some customers

staying home to avoid becoming caught in

the clashes the number of tourists here

has dropped by a third well the market

has tumbled by more than a quarter

business requires a degree of certainty

to mitigate risk and this is a risky

environment but even more damaging than

the protests themselves is the resulting

geopolitical battle

Kong citizen who works for the British

Consulate claiming he'd solicited a

prostitute the Chinese foreign ministry

warned that anyone with a hidden agenda

or who's hatching a sinister plot should

expect to be arrested following his

detainment the Canadian Consulate has

now suspended business trips to China

for its local staff and they're not

alone there are a lot of people that are

cancelling their business trips to China

no-go zone I've canceled my trip that I

was supposed to take to China for

business next month it's just not worth

it some Hong Kong businesses are also

facing pressure to silence their staff

flight attendant says she was fired for

posting messages of support for the

protesters on Facebook and some Canadian

expats tell global news they've been

their jobs or worse Jeff sample global
