good morning everyone

Hurricane durian is ready to unleash its

fury on our state the storm has regained

strength it is serious and it can be

deadly the message this morning is this

get to safety and stay there don't let

your guard down

this won't be a brush by whether it

comes ashore or not the eye of the storm

will be close enough to cause extensive

damage in North Carolina conditions in

Eastern North Carolina are deteriorating

rapidly overnight durian strengthened to

a category 3 hurricane this is a

dangerous storm that is already spawning

tornadoes in our state a tornado touched

down this morning in Brunswick County

causing some damage the latest forecast

track is more dire up to 10 inches of

more or more of rain in coastal areas

and from 3 to 6 inches in central North

Carolina the new forecast projects

sustained winds of a hundred miles an

hour at our coast with gusts up to 125

storm surges will be as high as 7 feet

in short hundreds of thousands will lose

power and that has already begun

winds will topple trees and power lines

and roads and buildings will be flooded

I have activated more North Carolina

National Guard soldiers and we now have

488 on duty with additional high water

rescue vehicles as hurricane Dorian

moves northward along our coast there

will be flash flooding

I urge everyone even those inland to pay

close attention to flood watches and

warnings and

be ready to evacuate if asked to by

local officials remember it only takes a

few inches of water to cause flash

floods and to wash your vehicle off of

the road

the majority of deaths in hurricanes are

from drowning and we know that all too

well in North Carolina never drive on

flooded roads and never drive around a

barrier it's there for your protection
