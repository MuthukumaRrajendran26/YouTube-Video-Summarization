well that morning we were watching the

series come up about door we stand on a

cupboard trying to get for higher ground

a supersonic rpcvs department but a

tired of caution will carry all our

clothes

each other we get caught in our partner

it was too late together so we took

refuge in no and the closet and me and

him sat in what's my artistic Center we

watch the hurricane took our roof off

science all under him in case anything

happened you say it sounded like a

freight train going around our home

water was coming in our house I think

our house is the only one standing on

Pelican Shores

and when I came out during the I

couldn't believe my eyes that basically

all the homes around me were gone washed

through or just flattening it was but

then when

colleague what it was it was fine

I don't think anybody else will want to

go through what we went through and I'm

finished finish what we're trying to get

out of here we've been stuck at the

treasure key since we brought our boat

in last Thursday I guess a week ago for

the hurricane so we stayed in the hotel

condos there which were almost totally

destroyed except for basically the

bathrooms and the walls of the structure

the big glass sliding doors all got

blown out the front doors all got blown

out the ceilings came down so there

wasn't much left when we came back into

our units after being in the bathroom

for 18 hours overnight the hurricane has

completely devastated us I mean this is

the first time in my history I've ever

seen a cat 5 plus orchid and I've lived

in many islands and I mean its total

destruction there's only about in

tragedy there are about five and

habitable buildings

no no safety at all I've heard that

there's a lot of fog there's a lot of

looting going on I've heard that people

are being walking around with guns

breaking into people's homes but still

have homes

it's that's why we're leaving and

there's no there's no force there's

nothing going on they should have had

this all done beforehand you know this

should have had it all in place and they

did and they don't they still don't aqua

homens government I don't know I've

helped I understand that help is on the

way but there's some red tape that's

stopping the planes are getting there to

bring us supplies I mean water is a

precious commodity now I mean all

practice assignments there's no care

there are no catalysts I've given away

all of my son's clothing to people I

mean I have there's so many major

nationals here they just take it

we have Bohemians we have no help you

know as we just found out the Bahamas

here it's coming but we have to pay when

there's no easy fo islands on no money

grab so where I'm able to actually pay

to get on the plane you know if we need

assistance because there's so many

Bahamian stranded there I just I'm just

dumbfounded I can't I have never seen

anything like this in my life
