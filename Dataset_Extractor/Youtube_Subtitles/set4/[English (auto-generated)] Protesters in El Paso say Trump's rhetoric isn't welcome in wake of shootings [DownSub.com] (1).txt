well we're here because we know that

President Trump is coming and we kind of

want to show that we are united as a

city together rather than just I guess

welcoming of him and I guess we're here

today because our hearts ache for our

city and for our people first and

foremost everything that he has ever

done and said the way he has painted the

citizens of El Paso and Mexicans people

alike minority groups that has helped to

incite

what has happened here this past weekend

and it is truly enraging and truly you

know aggravating to all of us and that's

why we're here today this is not a

welcoming of Donald Trump this is a

detesting of him how much of an impact

do you think his words had on what

happened here zero I can tell you that

zero

he has no compassion you know even you

know in Daytona Ohio he referred to them

as you know the people of Toledo and

that was completely incorrect what what

does he show that shows you know such a

lack of compassion for people for us

people who are going through situations

like this and he has zero compassion do

you feel that he is to blame for the

shooting absolutely I do like I said you

know initially for the way that he's

painted my people Mexicans are the way

he's painted my Sun City because we are

a border town you know we I can tell you

you know born and raised here we radiate

vibrancy and color and culture and love

everything that he's ever said

completely wrong about us if you could

say something directly to the president

today what would it be that he's not fit

to be in the position that he's in

completely you know I don't say it's

probably as much for myself I just feel

like I need to come out and express then

we've got to stop this just type the

hate speech

got to treat each other as one and Trump

is not helping and he's hurting

in fact he's causing something so that's

why I wanted to come out just to express

my my fear

how much what's happening how much

personal responsibility do you think the

president has for what happened here I

think and this says he has a lot because

you just have to watch a little bit of

television to realize that he's how many

times he's talked about invasion of

people here in El Paso we're one

community with wadis people go back and

forth all the time

my family has roots and wadis

and laws and I just you know I think it

contributed to this shooter wanting to

come here to kill Mexicans so if you

could deliver a message directly to the

president today what would it be

stop it just stop for the moment and

just stop forever on your hate speech

and just see where that gets us

as you know obviously I want him to be

gone if he redesigned today a different

leader sure do you think at this point

the genie can be put back in the bottle

you know in other words those people

who've been in Bolden are they going to

go away obviously he has millions of

supporters people in the rallies her

behind him we're going right along with

what he's saying and cheering him on so

there's a big problem here in the United

States sir tell me why you felt it was

important to be here today

well I've I've lived the year 25 years I

don't I've retired up by Las Cruces now

but I lived here 25 years was a

schoolteacher public school teacher here

in El Paso and I stand in solidarity

with the grieving citizens of El Paso I

grieve with them for this horrible evil

that has descended upon the city

what do you make of the way President

Trump characterized this city and the

border long before the shooting happened

well I think his messages have been

pretty clear throughout and that is that

he thinks that people with brown skin

were different ethnicities other than

Anglo our second-class citizens at best

and not worthy of being here within the

borders of the United States at all and

these people here have ancestors that

were here 450 years ago they predate

Trump they predate me and this is their

community and they have as much right to

be here in the United States as anybody

so what do you make of the president's

decision to come here

today I think it was a bad mood I think

it was self-serving I don't think he's

coming here as the comforter in chief I

think he's coming here is the divider in

chief and he's insensitive to boot as

far as I'm concerned he had no business

being here tell me why it was important

to be here today

[Music]

wrong I've lived here no pastor for 37

years this is not part of our heritage

our culture here no mountain city is a

right path I'm very loving and caring

city we accept everybody there's no

reason you know you take away the

motivations for this crime alone and

just look at it strictly as another mass

shooting how do you explain the people

who are from outside El Paso and from

outside the US a situation like this so

if you could deliver a message directly

president from today what would you say

what would that message be

[Music]

your visit mostly divisive for our

country please not don't stable
