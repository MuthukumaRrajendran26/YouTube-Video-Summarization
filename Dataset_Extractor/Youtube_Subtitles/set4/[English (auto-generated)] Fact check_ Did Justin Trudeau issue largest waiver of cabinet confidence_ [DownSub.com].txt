political foes always look for

weaknesses in their opponents and often

stretch the truth in their attacks and

their own defense we've watched that

happen over the SNC affair the issue

plaguing Liberal leader Justin Trudeau

The Globe and Mail broke a story this

week that the RCMP has been stymied as

they look into potential obstruction of

justice because the federal government

refuses to lift cabinet confidentiality

for all witnesses when Trudeau was asked

why it wasn't more fully lifted this is

what he said we gave out the largest and

most expansive waiver of cabinet

confidence in Canada's history it's a

pretty definitive statement we wanted to

check it out our chief political

correspondent David akin has been

looking back in history David what did

you discover

well the Prime Minister appears to be

misinformed on this Donna what he said

simply does not match the facts Trudeau

has granted only a limited waiver of

cabinet confidentiality he's refused

RCMP attempts to get access to

information protected by cabinet

confidentiality by comparison former

conservative Prime Minister Stephen

Harper

he gave the RCMP wood it needed to

investigate the duffy expense affair

liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin

granted request from the gamma e

Commission for mountains of cabinet

confidences related to the Liberal

sponsorship scandal you swear to tell

the truth and when the Oliphant

Commission was investigating former

Progressive Conservative Prime Minister

Brian Mulroney over the Airbus affair it

was Mulrooney himself that granted the

release of cabinet confidences from his

time in office even though

Mulrooney was the target of the

Commission's investigation and that last

case is the closest analogy to Trudeau

right now the RCMP want to look at

Trudeau's behavior and only Trudeau

can't release that info but so far he

has not done so well David Trudeau has

said the decision to waive cabinet

confidentiality is made by the clerk of

the Privy Council the country's most

senior civil servant is that true not

really

the verdict is unanimous among law

professors we contacted today prime

ministers and premiers for that matter

have the absolute authority to waive

cabinet confidentiality and are often

encouraged to do so precisely for

matters of public interest

or when investigating authorities like

the RCMP are trying to determine if a

public official like a prime minister

committed a crime

former Saskatchewan Premier Brad wall

did just that when his government couple

of years ago brought in the Auditor

General to look at how his government

handled a controversial land deal in

Regina when there are moments like that

in our case and when there are moments

like this now federally where there are

real concerns about even the legality of

what the prime minister his offices may

have done never mind the propriety it's

essential that cabinet confidentiality

be waived and there's plenty of

precedent bottom line here Donna Trudeau

has the power that many of his

predecessors have used to waive cabinet

confidentiality but again so far he has

decided not to use that power
