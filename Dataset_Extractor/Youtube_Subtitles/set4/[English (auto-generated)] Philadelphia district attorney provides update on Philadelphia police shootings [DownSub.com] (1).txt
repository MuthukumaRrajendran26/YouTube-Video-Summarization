hey Lori Mensa good morning thank you

all for being here obviously it is a

busy day after a extremely busy crisis

and tragedy in the city of Philadelphia

that thankfully and miraculously ended

with no loss of life and serious but as

far as we know at this time not

debilitating injuries to our law

enforcement officers after 4:30 and all

the way up to about one o'clock in the

morning yesterday in essence I'm here to

answer questions there are some that I

cannot answer and will not answer that I

think are better answered for example by

the police commissioner and others that

may bear on the integrity of an

investigation or may simply be things I

don't know but I do want to start with

this I want to make sure that everyone

knows what Maurice Hill we are talking

about because there are five if I

counted correctly five different Maurice

Hills who appear with different birth

dates in the Philadelphia and

Pennsylvania criminal records database

the individual who was involved in the

shooting yesterday is a more East Hill

with the date of birth of April the 26th

1983 that record is publicly available

at least all the portions that are not

sealed by statute and that record shows

a criminal record as an adult going back

to the early 2000s and extending up to a

few years ago

the most recent case that I'm seeing as

I flipped through it's approximately 12

pages is a conviction for 2012 to the

best of our knowledge the reporting that

there were there was a federal

conviction of mr. Maurice Hill and that

he did federal time is also correct that

there was federal supervision at least

up up until about 2016 to the best of

our knowledge that is also correct and

we are gathering that information now

having said that because there are some

people both last night and today in the

media who have either been misled or

have been confused about what Maurice

Hill we're talking about that having

been said are there any questions as

best I can tell the answer is absolutely

not

as best I can tell there has been no new

criminal matter in the city and counts

it County of Philadelphia in 2018-2019

and I believe not even something

originating in 2017 which would be the

year before we were in office I cannot I

cannot tell you at this time whether

there may have been an occasion when

there was a violation hearing during

this administration in relation to those

many many many convictions that happened

during the administration of Lynne

Abraham or the administration of Seth

Williams and this is in fact a 12-page

extract of criminal matters that were

handled by those administrations I can't

I can't say that but I can say that if

there's any contact at all it would not

have been on an open criminal matter

without I think it's clear this man

should not have been on the streets in

the sense that he obviously was a

tremendous danger to the public and to

law enforcement but if you're asking me

do I believe that everybody in the

system going back to 2007 and up until

the present has a crystal ball I do not

I mean we could for example ask the head

of the FOP who's been in office since

2007 what efforts he saw and whether he

had a crystal ball about this we could

also ask various commissioners many of

whom I deeply admire whether they ate a

crystal ball so I you know I don't think

it's fair to expect some level of

perfect knowledge on the part of police

or prosecutors but it is obvious looking

at the actions taken here that this was

someone who needed to be off the streets

and it also it is also clear that he had

a very lengthy criminal record going

back quite some time the charges have

not been brought yet this investigation

is ongoing I cannot tell you every

single charge but I can certainly tell

you some obvious ones it is pretty

obvious that there should be charges of

attempted murder it's pretty obvious

there should be charges of aggravated

assault in the first degree

pretty obvious that there are some

serious firearms charges including the

fact that he was a felon before he was

handling this weapon there are there is

drug involvement here and depending on

how this investigation develops it is

very likely that there may be some drug

charges as well there certainly are

other possibilities such as conspiracy

possibly even a conspiracy that

encompasses more days than this one

particular day involving drug activity

but an awful lot of these details are

not available to us now many of them may

not even be available to police yet and

there has been some collaboration and

coordination between both federal and

state authorities so there may be

additional sources of information as

well I am saying more than we usually

say because I understand the public

wants to know more and rightly so but I

would say there will be a lot of charges

these are more than enough charges

so that mr. Maurice Hill may never exit

jail

I don't specifically know about that yet

we are starting to dig into the

specifics of his case I mean I could

refer to this extract to try to locate

the one that you're talking about but in

terms of having the original file having

reviewed it I've done I can and I would

say this is also available to the public

at the UJS portal but you know we see a

lot of different types of charges we see

burglary charges escape charges we see

peculiar charges like illegally taunting

a police animal we see resisting arrest

we see multiple charges for aggravated

assault for drugs for DUI for reckless

endangerment of another person traffic

related activity and driving related

activity we see gun charges of a variety

of different types there is even a

conviction on perjury there there are

charges relating to drugs in connection

with guns so it is quite an extensive

criminal record there's a robbery charge

in here and I'm not saying every one of

these resulted in a conviction but there

certainly has been a lengthy and

extensive criminal record that includes

many convictions in the state system and

it there is also a record in the federal

system I have not seen it but I have

been advised that the record in the

federal system includes a lengthy prison

sentence in federal prison for weapons

there are several I don't honestly I

don't want to give you all the specifics

there's been some reporting around it we

can get you the answer but I haven't

bothered to itemize that I could go

through it with you here if you want

well I think what it says is that the

system had multiple contacts with this

man and the system following its

policies and its philosophy at those

times did things that obviously did not

stop this incident I think it says that

I think it also is an illustration of

what should be obvious because it's

obvious to us in medicine it should be

obvious in law that what a lot of us do

in law enforcement is risk management

and that there will be like it or not

occasions when there are bad results and

the real measure of the police for

example or you know others I don't even

want to call people out but the real

measure of all of us in law enforcement

is not whether or not there's a bad

outcome there will be bad outcomes the

the measure is do you manage it better

than other people manage it

[Music]

so there was a time when I was on the

phone let me explain how that occurred

and I don't believe it has an effect on

this case but it's certainly something

we will have to look at when we have

more information

mr. Maurice Hill the one whose birth

date is April the 26th of 1983

apparently was represented by Shaka

Johnson who is a known a Philadelphia

County criminal defense attorney has

been around for some time I was informed

by mr. Johnson that Johnson had

represented Hill in the past I receive a

call on my cell phone it was probably

about nine o'clock p.m. 901 902 and

returned it pretty quickly due to mr.

Johnson

partly because I almost never get a call

from mr. Johnson I don't think I've had

one two years and partly because things

were in such a state that I immediately

realized it was possible a defense

attorney wanted to reach me for a reason

having to do with the developing

situation mr. Johnson speaks to me he

tells me that the shooter his name

Maurice Hill that the shooter has been

calling him he's been on the phone with

the shooter that mr. Johnson indicated

he was trying to bring about a peaceful

resolution he I think like every one of

us didn't want to see anyone else shot

at didn't want to see anyone else

injured in the course of this horrific

event and then he he is he spoke to

Maurice Hill on the phone and asked mr.

Hill if he wanted to talk to me mr. Hill

was expressing concerns that he might be

killed if he came out concerns about

what was going to happen to him when he

came out including in the future in

terms of any possible case and mr.

Johnson patched me in and then we both

spoke to Maurice Hill who at that time

in my opinion was it wasn't a very

animated excited frankly dangerous state

I mean obviously was dangerous but

emotionally he seemed to be on the one

hand reaching out to someone to try to

end the situation without being killed

and also in a way that he would somehow

fine

septa but on the other hand he seemed to

be a man who probably at the other end

was holding a gun who as far as I knew

still had hostages in the building and

needed to be brought to a calmer place

so I did what I could I am no hostage

negotiator I have no such training

neither is mr. Johnson nor does he but

we were doing what we could to try to

lower the volume to bring more calm

about to get him to a more rational

position now mr. Johnson had a number of

contacts that evening not only with mr.

Hill but also with the police

commissioner there were a number of

contacts I'm not going to go through all

the details but they did come a point

where I was at this district attorney's

office late in the evening and I was on

a four-way call with the police

commissioner with mr. Johnson with

Maurice Hill and myself and we were

continuing various other efforts in

different ways but with the same goal

which was to bring about a peaceful

resolution so there would not be another

officer having to go at a man who might

shoot at them or hurt them or kill them

we had the miraculous moment of having

all these officers shot many of whom I

had visited none of whom were facing a

life-threatening injury thank God and

the last thing we wanted was to come out

of this with officers going in to take

him you know someone who had fired off

over a hundred rounds and have them

fired upon or haven't forbid killed or

injured so the conversation continued

and then eventually later in the evening

mr. Johnson contacted me and indicated

that he believed he could get Maurice

Hill to come out but that Maurice Hill

wanted to in some fashion see him and

see me out on the street in mr.

Johnson's opinion that meant Maurice

Hill was more likely more likely to put

down the gun empty his hands drop the

cell phone and come out in a way that

would be safest for law enforcement

safest for the neighborhood

and also potentially would mean that mr.

Hill would be apprehended right so I

went there mr. Johnson was there that

was done with the understanding of the

police commissioner

police commissioner once again who I

think did a tremendous job and I think

the police department did an amazing job

with the entire incident kept us off the

block but we were nearby and mr. Johnson

was on the phone on speaker with Maurice

Hill as he exited that property and as

he turned himself in without there being

any further gunfire I want you to

understand something though

I don't take credit for any of that and

I don't think mr. Johnson does either we

believe that the people who saw this

from beginning to end are in the police

department and maybe some of their

federal colleagues who came down and

provided assistance they are the ones

who deserve the credit I want none of it

I am well aware and the Commissioner

spoke to us after the surrender I'm well

aware that tear gas was used to bring

mr. Hill out of out of that home and I

tend to agree with the Commissioner that

it was despite good intentions it wasn't

anything that I did it wasn't anything

that mr. Johnson did that saw this it

was eventually it was first of all the

the incredible extraction of the

hostages and secondarily it was an awful

lot of efforts by the police

commissioner which I was not in on in

terms of communicating with mr. Hill and

then it was ultimately the timely

careful use of teargas

that I think brought mr. Hill out safely

present policies your contentious

relationship with some police how so no

one asked me to leave the hospital in

fact I was specifically told at both

hospitals that I would have the

opportunity to speak to the officers at

Einstein I spoke to I think every single

officer except one who was tied up with

his family I went to Temple twice but it

was a busy night and it was a busy night

including being at the scene being at

both hospitals being on phone calls

coming to the office trying to see what

we could do by hook or by crook to try

to get mr. Hill in custody without any

further danger to police officers or the

community so as much as I would have

liked it I didn't have a chance to visit

with the officers at the temple that

evening I hope will be at Temple that

evening I hope we'll be able to do it I

don't know who told you that report but

you know III apologize when people tell

you things that are untrue there were

multiple people who in one way or

another were being held the officers

have been described at times as having

been hostages hostages in a sense I mean

it's more complicated than that and

there were other individuals in there I

am NOT going to make any further

comments on that though I do not want to

interfere with the police department and

the and they're putting together the

investigative paperwork

that's me uh excuse me why you didn't

raise the position of the head of the

Fraternal Order of Police at the top of

do you think that you've stated the

inaccurate information in an attempt to

continue to undercut you I'll leave that

to you to decide once you once you see

what its various comments are and how

carefully he identifies Maurice Hill

there any other questions let me do this

we have two different questions I'll

come to your second please

did I know mr. Hill in advance no I'd

never heard of him and your and your

question you know I don't think so but I

do not you know this has been a very

fluid situation we certainly are going

to examine that seriously and carefully

if it raises any potential issue just as

you know mr. Johnson's conversing with

with whom they raise any issue in terms

of whether he's gonna represent this man

or not I don't know if he will we'll

look at that and we'll do whatever is

the law requires let me go here first if

I may have already had someone for you

but I will come back yes sir

I did speak with a lot of police and I

also was with the police commissioner

when he gave his first address to the

press at temple hospital so the answer

is no and I'm not sure what you mean by

initiative because what happens is I

picked up a phone call from Shaka

Johnson who within about two minutes

three wade in Maurice Hill it was not an

option I frankly don't know why anyone

in that situation will want me to drop

everything and hang up we were having an

opportunity to calm down a very agitated

person who had a gun and had hostages in

the facility it you know ideally I guess

in a perfect world if you could have

read the future and known this call was

coming I would have liked to do that but

there was no way to do that I don't

think anything I said is that important

I think that what was important is that

we were able to calm him down we were

able to slow down the process a little

bit and that meant that we could get out

of the way and that let the police do

the frankly brilliant things that they

did I don't know exactly when they

extracted hostages police from the

building but you know if I if my timing

is correct on how it was reported it was

close to the time when we were on the

phone someone who has a hot gun in his

hand and an incredibly dangerous one and

is in an agitated state that is someone

you want to slow down and if that gave

in anyway the opportunity to the to the

police to do the best job they could

that's I mean I think that is the only

effect but I want to say once again I

don't take any credit for this none I

truly believe this was just brilliant

policing and maybe a little bit of a

miracle

where I would run your office I'm sorry

in your view about took better run

District Attorney's Office better

managing for us how might the system

well again I think I will try to answer

your question but I also don't want to

be unfair and pretend that those prior

prosecutors those prior police officers

probation officers federal agents I

don't or the federal judges I don't want

to pretend that they had some crystal

ball and they can see the future I do

think what this record indicates is a

long series of serious criminal acts

they did not all make their way to a

conviction and obviously when you have a

serious case where a person is guilty

ideally prosecutors are going to be able

to rely on good investigations and

they'll be able to obtain convictions so

I think that for example our

administration's disinterest in

prosecuting minor offenses let's just

say like possession of marijuana and

it's much greater interest than going

after more serious offenses is more of a

focused approach to serious crime if you

look back at the time period when this

occurred you will see that in some of

these time periods there were there were

70,000 cases processed by the

Philadelphia District Attorney's Office

that number has come down over the years

but now it's closer to 40,000 cases well

there's a reason for that because we

would rather spend our time on people

who shoot guns and big-time drug dealers

and rapists then spend our time

prosecuting 6000 marijuana possession

cases which is what they used to do in

Philadelphia County I do think that

there are issues of focus here I say

that to you as I come back from a very

constructive meeting with the presiding

judge over criminal with the public

defender with various other stakeholders

where we are continuing and

ongoing discussion about how more

effectively and how better to deal with

shooting cases that has been underway

for quite some time we've already made

some success in the Municipal Court and

are proceeding essentially now with what

we think is a better way to prosecute at

the preliminary hearing level but we're

trying to do the same at the level of

the Court of Common Pleas which is the

trial level so you know that's the kind

of thing that becomes possible when

you're not wasting the system's time on

6000 marijuana possession cases and you

can try to reallocate resources put more

lawyers on these cases we are trying to

move and I believe we will successfully

move to what is essentially vertical

prosecution meaning a prosecutor that

has a shooting case where someone is

injured from beginning to end instead of

handing it from prosecutor to prosecutor

which is which has historically often

been done we're trying to get there we

were trying to get there long before

this incident happened our meeting today

was scheduled over a week before this

happened I think that's where we need to

go to a more focused approach that goes

at series crime in a serious way but

that is able to do it because we're not

wasting time locking up people for

things like marijuana possession I did

promise you know

open cases in Philadelphia County I am

not aware of any unresolved open

criminal matter in Philadelphia County

now having said that I do have some

information that would indicate that

there is a warrant for probation

supervision and that there actually was

a date scheduled by the judge who see

the probation of parole but there is a

date scheduled perhaps next week for a

hearing on that matter I'm aware of that

but you asked me about open criminal

matters there are to my knowledge there

are zero

open criminal matters in Philadelphia

County and there haven't been any open

criminal matters in Philadelphia County

since at least 2016 yes

yes

what I am aware of is that there is a

warrant or warrants out there the

specifics about something happening

yesterday I cannot I don't have that

information no I don't have that

information that's the first I'm hearing

of it but I'm not not surprised you know

we really don't have enough information

to evaluate that there are many good

reasons why events can occur in one

location that create an exigent

circumstance as they say in the law that

would require officers to go into

another location but I cannot say one

way or the other what the evidence is

going to show it would be very premature

for me to comment further on that I

think it's very premature for me to

comment on that concern because I don't

know what the right house means desert

if the right house national news means

national people want the facts that mean

okay I'm sorry the international people

are also entitled to the truth and to

the facts and it would be inappropriate

of me to guess at what the truth and the

facts are

this was a drug-related warrant there

was a search warrant yes I'm not gonna

get into all specifics no that's that's

not correct you know the way this goes

is there's not a case until there are

charges there are investigations there

are arrests but there's not a case until

their charges so I guess if if you

questions sir and I'm not trying to be

you know picky with you but if your

question sir is was it related to a

state investigation the answer is yes so

it's relates as a station I would

respectfully respectfully suggest that

you'll probably get more information

from the police there are a lot of

things going on in an investigative way

right now I think it's inappropriate for

me to step on the police by talking

about what they may be doing even though

I'm aware of some of it I think you may

be able to get more answers from the

police commissioner but only if he feels

it is appropriate from an investigative

perspective I don't see any way that the

process leading up to charging is going

to take more than a couple days but one

never knows it's complicated situation

there was gas that was put into that

location you know gas can affect

people's health there's a lot of other

things going on that may or may not be

happening while this person is in

custody so I I'm not gonna mislead you I

don't have definite answers out there

than if you look at these kinds of cases

in general there are charges within a

couple days

I really will not answer that question

at this time yes sir I mean let me let

me put it this way is it what I was

hoping for it no it wasn't what I was

hoping for I don't think the police

commissioner was hoping to speak to this

individual either I mean there are

certain rules of engagement that are

ordinary doesn't mean they're always

right let's face it in some ways the

outcome here was pretty good because

this man turned himself in but I

generally speaking you know hostage

negotiators don't try to put you on the

phone with the boss and yet the police

commissioner spoke to this individual

and tried to speak to him for hours I

don't begrudge him that you know we all

react to the situation we have I did not

pick up a phone that said to me shooter

I didn't even know the name or ISA I

picked up a phone that said Shaka

Johnson the next thing I knew we were in

a threeway that's the reality so you

know we do the best we can I'm not

making any claim that what I did or did

not do is perfect but I am making this

claim it's not what I did or did not do

in no way is important compared to the

amazing work that was done by

Philadelphia police and also some of

their federal collaborators yes

is it fair to say that the criminal

justice system in this instance

I think it's fair to say that the

criminal justice system imperfect as it

is did not stop this terrible incident

alright thank you very much
