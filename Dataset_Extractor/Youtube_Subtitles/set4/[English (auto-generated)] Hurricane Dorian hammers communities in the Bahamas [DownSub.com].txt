and from this angle which is directly

all right our house is on a cul-de-sac

so water is all around us but this is

the direct canal that's right behind us

and you can see the waves are just

raging as if we're at sea visibility is

very low and the waves are just like on

the ocean now I'm on the other side of

the house our garage door has already

come off and it's floating in this very

high water this is very deep water which

would be about eight feet right now and

I'm heading over to the other window

we just pray that we can come out of

this once we come out of it with our

lives we're happy

[Music]

[Music]

come ask can you get me go man go man

[Music]

the Chuck Chuck I'm sending the feed box

[Music]

the bus gone alright we need to focus on

Annalise and Malachi

[Music]

I'm gonna drop my shoe we need help

everything now everything down

come on move off my house I just took a

light tank off life

this is no provenance
