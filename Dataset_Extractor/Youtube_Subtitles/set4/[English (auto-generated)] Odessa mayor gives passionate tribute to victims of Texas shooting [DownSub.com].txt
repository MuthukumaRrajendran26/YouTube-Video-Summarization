good evening before I get to the details

of yesterday I'd like to say a few

thank-yous yesterday I was in Fort Worth

with my son getting ready to go to the

TCU football game when I received a

phone call from one of my very best

friends and said you got a call home now

I reached out to the city officials and

they told me short very short sentence

it's bad so I left Fort Worth as quick

as I could

driving above the speed limit to get

here to see what was going on in our

city on the way I received a phone call

from the White House saying that they

are standing with the Permian Basin

received phone calls from the state

officials say they are standing with the

Permian Basin received phone calls from

numerous mayor's saying that they are

praying and lifting us up as I speak

fact I received one email from a mayor

in Florida who was preparing his own

City for a hurricane but yet he took

time to call and say we're with you

you know their support the University of

Texas the Permian Basin has been

absolutely fantastic we have an ELC

which is Emergency Operations Center due

to the amount of law enforcement that is

currently in Odessa in Midland we could

not use that facility we have over 120

FBI agents ATF Texas game wardens Texas

Rangers etc here to make sure you feel

safe

yesterday was a horrible day that shook

us for a very foundation but this will

not break us in West Texas you have to

be tough our weather is tough the old

economy is with its ups and downs we've

been through a lot and we will get

through this just want to say a little

bit about our first responders our first

responders did an absolutely amazing job

our first responders had trained for

something like this active shooter

training is something that we have

stressed but nothing could have prepared

us for a movie

active shooter tragedy that happened

they're professional and professionalism

their heart their sacrifices did not go

unnoticed by your citizens and as the

mayor and I serve with an amazing City

Council you're our heroes and we could

not be more proud of you

one of the first calls I made was to a

very good friend mayor Morales for

Midland to let him know what was going

on in our city he started to find out

the details at one point I was told that

this person was leaving the city of

Odessa and was headed to Midland so I

called mayor Morales and said he's

headed your way get ready

mayor Morales at that point said mayor

you're welcome to anything we've got

three months ago there was a tragedy in

Midland when they lost an officer the

city of Odessa stood side-by-side with

our neighbors to the east our fire

engines were in their stations so that

all their first responders could go to

the funerals our police units were

serving in Midland to make sure all of

them could go to the funeral for the

officer and we have been offered the

exact same thing in a world where

everything is so divided it is so

comforting to have the support of a

sister city who will do whatever it

takes to make sure you are safe

I want to make a few thanks with our

sister city and our guys Odessa police

department chief Peggy your leadership

has been outstanding

I know this is something that none of us

wish for but I can't imagine having a

better person in that position

chief Alvarez sheriff Griffith thank you

for being here thank you for your

sacrifice thank you for everything you

did yesterday at one point we ran out of

ambulances and most of the equipment was

out due to the fact that we had 15 crime

scenes we had officers put people in

their tacos and take them to the

hospital we had citizens step up and

take people to the hospital but we also

had our friends from the East Midlands

Police Chief Herman Midland Firebird

chief chief in Midland Sheriff thank you

for your support here thank you for all

of everything you've helped us with the

reason that person was stopped was

because of a Midland police officer and

an Odessa police officer they rammed his

car stopped him and when he got out they

shined it and I think

yesterday began like many Saturdays in

Odessa with the excitement of children

ready to enjoy a few days out of school

and parents excited to spend time with

her families unfortunately that

cherished time was cut short by the

sound of gunfire at that time we saw the

very worst of humanity but we also saw

some of the very best of humanity we saw

first responders running towards the

danger we saw our citizens running to

help someone they didn't even know I

have heard countless stories of how

citizens of Odessa went out of their way

and put themselves in danger to help

their fellow man many times not even

known the person's name we had doctors

and nurses they weren't called to the

hospitals they went to the hospitals

they went just to serve citizens

protecting other citizens make bringing

food to the first responder service

responders the city citizens donating

blood because at a time like that blood

is a valuable and most important

citizens doing the thing that makes the

most difference it sprang after the

gunfire stopped we were saddened to

learn dat 22 of our citizens were

injured in this tragedy including three

officers one officer with Odessa Police

Department one with Midland PD and also

a trooper from the DPS I have visited

the two officers one from Odessa and one

from Midland the Odessa officer is in

fairly good shape the middle an officer

is a little bit more critical he is

stable but he was headed for another

surgery today the trooper is doing well

he is at Midland Memorial and so we

would covet your prayers for their fast

healing along with the other 22 that

were sorry the other 19 that Ranger

the ones that our Medical Center

Hospital one is in critical condition to

in serious condition eight and fair

condition we have some at ORMC I want to

say just a brief word about our

hospitals all three hospitals Medical

Center Hospital Odessa regional and

mitla Memorial all step in made a huge

we like to express our deepest thanks

for the professionalism and the

compassion is shown by the doctors

nurses and staff and administration

there has been a Family Assistance

Center that will be available starting

September 2nd from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. for

families of victims anyone present at

the crime and may not have been injured

but was traumatized this will be not

available to the general public but we

are anticipating that this Family

Assistance Center will be available for

a few days to help anyone that is having

trouble coping with this in this tragedy

we also lost seven of our beloved

citizens you know ranging from ages 415

which was a young lady from Odessa High

School so please pray for our schools is

the kids from OHS go back and have to

learn that one of their friends was

killed at senseless violence a time like

this I turn to the Bible for guidance

and wisdom and in the 23rd Psalms and

says even though I walk through the

valley of the shadow of death I will

fear no evil

are you with what you are with me your

rod and staff our staff and they comfort

me at this time we need the face based

community more than we've ever needed

them I would like to thank the

ministerial Alliance for putting their

putting this vigil together for all of

the work Thank You TPB for allowing this

to be here moving forward is gonna be

difficult

as west texans we are strong and

independent and known for our freedom in

us and our whatever it takes spirit the

next few days and weeks are going to be

difficult but with the strength and the

whatever it takes spirits will show this

community our state and our nation what

it means to be West Texas

we will make it through this horrible

tragedy in the next few days many

questions are gonna be asked but some

questions just have no answers like why

is evil allowed in this world I wished I

had the answer I wish to have the wisdom

to give you the answer but all is left

for we the living to do is to honor them

to take care of them and to rededicate

ourselves to cherish the freedoms that

our citizens were enjoying when they

gave that last full measure of devotion

to our fallen citizens may the wind

always be at your back may the Sun Shine

warm your face the rains fall soft upon

your fields and until we get again may

God hold you in the palm of his hand the

citizens of Odessa Midland and the

Permian Basin we will get through this

tragedy by moving forward one day at a

time

one week at a time one month at a time

in one year at a time we will show our

beloved state and nation what it means

to be Permian Basin strong may God bless

them Nestle my god bless Midland and God

bless Texas and may God bless the United

States

[Applause]
