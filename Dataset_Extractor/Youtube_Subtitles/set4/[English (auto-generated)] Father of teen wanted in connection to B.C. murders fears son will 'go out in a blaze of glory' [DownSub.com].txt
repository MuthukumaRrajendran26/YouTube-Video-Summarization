they hung out all the time

Brier never had cam stay at his mom's

house or his grandmother's it was always

at cams place or they had a few other

close friends and and and they'd have

their camp outs and all that I don't

know much I just I don't want no fin

cams cams family okay I know they're

hurting as much as I am I know they're

very confused all I can say is my son

did not have any real guns my son did

not have a vehicle my son does not know

how to drive

he was very introverted and and he was

very heavy into video games when he came

to work for me for the summer right I

didn't pay him I just had a very

expensive custom-made computer for him

which he was quite content with you know

he wasn't into the ones where you know

you have your machine gun and go

shooting people it was more into

strategy where you move your troops here

and there so it's influence that haven't

been good his influence has been YouTube

and video games they've never got in

trouble with the law they never got into

fights you know they're just hanging out

and having a good time

they weren't scrappers they weren't

cursors you know they didn't go play

Minister man like macho know they were

just everyday regular kids but both of

them have to have a lot of pain inside

both of them they had told me that the

Walmart jobs just weren't cutting it

they were gonna go to Alberta and make

some proper money

I believe that's what they were gonna do

and I was absolutely flabbergasted to

learn that two days later and I found

this out from the paper that they were

up in the Yukon initially it looked like

they were victims as well right

initially and and it's really tough for

me to see in the paper today photos of

them alive and well in Saskatchewan so I

know they're not lost in the woods

that's such stuff that's incredibly hard

to deal with the normal child doesn't

travel across the country killing people

child in some very serious pain dice

Mounties are gonna shoot first and ask

Bisons played later basically he's going

to be dead today or tomorrow he I knew

that I was sitting

this inspired unliving I'm so sorry all

this had to happen I'm so sorry that I

couldn't budge to you
