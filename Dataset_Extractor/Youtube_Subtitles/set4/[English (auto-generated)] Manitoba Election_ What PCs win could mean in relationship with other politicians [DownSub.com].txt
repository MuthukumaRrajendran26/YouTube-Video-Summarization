and I want to pick up on something Greg

Macklin he was using the whole Blue

Bomber analogy so I want to take you

from the field to the sandbox and the

premier who will remain premier is not

notably that's a play well with others

there's been a difficult relationship

between Broadway and Main Street and

also between Broadway and Ottawa that's

right do we expect that to change I'm

not thinking it's going to and one of

the things that's going on too is a

dynamic of we have Kenny

we have Moe and we have Ford there's a

lovely dynamic that's going on across

the prairies and into Ontario

conservatives solid solidarity as it

were that's going to work perfectly if

the Liberals are reelected in Ottawa and

if the shear goes in we're going to have

all sorts of interesting things happen

as well in terms of policy and

conservative policy I think you're going

to see a better relationship between

Broadway and Main Street as Julie put it

I think with this incredibly impressive

victory tonight I think premier

Pallister is gonna kick back to relax a

little bit and I hope he does and I'm

not saying it's his fault I'm not saying

it's Brian Bowman's fault but come on

but no Roman sports it's come on guys

let's put all that aside and get things

done for Winnipeggers you told me that's

makes me crazy so let's just let's just

admit the fact that the majority of

Manitobans live in Winnipeg right right

so we have two levels of government

representing us here and the fact is is

that they must play well with others

they have to get along because there is

only one voter there is only one tax

payer and we expect nothing less from

our premier people at Main Street

figured that one out the first meeting

that they had in a couple of years was

just before the election called that's

right so I don't know who you believe

because you say Brian Bowman will say

listen Brian Bowman will say the premier

won't meet with me and the premier will

say something else and just like whether

or not health care spending is up or

down or if there's cuts or no cuts they

need a couple's we don't really that's

what they need they did

maybe you have one that you're very for

my boy I can set them up
