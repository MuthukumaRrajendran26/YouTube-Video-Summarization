well hurricane durian has left North

Carolina and now the cleanup begins

we have about 45,000 people who are

still without power most of those people

are here in dare and in Hyde County

today I traveled to visit some people

who had storm damage I went to Emerald

Isle to the RV park that was hit by the

tornado there were significant damages

damage to many homes there we talked to

a number of people who live there and a

lot of volunteers who came to help it

was amazing that no one was hurt or

killed at this RV park I talked to a man

named Bill who was drinking a cup of

coffee when the tornado hit and he

showed me where he hit on the floor and

there were boards in beams all around

and I don't know how he survived but he

got by with a few scratches

we went later to Ocracoke Island and

talked to a number of survivors there

again we don't think there were any

serious injuries or deaths on Ocracoke

we do have a search and rescue team

that's going door-to-door to make sure

but this is a very close-knit community

and people assure me that everyone is

present and accounted for they also have

many homes that in people's memory they

haven't seen it that bad before I talked

to a man who had a home that his parents

grew up in and that he lived in that was

built in the 1870s and it had never been

flooded as bad as it was there the

collective thoughts though from people

are that they're pulling together and

getting getting through this I'm sad to

report that we have had one additional

death related to the storm

a man from Pamlico County 67 years old

died yesterday

as a result of falling off a ladder in

preparation for the storm this raises

the number of fatalities for hurricane

durian to to officially we're sad and

our our thoughts and prayers are with

the families of these men who did die

during the storm but as I have talked to

people across the state talking to

people who have been hit people who are

volunteers who are helping to local

officials the collective thought of

people is that overall this could have

been much worse for our state the people

who did get flooded and who did get

significant wind damage this is a bad

situation for them but in North Carolina

we're going to pull together and we're

going to work to begin clean up and try

to get back to normal

as soon as possible I want to thank all

of the first responders particularly

people who went over to Oakland and who

helped out early in that process people

who went when winds were still pretty

high and were able to get someone

medevacked out of their Ocracoke who had

an illness that was not related to the

storm a lot of our volunteers are there

serve beginning to serve hot meals on

Ocracoke Island right now they've gotten

the water sister back system back up

running but they still are working to

try to get power restored and they they

don't expect that to happen for several

days we have an emergency response team

there we're very proud of our men and

women of the National Guard who have

worked very hard during the storm and

are there still on Ocracoke Island

helping people to recover providing food

water shelter and I think the people of

North Carolina feel determined to make

sure we not only recover from this storm

but that we continue recovering from

Hurricane Florence I'm with a number of

officials here I'd first like to

recognize general Jim Ernst of the North

Carolina National Guard to say a few

words about the work of the guard we

came in on a National Guard helicopter

from Ocracoke Island just a few minutes

ago so general Ernst I'll recognize you

Thank You governor my name is Jim arts

I'm deputy age in general for North

Carolina

they say the strength of the nation is

the army the strength of the army is a

soldier and the strength of the soldier

is the family I tell you that to say

that we as National Guardsmen we draw

our strength from the community it's

been great for us to assist our

community in the recovery efforts of

hurricane we had 525 soldiers had been

mobilized for this hurricane and we have

we flew dozens of sorties to okokok

Island over the last couple of days it's

been an honor to be part of the team

that has assisted the community Thank

You governor

Thank You general we're grateful for the

men and women who come out of their

ordinary lives to serve our state we

also have with me who travel with me

just to survey damage today the North

Carolina Speaker of the House Tim Moore

who's here

speaker more you want to say a word just

be brief I just really want to also give

a shout out to the first responders who

are doing so much the governor and I've

had a chance to see firsthand what's

happening and everyone can rest assured

the commitment will be there from the

legislature to make sure the resources

are there to help but we're just really

fortunate that it wasn't worse than it

was

we also have Libby Turner here who is

our federal coordinating officer from

FEMA we're now out assessing damages

putting together information to see if

there is a request for a federal

disaster declaration and we're getting

all that information together right now

so we'll take questions from you guys

you know I think probably so but we're

trying to get all of the information in

regarding damages there there is some

concentrated areas where there is

significant damage and we know certainly

with public assistance we've got public

infrastructure of this damage we flew in

looking at highway 12 and there numerous

places where highway 12 has significant

problems I still say that people at

Ocracoke even though they many of them

have lived there a long time and their

families had lived there there was

somewhat a state of shock from the

significant storm surge that they saw

coming in the man whose house I visited

that had been built I think in 1870 the

water had never been like that before he

was telling me and there were a few

people who didn't get water in their

homes but most of them did I think

there's also a great sense of relief

that nobody was injured or killed on

Ocracoke and people are pulling together

to help each other just as you figure

North Carolinians would and particularly

those on Ocracoke

we know how beautiful a place that can

be and how it can become a part of your

soul so talking to a person who has

lived in a home for 35 years and who

told me I've lost everything that's

that's tough but then he said I'm so

glad that that I'm alive because many of

them were out there and had thought that

the storm was over that the I had passed

over and then the storm surge came

mostly from the sound side very quickly

came upon them

very quickly someone related to me that

his house was elevated and that he

stepped off and that the water came up

almost to his neck so we knew no the

water was very deep there there's got

any more information you think I need to

give here all right thank you guys very

much we appreciate it
