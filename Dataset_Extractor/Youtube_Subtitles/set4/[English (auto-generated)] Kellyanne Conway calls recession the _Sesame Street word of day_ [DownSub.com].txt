in front because it's nice to see the

media finally cover the Trump economy

you seem to cover it only when you can

use the Sesame Street word of the day

recession and so you're using a tweet

here or a report there or an economists

words here and there the fact is the

fundamentals of our economy are very

strong and you know it there we have

more people working in this country

right now than ever before in the

nation's history we have more people

coming off the sidelines going back to

work

we have people who don't just have job

availability but now they have job

security in fact they have job mobility

they can go and try to compete for one

of the other seven million-plus jobs

that are available apart for the one

they may already have or the part-time

one they may have or one that doesn't

have sufficient benefits or is too far

from home for them so that they've got

all these choices it's called freedom

and free market contrast that to

Medicare for all in green new deals and

taxes for everyone else and free

healthcare for illegal immigrants that

would tank our economy and everybody

knows that so the fundamentals of strong

I would also say that consumer

confidence is very high the optimism is

there but again you don't have a magic

wand to say and now we're in a recession

last one
