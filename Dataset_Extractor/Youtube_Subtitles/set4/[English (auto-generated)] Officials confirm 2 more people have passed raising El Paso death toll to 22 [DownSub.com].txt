good morning my name is David champion

I'm the chief executive officer here at

Del Sol Medical Center we wanted to come

to you this morning and be able to give

an update of the patient's the victims

from Saturday's incident Saturday's

shooting as to the patients that we have

here in house at del Sol we were

incredibly proud two of the patients

have been discharged one patient has

been transferred to another local

hospital five remain in stable condition

and one remains in critical condition

it is absolutely heartbreaking and I'm

terribly sorry to be able to share that

two of the patients have ended up

passing away one elderly woman ended up

passing away in the middle of the night

and then another patient patient just

recently passed away I'm going to have

dr. Stephen Flaherty our trauma medical

director come be able to share a little

bit more about the nature of the

injuries but the the nature of the

patients that we ended up seeing and and

the way in which the person who did this

was was shooting indiscriminately the

challenges that our care team has had

and taking care of a lot of these

patients has been beyond just treating

their gunshot wounds it's been treating

other comorbidities and and other issues

that these patients have had and so my

sincere compliments to the entire team

for the work that they have done in what

has been nearly impossible situations

I'm gonna ask dr. Flaherty to be able to

come in and share a little bit more

clarity

over the course of the past 48 hours

my partner is Jody Smith Rahul Rashid

and our adopted partner major Chris Bell

from Womack or from William Beaumont

Army Medical Center have been forgotten

providing surgical about support and

interventions to patients involved in

these shootings we have been providing

continuous care in the intensive care

unit to these most critically injured

patients at most times there has been

more than one of us present in the ICU

unfortunately these wounds have been

devastating and major and we are deeply

saddened to be here today to have to

tell you that two patients have passed

in addition to the care that we have

been organizing and leading there has

been an incredibly robust support staff

by our sides the nursing staff has been

incredible the del Sol ICU nurses have

been amazing at most times there have

been two or three nurses at the bedside

of each one of these patients that of

course is in addition to our respiratory

therapists the other support staff and

the unending support from the leadership

of this hospital led by David chim so we

are truly heartbroken to have to be here

to report this the wounds that the

patients have received have been

devastating consistent with which with

what has been reported as a

high-velocity gunshot wound our patient

who died had major I can tell you about

one of the patients who died she the

patient had major intra-abdominal

injuries affecting the liver the kidney

and the intestines

she received massive blood transfusion

utilizing all types of blood products

the red cells in addition to products

that help coagulation z'

FFP platelets and cryo precipitate I

don't think I can add anything more at

this point except to echo our deep

sorrow on behalf of myself and my team

we were just visiting with the family

and as I'm as I'm hugging the son of a

guy who just lost his mom he's he's

talking about the nurses and the doctors

and complimenting them to me and that's

what he was thinking about at this point

and and being able to convey just what a

phenomenal job all of the doctors all of

the team here at Del Sol all of the Del

Sole family has done and in taking care

of his mom and ultimately all of the

eleven victims that we received happy to

open it up to any questions

I'm sorry how to respect for the

families we can't release some of the

the nature of the injuries to the

patients ages from 35 to 82 again there

were significant amount of comorbidities

that some of these patients have had

absolutely you spoke certainly about the

patient that passed overnight the

elderly patient I wonder if you can tell

us more about the patient that passed

more recently and if you can talk about

the other patient who is in critical

condition how that treatments going is

there's there's nothing that we can

share right now about about the other

two patients

most recent death you said more recently

can you tell us when that patient passed

away within the past hour

thank you all very much

yep

you
