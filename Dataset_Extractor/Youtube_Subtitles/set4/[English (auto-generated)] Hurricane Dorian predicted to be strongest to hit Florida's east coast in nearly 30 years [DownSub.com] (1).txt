south-of-the-border hurricane durian

intensifies with forecasters predicting

it could be the strongest hurricane to

hit Florida's east coast in almost 30

years it's expected to make landfall any

day now

Global's Jackson Prosecco is at Cocoa

Beach Florida with the latest and

jackson preparations are underway for

what could be a category 4 storm now

yeah good morning to you Jen not only a

category 4 we're talking winds of 230

kilometers per hour that is incredible

and that would be incredibly destructive

if it comes here the thing is though the

models are now varying as to where

exactly this thing is going to land some

suggesting it may actually just stay off

the coast others saying it might ride

the coast so all of the east coast of

Florida is really on alert right now and

that's having a devastating impact of

course on what should be the busy Labor

Day weekend behind me here on the beach

you know the surfers are about the only

ones enjoying the bigger than usual

waves the rest of the beach though is

absolutely empty there's nobody out here

it should be packed on a day like today

and then you look at the hotels those

hurricanes storm shutters are starting

to go up as people leave and as the

hotels shut down the bottom line is here

Jen because the path is so uncertain

because there is so much uncertainty as

to even what day this is going to arrive

as it slows down people are not taking

any chances they're making preparations

no matter where they are along the

Florida coast yeah I bet they are it is

kind of an eerie scene there no one

around you on a beautiful beach is

everyone worried now about evacuations

as that's what's happening

yeah well this area specifically Cocoa

Beach Cape Canaveral these outer Bank

Islands were actually now under a

mandatory evacuation order that comes

into effect tomorrow morning so as a

result the hotels are shutting down

they've asked the guests to leave but a

lot of people preemptively cancelled

their vacation plans because they didn't

know what to expect this weekend so I

think it's an open question at this

point as to whether or not those

evacuation zones will be expanded up and

down the coast because the timing and

path are so uncertain officials seem to

be playing it very cautiously at this

point they don't want to give anybody a

full sense of alarm and they don't want

to cause any sort of panic if it's not

absolutely necessary okay well we're

just looking at pictures of the storm

and it is massive is that causing people

to run out and buy supplies how

are the supplies holding up do you know

yeah I mean I think it's a bit unusual

we've had four or five days to prepare

for this and people started stocking up

early all across the state as a result

roughly 50% of the gas stations in this

area have now run completely dry 1/4 of

the gas stations across the entire state

of Florida are now without fuel and the

grocery stores the shelves are empty no

more bottled water no more bread we do

know that Florida is taking efforts to

try and replenish supplies in fact the

governor announced yesterday that police

escorts will be used to bring fuel

tankers to gas stations to try and keep

the pumps flowing as long as possible

well lots going on there thank you so

much for your time and stay safe down

there with the crew that's Jackson

Prosecco joining us from Cocoa pirita
