heavy wind gusts and torrential rain

hammered halifax early Saturday

afternoon as the storm intensified

uprooted and broken trees littered

streets across the peninsula damaging

parked cars and blocking streets another

reason to stay indoors loose items from

construction sites police closed this

street after four by six sheets of

plywood were sent sailing down the

street emergency management officials

say those airborne items pose a great

danger to the public and we're asking

contractors to clean up any loose

materials we've been getting complaints

today and notifications about lumber

material left unattended construction

sites unsecured so those are a big

concern right now we've been working

with our policing partners all morning

trying to identify companies and

reaching out to them late in the

afternoon a construction crane collapse

onto an unfinished building downtown a

clear example of the danger with this

kind of wind heavy wind gust even tore a

large chunk of roof off a 50 unit

apartment building

Halifax fire was on scene to help

evacuate the tenants while city transit

were taking those stranded to an

evacuation center being run by the Red

Cross volunteers across Nova Scotia and

the rest of Atlantic Canada are on

standby to respond and we will support

communities that are impacted by this

disaster by mid-afternoon high tide saw

strong storm surges pounding the Halifax

harbor and rocking ships at the dock the

damage is building up even before the

hurricane makes landfall

Sara the winds continue to get stronger

and stronger and the damage reports they

continue to climb Halifax fire they're

everywhere responding to calls of downed

power lines and trees that have been

broken or uprooted that are blocking

streets now as it continues to get

darker we likely won't get an idea the

full extent of the damage until the Sun

comes up tomorrow morning yeah and

Jessie you you mentioned in that package

the situation downtown as you were

seeing debris flying off of Fenwick

towers just talk to me about how

dangerous that situation can be Sara

that's that's been a big concern

especially well we got a major gust

coming through right now but flying

debris was one of the major concerns and

we saw a roof get torn off a building on

Tobin Street and probably landed 70

yards down on Queen Street now they did

have to evacuate 50 people as we

mentioned that item they are heading to

one of those emergency evacuation

centers for the night Red Cross has set

up different locations across the city

but winds are getting strong here we've

got flying debris even coming down gajin

Street here out front of the global news
