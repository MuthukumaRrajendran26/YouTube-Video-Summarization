my wife Fran I won't express to the

victims victims families the Dayton

community our great sympathy this is a

heartbreaking tragedy and it is the type

tragedy that you pray never comes to

your state or to your community Mara and

I talked earlier this morning very early

this morning prior to that I'd received

a call from our public safety people

about about the situation I just want to

say that the city of Dayton Montgomery

County first responders everyone has

done an absolutely amazing job you

practice for these tragedies and you

pray to God they never occur if you

don't practice you're not ready it's

clear Dayton was ready the community was

ready Maris pointed out to me how many

other departments have made themselves

available and have been involved in in

helping so I just want to thank all of

them I won't thank the Dayton police

department the officers who were

involved in ending this tragedy their

professionalism their quickness their

amazing courage and their response

undoubtedly saved many many many lives

we will never know how many lives were

saved but you know Police Department and

mayor gave me off the tour my wife Fran

I the two or a few minutes ago and the

assailant was obviously very very close

to being able to kill dozens and dozens

more more people

so in this tragedy we have to thank our

first responders we have to thank our

police department for the amazing job

that they have done the mayor and I have

been in contact throughout the morning

we'll continue to be in contact I've

made it clear to her that you know any

resources that we have in the state

certainly is available from our mental

health specialists and our Highway

Patrol course has been involved as well

but again my hats off to the city of

Dayton to the police department into the

first responders thanks Mara certainly

appreciate the governor's help Ohio

State Patrol as well who have been

terrific as we've gone through a number

of these issues over the past summer the

governor has always been one to quickly

call quickly check in and then be here

when when we're dealing with these

issues so certainly appreciate your

personal leadership we have some updates

from police and so I'm going to turn it

over to deputy chief Carver Thank You

mayor first thing first thing I'd like

to do is go ahead and confirm the

identity or release the identity of the

shooter the shooter in this incident is

Connor Betts CEO NN o RB e TT s white

male 24 date of birth 1028 94 and I

would ask work we it's our understanding

that that some images of the suspect

have been posted by media and some of

those are not correct so please make

sure that you have the correct

photograph or image of the suspect when

you report that and secondly there's a I

believe some of the media has the wrong

Facebook posting on their on their

website so if you would please make sure

that you have the correct ones

so we're identifying the proper person

and and the proper persons image with

that we will have additional information

at four o'clock we originally thought

it'd be about a three o'clock briefing

for for a more comprehensive view of

what happened and and what the response

was that's going to be at four o'clock

right here at this location so we will

give you additional information on the

suspect and actually what transpired at

this time I'll give you the names and

demographics of the nine people who were

killed and the first one is Lois Oglesby

og lesb why black female 27 the second

one is Megan Betts the ETTs white female

22 Syed Saleh si le h black male 38

derrick fudge black male 57 Logan Turner

white male 30 necklace Coomer Cu mmer

white male 25 Thomas McNichols MC n IC H

OLS black male 25 Beatrice Warren Curtis

black female 36 and Monica Brickhouse

life female 39 those are the nine names

of the individuals who were killed

overnight with with that I'll turn it

back over to the mayor

so tonight I want to also announce we

will have a vigil at 8:00 p.m. we've

talked with the leaders of the Oregon

business district association it will be

on the streets of Fifth Street in the

Oregon district at 8:00 p.m. this

evening

also the Blood Center is closed today

we've been informed they have adequate

supply today but we want to remind

people that if they want to take action

it would be good to donate blood

tomorrow and we have a special effort

that we're putting together and I want

to thank the Dayton foundation and have

Mike Parks come forward to explain what

we're trying to do for victims families

Thanks mirror first our thoughts and

prayers are with the families and the

victims as two months ago we learned as

a community we came together to help

those in need and once again we'll do

that and as we speak a fund is being

established called the Dayton Oregon

district tragedy fund at the Dayton

foundation that'll be up and going

later this afternoon for those that

would like to help and if you'd like to

help your neighbors and friends there'll

be a way to do that and to assist those

that have been impacted thank you Mike I

think what's most amazing about our

community is once people woke up this

morning as early as 5 a.m. 6 a.m. 7 a.m.

folks and leaders from across the

community called or reached out and said

what I can what can I do and then others

we called and they immediately stepped

in and I want to appreciate I really

appreciate the Dayton foundation for

doing this quickly as we know that there

will be people that weren't prepared

obviously for such a tragic event and

their and their families all right with

that I'll open up and question Mike

Campbell

yes that's the sister of the suspect all

nine shooting victims were were located

in the Oregon district on on or around

history is there another crime scene in

a different area related to this as I

said earlier the investigation leads us

in different direction so obviously we

we look at vehicles we look at houses

and and yes we did conduct a search

warrant earlier today and we will put

this on our site as well so how about we

do that maybe that okay I think that'll

be best we'll put that up

that's incorrect and I will say that the

family members of all nine people who

are deceased have been have been

notified and a Victim Witness member

from the Montgomery County Prosecutor's

Office has been assigned to each of

those families to help them through this

process as well and that's why we waited

until this afternoon to release the

names we will address that at four

o'clock as best we can we will be able

to provide much more information on the

actual incident itself at four o'clock

the address that we where he was staying

and where we conducted a search warrant

earlier today was in Bellbrook that is

correct

well all the victims are from our own

backyard too and so you know this is

just an immense tragedy you know no

matter where the victims are from their

victims and their heart goes out to the

families but this is a it's a Miami

Valley tragedy

I cannot we will comment more at four

o'clock I don't know if we'll get into

that greater detail but we will provide

as comprehensive of an overview of what

occurred at four o'clock the shooting

took place on and around the street and

sidewalk of Easter Street we're telling

you that the shooting took place on East

Fifth Street and on the sidewalks of

East Fifth Street not the parking lot

correct

we can we can give a little bit more

information at four o'clock on that I'm

sorry I can't hear you

we will we'll try to get you a general

idea of that at four o'clock well I

think that's the first thought that

always goes through your mind whenever

there is a tragedy of any any kind the

question is that policy makers have to

think about is is there anything we can

do in the future to make sure something

like this does not happen and make sure

is the wrong term but to lessen the

possibility or to lessen the number of

people who are killed these mass

shootings if you go back and I don't

pretend to be an expert but you know

they're all like and they're all

different in that sense and so sometimes

you get different lessons from each one

of them I don't think today is the day

to try to draw the lessons because

frankly we don't have all the facts and

there's going to be ample time for the

for all of us to to talk about what we

learn from this from this tragedy but

again without all the facts I would just

tell people just wait till you get all

the facts and then we can start having

those those discussions

well we've asked well in all due respect

you've asked several questions at the

same time let me just say that let's

there will be ample time for us to

discuss the lessons learned from what

happened today but let's first get the

facts and get all the facts out and

there'll be time there'll be time to

have those discussions each one of us

who is in public office has an

obligation to take what facts that occur

to take tragedies whether it's a natural

disaster whether it's the disaster of a

mass shooting such as this whatever it

is and try to come up with the lessons

lessons one

we will will address that the best we

can a fork lock I will say this

due to the short of the very short

timeline of violence it's hard to

imagine that that there was much

discrimination in in the shooting it

happened in a very short period of time

absolutely you know we're always looking

at what could have motivated such a

horrific action as this and and like I

said this morning were interviewing

dozens of people and going through a lot

of different you know electronic

evidence other evidence to try to

determine that we don't have that answer

yeah this is the first day this is a you

know there's gonna be a lengthy

investigation

so we'll do our best to get to get the

information to you but speculating at

this point would be premature

i I won't i won't address that

we said earlier that it was a 223

caliber a K like long rifle weight and

he had extra magazines as well as who

was wearing body armor we can we can get

you more specifics at four o'clock yeah

four o'clock I bet we'll see you all at

four o'clock I want to recognize some

people that are here the coroner's

office has been a great partnership

obviously the coroner has been an

autopsy all day so Eric Blaine is here

state representative Phil Plummer is

here I see state auditor David Yost is

here and my dear friend and I don't

think I'd get through anything without

the mayor of Kettering Don Patterson ok

we'll see you in a few hours I will see

you at 3:00 3:00 o'clock we're gonna

have a press conference at 3:00 and a

press conference at 4:00 because I know

how much you guys love press conferences

thank you

you
