the handover in 1997 transferred Hong

Kong from British rule to China with the

promise one country two systems' for the

next 50 years but China has attempted to

bring Hong Kong increasingly under

Chinese Authority and Hongkongers have

protested in 2003 in 2014 and again this

year to retain rights and free speech

Hong Kong is Chinese

but with democratic laws and freedoms

that make it historically different from

China Hong Kong is immensely resilient

they are culturally Chinese but they

don't feel politically connected to the

mainland at all for Great Britain Hong

Kong became an east-west trading hub

more than 200 years ago around tea and

silver and then opium Britain gained

control of Hong Kong after the First

Opium War in 1842 Canada became

interwove on with Hong Kong in the later

19th century British travel through this

country and Chinese immigration here

steam ships and ocean liners across the

Pacific established trade and cultural

ties between Vancouver and Hong Kong and

Canadians were also with British forces

imprisoned by the Japanese in Hong Kong

in the second world war and in the 1980s

a flood of Hongkongers began coming to

Canada that exodus began in anticipation

of the handover soon after China's

premier and Britain's Prime Minister

agreed that Hong Kong would become part

of China the successful negotiations is

a major triumph for both leaders in the

years since the handover many Chinese

from the mainland have moved to Canada

the protests this past weekend in

Toronto Vancouver and Calgary pitting

sympathizers on both sides shows the

large Chinese presence in this country

and the divide that exists here -

there's a mainland and Hong Kong people

I'd I'm even among the Chinese community

jomkwan urges Ottawa to stand firm

against pressure from an increasingly

powerful Beijing and we have a moral

duty to speak out against what's going

on is what I call the erosion of the

wine country to system the handover was

supposed to guarantee 50 years of

democracy in Hong Kong the one country

two systems' agreement is set to expire

in 2047

and while Zi Jian things government has

consolidated more power in Beijing Hong

Kong appears as resistant as ever to one

country one system Erik Sorensen Global
