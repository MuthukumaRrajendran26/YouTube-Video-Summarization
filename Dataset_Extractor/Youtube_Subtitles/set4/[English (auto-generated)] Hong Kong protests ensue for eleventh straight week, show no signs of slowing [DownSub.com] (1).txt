well anyone who was predicting that Hong

Kong's pro-democracy movement would

fizzle out this weekend after a

difficult week take a look it appears

they were wrong for the 11th consecutive

weekend thousands of Hongkongers have

gathered together here to protest what

they see as China tightening its grip

over this semi-autonomous City people

here braving the heat and unlike the

scenes we saw last week so far these

protesters have been very peaceful and

very polite even by Canadian standards

speaking of which we met a number of

Canadians in this crowd Hong Kong is in

fact home to the largest Canadian

diaspora of any city outside of Canada

have a listen and Canadian Valley

democracy democracy is us and we are the

people and people are the boss of the

Gothenburg it's truly a grassroots

movement that this is what people want

this is the voice of the people but

despite the celebratory atmosphere here

there is also a palpable tension hanging

over this crowd after threats from

Beijing right now more than a hundred

military vehicles with the Chinese army

are massed just across the board or a

top Chinese military commander warning

they could be here in ten minutes to

quell the unrest so at once this city is

protesting and holding its breath

watching and waiting to see how Beijing

will respond
