political campaigns can feel well

exhausted the debates TV ads let's do

this together rallies pundits what a

showdown last night politicians the

pollsters the elite media and usually

voters are only going to remember one

thing about a candidate their slogan a

slogan is a word or a phrase used to

express a position or goal and when it

comes to politics it's that little sound

bite that politicians want you to

remember them by their chanted at

rallies the closing line and speeches

and they're printed on posters back in

the day they were even turned into

original songs

[Music]

[Music]

I've been on campaigns were used oh my

god you spend you spent hours and hours

looking at polling data you test things

out in focus groups yeah I mean a lot of

science goes into this that's Dennis W

Johnson he's a former political

strategist and professor who's written a

lot of books on election campaigns you

know if you're gonna have an effective

political slogan it's got to be

memorable

it's got to be catchy it's got to be

true and it also should be aspirational

it should be a positive kind of message

and that's what made Obama's 2008

campaign slogan so successful kind of a

rock star Michael a star is born and the

same goes for Trump's make America great

again slogan even if it wasn't exactly

original for those who've abandoned hope

will restore hope and will welcome them

into a great national crusade to make

America great again political slogans

have been around since at least the

1800s in the United States William Henry

Harrison was a war hero who went by his

nickname old Tippecanoe after a battle

he won in 1811 when he ran for president

in 1840 with John Tyler his slogan was

Tippecanoe and Tyler too the race is

seen as the first modern presidential

campaign complete with an advertising

campaign that cast Harrison as a

hard-working Western farmer who lived in

a log cabin despite the fact that he

grew up wealthy on the East Coast

since then campaign slogans have become

an essential part of any leadership race

I think my absolute favorite has to be I

like

[Music]

it tells you nothing about what he

stands for but it basically says I like

this fella I think he'd be a good

president little campaigns are all about

messaging how well one candidate can

define themselves and their vision for

the country and to do that they tell you

a story listen to what Bill Clinton's

former campaign manager James Carville

had to say about it since the first time

the first human being told somebody

about their end of impact every every

story that ever exists has the same

ought it cannot have any other it's

called set up conflict resolution and it

is the way that people receive

information it's the only way they

receive information we don't get

information through 10-point plans and

when you look at some successful

presidential campaigns the narratives

carefully crafted by political

strategists almost always center around

two emotions fear or hope Nixon

weaponized fear to cast himself as a law

and order candidate we shall have order

in the United States it's morning again

in America

Reagan was reelected after this historic

ad convince people he had turned the

country around in an increasingly

dangerous world George W Bush used 9/11

to portray himself as America's

protector Obama championed a story of

hope and change and progress and Trump

pulled a page from Nixon's playbook

ratcheting up white fear while offering

a pseudo nostalgic vision of old America

of course candidates don't get elected

solely because of the story they tell

campaigns take a small army to pull off

and there is a whole science dedicated

to it but research has shown that you

can predict how someone will vote based

on their perceptions of candidates

personalities like how trustworthy they

seem or whether they'll make a good

leader Trump for example gets high

ratings from Republicans on his

personality traits especially when it

comes to his conviction so why does this

matter anyway well the next time you go

to a rally or watch a debate and a

politician makes you feel some type of

way know that it's not an accident it's

by design so you're 18 years old and you

haven't registered to vote what are you

waiting for a take the opportunity to

let those people who are giving you a

bad time

now let them have the bad time tomorrow
