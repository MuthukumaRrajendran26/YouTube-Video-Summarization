these are the images often associated

with the European migrant crisis Germany

France and Italy have all brought in the

highest number of asylum seekers but

there is one location that you often

don't hear about Cyprus and it's at a

breaking point over the past two years

the small country has seen a dramatic

influx and now has the highest number of

first-time Asylum applicants per capita

in the entire European Union but what

makes the situation more complicated has

to do with the island's unique political

history Cyprus has been divided since

1974 after Turkey invaded the north of

the island in response to a military

coup meaning that portion of the country

is run by a Turkish government while the

South known as a Republic of Cyprus is

led by the Greeks there seeking

protection in the Republic of Cyprus

there are several reasons for this

influx the Cypriot interior minister

puts some of the blame on Turkey for

refusing to cooperate with authorities

and for exploiting cypresses unique

geopolitical situation some NGOs and

organizations feel the backlog of the

asylum applications are due to the lack

of avenues available for people to

legally stay in Cyprus the island is

just west of Syria so there are a lot of

Syrian refugees arriving but lately the

country's also seen more people from

Cameroon's Anglophone region who are

also fleeing conflict and not everyone

seeking refuge in cyprus ever plan to

end up there many people were tricked by

smugglers who would claim they could get

them to Italy or Germany only to drop

them off in Cyprus in come cases people

are having to wait between 3 to 5 years

for a final decision on whether they're

going to get silent it's all down to the

lack of capacity the fact that

there isn't the capacity to process this

file of sufficiently quickly thereby it

creates a backlog what we would say is

it's also very important that people are

really assessed so that we can identify

those that really do need protection

they really do have protection needs so

that they can be given the support that

they require aid organizations want

asylum applications process faster and

if that doesn't happen they fear the

crisis will only get worse
