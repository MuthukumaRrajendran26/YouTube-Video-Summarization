when it comes to decisions about

currency manipulation and whether we

believe that is something another

country is doing Canada believes our

approach needs to be fact-based we look

to the judgment of experts like the IMF

and I would point you to the IMF recent

views on what has been happening with

the Chinese currency at a time of

volatility in the global economy and

volatility in the trading space there

can be a lot of explanations for why

currencies falling rise our government

is very aware that there are 300,000

Canadians in Hong Kong

and in general I think Canadians

appreciate you know and a psycho might

have been discussing this is a turbulent

moments in the world and one of the

responsibilities of the Government of

Canada in turbulent times is to pay

particular attention to Canadians who

find themselves either as residents or

as visitors to places where there is

so that is always a priority on my

agenda it's always something that we are

watching in put your hands closely Hong

Kong is one of the places in the world

that we're looking at closely right now

because of the ongoing protests and

because of the very large number of

Canadians who are there I would urge all

Canadians if you live in Hong Kong if

you are travelling there if you have

relatives who are there or traveling

there to look at our travel advice we

are very intentional about the travel

advice that we publish about all

countries we recently updated our travel

advice for Hong Kong and currently our

advice is to exercise a high degree of

caution the advisory specifies the

reasons for that advice and I would also

say Canadians should feel very free to

you know go on our website there are

resources there you can get in touch and

if you're in Hong Kong our consulate is

very active please feel free to get in

touch with the consulate we are there to

support Canadians around the world I

think that is is very important

everywhere in the world

lead to their people that's actually

something that I thought I were talking

about in our conversation this morning

you will never go wrong as a government

when you listen carefully to the

concerns of other people I think it can

also be tempting when a government

doesn't like the concerns expressed by

its people it can be tempting to label

those concerns by an expression of a

genuine desire of people but to label it

as something else I think that when it

comes to how we try to practice all it

takes in Canada it's a mistake to do

that
