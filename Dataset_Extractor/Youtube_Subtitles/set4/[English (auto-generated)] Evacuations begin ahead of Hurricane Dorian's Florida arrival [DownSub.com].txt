hurricane durian creeps toward South

Florida people in Miami are gathering

donations for the hard-hit Bahamas prime

minister justin trudeau also announced

today canada is ready to provide support

if needed the eye of the storm is now

dangerously close to Florida's east

coast

the storms outer bands have already

pounded parts of the state with heavy

rains and residents are being warned to

hunker down and prepare for

hurricane-force winds

durian is fierce even from space you can

tell that it's huge

the storm is tied with the Labor Day

hurricane of 1935 for the most powerful

Atlantic hurricane to ever make landfall

Jackson Prosecco is in Daytona Beach

tonight in Jackson after all that

destruction in the Bahamas you found

people willing to defy evacuation orders

well Robyn nearly 3 million people up

and down the coast are under mandatory

evacuation order tonight and here in

Daytona Beach they've gone a step

further they put a curfew in place as

well all of this is to get people away

from the coast while it's still safe to

do so because this storm has such an

uncertain path evacuation day on the

coast and a frantic rush for tourists to

leave

I feel like safety is most important you

can't stop storms and mother nature so

you just have to go with the flow in

South Carolina's lanes on the interstate

were reversed to help people flee faster

in Daytona Beach where there's also a

mandatory evacuation order in effect

many locals are staying put confident

they can ride out the storm on this thin

strip of land we supply for the next 7

days I have gas for my generator for my

refrigerator staying means being trapped

when the bridge is closed with durian

drifting close but not forecast to make

landfall

people would rather hunker down I mean

the storm is only moving at 5 miles an

hour right now see have some time to

get your stuff and get out of here

before it hits just to be safe hunter

and Toby Harrison were busy packing up

anything in their yard that could become

a projectile but they still have no

plans to leave

I feel pretty calm and pretty confident

in this house and that'll keep us safe

along the coast of Florida Georgia and

the Carolinas residents face the same

dilemma stay or go

shelters have opened for people who need

a safe place some of them have already

hit capacity in a sign of what's to come

utility crews from across North America

have begun staging at the Daytona

Speedway thousands of trucks ready to

roll out as soon as they're needed as

the wind grows stronger and the waves

get larger people up and down the coast

have put their faith in the forecast

hoping that Dorian will only deliver a

glancing blow but they're watching

closely and are more than a little

worried as long as the eye doesn't hit

us directly then we're gonna stay I mean

if a real strong eye is gonna hit us and

we're gonna scoot out of here those

evacuation efforts have been hampered by

the situation at airports several

airports in this area have already shut

down others are closing tonight that

includes the airport in Orlando Robyn

there are also still shortages of

gasoline with about 50% of stations in

this region running completely dry

Jackson what are the weather conditions

like right now where you are

well we've certainly noticed increase in

the winds over the course the day today

and throughout the day we've also had

these bands a very intense rainfall that

have moved through but the real bulk of

this storm is still days away especially

here in northern Florida and into the

Carolinas this is going to be a

prolonged event and people are being

told to get ready for just that
