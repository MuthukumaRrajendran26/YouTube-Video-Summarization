so it's good to be in Halifax today

obviously we've been watching over

carefully over the course of the past

few days

both the impacts of Hurricane Dorian and

the recovery efforts across Nova Scotia

indeed across all the Atlantic areas I

was obviously following very closely in

regular contact with officials I reached

out to mayor's including the mayor of

the Lila Medlin a number of premiers as

well here today to thank thank the first

responders and all the people have been

working very very hard on something that

has been an ongoing effort over the past

few days I know that crews have been

working around the clock to restore

power throughout Nova Scotia and there's

lots more work to do and the federal

government is here to support in any way

we can and if we see a leaf axils

re-pour consuming me who called me

demos we've had a crush to spa say she
