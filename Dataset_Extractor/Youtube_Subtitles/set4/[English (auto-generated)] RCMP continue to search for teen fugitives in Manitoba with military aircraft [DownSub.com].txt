the search continues here in Gillam

Manitoba at this point it remains the

focal point of the RCMP investigation

because this is the last place with a

confirmed sighting of the pair we're

talking about gamma cloud and briar

Chmerkovskiy now in the community they

will be using the hercules aircraft that

the military provided it landed in the

community yesterday and it was up in the

air doing searches right until dark it

is going back up today it will be

looking at a number of areas including

waterways now the Hercules has some

equipment that is very useful number one

it can stay in the area for a long time

but also has high-powered cameras I can

also tell you that the RCMP will

continue to scan the wooded area around

this community using of course ATVs and

officers will be on foot with k9 units

they did earlier search a train that

came into town from Churchill Manitoba

plainclothes officers continue to talk

with community members here on the

ground of course they have been

searching this community since Tuesday

and it appears they will continue to do

so until evidence points them in another

direction
