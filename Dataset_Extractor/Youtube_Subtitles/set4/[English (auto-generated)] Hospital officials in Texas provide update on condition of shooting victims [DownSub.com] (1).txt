all right y'all ready okay

7:45 we just want to give another update

again we've some things are starting to

come into focus a little more like I

started off with earlier it's it's very

important to me to y'all to know that

first and foremost that the start this

healing process starts within and that

this community it needs to love each

other and pray for each other and pray

for the victims and their families

that's most important is is to remember

those people and to grab on to your

loved ones tonight I want to update you

on what's happening right here at

Medical Center of what we have going and

I've got some updated numbers and I'll

try to to go through those quickly but

accurately amend ago earlier when I came

out I reported 14 here that number is 13

one of the people we had was caught in

the action it was not related to this

incident so the number is 13 okay so I

want to correct that that the number is

13 out of those 13 we have had two that

have been treated and released we have

seven that are critical when I say

critical most of those have been in

surgery and are out of surgery seven of

those okay those are critical to serious

one deceased and we have one transferred

a pediatric patient under the age of two

years old that was transferred out of

here okay so I'll go over those one more

time seven critical to serious one

deceased one transferred under the age

of two years old okay a to the eight

we've had eight people total in surgery

and and most of those are out and and

have gone very well let me just talk

about our blood supply we're getting a

lot of calls about blood supply our

blood supply currently is good we're

okay right now we appreciate all the

calls and all the outpouring has been

nationwide we're getting calls all over

the nation about what's going on and

first and foremost we want to say thank

you for that because that's really shows

the support that every that

that we have for each other our supplies

are good the blood is good let me just

comment briefly on the on the families I

know there is a family gathering center

that's been set up here in Odessa and

I've got I'll get that in just a second

but I'll get that out but there is a

family center that has been set up for

people to to gather if they have any

questions okay y'all may know that

already but I just wanted to bring that

out but we're still on lockdown

I still think for the safety of our

patients and victims and the victims

families that we need stay all lockdown

just to keep it under control we hope to

have that lifted before too long but

right now I think it's in the best

interest to keep it locked down where it

is okay our staff has been amazing but

that's not the point here the point

right now is that that these victims are

being taken care of and so we're just

we're just trying to do right by them

okay let me introduce just a few people

that will take just a few questions okay

this is Matt and he's our chief

operations officer Matt's here this is

dr. Bose one of our trauma doctors and

I'm going to turn it over to dr. Bose

just for a second just to talk about

gunshot victims and what things like

that are and I'll let him speak to it in

just a minute we'll come back to me then

- Matt for any follow-up questions okay

I'll hand it over to dr. Bose was here

for this second thank you

so first of all our thoughts are with

the families and when a situation like

this happens its actions that come

together from preparation years in

advance so over the last several years

we've formed committees where we've

coordinated the many elements that will

be necessary here police sheriff school

departments Odessa Fire & Rescue and the

medical director the emergency room and

other parties that are involved here

when everyone arrived it was well

orchestrated we received 13 patients and

because of this preparation you know we

were able to call in our backups

anesthesiologist operating room staffs

tax nurses this was a great team effort

for everybody when the patients arrived

after they arrived we were able to do

the initial stabilizing maneuvers on

everyone and the emphasis I would give

here and I think a take-home point

especially for the national viewers is I

encourage everyone in every community no

matter what size you're in the middle of

the desert you're in an urban area to

prepare in advance unfortunately it may

not be a matter of if it may be a matter

of when and for us this preparation

really helped us today I thought to what

the family and another thing I'd mention

is whenever there is something on the

national scale like this it starts as a

local response it starts right there at

the community it starts with knowing how

to stop bleeding it and starts with how

to do BLS and chest compressions and

this is something that we as Americans

can do and we're incurring encouraging

this in the Midland Odessa community and

we really encourage this at Medical

Center Hospital and you guys out there

wherever you're watching nationwide you

can make a huge difference for people

because when they arrive here the

response can stay local because if you

practice this you don't need to call in

the state you don't need to call the

governor you don't need to activate FEMA

and national you know resources so we

can do this we can come together and

I think our community here has shown how

we can do that and I think our families

are going to come together and we're

gonna become stronger from this thank

you let's turn it over to Matt

hi my name is Matt Collins I was the

incident commander for this incident

first of all of course our hearts and

prayers go out to all of the victims and

and their families and our hospital

staff as well this has been a very very

difficult situation we really have three

phases of operations inside the hospital

and this happens we have an activation

phase and then we have operational

periods we've just completed operational

period one and two and at 7:00 at 7:30

we went into the final phase which is a

recovery phase and that's where we start

putting everything back together getting

back to normal operations and taking

care of our staff and to continue to

take care of those patients that have

just gone through this horrific

situation so with that said I'd be able

be happy to answer any questions that I

can of course we're not able to release

names or any information regarding the

victims I am NOT certain but they were

life-flighted to Lubbock or Children's

in Dallas

my understanding all I can tell you is

we know that that person was involved in

this incident and had a fatal gunshot

wound

[Music]

you know honestly it's not a time for us

to think a lot we've done a lot of

preparation for this day and we work

through these things in simulated

situations several times a year so

everybody has a role that they fall into

and everybody fell into that role in the

hospital and all of the staff performed

Admiral

admirably but ultimately we're here to

serve those victims and the family so

it's not really about us today we do of

course you know this happens when all of

the media is released and social media

reports people come to the hospital

seeking reports on their loved ones so

we have a location inside the hospital

where we congregated all of those

families and we had a senior nursing

official work to reunify them and get as

much inflammation information as we

could to each and every family member

it's my understanding that that room is

down to just a couple of families now

and that we've communicated with

everybody that we can

we're gonna keep the hospital into a

lockdown situation until approximately

10:00 p.m. just for staff comfort and

safety but the hospital is back to

normal operations at this time it did

make the difference I can't tell you

because we are prepared but I think if

we were not we may not have had the same

rapid response to the situation and the

great outcomes that we had I mean we

saved 12 people today we're using our

own internal communication systems to

make sure that we're adequately staffed

for the unit for the evening and yes we

are actually above normal staffing

levels for this evening going into the

weekend in the hospital is back to

normal operations right now it's being

reported to us that we're fully staffed

we activate what's called call trees

where managers start them then they call

one person after another after another

and we had the exact response that we

would have ever hoped for in the

situation not only for nurses but for

doctors and all of the other support

staff and police officers security

everybody that we need to manage an

incident like this

lots of flies are good that's very good

news and then your supplies you know as

our CEO said a few minutes ago the

community needs your prayers

victims need your prayers families need

your prayers the hospital staff needs

your prayers we what we call cash

emergency supplies so when there is a

situation like this where we consume

lots of supplies while giving the care

were able to replenish them quickly

enough to maintain operations those

patients there's eight or seven critical

and two that are serious so I'm I can

give you an update on their exact status

but they are receiving the appropriate

care at the level of care they're there

first I would emphasize that this is not

about the doctor it's not about us it's

about the family but myself personally

I'm an Iraq war veteran I served 12

years in the military and served in the

Second Battle of Fallujah and Baghdad

and this is something that unfortunately

I'm very experienced at mass casualty

situations and this is what led us to

form the preparation process with

hundreds and hundreds of people that you

are not seeing here that are very

intricately involved in a situation like

this

so as far as for the public out there

the message for them I think what they

can do to help you know we always say

thoughts and prayers that's great but go

out there take a BLS class go out there

learn about how to stop bleeding go out

there and practice safety don't text and

drive don't do things where you put

yourself and others in danger and this

is something that we can do as a nation

to help here

so typically I can reliably comment on

what's happening in the walls of the

emergency room

so it'd be speculation about what is

going on on the streets and what streets

are closed and what weapons were used

I'm I don't want to say the wrong

information so I don't want to say the

wrong information but from my

understanding of the situation

the vast majority came to Medical Center

Hospital we are the highest level trauma

center for over thirty thousand square

miles in this region so over thirty

thousand square miles so the majority

came here there were fuse that went to

some outlying trauma centers as well so

who was an officer and who wasn't and

who was where it would be speculation on

my end our end we were just trying to do

the basic stop bleeding resuscitate and

use our well-trained Tech's nurses staff

physicians everyone to get the job done

these things don't just happen you have

to prepare so everything from who comes

in to where family members go to how to

keep ourselves safe

how to prevent wrong messages going out

to the media how to keep the calm and do

this in a calm situation this doesn't

happen by accident this takes years of

preparation and I encourage every

community to do this this is not an

urban community here but this happened

here and this can happen anywhere across

America and I think what I personally

took from this is a team here in West

Texas in the deserts of West Texas was

maximally prepared at this trauma center

to take care of everyone and I don't

think this is beyond us anybody can do

this

please be prepared information on the

family center is located at a set up at

Ector County annex building on 1010 East

8th Street 1010 East 8th Street and

that's for the Family Center the

reunification center there okay any

other questions before we wrap this up

so we had our basic emergency department

crew and then on top of that we have

backup emergency department crew but

often you have to figure out the

bottlenecks in your system and this is

this came from our preparation the

bottleneck may not be an emergency room

it may be the operating room

anesthesiologist so we prepared this in

advance

everybody was called in from extra

nurses extra tax extra you know

custodians they may save more lives than

anybody by preventing infection so this

is a team effort and we were prepared

for this and the whole team was called

in the last thing we're gonna we're

going to say a lockdown until 10 o'clock

at 10 o'clock we'll reassess the

situation make sure we're safe I don't

plan on having another one of these

unless something drastically changes

okay but if we do we'll get the

notification out to everybody but thank

you all for

for being here and and one final word

just to everybody listening to our voice

today and tonight is when you when you

go when you go to bed and hide with your

families you need to grab them hold on

time because nobody's guaranteed the

next the next day and grab on to your

families and love them and pray for our

staff our doctors and these victims and

these victims families and hold on to

your loved ones tonight and all we can

say is God bless Texas god bless

Odessa and Medical Center United States

and and and love on your family tonight

and thank y'all very much that's all

thank y'all thank you everybody
