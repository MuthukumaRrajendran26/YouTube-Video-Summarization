it is hard to believe that just

yesterday evening the I the center of

durian was directly overhead

since then the sky is cleared out the

Sun has been shining all day and the

full context of the damage that durian

caused is finally being realized here in

Halifax we've been watching this crew

work for the last couple of hours these

large hundred plus year old trees are

littering the streets up and down

they've come down on power lines and

snapped poles in half and that's why

this is going to be a long process

likely days before residents of Halifax

get their power back and then even

longer for more rural areas around

Atlanta Canada this is such a massive

storm since it moved off North

Carolina's coastline it expanded in size

at one point covering all of Atlantic

Canada and now moving away from

Newfoundland and into the open Atlantic

so there is some good news and people

here are taking it in stride in fact

Maritimers big smiles all over including

this couple that we ran into earlier

they had to move up their wedding

yesterday because of the storm and today

well they're getting some very memorable

photos as they've toured streets that

were heavily damaged from hurricane

durian I'm chief meteorologist Anthony

far now
