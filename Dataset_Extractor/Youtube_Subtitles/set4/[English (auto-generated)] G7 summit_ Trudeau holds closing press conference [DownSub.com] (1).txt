world hard-working middle-class people

are already having a time mate having a

hard time making ends meet even with the

growing economy they're worried about

their jobs but the businesses about

their future they wondered what this

uncertainty around the global economy

means for their retirement for the kids

for their community we in Canada believe

that we should put the best balance

sheet in the g7 to work for the middle

class it's up to the leaders of all g7

countries to work together not only to

avoid economic hardship but to build a

global economy that doesn't leave anyone

behind and creates real jobs and real

opportunities for people that's why I

asked for the g7 finance ministers to

monitor any signs of risk and report

back to their leaders so our countries

can take concerted action to address

them and maintain a strong and stable

global economy which in turn creates

growth for Canadians and other things we

discussed over the weekend was reforms

to the World Trade Organization to

ensure that trade is not only free but

fair we need to have clean

international trade rules Canada is

working with a group of WTO members

known as the Aqua group to help

modernize this organization in its

crucial role of facilitator

international trade and resolving

disputes and while we seek to reform and

strengthen the WTO Canada is also

working with the EU to establish a new

appellate mechanism so that will still

be possible to arbitrate trade disputes

in the meantime by taking these

proactive steps Canada is playing a

leading role in bringing more certainty

to the global economy while making it

easy for companies to expand and create

more of the good middle-class jobs

last year Canada set up the gender

equality Advisory Council to ensure that

the conversations taking place at the g7

included gender equality at their very

core whether we were mapping out how to

better promote women in stem or leading

critical discussions about gender-based

discrimination the work of the council

shaped our vision of an inclusive g7 and

a better world for all it's fantastic

that France chose to continue with the

council ambassador view dome which aired

who co-chaired the council last you has

continued the important work can

and its partners started in shallows

what like addressing gender-based

violence and increasing the number of

women in leadership positions Canada

also signed on to the beer our partners

we raised a historic 3.8 billion dollars

for women and girls education in crisis

and conflict situations as part of this

commitment I highlighted a number of new

projects to support girls education

because we know that when girls and

women succeed entire communities thrive

we also had the chance to meet with

African leaders to talk about regional

security including in the Sahel region

and about helping people in equal world

to create better initiatives and better

tools that tackle the most pressing

issues we need a wide range of

experience and expertise around the

table when I met with African leaders we

discussed the importance of encouraging

growth through trade and attracting

investment that benefits everyone does

not support Russia's reintegration to

the g7 Russia has yet to change the

behavior that led to its expulsion in

2014 and therefore should not be allowed

back into the g7 Russia's aggression and

illegal annexation of Crimea is

completely unacceptable

Canada has and will always defend

Ukraine's sovereignty we also talked a

lot about the climate crisis at this

side people around the world are shocked

and devastated to see the Amazon

engulfed in flames

Minister Freeland has reached out to her

counterparts in Brazil and Bolivia and

her government has been in touch with

the Brazilian government to offer our

support to put an end to this crisis

today alongside other g7 countries

Canada is stepping up to fight the fires

in the Amazon Canada is offering to help

by sending water bombers as well as a

finance

so contribution of 15 million dollars

now we could pretend that the situation

in the Amazon is just part of a natural

cycle but that's not exactly what's

going on here the toll of human activity

and extreme weather events on our

communities our environment our health

and our world will continue decline

unless we take decisive action as part

of our broader commitment to fight

climate change we've also made

investments through the Canadian climate

overall we've had a very productive few

days here at the g7 I'm looking forward

to building on the progress we made this

weekend and work even more closely

together to tackle the most pressing

issues facing not just our countries but

the world thank you once again for

joining us know happy to take your

questions hi Prime Minister you say

you're optimistic about the ability to

make progress on dealing with the

challenging issues facing the world but

Donald Tusk gave a stark warning on the

first day of the gathering here in

Biarritz that this summit may be the

last chance to restore the political

community there is no large-scale

communications reduced to a single age

so given that lack of consensus and

possibly ambition how confident are you

that the g7 can be effective in a short

to medium term to deal with a lot of the

big issues given that the US president

is office Omega I was actually very

pleased that we were able to come

together on so many significant issues

that matter to Canadians and indeed to

people around the world we came here to

make sure that Canada's voice was loudly

and clearly heard around the around the

global table on issues that matter

deeply to us and by extension to

everyone around the world so whether it

was concrete confirmations of support

and actions on a range of issues from

the Amazon

to the Middle East or whether it was

deeply discussing and and following up

on situations facing the global economy

we are very pleased with a significant

dialogue and constructive conversations

we move forward with you repeated your

position that you would not welcome

Russia back into the g7 Donald Trump

cannot do that without support from the

other members but his chair of the

summit next year he can invite guests if

he invites Russia what will you do

would you attend the conference if

Vladimir Putin is going but the I have

never tried away at global summits from

tables around which mr. Putin sat and

contributed I had direct conversations

with him in which I have reinforced

Canada's concerns around a range of

Russia's behaviors and actions and I

give it an opportunity I will repeat

myself and listen to what he has to say

I think the important thing is to

recognize that the g7 is a gathering of

like-minded nations that have committed

to moving forward in a positive way for

the global economy and Russian Russia's

actions both in Ukraine and in other

ways have clearly made it not eligible

for partnership in this group of

like-minded countries to do very much to

Canadians I wouldn't be playing paying

that's something we will take into into

account as we move forward to ensure

that this system is fair for everyone

my ministry spoke about the importance

of dealing with climate change through

this forum what message does it send

when the President of the United States

doesn't even show up the president has

made his perspective on climate change

very clear made it very clear over over

the past years we believe that climate

change is a real and existential threat

to our planet and that's why as a

country and as a government we have

moved forward unequivocally in

leadership

climate change whether it's putting a

price on pollution or progressively

phasing out coal or protecting our

oceans or facing out plastics Canada has

been unequivocal in its leadership on

that understanding that you cannot have

a plan for the future of the economy

unless you also have a plan to fight

climate change now the President and

even some conservative politicians at

home seem to disagree with us on that

but I'm very much looking forward to the

lecture which we get to have this

conversation with Canadians

I can't speak for my g7 partners but we

are happy to announce right here right

now Canada will be investing fifteen

million dollars ourselves towards this

crisis in the Amazon these forest fires

in the Amazon on top of sharing and

sending down water bombers that are so

significantly needed one of the things

we've seen over the past years as Canada

has faced increasingly extreme wildfire

events is there is a global network of

support and friends that lean on each

other whether it's Mexican firefighters

or even Australian firefighters we've

had many people come to help Canada

during our difficult years and I'm very

happy to be able to say that we will be

there to support our friends in in South

America as we fight a blaze that has

distress table called an attorney even

excitement of artichokia

on a director my contract and was an

did you think at the decision to invite

the Iranian Foreign Minister here and

did you have any terrain

we had a very robust conversation on

Saturday night on this subject of around

where we agreed that not only do we need

to ensure that Iran doesn't develop

nuclear weapons that we need to see a

de-escalation and more peace and

security in the region and that should

happen through engagement and dialogue

with the Iranian government that's

that's why we were pleased to see the

immediate next steps of dialogue

beginning with with Iran the following

day we don't have any direct diplomatic

relations with Iran but we are certainly

part of the discussions that is calling

for peace and de-escalation in the

region on China were you hoping to see a

stronger stance on the two detained

Canadians from the g7 has um every one

around the table at the g7 indeed most

of our partners around the world have

been very clear that the arbitrary

detention of two Canadians is something

that is of concern obviously not just to

Canada but to the entire global

community it remains at the forefront of

our preoccupations with China we will

continue to bring it up at every

occasion hi Eric regularly with The

Globe and Mail have a question on brexit

would you like to see Canada become the

first country destroyed country deal

post brexit what we was what we would

very much like to see is a minimal

amount of disruption to

and global economy regardless of the

next steps taken certainly Canada has

deep ties of friendship and trade with

the UK and we would certainly hope to

see that continue as smoothly as

possible our officials will be getting

together to continue to discuss how we

can ensure that that there is minimal

disruption for Canadian businesses and

for our citizens around the world but

could that include a trade deal the

secretary deal pretty much out of the

gate we have been doing a very good job

over the past four years of signing very

big trade deals whether it was with

Europe whether it was with that North

America or indeed with the growing

economies of Asia and we look forward to

having our officials continue the

discussions that we've had over the past

years with the United Kingdom on the

issue of ensuring that the tremendous

and positive trade between our two

countries continues in a way that is is

beneficial to us all CBC does Canada

have anything to contribute to the

launch by president macron where what if

anything can we contribute to this we

continue to be part of the global

community that is calling concretely for

a reduction of tensions in the region

and we support the jcpoa and it's and

it's important goal of continuing to

keep Iran from developing

nuclear weapons we have a range of

sanctions on Iran we just had equipment

and you need frigates in the Persian

Gulf as part of our our engagement in

the region we're going to continue to

support our partner and says we strive

for open mobility in in the Persian Gulf

and a de-escalation of the of the

situation Prime Minister your party

campaigned on improving relations with

Iran in 2015 that's not happening as

Canadians well know one of our first

priorities in any situation is standing

up for Canadians who are in difficulty

around the world we have done that

consistently had a number of very strong

successes where we have engaged and got

the Canadians out of difficult

situations and there are a handful there

are a small number of consular cases in

Iran that we continue to be preoccupied

with Prime Minister the US presidents

reported to have disliked some of the

the conversations are the focuses of

some of the meetings he skipped the

climate change working session so how

concerned are you when the US takes over

the presidency next year that you know

conversations about gender and climate

will not be part of the defendant

I think the g7 is a really important

moment for us to come together and

discuss a range of important issues the

US and Canadian pressure on on this g7

ensured that there was a sick

we can focus on the global economy and

there are always ways that people who

come to the g7 can influence the topics

of conversation and the discussions that

are had but anytime you get you know a

number of significant global leaders

together to talk about the big issues

that the world is facing reverse of

where it is are we sitting in the chair

there are opportunities to highlight

concerns that Canadians have concerns

that people around the world haven't

show leadership on how we solve them so

I always look forward to opportunities

to get together with my counterparts and

promote the things that both have worked

in Canada but also challenge people to

move forward in the right direction on

global issues you seem pretty strategic

in the way that you presented yourself

at this summit

focusing on key campaign issues of yours

like the economy and climate so how much

were or were you playing more to a

domestic audience than an international

one with the election in mind when we

had the opportunity to host the g7 last

year in Charlevoix our focus was on the

global economy was on growth for the

middle class and indeed on climate and

oceans the year before that at the g7 we

brought forward strong issues around the

global economy and climate change these

are the issues that matter to Canadians

and indeed matter to people around the

world we will always highlight them in

our actions and in our in our

engagements the world depends on Canada

to be there to step up to be part of

shaping the solutions that are going to

matter we are tremendously fortunate in

Canada to have a strong voice on the

world stage

that both benefits other people around

the world and benefits Canadians by

ensuring that their preoccupations are

being responded to and create

opportunities I'm going to continue to

do that every opportunity I get to serve

and represent Canadians either at home

or on the world stage new Haqqanis okay
