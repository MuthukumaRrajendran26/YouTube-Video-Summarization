oh Jesus thank you very much it's my

great honor to have the very popular and

by the way great athlete one of the

greatest but very popular prime minister

of Pakistan

we have many things to discuss military

and terrorism and trade and I think

we're going to spend a lot of time

talking about trade because we do very

little trade with Pakistan compared to

what we could be doing and should be

doing what I've got to really get along

perfectly and I think we're having that

start we're going to have that start but

there's tremendous upside with respect

to trade one of the things we're going

to be discussing to is hostages

perhaps the polio vaccine because

Pakistan is one of the countries and

we'll talk about that has to you know

what your building is on that but we

have a situation in Pakistan where we

want to talk about the polio or the

possible polio vaccine and I think we

can have great meetings we're going to

be spending a long time together we have

our representatives meeting right after

we're finished and we just came out mr.

prime minister with tremendous economic

numbers for the United States the best

we've ever had we got the best economy

we've ever had and I think we can ship

some of that over to Pakistan we should

be doing tremendous business together so

I mean first to the US was keep going

for hours I will say that we have a very

good relationship with India I know that

your relationship is strained a little

bit maybe a lot but we will be talking

about India there a big part of our

conversation today and I think maybe if

we can help intercede and whatever we

have to do but I think it's something

that can be brought back together

and we'll also be talking about

Afghanistan we've reduced that number of

troops there by quite a bit we are

continuing to reduce troops in

Afghanistan while working with Pakistan

and others on getting an agreement

signed as you know and we'll see what

happens but we will be talking about in

and Afghanistan very much I know about

Huawei I know all about 5g and they were

working on it and we have companies that

are now getting very very strong in that

department we're gonna have 5g we're

gonna have the best 5g in the world just

like we have everything else our silicon

silicon valley cannot be competed with

there's nobody that can compete with

Silicon Valley for the brain power or

for what we do and nobody was focused on

5g but now they are now we have great

companies going into 5g even if they

don't want it to have a lot of them were

very happy doing what they were doing

but now they're going at my request they

going into 5g so we don't need we don't

need anything from our relationship with

North Korea's been very good we've

really established a good relationship

with kim jongwan I have personally

there's no rocket testing there's no

missile testing we're getting our

remains back we got our hostages back

and we have a very very good

relationship the two of us and that's

very important and what they're doing

will be

to the point well I think we're gonna

have a great evening today I know it's

an important meeting I consider this a

very important meeting because I think

we haven't

you

and million people I have plans on

Afghanistan that if I wanted to win that

war Afghanistan would be wiped off the

face of the earth it would be gone it

would be over in literally in ten days

and I don't want to do that I don't want

to go that route so we're working with

Pakistan and others to extricate

ourselves nor do we want to be policemen

because basically what policemen right

now

and we're not supposed to be policemen

we've been there we've been there for 19

years in Afghanistan it's ridiculous

and I think Pakistan helps us with that

because we don't want to stay as

policemen but if we wanted to we could

win that well I have a plan that would

win that war in a very short period of

time you understand that better than

anybody we've been in they're not

fighting to win just fighting - they're

building gas stations they're rebuilding

schools the United States we shouldn't

be doing that that's for them to do but

what we did and what our leadership got

us into is ridiculous but we will I

think we'll have some very good answers

on Afghanistan very quick

[Music]

we are going to we were saying 1.3

billion to Pakistan as a working up for

many years the problem was Pakistan this

is before you Pakistan was not doing

anything for us they were really I think

subversive they were going against us

and this is something will be tie ended

that about a year and a half ago the 1.3

billion dollars and I tell you what to

be honest I think we have a better

relationship with Pakistan right now

than we did when we were paying that

money but all of that can come back

depending on what would work out we're

working out things that are very

important we have avert this I consider

this very important we're working out

things that are very very important and

I think at the end of this at the end of

a very short time we're gonna have a

very great relationship with Pakistan

and we should it's a great country it's

a great they're great people I have many

friends from Pakistan living in New York

I have a lot of Pakistani friends I will

tell you that and they're great people

smart tough they are tough there's no

question about that

no I'm not gonna be watching probably

maybe I'll see a little bit of it I'm

not gonna be what watching Muller

because

you

suddenly gets this position but you know

what he's still ruled and I respect him

for it

he still ruled no coloration no

obstruction and this thing should have

ended a long time ago this has been

going on for two and a half years and

we're never going to allow this to

happen to another president again

because most stuff would be able to take

it on top of everything else we have the

strongest economy we were just

discussing this with the prime minister

we have the strongest economy that the

United States has ever had we have the

highest stock market yesterday literally

the highest stock market we've ever had

on Friday Thursday we've broken the

record I think 109 times our highest

stock market but on I believe Thursday

of last week we hit the all-time highest

in the history of our country our

country is doing phenomenally well

unemployment is the lowest in 51 years

soon to be the lowest in history if it

keeps going this way in a short period

of time black Hispanic Asian

unemployment the lowest and history

women the lowest in 72 years nobody has

ever done what we've done nobody's done

in two-and-a-half years what we've done

the biggest tax cuts in history the

biggest regulation cuts in history so

many things for health care we got rid

of the individual mandate which was the

worst part of Obamacare when it could

end up if we end up winning the house

back we keep the presidency we should

keep the Senate we should keep the

presidency I would think easy when you

have the strongest economy in the

history of our country and somebody's

going to run against that particular

president even though in this case it's

me in theory I have

so a lot of great things are happening

but the Democrats they don't want to

talk about that they want to stay off

the economy subject and what they're

doing is just hearing after hearing

after hearing it's nonsense

okay they tried an impeachment vote and

they got slaughtered last week they got

absolutely slaughtered it was the most

ridiculous idea we know they were going

to do it and I'll tell you just in

finishing I have a lot of respect for

the Democrats because most most of them

voted against impeachment last week and

I have a lot of respect for those

Democrats that did that because they're

doing the right thing for the country no

collusion no obstruction okay yeah we're

talking about it

secretary minuchin is talking about it

we're having very good talks with the

Speaker of the House with Nancy Pelosi

we're having very good talks with Chuck

Schumer and of course with Mitch

McConnell and Kevin

we are Kevin McCarthy we are I think

doing very well on debt if you look at

that limit however you want to define

that but we're doing very well on that

and I think we're doing pretty well on a

budget very important that we take care

of our military our military was

depleted and in the last two-and-a-half

years that we've under pleaded it okay

to put it mildly we have made it

stronger than ever before we need

another big year so we had 700 billion

we had then 716 billion and this year

we're going to be asking for a number

slightly larger than that we're putting

our military back into a shape that it's

never been in before new the best

missiles in the world the best equipment

in the world the best military equipment

of what we're building submarines the

finest nobody could even think about

competing with what we're building we're

building as you know new submarines we

have a new aircraft carrier coming

online so larger ship in the world it's

so large that maybe I could even learn

to plan

top of it okay then it's a big it's a

big one President Gerald Ford it's a

phenomenal it's a phenomenal ship so

what we're doing what we're doing is

incredible things for our country and I

might I might say this about the

military equipment it's all made in the

USA everything 100% it's all made in the

USA and you know it's one of the reasons

our job numbers probably is so good

lowest unemployment yeah son is a great

country so he will be definitely

extending your limitation so Pakistan

well I can't say that yeah because so

far he has not extended after today's

meeting maybe you won't but I have a

feeling he might guess I'd love to go to

[Music]

[Music]

yeah yeah we have already withdrawn

quite a few and we're doing it very

slowly very safely and we're working

with Pakistan and with as you know we're

negotiated with the Taliban and we are

doing I think very well in that regard

again it's something that we could do we

could go one of two ways we could do a

number the likes of which they've never

seen before and win it very quickly I

don't want to do that that's because

you're talking about millions of people

and I don't want to do that and we're

working with Pakistan and getting a

solution and I think I think it's being

worked very well

we've done what we were supposed to do

we've been there for 19 years and we've

acted as policemen not soldiers and

again if we wanted to be soldiers it

would be over in ten days one week to

ten days if we wanted to but I have not

chosen that wife why are we why would we

kill millions of people it wouldn't be

fair in terms of humanity it wouldn't be

fair so very well and I think if you go

all-out military there will be millions

and billions of people who died so there

is only one solution and I feel it's the

closest we came to a peace to you and we

hope that in the coming days we will be

able to purge this all about you speak

for the upon someone had come to a step

above what the Prime Minister did what

the Prime Minister just said is a very

big story and it's 100% true where we've

made a lot of progress over the last

couple of weeks and Pakistan has helped

us with that progress but a lot of great

things are happening a lot of things are

happening for the United States and I

think a lot of great things is gonna be

happening for Pakistan - under your

leadership thank you

I think Iran doesn't know where they are

I've been watching and reading a lot of

reports and right now they're a very

mixed up country they don't know whether

they're coming or going they have

tremendous problems economically their

country's in turmoil they're having

demonstrations all over Iran their

inflation rates at 75% they have a lot

of problems so whatever it is it is I'm

just gonna sit back and wait let's see

what happens but I will say they are

doing they are doing very poorly as a

country and we'll see what happens we

did actually because they said no and

you know it's a religious country or

religious leaders but they lie a lot we

did shoot down unfortunately we had to

shoot down a drone the drone came down

you know how it would how it came down

with a new technology that's actually

quite amazing but we took down one of

their drones instead of saying yeah that

happened they'd lie they say it didn't

happen so we have there's a lot of proof

it's called take a look at it in the

ocean floor just go down there and take

your scuba gear and go down there in the

open what do you would do that I know

but we took down a drone I think very

importantly I read a report today about

CIA that's totally a false story that's

another lie they put out propaganda they

put out lies I don't think Pakistan

would ever do anything like that

Pakistan never lies but Iran does

unfortunately so let's see what happens

with Iran we are ready for the absolute

worst and we're ready for sense too so

we are very geared up and if they they

are they are really the number one state

of terror in the world now I have to say

they pull back because they their money

is running very low the deal the

President Obama made was a disaster

because it was such a short term it

didn't cover ballistic missiles and they

couldn't see the important sites under

this you couldn't inspect the important

site so many things wrong and of course

they gave 150 billion dollars plus 1.8

billion in green green beautiful care

that's called many play modes appears I

think Pakistan would like to have some

of those things but they gave one point

eight billion dollars in cash which is

unthinkable and instead of being

respectful and thankful which brightly

they should have been to the United

States and to President Obama for making

that ridiculous deal instead of being

respectful they put their finger up in

the air and this finger the thumb they

put their finger up in the air and they

disrespected the United States you

shouldn't have done that that was a big

mistake

one of the best things I've done is

terminate that ridiculous here if they

want to make a deal it's it's frankly

it's getting harder for me to want to

make a deal with the run because they

behaved very badly they're saying bad

things and I'll tell you it could go

either way very easily very easily and

I'm okay either way it goes give me what

they didn't do in the world I don't

think Pakistan look I don't think

Pakistan respected the United States

I don't think Pakistan respected its

presidents and I think Pakistan could

have done a lot I think Pakistan can do

a tremendous amount against with respect

to Afghanistan they didn't do it and I

don't blame many things they were

dealing with the wrong president who

knows but I think Pakistan could have

done they're helping us a lot now I

think they could have helped us a lot in

the past but it doesn't matter we have a

new leader he's gonna be a great leader

of Pakistan and we have a new leader

here sort of knew him two and a half

years now getting to be three years can

you believe it you're gonna find time

flies

but no I think Pakistan could have done

a lot but they chose not to

that's because they did not respect us

leadership well I'll let you know that

very quickly I'll let you know I mean

I'm gonna know soon it's not gonna be

like a long term thing I I figured

things out very quickly

so the question was it's probably the

best question you've asked it Muller

Muller a mother she's been asking the

best question I have to focus on that

cuz that's a great question I think

Pakistan is going to do a lot I really

do

I think Pakistan is going to make a big

difference I think Pakistan will save

millions of lives in Afghanistan because

I really believe they can they have a

power that other nations don't have with

respect to Afghanistan and I will say as

of this moment they're working very hard

[Music]

[Music]

you know I know President you were

working on trade deals right now we'll

see what happens retha they're paying us

billions and billions of dollars of

tariffs which is fine with me but I know

that they're working I know that's a

very important situation for President

Xi and you know you could say what you

said but you could also say that he has

allowed that to go on for a long time

and you know it's been it's been

relatively I think it's been relatively

nonviolent

I don't think China stopped him the

China could stop them if they want and I

think I think that again I'm not

involved in it very much but I think

President Xi of China has acted

responsibly very responsibly they've

been out there protesting for a long

time I've never seen protests like it

will you have that many people it looks

like 2 million people there's a big

presence but I think the presidency I

hope that President Xi will

the right thing but it has been going on

a long time there's no question mr.

president good remarks about Pakistan

and said that part on can help lot to

end the violence in Afghanistan the

dialogue process and reconciliation

process

so what really Pakistan can do to bring

peace because you are also complained by

your deputy commander general Raja and

other security team so what solution

Pakistan what strategy paper you have to

push forward the peace and

reconciliation process in Afghanistan

and assurances to the u.s. yes what

number one this is the longest war

because anyone who knows the history of

Afghanistan you just have to look back

at the history there was always going to

be able to settlement at the end and I

have to compliment President Trump

because he has people to end the war who

have a have a settlement and that's

where I think Pakistan is playing a very

important role because Pakistan has a

1,500 mile border with you of Ariston

and all the areas where the trouble is

which is the suicide of what is that

okay so my talks with President Trump we

have a military leadership here because

this is obviously a security situation

and what we want is Understanding

between the two countries

I can show president Trump whatever we

will be saying will be the app we will

be straight with them they will rock

never be any question of any doubt on

Pakistan's intent because in apart from

of honest on the country that wants

peace and of honest and more than any

other countries Pakistan this is bigger

directly affected by it

and Pakistan needs stability we have had

15 years of fighting this war on terror

over 70,000 Pakistani casualties over

150 billion dollars lost to the economy

so we desperately want peace and I'm

happy

[Music]

[Music]

I will be asking President Trump he's

it's the most powerful country in the

world the United States it can play the

most important role and bring it peace

in the subcontinent you know they're

over are well over a billion and a

quarter people in the subcontinent they

are held hostage to the issue of fish

beef and I feel they're only the most

powerful state headed by President Trump

and can bring the two countries together

I might want I can tell you we have

tried our best

we made all over just to India to to

start dialogue dissolve our differences

through dialogue but unfortunately we

haven't made any ways as yet but I'm

hoping the president shop would know I

was with I was with Prime Minister Modi

two weeks ago and we talked about this

subject and he actually said would you

like to be a mediator or arbitrator as I

said we're so Cashman because this been

going on for many many years I was

surprised at how long I've been going

going 70 years I think they'd like to

see it resolved and I think you'd like

to see result that if I can help I would

love to be a mediator it should be I

mean it's impossible to move to

incredible countries that are very very

smart with very smart leadership can't

solve a problem like that but if you

would want me to mediate or arbitrate I

would be willing to do that right now

you will have the prayers of over a

billion people if you can mediate and

resolve its Asian shipping result so but

he asked me the same thing so I think

there's something so maybe we'll speak

to him where I'll speak to him and we'll

see if we can do so because I've heard

so much about Kashmir yeah it's such a

beautiful name it's supposed to be such

a beautiful part of the world but right

now there's just bombs all over the

everywhere you go you have bombs and

it's a it's a terrible situation been

going on for many years if I can do

anything to help that let me know let me

give you one thing on Afghanistan as an

example so a lot of you don't know this

but we dropped the largest non-nuclear

bomb ever built in history we dropped it

in Afghanistan we were getting ready to

make many of those bombs this left a

hole that was it took out a lot of big a

lot of the tunnels in the world but it

left a hole in the earth that look like

the moon look like a crater from the

moon still there it was nobody's ever

seen anything like it people heard it 15

miles away they said what was that it

shook the earth non-nuclear the largest

ever made by far and they were going to

make many of them and I said no I don't

want to drop that I don't want to do

that so many easy solutions that's

actually the easy solution and they'd

come in and they'd say let's have peace

but you don't have to do that I think

we're going to be very successful

without having to go that route and I

have tremendous confidence in the Prime

Minister Pakistan has one of the freest

presses of the world all you have to do

is sense I'd be the Prime Minister in

the last ten months I think the

criticism I have received from my own

press unprecedented all right so to say

that the curbs on Pakistan

wait a minute wait wait

uses with no way you're treated worse

than I can get it after speak because I

didn't hear your words freedom of the

press we will do that we will we're

talking about hostages we're talking

about hostages being held in various

places I've had very good luck with

ostriches with North Korea with many

places they've treated us with respect

and I appreciate it

made a big difference we have two or

three hostages that we're talking about

that's one of the gentlemen that we have

heard about and will be we will be

discussing that with many other subjects

yes well I think they're very bad for

our country I really think they must

hate our country I think the four

congressmen we're talking about the

Congresswomen what they've said about

Israel what they've said about an our

country when they talk about disgusting

people when they talk the way they talk

when the one mentioned that brown people

should speak for brown people and Muslim

people should speak for Muslim people

and you hear all this it's not what our

country is all about no I think they're

very bad for our country I think they're

very bad for the Democrat Party I think

you see that and they're pulling the

Democrats way left nobody knows how to

handle them I feel they're easy to

handle to me they're easy to handle

because they're just out there they're

very bad for our country absolute

no no Rachel no there's no racial

tension mister but I had my best numbers

recently and it's because of the economy

of what I've done feel of the afternoon

in America when you look at the African

Americans far doing better than they've

ever done in our country that we're

creating numbers look at the poverty

numbers look at so many different look

at the unemployment numbers the best

they've ever had now we have fantastic

relationships with the African American

community I think you'll see that see

that in he's gonna win and I think

what's gonna happen and I think that's

very true it's actually a very good

question the answer is yes I see great

trade with Pakistan and I'm not talking

about a little bit more I'm talking

about

we could go ten and even twenty times

ten is a big country it's actually a

very big country and they have

tremendous product they make great

products they make tremendous I bought

from Pakistan over the years when I was

in the private section they make

incredible product they're brilliant

people they're hardworking people I

think we're gonna have a fantastic trade

relationship I don't mean well increase

it by 20% I mean I think we can

quadruple it I think you could go I mean

literally it sounds great you could go

10 times more you could go 20 times

right because what we do right now is

that much and we should do a lot so I

think that's gonna be and I also do

agree that that has so much to do with

great peace having a great

trading relationship has so much to do

with peace and extremism in this case I

think it can have a so I expect that we

were within a very short period of time

start having very significant trade with

back we just have a very good

relationship and probably they would

like to meet and we'll see what happens

there was a little car spawned us

recently we're very positive cars

planets with North Korea again there's

new nuclear testing there's no missile

testing there's nothing I think when

they're ready when they're ready mr.

prime mr. Robbie will be discussing mr.

prime minister what are your specific

[Music]

[Music]

I think I can very well I'm a very good

relationship with Prime Minister Modi

and I think we're gonna have a

phenomenal relationship with the Prime

Minister of Pakistan I I do think that

it's a two-way street you know you say

India is coming in and destabilizing

Pakistan but India is saying that

Pakistan is coming in and destabilizing

so there's a lot of room right there

where we could meet I think we yeah the

question I'll put one person to each

step there

he's a terrible governor I think you

have an even worse mayor of San Juan

she's horrible

I think she's horrible I watched her my

people did nothing but complain about

her when we helped them with their

hurricane problem the mayor of San Juan

Puerto Rico is a horror show she's

incompetent grossly incompetent at the

same time the governor is not good so

the United States Congress you won't

believe that please close your ears

because this would be gave Puerto Rico

92 billion dollars last year for

hurricane relief now they haven't got

the money all of it but they've got a

lot of it but they're scheduled together

the Congress of the United States handed

him 92 billion dollars and that 92

billion dollars is in the hands of

incompetent people and very corrupt

people but the governor has done a

terrible job and the mayor of San Juan

has she's horrible I think she's just

terrible she's so bad for her people and

I think the government of the United

States have to be careful I'm the best

thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico

because we did a great job in Puerto

Rico they don't like to give me the

credit for it but we did a great job

have many Puerto Rican friends I have a

real understanding of Puerto Rico I've

had jobs in Puerto Rico I had I think

the most successful I owned the Miss

Universe contest of pageants and we had

them in Puerto Rico twice and I'll tear

we had tremendous successes in fact they

said literally a hundred

this never happens almost I think 100 a

hundred percent of the island itself was

watching they like those pageants I've

had a great relationship with Puerto

Rico I'm the best thing that ever

happened to Puerto Rico but Congress has

given them 92 billion dollars Pakistan

without some of their 92 not 1.3 because

Pakistan was getting 1.3 92 billion

dollars and the money is squandered and

wasted and stolen and I'll tell you what

the Senators and not happy about it and

Congress is not happy about it

because you really do you have

incompetent totally grossly incompetent

leadership at the top of Puerto Rico the

people of Puerto Rico are great and the

people of Puerto Rico like me and they

should because nobody's given them what

I give them but the leadership is

corrupt and incompetent thank you very

much
