returning to our panel Hal Anderson of

CJ OB Shannon Sanford political

scientist and also Jenny McCulloch who

ran as a municipal election and we're

looking at some of those numbers now and

Jenny do you think that the the numbers

that we're seeing for the NDP is really

an endorsement of Wahb canoe or the NDP

brand I have a very hard time believing

that there's any endorsement of Wahb

canoe but that's my personal feeling you

know I honestly believe that Brian

Pallister has done a good job of moving

the province in the right direction

anything that the voters of Manitoba

want to keep going in that direction and

they are looking for people to actually

bring a little transformation to the way

that we govern and the way that we

manage our province and the NDP's entire

campaign themes seem to be we want to go

back to the way it was and yet Shannon

it resonated with people clearly as well

as they're picking up I think said he's

being a little too hard on Wahb canoe

you know when it comes down to it I know

I know but when it comes down to it he

was pretty quick charismatic he did tell

the stories that he needed to tell he

won the leaders debate on television

hands down he did he didn't do what he

needed to do for the young voters and he

did do what he needed to do for the

Winnipeg voters and him resonators like

him they'd like him they just find him

very charismatic and for some reason

they'd like him

what canoe is very curious if compared

to our six-foot a premier that people

find scary you know I can see why people

would choose him he does come on yet

interesting that people didn't choose

him right the people chose Brian

Pallister

but there was no change in the air this

time around right last time it was like

we're gonna run these bums on it you

know and this time it was time you have

to understand I don't think anybody

showed up to vote this time it'll be

interesting to talk about the voter

turnout and your predictions Hal

Anderson we wrote them up on the board

at C Jo B yeah I wrote down a very sad

number in my estimation which is 48

percent

see where it it we will see where it

ends up but let's face it I mean yes the

NDP number is is getting bigger but why

is it getting bigger

the Tories tonight they've still won a

real nice majority it was you know

record numbers last time it's not

surprising that that number would come

down a little bit it's it will talk

about the tournament next time around or

as they say in the sports world a w as a

W is a W it's not a squeaker no no 34

it's a pretty big man that's round we're

talking about it as if as if the PC

Party Manitoba lost tonight well they

were re-elected with it with a strong

majority and a strong mandate to move

Manitoba forward as air signs say and
