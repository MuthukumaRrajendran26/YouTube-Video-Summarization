budgets forward to better care and

sooner forward to new schools for our

children and grandchildren forward to a

stronger economy for all of us and

forward to more affordability for

families with lower taxes and more money

right on the kitchen tables a Manitoba

thank you sorry in order I want to say

first of all thank you to all the

candidates all the supporters and to the

leaders of the other parties for making

democracy work for giving people choices

that's what democracy is all about

tonight they chose and those other

candidates for those other parties and

those other leaders deserve our thanks

and our congratulations for giving

people in Manitoba a chance to choose

I want to say a special thank you to our

whole campaign team and to David

McLaughlin and Tannis Drysdale for all

the work that they a whole team thank

you I want to say a very heartfelt

personal thank you to all of the

dedicated volunteers we are the

volunteer party thank you to all the

volunteers who worked on all our

campaigns right across the province and

I want to say a special thank you as

well to the best-laid of candidates that

ever was presented to the people of the

province of Manitoba all the PC

candidates and their families thank you

for your dedication and if you'll permit

me I also want to say thank you to our

family to my family to Esther's family

for their support for their love for

their advice and counsel and to our good

friends who have stood by us through

thick and thin when we were not as good

of friends as we should have been

because this job is consuming and I

thank them and I thank them from the

bottom of my heart and I thank all the

friends across Manitoba of our MLAs who

will serve the people of Manitoba with

diligence and dignity and grace thank

you for your support and your love and

your kindness thank you so much

if you'd allow me I want to reflect for

a moment on 27 years ago when we had a

one-year-old who's not one anymore and

we decided to get into politics because

our town was dying and we accepted a

challenge that many others have as well

of getting into public life and Esther

and I became empty nesters this January

and I don't like it but she did all the

work so she's fine with it but this is

the first campaign in my political time

of service that I've been able to

campaign alongside my wife Esther and I

want to say I thank God for Esther and I

thank Esther but you all know and

Manitobans recognize that we inherited a

mass of responsibility some would call

it a mess but like the Manitoba bison

that is in our logo and that inspires us

we are accepting of those challenges the

Manitoba bison unlike most species when

faced with a challenge always turns and

faces toward it and we did that and

we've done that and we've done it with

focus we face our challenges together

Manitobans do that and today and tonight

they said they appreciated the fact that

we fixed the finances and we're

repairing the services and we're

rebuilding economy

there is absolutely no doubt that

Manitoba is now Canada's most improved

province

we are the Keystone province we are the

center of Canada we are no longer

Canada's best kept secret and next year

when we unite to celebrate our 150th

birthday our 150th birthday in the most

beautiful and blessed country on the

face of the earth are Canada we will

come together next year and we will come

together to honor our past but I assure

you ladies and gentlemen that we will

also come together to celebrate the

future of Manitoba Manitobans worked

with us all hands on deck Manitobans

have repaired Manitoba's foundation and

now Manitobans and we will join with

them in this will rededicate themselves

as we will rededicate ourselves to

building on that renewed and

strengthened foundation to build the

Manitoba of our dreams to build the home

of hope right here in Manitoba to build

the place where truly Canada's heart

beats Manitoba United never backward

like the Manitoba bison always forward

the sky used to be dark but the clouds

will lift

perhaps not tomorrow or the day after

but they will lift and there will be a

new day and it will be a brighter day

and it will be under a blue sky and I

say to you because of your dedication

and because of the values that

Manitobans demonstrated today in

choosing forward the only thing better

than today in Manitoba is going to be

tomorrow

[Applause]
