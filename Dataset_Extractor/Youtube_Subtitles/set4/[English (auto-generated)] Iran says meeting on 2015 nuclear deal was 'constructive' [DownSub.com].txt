the boat size as I said had complaint

complains about each other we raised

this today

I think the atmosphere was constructive

and the discussions were good I cannot

say that we resolved everything but I

saw I can say that there are lots of

commitments to the jcpoa and its

survival all remaining participants to

the jcpoa are still committed and you

know determined to save this deal which

is a big achievement of diplomacy in the

recent years and we will continue our

efforts in that direction we had a

regular Joint Commission only a month

ago but in the past one month we have

had several developments regarding the

implementation of the jcpoa some of them

was regarding you know Iran's you know

reduction of commitments which reported

by the by the IAEA and also we had some

complaints about you know proper

implementation of commitments by the

other side I mean the Europeans in

particular we also discussed to have the

ministerial meeting Jay Z prime

ministerial meeting it would take place

soon that time is not you know fixed yet

but we decided to go for a ministerial

meeting with with you know which could

be successful with an tangible outcome

and for that we should we need more

preparations today we also did some

preparatory work and we continued to do

that

so when our ministers meet we can expect

a successful meeting and a good outcome

we also decided to go for expert

meetings on different areas to find

practical solutions for Iran to enjoy

its benefits

of sanctions lifting well there were

some tense moments but on the whole the

atmosphere was very good friendly and I

was a very professional of course I

think it is natural that he three the

the Iranians to come back to full

compliance and then the Iranian side

urged the the EU and the III to

implement their part of the deal and

then of course it is understandable that

there are some tense moments around

these issues first that all sides have

expressed their commitment to safeguard

the jcpoa and to continue to implement

the jcpoa in an effective manner and the

balanced manner and second point i take

away from this meeting is that all sides

have expressed their strong opposition

against the u.s. unilateral imposition

of sanctions especially the

extraterritorial application of these

sanctions and they have also expressed

support and appreciation for China's

efforts to implement the jcpoa in

particular in China's efforts to

maintain normal trade and oil relations

with Iran thank you
