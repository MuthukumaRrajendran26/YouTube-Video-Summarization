I swear on storm watch tonight on the

ground in Florida as Hurricane durian

barrels towards the US Coast right now

durian is in the West Atlantic

strengthening into a category 4 the

monster storm is on a collision course

with the Bahamas which is expected to

take a direct hit it could then turn

towards the US mainland on Monday or as

late as Tuesday weather models show the

storm is shifting but still tracking

towards the southeastern US where its

winds are expected to batter Florida a

special team from the US Weather Service

flew into Dorian's eye today as the

Hurricanes path shifted direction but

people in Florida aren't taking any

chances and that's where our Jackson

Prosecco begins our coverage tonight in

Daytona Beach Jackson there's so much

uncertainty surrounding Dorian's path

but it's a frenzy in Florida right now

it really is calling for some people

today was a chance for a last surf for a

swim before the weather takes a turn

many others though spent another

consecutive day preparing because quite

simply put they don't know what's coming

they don't know how bad it will be if it

will make landfall and where that might

be and so they're not taking any chances

on one of the busiest weekend's of the

year Cocoa Beach is nearly deserted with

tourists scared off by the pending

arrival of Hurricane durian those who

did stick around have been ordered to

leave by Sunday gotta have tourists and

make this town run basically you know we

got the port right there

the pier here downtown Cocoa Beach is

world-famous and it's all empty right

now empty as can be

locals are left to soak up the last of

the surf and Sun not knowing how long it

will last

I think everybody's kind of scared of

the hurricane and it pushed them away so

it's pretty nice out up and down the

east coast of Florida it's now a waiting

game with Dorian's timing and path

completely uncertain but potentially

devastating hope it's are going to be a

missed it's hard to tell look at the

track of it they don't really know but

better be cautious is sorry even with

the storm shifting East its size and

ferocity are still threats waiting for

Dorian means continuing to get ready for

every scenario including the worst there

is still significant chance of a strike

on the state of Florida if you look at

that cone anyone inside that cone needs

to be prepared nASA has moved its giant

mobile launch platform indoors while

ordering most employees to evacuate Cape

Canaveral fuel shortages remain a major

problem up and down the state in some

areas nearly half of all gas stations

have run dry I would say half we ready

we still got a board one of the windows

but we gotta generate it together we got

some water we have some essentials even

if they're prepared residents still face

a bigger question what to do if the

order comes to get out of Dorian's way

immediately this one's looking like it's

staying off the coast for the most part

I think I'd go you know there's no point

taking a chance when you know if

something happened to you know would

come get you I guess

and it seems like many people are simply

making their plans day-to-day at this

point here on the Outer Banks we're told

an evacuation order could come as early

as tomorrow perhaps on Monday at which

point everyone will have to leave well

in other places where those evacuation

orders were planned they've now been

rescinded
