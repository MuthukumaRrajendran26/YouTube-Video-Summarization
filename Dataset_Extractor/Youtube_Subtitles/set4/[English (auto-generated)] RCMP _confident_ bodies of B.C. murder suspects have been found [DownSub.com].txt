this morning at approximately 10 a.m.

RCMP officers located two male bodies in

the dense brush within one kilometer

from where the items were found this is

approximately eight kilometers from

where the burnt vehicle was located at

this time we believe these are the

bodies of the two suspects wanted in

connection with the homicides in British

Columbia an autopsy is being scheduled

in Winnipeg to confirm their identities

and to determine their cause of death to

the families of everyone affected by the

series of events over the last few weeks

I know it has been so very difficult and

I hope today's announcement can begin to

bring some closure I want to thank the

communities and the leadership of

gilliam Fox Lake Cree Nation Ilford War

Lake First Nation and York Landing your

lives have been disrupted many of you

lived with uncertainty and fear but

throughout you were resilient you came

together as communities and you helped

our officers get the job done to the

officers involved in the search I

commend you for your determination your

innovation for never giving up and for

working night and day to bring this

search to a conclusion this was a search

that could not have been successfully

achieved without the help from our

partners and Canadian Armed Forces I'm

confident that it is them but there to

identify them officially and and caught

you know to to be sure we have to go to

autopsy I don't have an answer for that

it's a very dense place it's a difficult

place to find anybody as I said earlier

very tough terrain lots of lots of land

as well it's it's a huge area that we're

looking at it's it's very hard to

pinpoint anything in such a dense

terrain yes it was which are specialized

our CIP resources were in the area and

they were doing a foot search

I'm afraid I can't speak to that right

now it's very very dense brush is what I

can tell you very thick very difficult

to work your way through there's no

trails it's it's just very thick brush

very dense and it's a huge area we were

searching before we didn't have any

information to pinpoint us to a specific

search area where we could do a much

more detailed search the items we did

find on the shoreline gave us that

opportunity to pinpoint that search and

therefore do a much more detailed search

of the area I can't speak to that right

now I'm sorry

you'd have to talk to my colleagues in

British Columbia they're investigating

the homicides themselves I don't have

any information of those I'm afraid not
