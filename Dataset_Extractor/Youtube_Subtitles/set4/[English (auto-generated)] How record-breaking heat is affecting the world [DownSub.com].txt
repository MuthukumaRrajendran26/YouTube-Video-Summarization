record-breaking heat appears to be the

new norm June of 2019 was the hottest

June ever experienced around the world

the average temperature worldwide was

higher than what we've seen in the last

hundred and 40 years since the agency

started keeping records and nine of the

ten hottest June's ever experienced have

all happened between 2010 and now it

should be a wake-up call that we can see

what's happening now with climate change

and it should be telling us that we need

to act dramatically rapidly quickly and

viciously to do whatever we can to limit

the impacts of climate change to stop

this from getting worse the first half

of 2019 has been the second hottest year

to date and we're now seeing more and

more direct consequences a heat wave in

North Korean the last few years has led

to rice maize and other crops withering

in the fields record-breaking heat and

lack of rain has loved fields dry and

affecting the irrigation systems North

Korea has seen food shortfalls of about

1.4 million tons in 2019 leading people

to rationing food supplies starvation

malnutrition and even deaths in

particular you know sustenance farmers

who've been relying upon the land

relying upon a stable climate are

impacted the most dramatically but also

large food supplies in in major

countries they're also being impacted as

well by the year 2030 it's being

predicted that climate change will lead

to about 250,000 deaths per year from

malnutrition malaria diarrhea and heat

stress around the world in France

farmers have been asked to stop

harvesting after hundreds of hectares of

fields caught fire in July due to

intense heat and South Africa is

expecting to harvest 20% less maize in

2019 compared to previous seasons

because of heat and droughts caused by

climate change our understanding is that

in the forthcoming so-called the lean

season in southern Africa which is the

lean season is the period between

harvest ie when the availability of food

from the previous harvest has run down

but before the next harvest kicks in in

southern Africa were going to have more

than 40 million people who are going to

be extremely food in

Cure in that window Brooke says the

rising temperature trends that are being

seen around the globe is a symptom of a

larger climate change issue I hope that

we can now accept that that that climate

change is happening we don't need to

spend more time studying whether it's

happening how you know what we need to

do is start to talk about about action

Brooks and Burke both feel that action

from the government will help reverse

the damage brought on by climate change

as a global community
