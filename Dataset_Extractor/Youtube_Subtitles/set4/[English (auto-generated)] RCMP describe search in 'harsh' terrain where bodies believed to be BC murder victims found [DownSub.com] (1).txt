how did how did it go there well some

difficult terrain but we had our search

team with six officers deployed in two

locations today focusing on where the

burned vehicle was located and where we

discovered the bodies and we conducted

some thorough searches around those

locations yeah well we split into two

teams and one team was focusing on where

the bodies were located and another was

focused on where we found some property

days prior did you find anything new

today as far as evidence goes we found a

item whether or not it's relevant to the

investigation the investigators will

look at it and determine if it's if

there's a relevance so one item in the

one location yes we have another area to

go search yet from here oh you're hiding

yes we've completed the search along the

river in this area and now we're going

to be traveling to another site to

conduct another search okay not by boat

no this one we can drive to this is

actually the site we're going to now is

where the vehicle was located gotcha

okay so area around where body was found

one item was spotted and now you were

headed to the location where the yeah

that's correct no the idea is just to

see if there's anything that might have

been missed on the initial search and to

be more thorough and see if we can kind

of wrap this up

any no it's just like saying it's

related to the investigation and it may

may be involved in or may not be for our

search team this is our first the

preliminary search would have been with

ground crews at the time this crew we

have in now that I'm a part of search

and rescue is more more trained on

either searching for people or in this

case evidence searching which is what

we're focused on today so is this just

standard protocol or is it because this

is such a high-profile case you came out

to know this is in a lot of homicide

investigations in this province and

I would imagine in every division this

is what you'll do is you'll send your

search team to basically calm the area

even tighter to see if you missed

anything it would have been 2 or 3 hours

these locations coming up yeah depending

on the time frame yeah we've probably

need a couple hours to conduct a

thorough search now have you been to

that where the bodies were found

I've heard a lot about it I've seen the

area around it I haven't been able to

access that because it's difficult to

reach what's it like seeing the terrain

firsthand it's it's always been

described over the past couple weeks as

dense rugged that almost doesn't

describe it it is even more difficult

than I would have imagined the

riverbanks and a lot of these locations

can be anywhere 60 80 100 feet high with

slopes right to the water the currents

is extremely fast-moving as soon as you

kind of get walk into the bush the bugs

that are all over you so like they're

not kidding when they say this is harsh

terrain it's it's really it's difficult

to describe it based on locations like I

say that they were on the run and

there's the spot where they ended up

it's like you say they kept moving and

this is where they stopped and like I

said is the terrain they were in I guess

they just decided like this is as far as

it's going to go and like I say it's -

even to reach that spot is it's

difficult to walking and yeah any idea

how they may have died like what it

appears from well those results that's

what we're waiting for confirmations

from the autopsies which I imagine I

believe was carried out after yesterday

or this morning and then those results

will be made

provided to our colleagues in BC and who

I believe will be providing then that

information next week so the autopsy is

done my nurse and they've been completed

at this time and so BC will be getting

it next week for sure whether or not the

public gets the results is another story

yeah it's the they'll make that

determination whether they want to share

that information with the public yeah

the issue to like say a lot of times if

we had been searching this I would say

last week at this time we would have had

escorts providing basically a cover

while we do our work so we don't want to

be potential targets considering how

we're dressed for a search and rescue

team is the idea is to be visible well

we don't want to be visible to perhaps

suspects who may be armed so the idea

now is these subjects were recovered and

now it's we believe the area to be more

secure to conduct proper searching what

what other information can we find out

from the autopsy so obviously the cause

of death

what any can anything else significant

come out of this autopsy for police well

you know important for us is confirming

identities and determining cause of

death is determining you know is that

homicide is it self-inflicted those are

all pieces the pathologists are experts

on and they can provide that information

for investigators that might be

difficult to ascertain a motive it's

just the ideas you know you want to be

able to link people to certain property

can we link someone to a crime can we

find their trail you know these people

make movies that they make leave notes

something information might come from

somewheres from some sorts they may have

talked to someone prior to them leaving

like I say there's still a lot of people

we probably need to speak to a lot of

pieces to put together that's when you

put it all up together so wait a minute

this could be an idea it's like saying

we can't prove all these ideas is just

trying to put everything on paper and

just to see what's the picture that it

paints for us
