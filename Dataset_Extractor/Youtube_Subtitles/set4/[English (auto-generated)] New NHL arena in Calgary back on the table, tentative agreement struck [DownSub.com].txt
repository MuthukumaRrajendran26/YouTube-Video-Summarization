and please though however that we're all

here today today to announce that after

14 months of discussion the City of

Calgary Calgary sport entertainment

corporation and the Calgary Stampede

have agreed to fundamental terms and

conditions that would allow for the

development and construction of a new

sports and entertainment event center

outdoor festival space and enhancements

to Stampede Park the estimated cost of

the up to 19,000 seat facility is five

hundred and fifty million dollars which

will be shared 5050 between the city and

Calgary sport and entertainment

corporation the city will own 100% of

the Events Centre the land it sits on as

well as the surrounding lands Calgary

sport an entertainment corporation will

bear 100 percent of the operating

maintenance and repair costs for the

period of the thirty five year agreement

and their extension clauses as well that

can be exercised to continue that

arrangement beyond 35 years finally the

city will generate a return on

investment through a number of

mechanisms namely a facility fee

percentage of naming rights and the

creation of property tax uplift in the

rivers district this deal makes sense on

its own merits and while there are other

opportunities here that I think can give

us only upside it was important to me

and important to members of council that

this deal made sense on its merits so

you see that the City of Calgary will

receive a facility fee on every ticket

sold to every event for 35 years the

city will receive a share of naming

rights CSEC will invest even more than

they do now in amateur sports and

community here in the city the city owns

the building in the land it comes with a

permanent year-round community gathering

space and there will be community use

for the facility for events throughout

the year
