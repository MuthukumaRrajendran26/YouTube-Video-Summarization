it in so many corners of our country and

now here among us you know there are a

lot of great communities in our country

but there's nothing microfossil

[Music]

cuando pasa

Esther's closest moussa this is escucha

mos los que dicen oh no Stefan esta

hablando acerca de la nación de nuevo

third they're just talking about prayer

why are they talking about prayer

what does prayer do it heals it changes

us it saves us I think that those who

bet raise those questions they don't

know prayer knowing theanine la acción

no intendent aqui estamos a-- uh Randall

I'd like to point out very quickly just

to misunderstandings that they have

about prayer two mistakes we're not

going to make first of all there are

those who never got beyond their

childish notion of prayer as being

something in which we address some genie

in the bottle when haenyeo en la botella

no alguien que podemos controller see as

I own do we control our law play dis

Mandar lo sé lo que queremos we think

that we should be able to raise God and

get them to do our will when in fact

what prayer is about is entrusting

ourselves to his will to trusting him to

knowing that our good God understands

what we cannot begin to explain

and our good God is capable of bringing

good even out of evil on cuando parece

impossible Elsinore para hacer algo

bueno and many other do not apparent

eight the rota él puede Canara and

21-year and we're in Moscow the fuerza

de la mora the second thing that they

and they must understand is that they

think prayer is an escape prayer is is

just separating ourselves from the

difficult realities of this life they

don't get it at all when we people of

faith pray we know

you

first of our life the very source of our

hope the one who loves us and cares for

us and brings life even out of death

este es lo que pasa innovation and

promise in the in mayor de la realidad

and promise in la razón para nuestra

speranza cuando no pen tenemos el poder

como Manos podemos descubrir alguien que

tiene pelea para cambiar el mundo y creo

mundo de Paz y justicia y amor eso es lo

que pasa quandaries ammos we when we

pray we don't seek to change God we know

that God will change us and make us a

better and more loving community

hermanos por eso

estamos aqui esta noche talking necesito

mas

el Senor ness Adamo supras NC a--

necesitamos suicide Bastian we need his

help we need his saving grace we need

him to enter into the midst of lives

that are broken and to bring healing and

hope and trust that life is much more

than this moment that life and life

eternal is his gift and no person of

hate no act of evil will bring us down

no act of violence will keep us from the

life that God has chosen to give us and

will give us forever

[Applause]

oh man hermanos tenemos mucho que

quieran compartir con nosotros esta esta

tarde I should finish and let them speak

let's open our hearts let's pray

together and see what God will do in our

lives and in our community and in the

lives of all of those who tonight are

I'd like to bring up here Bishop Michael

Buerkle hung from a physical as

Episcopal Diocese of the Rio Grande

[Applause]

buenos tardes a todos I bring you

greetings from the Episcopal Church

throughout the world and it is my joy to

serve as the Bishop of the Diocese of

the Rio Grande which includes the

beautiful city of El Paso the Big Bend

region and the entire state of Nuevo

Mexico and tonight tonight we are in

mourning we are grieving the loss of

those who died yesterday afternoon and

we are all so frightened about the

attack that took place on this community

we are grieving tonight and it is a

grief that is beyond all language it is

a grief that knows no nationality it is

a grief that knows no political party it

is a grief that knows no religious

denomination it is a human grief it is

the grief of God that the creator of the

universe who cries out in anguish who

cries out for justice who cries out that

love might be stronger than death we are

grieving tonight as we pray together

but even as we grieve we are not without

hope of Paso we are not without hope

because look this is what the kingdom of

God looks like we are not without hope

El Paso because between these mountains

for centuries this place has been about

neighborly love this river has been a

place of coming together this place is a

place where neighbors love one another

so tonight we are not without hope

because we know something about

neighborliness and we know something

about love that is bigger than the

barriers that human beings create we

know something about a love that is

greater than any kind of hatred a love

that is stronger than death and so El

Paso let us bear witness tonight to our

children that they don't have to be

afraid let us bear witness to our

children tonight that love and community

looks like this night and let us bear

witness not just to our children but let

us bear witness to the nation that is

with us in prayer tonight let us bear

witness to the world that is confused

about the violence in this country let

us bear witness

let us show the world how paso in the

days ahead in the months ahead

let us show them why we love this place

let us show them why we love our

neighbors on both sides of this river

let us bear witness to the love that is

stronger than death let us not lose hope

let us remember that you are what the

kingdom of God looks like and let us

walk in love my brothers and sisters and

all of my siblings I'm speaking of

children there are so many children here

I think this is a good opportunity when

you go home tonight after this beautiful

beautiful service is to talk to your

kids at any age appropriate to talk to

these kids right behind me and have that

conversation that there is Abel but we

will overcome yes I want to hear those

kids yes

no I said the kids not the adults 1 2 3

yes or no yes those young little voices

those young little voices because they

are the ones you know as adults we can

overcome a lot of things but they will

need a lot of help from all of us of all

adults with our faith in with our wisdom

cuando estés Avenue da y nuestro los

buenos consejos para nuestros hijos para

que ellos pueden super r esta tremendo
