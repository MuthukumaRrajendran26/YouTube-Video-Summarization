creamy sweet smooth gelato versus ice

cream what's the difference we ask the

important questions in life

this is gelato and this is ice cream

gelato am I right or am i right

they really taste the same to me yeah

ice cream gelato I'm good I said yeah

thank you thank you

am i correct yeah I failed I failed with

a blindfold the difference between

gelato and ice cream isn't always so

easy to understand gelato first of all

gelato means frozen it's a very simple

word boo Chanti is from Rome he's been

making gelato for 25 years the fact that

there's a lot of fat it makes it more

hard the ice cream you can scoop the ice

cream the same whether you will scoop

the gelato because the gelada is a

little more a noble way of making the

dessert you know in general gelato has

less fat than most ice cream ice cream

is made of milk cream sugar and egg

yolks it is churned at a high speed to

ensure air traps and increases in volume

gelato on the other hand uses more milk

than ice cream and typically uses fewer

egg yolks if any the difference is

gelato is turned at a much slower pace

keeping it dense and is served at a

slightly warmer temperature than ice

cream

ice cream is best served at about minus

12 degrees Celsius if gelato were served

at that temperature it would be way too

hard it is believed that modern gelato

as we know it today was invented by

Fernando Montiel NT an architect from

Florence he was asked by the Medici

family in the late 1500s to prepare an

awe-inspiring feast for the visiting

king of Spain his creation a sweet treat

made with milk cream and eggs the cold

cream flavor with Bergamo and orange

became known as gelato buon appetito
