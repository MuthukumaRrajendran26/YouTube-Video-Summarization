Boris Johnson has made a bold move in

his bricks at bid the British Prime

Minister went straight to the top to the

Queen to suspend Parliament for a month

and that's strategic because it will

block the opposition so he can forge

ahead with his brexit plans this is one

of the most crucial times in the UK's

history Johnson has promised to take the

country out of the EU by the end of

October with or without a brexit deal

his opponents say he's depriving them of

their democratic voices on this

momentous decision if MPs don't come

together next week to stop Boris Johnson

in his tracks then I think today will go

down in history as the d UK democracy

died but as Redman Shannon reports

Johnson insists it's proper procedure

brexit is a political crisis like no

other and yet again it has British

politicians grasping for hyperbole this

is simply outrageous from the Prime

Minister this is a constitutional

outrage it is a constitutional outrage

is not democracy it's dictatorship a day

after opposition parties banded together

to stop a No Deal brexit Prime Minister

Boris Johnson hit back he got permission

from the Queen to suspend or prorogue

Parliament for one month in

mid-september

we've got to be bringing forward new and

important bills and that's why we are

going to have a Queen's speech and we're

gonna do it on October the 14th a short

suspension is normal before a Queen's

speech at the start of a new session of

Parliament but not one that's a month

long Johnson denies he's doing it to

stop the opposition from blocking and No

Deal brexit on october 31st that is

completely untrue if you look at what

we're doing we're bringing forward a new

legislative program but the normally

nonpartisan Speaker John Bercow says

however it is dressed up it is

blindingly obvious that the purpose of

the propagation now would be to stop

Parliament debating brexit the first

thing we'll do is attempt legislation to

prevent what he's doing and secondly

we'll challenge

him her motion of confidence at some

point the problem for the opposition is

that if it succeeds Johnson could

demonize them ahead of a potential

election perhaps finesse it to his

advantage make it into a a will of the

people have been frustrated by this

institution here there is also the

possibility of a judicial challenge

against Johnson's move unmoved thousands

of anti brexit protesters in London are

calling a coup as the clock runs down

toward October 31st MP's returned from

their summer break next Tuesday Robin

they then have those opposition MPs four

to seven working days to fight against

that

No Deal brexit when they return after

the suspension and the Queen's speech

they will then have ten more working

days until that October 31st brexit

deadline Redman what's the potential

political fallout from this well we're

hearing reports today that the leader of

the Scottish Conservatives Robin is

considering quitting her role and that

is partly because her of her concerns

about and No Deal brexit now her

spokesperson today said that this is not

connected to what happened today but the

timing is very interesting and it is

worth remembering Robin that the EU and

the UK could still strike a brexit deal

between now and October 31st but it

seems very unlikely
