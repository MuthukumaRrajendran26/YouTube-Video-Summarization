hurricane durian has now hit the United

States making landfall over Cape

Hatteras on the Outer Banks of North

Carolina as a category 1 hurricane

Dorian barreled ashore just before 9

a.m. local time bringing fierce winds

heavy rain and severe flooding one of

the worst hit areas appears to be the

island of ocracoke people there

reportedly raced to their attics as a

dangerous storm surge flooded in

hundreds of people are now believed to

be trapped authorities say they're doing

all they can to get to them in the

Bahamas there is still a desperate need

for help the official death toll there

from hurricane Dorian is still 30 but

hundreds possibly thousands of people

are still missing and government

officials warned the final death toll

will be staggering as Mike Jarle reports

those who survive now find themselves in

the midst of an unfolding humanitarian

crisis the Nixon family has been doing

this a lot the spontaneous hugs

reminding them of what they could have

lost we watched our house that swept

away by the tide

and that tide beat the place we were

staying and beat the door down the wind

and the waves pushed them in different

directions they lost sight of each other

and then somehow found each other again

that's that's a major miracle I'm a

pastor that's a major miracle I believe

in God III the same my faith went to

another level everybody we encountered

has a similar story of survival of

losing everything but the lucky ones

happy they held on to what mattered most

my three kids my wife we had to get to

safety the list of missing is massive

but the government warning Bohemians to

prepare for unimaginable information

about a death toll that could rise into

the thousands but there's no way of

knowing how many for sure as evidenced

by the fact Elijah hecho is still here

his phone had lost power before the

hurricane hit eight days later when he

got power he found out he'd been put on

the list of those missing likely dead

so over like 500 messages see some

resumes and their 1000 messages the UN

says some 70,000 who were lucky to

survive could suffer greatly they don't

get food water and medicine immediately

for days Canadian aid agency global

medic has been getting ready to move in

with their own water treatment systems

fresh water will make a difference even

more so for former NHL or Andre de veau

a native Bahamian who lost contact with

his father on Saturday only to hear from

him finally on Thursday night it's been

a load off me for sure the first few

days I was pretty tense and it was

getting pretty frustrated not you know

what do you what do you mean we're not

going right now what do you mean we're

gonna have to wait now they were able to

get a small team in there today they

brought a couple of systems with them

and they're gonna get right to work

getting fresh water to the people that

need it they're also gathering a lot of

resources in Toronto at a bunch of

donation centers and as soon as those

are full they're gonna ship them down

here

but even that poses a problem because

we're at the airport right now it comes

gonna kind of come it's gonna come in

here we have to get it then to the

islands to the north and that's a real

problem because the government's been

heavily criticized for putting a little

too much red tape on things and not

allowing pilots to fly one we've heard

is actually flew in got so fed up he

flew in by himself

any of getting a citation from the

government Donna Mike what are you

hearing about what might be the true

scope of the death toll there what are

people telling you they've seen well

what they are seeing is a lot of death a

lot of suffering we've heard people

talking about parents having to choose

between holding one child and the other

there's the human toll on these people

even if they didn't lose somebody

personally what they've seen is going to

stay with them for the rest of their

lives also the government is ordering

more morticians and body bags in because

the morgues on those islands are full

and the problem with that is that there

are far too many bodies in the street in

the rubble and floating in the bay and

floating in the ocean for them to deal

with all at once it's quite the scene
