well we're seeing some really really

devastating images out of the Bahamas

please keep them in your prayers they

were hit with a hurricane with one

hundred and 85 mile-per-hour winds and

we've in Florida's history have seen

exactly one hurricane make landfall at

185 miles per hour the Labor Day

hurricane in 1935 and so they are in a

really precarious situation

this storm is slowing down it's likely

to continue to administer really

significant punishment over the next day

as a five o'clock the storm was about a

hundred and seventy five miles east of

Palm Beach and moving to the west at

five miles per hour we are continuing to

make all necessary precautions and

urging people out in the state of

Florida to to make their preparations

heat evacuation orders now this storm

has tracked further West slightly but

still further west than we had hoped I

mean we were hoped that it would air on

the eastern side of that track it's it's

aired a little bit closer to the Florida

coast the storm has slowed down but we

do need it to slow down just a little

bit more to ensure when it turns north

that it's not impacting directly the

Florida coast and we cannot say that

that is not a possibility

and so I think it's important that we

prepare for this to potentially make

landfall here

I held a conference call with members of

the Florida Legislature with all the

County Emergency Management directors

the good news is we've worked great with

the counties we're all working together

my wife the first lady put out a public

service announcement this afternoon with

with important message for people to

listen to their local authorities and

have an evacuation plan ready if you are

ordered to evacuate you know safety

comes first and you don't want to mess

with the storm that is going at 185

miles per hour and her PSA is posted on

social media so we now have seen a

significant increase in watches and

warnings a hurricane warning is in

effect for Palm Beach Martin st. Lucie

Indian River and Brevard

counties and a storm surge warning is in

effect for those counties a hurricane

watch is in effect for Volusia County

and so as a storm surge watch now there

will absolutely be additional hurricane

warnings and watches all the way up to

the Georgia border on the east coast of

Florida so you can you can pretty much

set your clock to that and you can see

tropical storm force winds arriving on

Florida's Treasure Coast as early as

late tonight and of course you have

storm surge in places like Jupiter Inlet

forecast to be between 4 & 7 feet

there's a number of evacuation orders

that have been issued Volusia County

Indian River County Duval County Nassau

County and st. Johns County they've all

issued new orders today

and of course Mountain Martin Palm Beach

Brevard st. Lucie had issued orders

already we've also have a number of

counties that have issued voluntary

evacuation orders Osceola glades Hendry

Okeechobee hyland if you are in an area

that has flooded in prior hurricanes and

you're given a voluntary evacuation

order you really need to seriously

consider heating that and in evacuating

you know when the water gets high

there's not a whole lot you can do about

that and given the uncertainty of the

storm it's better to err on the side of

safety the Coast Guard is beginning to

lock down some movable bridges to marine

traffic but to be clear these bridges

are still open to motorists and of

course if there's any changes to that

you know we're gonna we'll announce that

Palm Beach International will cease all

commercial air service beginning

tomorrow and Orlando Orlando Melbourne

International plans to close on Monday

evening we're monitoring every road in

the state FDOT

and the traffic has not been abnormal in

fact I think the non hurricane related

traffic it's probably been less than we

would typically have on a Labor Day

weekend and we obviously will make

accommodations to make sure that those

subject to evacuation orders are able to

to evacuate as efficiently as possible

by tonight the Florida National Guard

will have 4,500 soldiers and airmen

activated and ready to respond they have

15 rotor-wing helicopters available an

additional 24 been offered from regional

National Guard locations and the active

army component has pre-positioned 40

additional helicopters near our state

border to respond if needed and so you

know we are taking this storm and the

potential impacts on Florida very

seriously you know I hope that we watch

a tract over the next 24 hours and see

that the threat to Florida has

diminished but but we are not banking on

that at all and we are preparing for a

significant event with that I can take a

couple questions why are we seeing so

little traffic on our major highways

well I I think part of it is the traffic

overall this is not the typical Labor

Day weekend given that you had hurricane

hurricane news going on really for

several days now

probably even at the beginning of the

week I think we were starting to look at

this and so I think that probably

impacted the natural traffic and I also

think that if you look at say Palm Beach

County those evacuation zones a and B

that's a high percentage of seasonal

residence a lot of those folks on that

coast are not necessarily staying in

Florida in August um in September and so

but I think that folks have been willing

to take steps to prepare I mean you saw

people lining up for gas you saw water

flying off the shelves and you know

people have been through this drill

before so sometimes there can be message

fatigue but I also think at the same

time they understand that if you're

prepared you're gonna be much better off

if you take those steps and so we

appreciate I think you know having

worked with the counties to to get into

place where they can protect their their

residents and obviously we appreciate

Floridians making preparations

that ship going to the west just a

little bit like has that prompted you

guys to make any changes and I responded

maybe reallocating resources there's

repositioning that we're all we we're

always planning I mean like we never

thought that we could just assume it

wasn't gonna impact floor I mean so

that's kind of been how we were I think

what we would have liked to have seen is

it slowed down more and then take kind

of that Eastern track within the

guidance because that would have been it

would have been good to tell people that

but we're certainly not going to tell

people that if that's not what's gonna

happen so I think the resources have

been ready because when you have a storm

of this magnitude I mean even the track

that keeps it off the coast and ain't

like it's a hundred miles off the coast

I mean it gets to be about 25 miles off

the coast in some areas and so that's

way too close for comfort

even if that were gospel so so it hasn't

changed anything we've done I think once

we knew was going to be more of an East

Coast event you know we started having

the resources more focused on that I

mean you remember three or four days ago

was not out of the question that you had

a southern hit in South Florida coming

out to the Gulf of Mexico and then

hitting the Panhandle that obviously

would have been a major challenge when

you're talking about the most populated

part of the state you know State and

part of Southwest Florida that had just

been hit by hermit two years ago and

then the Panhandle potentially where the

Michael victims were and so that was

really a problem now the resources we

know work of the guards gonna be needed

you know we know where F F H P and D ot

are gonna need to help with the roads

the utilities have a better sense of

where they're gonna need to go when

power goes out and so in that sense I

think that that it's made it a more

focused effort which which our state

this big that's just there's logistical

challenges sometimes but um but I think

that I think we kind of know where were

the where the issues will be made the

point about an hour revealed you ready

that there are a fair number of people

who were taking vacations out of the

state and he expects or would hope that

they would extend their vacations by a

few days to ease their return to Florida

will you be calling for that well look I

think people need to do what's in their

best interest they know kind of you know

depending on where they live obviously I

would not recommend somebody you know

going to to Melbourne tomorrow if

they're out of state I mean I think you

probably would be better off to to wait

and see how this thing shakes out and so

that's just kind of the way the cookie

crumbles

but yeah it's uh I mean look my I was

planning on my wife and kids we were

gonna have fun with our our our kids

this weekend on Labor Day I know a lot

of Floridians were have had plans and

are enter and are having fun elsewhere

and so they just got to make the best

decision you know for their family but

clearly when you're talking about that

that's that area that's within the cone

you know I think that would be a real

real problem to just assume that you can

come back with no problems you guys are

getting is it going to take more time

more difficult to get resources down to

people that stay behind because it's

going to sit there for that as the storm

goes north you're gonna see resources

come following the storm so when we had

the meeting with the with the president

and spoke with FEMA you know you can see

where they have assets pre position you

know they have them in southern Florida

obviously as this thing looks to be

tracking you know kind of north of Palm

Beach and if it if it starts moving up

the coast that way you know they're

gonna take those southern Florida assets

and bring them to follow the track and

so and I think the same thing is true

with the utilities I mean they recognize

that you know you can have significant

impacts in in Palm Beach County and

Martin counties and so that that storm

could still be near st. Augustine and it

may have passed in that area and

obviously you know they're gonna want to

get in there and be able to help those

folks who've already experienced the

effects all right well we're going to be

monitoring this tonight we'll have any

any more updates will we'll put it out

for y'all I mean we'll be back here

doing more briefings tomorrow for sure I

don't know if we're gonna do any more

tonight but you know at the end of the

day please prepare because this thing is

this is a big boy thanks
