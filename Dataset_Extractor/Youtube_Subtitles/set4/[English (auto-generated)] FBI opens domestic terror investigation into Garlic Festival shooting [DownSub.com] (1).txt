our collection and review of the digital

media in this case is ongoing we are

continuing to access data on several

devices we have not made a final

investigative conclusion into the motive

of the shooter however we have uncovered

evidence throughout the course of our

investigation that the shooter was

exploring violent ideologies we have

seen a fractured ideology the shooter

appeared to have an interest in varying

competing violent ideologies as we

continue to exploit his digital media we

are striving to find several things what

if any ideology he had actually settled

on who if any one he may have been in

contact with regarding these ideologies

who if anyone helped him or had advanced

knowledge of his intentions and why he

committed this specific act of violence

much of our work remains ongoing one

piece of evidence does not necessarily

constitute a motive hence the need for

thorough methodical investigation the

FBI and the Gilroy Police Department

investigators have uncovered a list of

organizations

you

process of notifying those groups

however we will not be releasing or

confirming the names of any specific

organizations at this time out of

respect for their privacy and their

safety due to the discovery of the

target list as well as other information

we have a captured in this investigation

the FBI has opened a full domestic

terrorism investigation into this mass

shooting I understand that several

people have questioned as to why we did

not open this investigation sooner and I

want to provide some additional

information on how this process works an

act of violence alone even a large-scale

and horrifying as it may seem does not

necessarily necessarily give us the

legal authority to open a federal

terrorism investigation a federal

domestic terrorism case requires several

things

it requires the existence of a potential

federal violation it requires the

unlawful use of force or violence or the

threat of force or violence and most

importantly the existence of ideological

motivation having a belief system also

committing having a belief system and

also committing an act of violence does

not necessarily make that a terrorist

and act of terrorism nor does it give a

clear motive we have to determine that

individuals ideology caused them to

commit the act of violence in

furtherance of their political and

social goals we are still working to

determine the motive for this crime

however due to the information we have

found thus far the FBI has opened this

full domestic terrorism investigation it

is critically important for us to ensure

there is no ongoing threat to any

community this case is ongoing so we

cannot provide detailed information into

our investigative activities at this

time it is absolutely important that we

do this the right way finally I want to

thank the public for your patience as we

continue to conduct this investigation

carefully and methodically and

appropriately under our legal

authorities thank you to all the

organizations that have stepped up to

help this community

as the grieving continues and the

healing process now begins Gilmer is

strong is not just a t-shirt it is who

you are this community has been

incredible

we have been embedded here for several

days now where we've seen firsthand how

all of you have come together to support

one another and the police departments

and I want to thank you all
