parts of Atlantic Canada are in the dark

tonight more than two days after post

tropical storm durian ripped through the

region hydro crews are working around

the clock to restore power to more than

a hundred thousand customers and the

task is painstaking all public schools

in Nova Scotia are closed today and the

same goes for tomorrow over the weekend

Dorian packed a punch hitting Nova

Scotia first New Brunswick and PEI were

next

then Newfoundland and Labrador and the

damage is extensive hundreds of Canadian

soldiers have been deployed to help

clear debris so utility crews can get

power back up and running it's a huge

mission especially in hard-hit Halifax

where Ross Lord is tonight

Dorian's devastation is not easily

removed many Halifax area streets are

still choked with trees and branches as

people struggle through another day

without electricity because of the

generator we're getting through for

Michelle snow cucumber sandwiches have

lost their luster she misses her normal

routine the cooking a hot meal and you

don't really end a lot of the swords

don't have power to be able to go do

that since the weekend crews from Nova

Scotia Power have been joined by those

from other provinces and partner

utilities from Maine and Florida and

there are new visitors 250 soldiers from

Canadian Forces Base Gagetown our main

priority is to clear the roads and also

to make sure that people do not have

electricity in their house that they are

safe but coordination is a challenge

this team was deployed to chop up a tree

blocking a busy street they spent two

hours waiting for safety clearance that

didn't come

so they moved on without touching a

branch dorians impact extends into rural

communities apple growers the Nova

Scotia is Annapolis Valley say apples

bruised or blown to the ground will take

a bite out of their revenue after the

fact when we looked we we had pretty

significant damage damage control

includes removing this windblown

construction crane from an unfinished

apartment building for now they're still

trying to figure out how to do that job

safely there is progress broken power

poles discarded by the roadside with

neatly stacked replacements nearby and

some homeowners sharing their power

supply so neighbors can keep their

phones charged well it means being able

to stay in with communication to people

if needed it's great in an emergency my

phone's dead so I really appreciate it

despite the massive push to get life

back to normal

Nova Scotia Power says it could take a

while to clean up including full

restoration of power could take several

more days
