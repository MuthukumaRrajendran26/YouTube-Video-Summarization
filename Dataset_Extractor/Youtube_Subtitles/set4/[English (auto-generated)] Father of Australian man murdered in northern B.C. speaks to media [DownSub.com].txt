good afternoon as you know I may be an

experienced police officer but today I'm

standing here is the father of a murder

victim

we are just distraught this is really

torn two families apart our son Lucas

was having the time of his life

traveling the world he met a beautiful

young lady and they teamed up they're a

great pair and they fell in love we were

overjoyed for Lucas he came to Canada

and he planned a trip in a van with

China we'd been talking about it

we'd been discussing his trip and he

communicated with us as they were

leaving what happened after that time

will tell I guess we are hopeful of a

positive outcome and obviously we're

appealing along with the RM CP for

anyone to contact who may have any

information whatsoever however little

please contact the police I'll take

questions

there are some difficulties with the

dates because of the time differences

between Australia and Canada but we're

in contact within hours of him leaving

on this trip

look Lucas was was just a fun-loving guy

who you know had a goal to travel the

world he he saved up all his money

whilst he was working in Sydney he set

out on an adventure with a mate along

that tour he met China and they became

an inseparable pair you know it's it's a

love story that's ended tragically

it really is it's the worst ever love

story because we now have two young

people who had everything ahead of them

tragically murdered

I'm very grateful to the Commissioner of

New South Wales police the police and

the Australian government have been over

backwards for my family and I they have

provided me with support and part of

that support that was offered was the

services of two of our detectives to act

as liaison between the family and the RM

CP we've got no specific plans in place

at this stage we're taking it a day at a

time

it's extremely difficult for all of us

and we just hope to be able to take a

breath and as I say we were in

communication because of where he was we

were using services available at the

time but within hours of him leaving on

this trip with China

I know there's been a lot of speculation

but look as an experienced police

officer I know how these investigations

go my family I are more than satisfied

with the resources of the RM CP that

they're putting into this and I can tell

you I am more than confident in the

commitment of all the officers who are

working on this case

look as the police officer you you work

with families all the time and you get a

feel for the lay of the land is just as

you see but nothing prepares me nothing

prepares my family for what we are going

through now

I'm not going to be drawn into anything

in relation to the investigations that

are taking place by the Aaron sleepy
