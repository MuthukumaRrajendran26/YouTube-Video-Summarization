mr. I'm just going to be happy to answer

your question or you can just have a

conversation by yourself but if you'd

like to ask me a question I'll be happy

to continue you swear or affirm under

penalty of perjury that the testimony

you're about to give is true and correct

to the best of your knowledge

information and belief so help you God

since election day whether it was bad

actors at the FBI in the intelligence

community or lies coming from members of

the current House majority that there

was evidence of collusion the American

people continue to be sold a false

narrative with the purpose of

undermining the legitimacy of the 2016

election results I also received

hundreds of thousands of emails some

days with as many as a thousand emails

and unlike Hillary Clinton I don't think

I ever delete any of those many of them

will respond to two with either one-word

answers or folded to other staffers for

additional follow-up but throughout it

all and to the best of my recollection I

don't ever recall having any

conversations with foreign entities let

alone any who were offering to help to

manipulate the outcome of an election

how many times is the president asked

you to meet him in the White House the

White House's director not disclosed the

substance of his did you meet with the

president alone in the White House in

2017 I don't know the answer to that how

many times did he direct you to deliver

a message to a member of his cabinet the

White House is direct I had not

disclosed the substance of any

discussions what year isn't it did he

ever discuss with you any concerns that

he may have committed a criminal offense

the White House has directed not

disclosed the substance of any

discussions with the President or his

advisors to protect executive branch

confidentiality every time I raise my

right hand to God I've sworn and told

the truth that's not my question to you

sir we'll get to that my question to you

sir is on national television did you

lie about your relationship with the

Special Counsel and whether they sought

your interview I don't know

and sir did you lie about it because you

didn't want the world to find out that

you were afraid you could be exposed to

criminal liability and you were only

going to appear as to certain issues

with a grant of immunity protecting your

words from being used against you in a

criminal prosecution I'm gonna go back

through what director Muller stated he's

not going to answer that question I'm

not gonna allow you to use me as a

backdoor into his methods if you'd like

to question director Mahler about the

way of the investigation techniques of

the Justice Department you've had that

opportunity to do so but clearly you

didn't so take him back here and bring

him before the committee can ask those

questions those questions are not from

me prior to the Muller report being

published in redacted form

did you ever misrepresent what you did

on behalf of the president I can't think

of an instance where that would have

occurred let me show you an interview

that you did on May 14th of 2019

excuse me a showed you from February

22nd 2019 let me show it to you 2019

thank you I don't ever remember the

president ever asking me to get involved

with Jeff Sessions or the Department of

Justice in any way shape so you did you

hear that sir that was you saying on

MSNBC you don't ever remember the

president ever asking you to get

involved with Jeff Sessions or the

Department of Justice in any way shape

or form that wasn't true was it sir I

heard that and that was not true was it

I have no obligation be honest to the

media just because there's just as as

honest as anybody else see so you're

admitting sir you were not being

truthful in that clip correct my

interview with re Melbourne yes can we

interpret any way you'd like are you an

agent working on behalf of the Russian

government no sir

as a close friend and adviser of the

president you don't believe that the

president is working on behalf of the

Russian do you absolutely not dictated

to you exactly what he wanted you to put

into the mouths of Attorney General Jeff

Sessions correct I believe he asked me

to deliver a message for Jeff to

consider delivering himself strange that

the president would sit down with you

one-on-one and ask you to do something

that you knew was against the law I

didn't think the president asked me to

do anything illegal you got cold feet

yeah you chickened out I went on

vacation you

education
