Jilla chair tries to protect his

property from the wind and rain of

durian and he has his work cut out for

him go over there with conditions

worsening as the day progressed more

people came out to check on their boats

in Shetty AK I just came to check on the

boats see I make sure everything's okay

others like nadine gallant were dropping

by just to check things out a couple of

hours away in st. john more rain and

wind but no major problems reported

during the day still some people weren't

taking any chances and closing up

possible trouble spots yeah when you

hear hurricane yeah you immediately

think of strong winds and especially

when there's a lot of trees around us

you never know exactly what's gonna

happen

Kevin Clifford is st. John's fire chief

and heads of the city's emergency

measures organization he says people

need to remain vigilant well if they can

stay home stay home you know even even

driving in today to be part of this

operation I was thinking about things

that could fall on me because of the

high wind

Clifford also encourages people to think

of others who may need your help when a

storm strikes you got neighbors that

aren't as you know as as young as you

may be and then the folks who may be you

know they may have things around their

homes that that aren't secure now keep

an eye on your neighbors and if you can

help and keep yourself safe at the same

time be prepared to do so good advice as

you stare down a storm that has already

taken lives and left widespread damage
