to help in this effort as the governor

I'm authorized to provide a reward and

we're doing so a $25,000 reward for the

apprehension the arrest and the

conviction of this individual and we

want to remind you the last thing I'll

say is we need you to be vigilant we

need you to provide information we need

you to help law enforcement because it's

very important to the state of Tennessee

and to the citizens of our state that we

apprehend it's important for the family

of Deborah and we we appreciate all of

your help in apprehending this very

dangerous individual so it's my

understanding that someone did so

Deborah had been in the department for

38 years as I said earlier she had a

great relationship with both staff and

inmates in the T DLC system many a lot

of inmates knew who Deborah was she was

very personable and she was very

respected with the inmate population in

regards to this particular inmate I

don't have any knowledge of specific

communications or a direct link with the

inmate but it's not uncommon for her to

know these inmates that work on the

property

she lived sure we have had we've had now

over 75 tips

that placed the suspect in a number of

places throughout the state as well as

other states and so we are following up

on every tip that we receive the ones

that we feel are most credible we're

checking them first and then we're

working from that but there have been a

number of alleged sightings we have yet

to locate him at any of those places

that we've been reported
