like a color that you're not is

essentially racist I don't think he's

racist at all it is a little messed up I

think some people would find that

offensive just some of the reaction

today as offensive photos emerge of the

prime minister in brown and blackface

we have breaking news with a third

photograph and all the impact this is

going to have on the federal election

the Trudeau campaign is in damage

control mode this hour rocked by three

separate occasions photographs of the

prime minister wearing brown or black

face the liberal leader has apologized

but as judgment and credibility among

voters are in question today pre Assam

Assam is live in our newsroom Priya

you've been speaking with so many voters

tell us about some of the reaction

you've received it has been so

interesting farah talking to people this

morning so I would say that everyone we

spoke to was surprised by the video of

Justin Trudeau in blackface and the

photos of him in brown face but the

reaction to how this should impact the

election was mixed this is the third

confirmed incident of Justin Trudeau in

black or brown face makeup to surface in

the last 24 hours

a Trudeau staffer confirming to Global

News this is the Prime Minister but

would not say when or where the video

was shot the reaction to the video in

downtown Toronto is mixed he was fairly

young at that time and you know it's

something that it doesn't bother me

really it is very disrespectful to the

batteries and the fact that people don't

recognize that

we're still being disrespected even

after many years of slavery that's

really sad Trudeau apologized for the

initial photo showing him with dark face

makeup and a turban he says it was taken

in 2001 at an Arabian night themed

dinner held at a private school where he

was a teacher at the time it was

something that I didn't think was racist

at the time but now I recognize it was

something racist to do and I am deeply

sorry other party leaders reacting to

these three incidents this morning on

the campaign trail I believe that

Canadians might have been able to accept

his apology if he had been truthful and

open if he hadn't based that apology on

a lie but he was specifically asked if

there were other instances where he

engaged in this type of racist behavior

and he indicated that there was only one

other incidents and now we know that

there was at least three what we're

seeing now is an ongoing pattern of

behavior that's really gonna hurt

Canadians they're gonna see the Prime

Minister mocking the realities that so

many Canadians live with and it is not a

joke back on the streets of Toronto

voters are wondering how these photos

remained hidden for so long and saying

there's no excuse for Trudeau's actions

I feel like what people need to realize

is when dressing up in say cultural

outfits you don't necessarily have to

put on the skin colour as well like you

can dress about the Latin and people

will still get the character with how

you painting your skin I think that's

like like really messed up because the

blackface regardless if you're like

doing it as a black person or somebody

of color like that's just wrong on the

other side some Torontonians say it was

a sign of the times it is a little

messed up but like you conform to

whatever society was like you know back

then what is certain though is that the

incidents are making headlines in

Toronto across the country and now

around the world and we have yet to hear

from Justin Trudeau since Global News

exclusively obtained that video we have

heard a little bit from his staff but

all they have said is a comment they've

given confirmation that it is him in the

video and have also said that it was

shot during the 90s so we'll be

following this story throughout the day
