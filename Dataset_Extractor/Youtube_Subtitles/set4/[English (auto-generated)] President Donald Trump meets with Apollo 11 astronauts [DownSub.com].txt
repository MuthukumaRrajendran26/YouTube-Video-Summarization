well thank you very much

tomorrow is a very big day because

tomorrow will represent 50 years from

the time we planted a beautiful American

flag on the moon and that was a an

achievement possibly one of the great

considered one of the great achievements

ever and we're going a lot further now

we're going to the movie but we're then

going to Mars and I think very

importantly at all of you folks know

that from a standpoint of defense so

important we're going to be doing the

space force I assume you guys are all in

favor of the space force right I'd be

very surprised if you weren't but that's

where it's at we're going to be doing

the space force we're very close to

getting that completed and operating

that's going to be very exciting so a

lot of things are happening we have with

us of course Buzz Aldrin always been an

incredible gentleman I've known him for

years for a long time and we've been

friends for a long time but just a

fantastic fantastic man and Michael

Collins you all know flew Apollo 11

overhead and it's Aldrin and Armstrong

they walked on the moon we have and you

have Rick off from the Sun mark it's

just incredible families these are

incredible space families these are

incredible men and honestly I've gotten

to know some of the women of the family

these are great women great men frankly

great genes but tomorrow's a big day so

tomorrow is a day where 50 years and we

also have Jim brightenstein and Jim is

the head of NASA as you know and nASA

has done a whole different it's a whole

different thing Jim bridenstine is

somebody that everybody wanted that job

because there's a love for space that is

unparalleled Mike Pence

and myself felt strongly about Jim we

gave him the job and he's surpassed any

of our expectations

NASA's back having rich guys use it and

pay us rent I like that I almost like

that better Jim you want to know that we

don't have to put up so much money but

you've been watching a lot of rich guys

sending up rockets and that goes to our

credit and it goes to their credit also

but we like it and we opened up our

field when we took it over they were all

covered with grass and they were broken

and they were in bad shape the nessa if

you look at Kennedy you look at down in

Florida you look wherever you want to

look it was not a pretty picture

they were almost you could say abandoned

and now they're in tip-top shape and

rockets are going up all the time and we

would actually lease rockets from Russia

and other countries but from Russia to

send people up and we appreciate the

whole relationship with Russia but we'll

be doing it ourselves we're in a

position that we haven't been in for

many many years and space to me is

important for defense and offense I

guess you could say but space to me is

very important for defense it's not just

about going to the moon and going to

Mars because we don't know what we're

going to find do it Mars but it's

certainly a trip that's going to be very

interesting to get to Mars you have to

land on the moon they say any way of

going directly without landing on the

moon is that a possibility

because when we go to the mall when we

go to Mars we're gonna have to be there

for a long period of time so we need to

learn how to live and work on another so

how long a trip tomorrow how long would

it take it's about a seven-month journey

there

the challenge is Earth and Mars are only

on the same side of the Sun once every

26 months so we have to be prepared to

stay on Mars for long periods of time we

prove that out on the moon then we go on

tomorrow what happens if you missed a

timing they're in deep trouble right

well we're not you don't want to be on

that ship yes sir

you don't want to be on the show what do

you think we come back and try to get

yeah I guess what's a long time that's a

long time how do you feel about it Mars

direct you like it direct yeah it seems

to me Mars direct everyone patient I

mean who's who knows better than these

people doing this stuff for a long time

what about the concept of Mars direct so

the the challenge is if we go direct to

Mars there's going to be a lot of things

that we haven't yet proven out we need

to think about this we need to use the

resources of another world in order to

live and work for long periods of time

the moon has hundreds of millions of

tons of water ice that we discovered

back in 2009 water ice represents life

support it's air to breathe its water to

drink it's also rocket fuel hydrogen and

oxygen the same rocket fuel to power the

Space Shuttle so it's available in

hundreds of millions if there's mr.

president that's a market that's an

available market where people some of

these commercial guys are interested in

going to the moon to utilize that

resource for their own stays on the moon

it could be for tourism it could be for

resources potentially even Shiva statue

they haven't really landed that close to

that portion of the moon that you're

talking about that's correct in the

Apollo era we landed in the equatorial

regions so from 1969 the first landing

up until 2008 and 2009 many people

believe the moon was bone-dry now we

know that there's hundreds of millions

of tons of water ice we need to learn

how to use it so we can live and work

and then ultimately that gives us the

opportunity to go to Mars so you feel

that really landing on the moon first

and figuring it out and getting ready to

launch and you would like to you really

feel launching you're essentially

launching from the moon to Mars I think

so the best way to think about it is we

learn how to live and work on the moon

but we launch to Mars from a space

station that we have in orbit around the

moon a space station we call gateway

right which gives us access to the moon

but ultimately it becomes the deep-space

transport to take go to Mars with a

gateway we will have more access to more

parts of the solar system with humans

than we could ever have otherwise

because from the moon it's very easy

because the moon's gravity well is small

compared to her so what we a grenade at

the gateway enabled us to go version

just seeing our Jim brothers done was a

great congressman who was with me most

of the time at all the time it was not

that easy a decision for me but that's

okay you know that you know what I'm

talking about and ultimately once I got

to know him and once he got to know me

it was a whole different ballgame and

you've done a fantastic job you really

yes and you love it and more importantly

he loves it the reason he's doing well

with my Mike Pence where's my pride by

coming tell me what you think of the job

Jim's doing what what do you think of

the job they're doing well thank you mr.

president

I sure you enthusiasm for our NASA

Administrator Jim Brad Steiners done a

phenomenal job really putting into

practice your vision for reviving

American leadership and human space

exploration about to be able to be here

in the Oval Office with you and the

first lady with Buzz Aldrin Mike Collins

in the family of Neil Armstrong as we

celebrate the 50th anniversary of the

Apollo 11 mission is it is very humbling

for me I thank you for your leadership

you revived the National Space Council

you asked us to lead it and we have

really revived American leadership in

space we're launching a space force to

make sure that we can defend this nation

at the outer reaches of space but

because of your leadership I know

everyone gathered here these families

these astronauts are excited to know

that within the next year we will be

able to return American astronauts to

space on American Rockets from American

soil

maybe you could just wear it just hold

up your hands and little bits of

immediacy the family of diehl-armstrong

where's our family they're all family

what I want you to do buzz just

introduce your family that's you fit

this mic lovely so do you have any

questions folks one thing I think before

we go I do want to ask one question to

be the Mike or Jim

private guys wealthy guys is spending a

lot of money with you right now a lot I

assume they're using the facilities

they're leasing the facilities at any

money to set off their rockets you can

judge a block they have so much I don't

know what to do with it and then like

rockets my god I don't like it said Mike

I like it I like it the way we're doing

it I also like it the way they're doing

it how much of the work that you're

doing is privately financed and because

I see whether it's Bezos or I could name

many okay have many involved how much of

the work that you're doing is private

versus government-funded and researched

so right now on the International Space

Station

we are commercially resupplying the

International Space Station by buying a

service from these commercial providers

who have invested their own money

because they're looking for markets

they're looking for business that is not

necessarily us which means our costs

good out and our access goes up but

that's resupply to the International

Space Station now we're doing commercial

crew to the International Space Station

and the value is this and sir this is uh

this is a public-private partnership

where we're gonna have the opportunity

in the future to have NASA be one

customer of many customers in a very

robust marketplace in low-earth orbit

where the costs come down access goes up

but we also want to make sure and this

is important we have numerous providers

that are competing against each other on

cost and innovation and as they compete

our costs will continue to go down

access will go up the goal being we want

more access to space than ever before

and that's ultimately how we're going to

go to the moon that's how we're going to

get to Mars and that there are markets

out there that are not NASA and that's a

good thing for our country what in our

defence industry so nASA has a lot of

technologies that we developed that the

Department of Defense in fact takes

advantage of and that goes back to

people remember Alan Shepard launching

into space well he launched on an ICBM

so there's a lot of back and forth

between what NASA does for Science and

Technology and what the Department of

Defense does for the national security

interests of the country but you know

this and I've been very public about it

the United States Air Force is an

amazing institution the challenges their

budgets are pretty steady and yet the

greatest threats that the Air Force

deals with are in space and cyber space

and these are areas where the Air Force

is going to run out of capacity in my

view from a national security

perspective so we need to take that

element and create a separate space

force where we can organize train and

equip a cadre of professionals that can

keep us safe from a space perspective

and by doing that we will have more

opportunity to explore space than we

otherwise would fantastic job

so Michael Collins flew Apollo 11 what's

the difference with there's a long time

ago with that and let's say what they're

doing today because you're abreast of

what they're doing today might well I

think the whole system is

more we're talking a minute ago about

private funds I think that's wonderful

the more the merrier the money this must

be in Bezos to put take out of their own

pocket they put into the fabric it is

all one lump as far as I'm concerned

maybe the budget tears don't quite agree

with that

but I think it's just the more the

merrier private funds appropriated funds

we need a moment let's go with look let

me say like that whole concept yes

do you see a big advancement from so

many years ago with Apollo 11 you see a

tremendous advancement when you see

what's happening like Elon Musk

I see where his propulsion systems come

back to earth I had never seen that

before they come back standing up and

that means you use them again I guess

but that was unthinkable a long time yes

sir that was one shot and they fell into

the ocean a tremendous waste of fine

food rocket motors for every Saturn 5

that you sent huh I think that is the

most dramatic new idea that reusability

I mean how many things in our life do we

use once and throw away too many maybe

maybe that reusability doctrine could be

a little more widespread in the rest of

our mr. president it's just to reinforce

your point president Science Space

policy director one saying that America

was going to return to

and then to Mars this one first acts in

this administration but the president

president has also taken action to

streamline regulations for private space

exploration but the president's vision

is that we will continue to have

American leadership in space some of

that will come from NASA some of that

will come as a part of our national

defense but much of it will come by

unleashing the entrepreneurial energy of

American space entrepreneurs and and all

of it represents what I know all of

these families are excited about is

renewed American leadership in human

space exploration and it all comes to

articulating and putting into practice

your vision mr. president thank you very

much Mike and bus maybe say a few words

you've been watching the space program

very closely you've been watching what

we're doing and what a career you've had

great careers

what would you say I've been a little

disappointed in the last 10 15 years we

were able to achieve so much early what

maybe we because of conflicts in

Southeast Asia we had to terminate the

Apollo payment moved on other direction

but in the last 50 years we had a rocket

saturn v and it took command module that

was like spacecraft and the lunar module

was you know we all went together we

landed we joined up that was my

expertise upon the earth we came back

now we have a number one rocket right

now in the US and we have a number one

spacecraft and they cannot get into

lunar orbit with significant maneuvering

capability and that's a great

disappointment to me how do you feel

about that Jim we're working on it

fact so the Orion crew capsule is an

amazing crew capsule and we need it to

go to the moon within five years which

of course is the direction that we're on

right now but when we're there I think

the gateway it's going to attach to a

small module in orbit around the moon

called the Gateway think of it as a

small space station and that's going to

give us what we call Delta V that's that

maneuvering capability to go down to low

lunar orbit and then back up

on a lander so those are the pieces of

the architecture that we're working on

the other side because some people would

like to do it a different way yes sir I

see you listen to buzz are the other

people because they also feel I mean I

know this has been going on for a little

while and we're so advanced but I would

like to hear the other side I think the

the other real benefit of space that is

something we haven't talked about now is

the inspiration that it provides for all

the kids out there not just in the US

but all around the world to focus on

achieving their dreams studying science

and math and engineering and I've met

I've heard from so many people that have

come to me and said I was inspired to be

what I am because of what I saw in the

Apollo program and that the value of

that is is tremendous and I think we

need more of that so I'm really hoping

that you know days like today will help

do that and with the increased activity

in space that we're all talking about

here we'll all help that well you have a

great family

and you know one of the things we're

bringing the glamor back to it because

it was the glamour lost everything if

you would have seen these fields when we

took over really you started about a

year year-and-a-half ago when we took

over it was unbelievable it looked like

an abandoned town and now there's this

beauty is beauty and there's a lot of

things happen a lot of really great

things are happening so we're very proud

of that thank you all very much we

appreciate it thank you
