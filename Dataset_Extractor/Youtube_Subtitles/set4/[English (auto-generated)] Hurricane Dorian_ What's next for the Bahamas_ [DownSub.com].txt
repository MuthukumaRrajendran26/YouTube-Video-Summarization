meantime in the Bahamas the death toll

is rising as the search for more victims

continues and aid efforts are getting

underway mic relay is in Nassau this

morning with more on this good morning

so Mike describe what the scene is like

where you are and also the hardest hit

areas well we're in Nassau where a lot

of the staging grounds are for for the

relief efforts but just north of us

there are the two main islands in the

the Bahamas that were hit you have to

understand Bahamas is a series of 700

islands not all of the Bahamas were hit

so most of it most of the tourist areas

in fact are were left relatively

untouched but the Grand Bahama Island

and Abaco Islands were destroyed the

prime minister is calling it

generational destruction getting in and

out is proven to be extremely difficult

for rest and they are just we're finding

getting new terrible information about

death tolls and about and every day you

know speaking of the death toll it's

risen overnight now what are the fears

right now that how high could it go well

they are saying to prepare for the worst

that it the Health Minister said that it

could go and to possibly even into the

thousands the list of missing is very

very long you have to understand this

wasn't your normal storm it was a

category 5 and with winds close to 300

km/h sure akane behaved differently was

the Abaco Islands in Grand Bahama and

destroyed everything and then it sat

there for two days and pummeled them

with more wind and rain there is a story

about a man who was in the water in the

Abaco Islands the water was up unto it

to his rooftop he had broken his leg he

was in the water with his five-year-old

son and he saw fins in the water because

the Sharks were swimming between the

houses he was able to lift his son onto

the roof to put him to safety and as he

was about to pull himself up the winds

blew his son away his son is not among

the death toll because he's just listed

as missing but at this point what kind

of hope does he have he the last thing

you heard was his son getting blown away

yelling daddy

well as that is to here there are

stories like that we're hearing like

every day

yeah incredibly sad there's no question

about that and you mentioned that Nassau

is the staging ground for the relief

effort so a lot of supply is obviously

coming in the big question is what

happens next in getting these supplies

and everything that is needed to the

hardest hit areas talk about the

challenges surrounding that well one of

the passage challenges are many it's

like how long do we have

first there's you know bureaucratic

bureaucratic red tape we spoke with a

pilot yesterday who has been sitting

there for 24 hours waiting to get in he

needs to get the permission to be able

to fly into one of the few air strips

that are open the one of the problems

with it is that the main International

Airport on Grand Bahama is still closed

because there's too much degree the

debris they can't stage there they can't

land there there's a plane that's been

blown into the terminal so it's it's

it's unusable so the US Coast Guard the

good news is that they've been able to

save and one people as of last night but

they're doing it via helicopter and it's

slow difficult methodical work but right

now getting into the access to it is

their biggest concern and they're trying

to trying to do it any which way they

can and it's an effort that could take

months if not years all right micro lay

in Nassau Bahamas thank you so much for

this and stay safe in related news an
