the challenges for this operation have

been immense we have not seen anything

like a debris field like this there are

multiple areas that are impassable we

have a difficult time because of course

we have to find make sure that our dogs

are okay there are multiple hazards here

like nails corrugated steel glass you

know things like that we also have other

animals that are running around and

we're trying to actually help them out

to if we can but there is certainly some

challenges there's been some areas that

we just haven't been able to actually

get into but all of the buildings that

we can get to we've been searching and

then we mark them so that it doesn't get

repeated by a future team yeah it's

pretty difficult you know but it's

something that we do so you know yeah

these are this is our job you know we've

been tasked to do this so you know we're

prepared for it and you know but just

the magnitude of the damage has been you

know certainly very challenging for the

teams and the heat as well has been

quite difficult to so but our guys are

doing good and we'll continue to to do

well and and hopefully we'll be back

here tomorrow on on a further side and

and we'll just continue to clear

buildings
