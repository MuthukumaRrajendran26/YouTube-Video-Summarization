we came out to see kind of the dumb

people make a run for it

I like my freedom inside six months in

federal prison and that doesn't sound

like a good time why would you ever miss

this a bunch of random people in weird

costumes standing outside of a

government base why would you want to

miss that that's that's a one lifetime

experience it's like it's hot Halloween

but we're just annoying people

it's been fun everything so welcoming

and nice we got to meet new people law

enforcement you know they're here to do

their job and they're really nice and

friendly

[Laughter]

come on Pete I don't know how else to

explain it to you but I think if you

witnesses you you will believe there's

stuff out there that's incredible that

you wouldn't believe it unless you saw

it for yourself and I'm a believer there

are aliens

I don't know what you're talking
