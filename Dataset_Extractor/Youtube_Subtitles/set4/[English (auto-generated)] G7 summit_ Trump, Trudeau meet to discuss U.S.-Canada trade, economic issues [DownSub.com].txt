always discuss with a sit-down with

President Trump

we've had some good conversations

already particularly on the global

economy partly because of the trading

relationship we have great work we did

quite frankly around the table there's a

lot of people wanted to make trade deals

with each other we have we have a deal

that we were able to negotiate this good

for our workers for our citizens that's

the kind of thing will be more of around

the world always a pleasure to talk

about a broad range of so we're going to

be significantly expanding our trading

relationship when the u.s. MCA gets

completed our farmers love it

the union's love it the workers love it

manufacturers love it everybody likes it

I think most Democrats like it so

hopefully that'll be put to a vote

fairly soon it's got tremendous support

itself I believe Democrat and Republican

it has been signed and finalized

essentially by Canada and essentially if

I measure so we're waiting for that from

the United States and we have we have

really great support and it's something

I think it's a very special agreement

and replaces NAFTA which is perhaps the

worst rate agree we've ever done

within our country I can think of one

worse but it's not within our country

outside of our country that's the w3 oh

that's a beauty so we're very happy with

the agreement and I congratulate you I

hope it gets done I guess we should save

the congratulations for when they vote

but hopefully that will be put to a buck

pretty soon thank you very much thanks

leaving now thank you all press we're

leaving now thank you pressed once again
