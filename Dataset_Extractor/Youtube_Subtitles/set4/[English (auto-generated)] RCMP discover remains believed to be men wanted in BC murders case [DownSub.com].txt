breaking news of the manitoba tonight a

province that has been on edge for weeks

as it became the central focus of a

nationwide manhunt for two teenagers

suspected of triple murder tonight

relief the police say the manhunt is

over and that they found the remains of

bryerson Miguel ski and Ken MacLeod this

morning at approximately 10:00 a.m. RCMP

officers located two male bodies in the

dense brush at this time we believe

these are the bodies of the two suspects

wanted in connection with the homicides

in British Columbia the remains were

discovered near Gillam in northern

Manitoba a community that was living

with fear and uncertainty during this

search tonight those fears can be put to

rest but more than anything the Mounties

hope there is closure for the families

of the BC man and the tourists couple

the teens are suspected of killing for

the very latest on this development

let's go to globals Brittany Greenslade

in Winnipeg Brittany yeah Robyn it's

been an exhaustive search and after more

than two weeks many people have given up

hope of ever finding cam MacLeod and

briers Miguel ski now RCMP even pulling

resources out of the area but this

morning the search officially over after

two bodies were found as police began to

scale back their efforts critical

evidence was found Friday in the rugged

densely wooded terrain

well Mounties refused to say what items

belonging to the suspects they found

they admit it was a crucial find in

changing their search police have not

said exactly where the bodies were found

but here's what we do know a vehicle

driven by the two men was found burned

out on July 22nd near Fox Lake Cree

Nation

police say the bodies were found about

eight kilometers from that spot police

were led to this new location after

finding items including a rowboat on the

shoreline of the Nelson River the bodies

were found in dense brush this morning

within a kilometre of where those items

were located the community of Gilliam

has remained on edge for weeks and today

news helps bring closure to them and a

sigh of relief from investigators

there's obviously a certain amount of

relief that we were able to locate these

people and and hopefully bring some

closure not

the victims of the homicides but to the

people of Gilliland Fox Lake Cree Nation

New York Landing

Wilfred warlike nation it's it's it's

huge to be able to hopefully give some

people an opportunity to exhale and

hopefully eventually go back to normal

and not being afraid of who's out in the

woods anymore Brittany do we know how

the pair died yeah that's still one of

the major questions that remains

unanswered RCMP have not said how they

died or how long they were dead before

those bodies were found this morning now

BC RCMP have been the lead investigators

in this entire case from the beginning

they gave an update today after those

suspect bodies were found BC RCMP

investigators have spoken to the

families of Leonard dick Lukas Fowler

and China DS and provided them with the

latest update the RCMP will continue to

offer support to them understanding that

the traumatic losses they have gone

through do not end with the deaths of

these men whom we believe to be our

suspects suffice to say there were

significant evidence that linked our

suspects to both crime scenes

now still a lot of questions remain

unanswered we do know those two bodies

are being flown from Gilliam to Winnipeg

tonight for autopsies over the next few

days we are hoping for more answers in

the coming days and weeks
