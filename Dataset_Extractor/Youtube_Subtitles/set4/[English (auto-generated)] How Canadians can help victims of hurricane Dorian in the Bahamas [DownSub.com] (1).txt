this is the Bahamas after being hit by

Hurricane durian a category 5 hurricane

when it's struck has left thousands on

the Caribbean nation in need especially

on the islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama

access is finally opening up and we are

starting to receive aerial assessments

that indicate that it is 99 percent of

people who live on these islands may

have been affected we're seeing images

of completely flooded neighborhoods of

houses and buildings missing rooms and

walls of both overturned we're hearing

that the massive flooding has

contaminated Wells and that people are

native drinking water and that

infrastructure has been severely damaged

eight organizations like Red Cross and

UNICEF have teams in the Bahamas

assessing the situation and providing

support and many Canadians are wondering

how they can help the first instinct is

to think of sending physical items like

blankets clothes or food but first

responders on the ground say in these

situations cash is usually King may not

be the right thing for the country where

they're going to so not good but if

people wanted help all reputable

agencies are asking for financial

support for that heart and get there so

that they could be providing the help

the technical know-how agencies with

teams on the ground know what items are

needed and having the funds to provide

those items is much more efficient than

having individuals try to send

themselves we are preparing a response

that will help close to 5,000 families

the Red Cross responds and now we'll be

focusing on providing shelter assistance

so this will be providing household

items and it may have been lost

blankets tarp aleene's and hygiene kits

we'll also be looking to support those

in clean water and hygiene activities

and if you're among the many Canadians

planning to vacation to the Bahamas

don't cancel your plans just yet

double-check your destination as it may

not have been affected by the hurricane

the tourism industry there is going to

be in need of tourists as it recovers
