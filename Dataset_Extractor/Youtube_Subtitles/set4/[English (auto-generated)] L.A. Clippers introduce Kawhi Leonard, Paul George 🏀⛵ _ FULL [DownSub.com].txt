be here today to celebrate a truly

historic moment for the Clippers the

organization and their fans before we

acknowledge all of the Clippers staff

that are here lining the back of the gym

better than maybe anybody else so thank

you for joining us as we celebrate again

hosting us today this court this court

that we're sitting on is one of 350 that

have been renovated and refurbished by

the Clippers in partnership with the

Department of Recreation and Parks it

has been truly an undertaking for the

Clippers organization and the city of

Los Angeles

I would love to welcome from the LA

Parks Foundation Carolyn Ramsey and

Judith Kieffer California State Senator

Stephen Bradford LA councilmember

current price state assembly member

Sydney Kim la garde of state

Assemblymember Reggie Jones Sawyer's

senior Inglewood Mayor James T butts of

course our clipper partners Fox Lexus

Cedar sinai and chick-fil-a and last but

not least the incredible kids of Green

Meadows who are sitting right here in

the middle give it up

now to officially kick things off I

would love to bring up the team

president of basketball operations mr.

Lawrence Frank

how's everyone doing today right they

gave me these huge huge two cards make

sure I don't mess it up all right the

first of all welcome thank you all for

being here this is a landmark moment for

the Clippers franchise and our fans I

want to recognize some of the people who

made this possible

first and foremost why and Paul thank

you for deciding to be Clippers

[Applause]

it means a great deal for players of

this magnitude to decide to be clippers

and to put their trust in us wise mother

Kim Robertson cries uncle Dennis

Robertson his agent Mitch Frankel of

impact sports and all of Weis family and

friends from the Inland Empire in San

Diego we'd like to thank Paul and

Paulette George Paul's agent Aaron Mintz

of CAA sports and all his family and

friends from LA in the Antelope Valley

we're honored to be united today none of

us would be here today without this man

Steve Ballmer ok

[Music]

when Steve bought the team five years

ago his intention was to make the LA

Clippers the ultimate destinations for

players and their families he's made an

unbelievable commitment to make sure

every day that we're striving towards

that goal there are so many people both

in basketball operations and business

operations who contributed to help make

this moment possible

I can't possibly list them all but our

gratitude is there but there are a

couple vital members that I do want to

acknowledge that had a huge part in

helping us get to where we are today

first Doc Rivers championship head coach

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

jerry west the greatest architect there

is in the game

[Applause]

and then I have an unbelievable team of

guys michael winger our general manager

Trent redden our assistant general

manager Mark Hughes our assistant

general manager and our president of

business operations billions of who all

provided tremendous support and insight

throughout this process last year dot

called our group a black top team

because of the toughness and grit that

they brought to the court our players

and coaches deserve a ton of credit

today it was the culture that they

created that made Hawaii and Paul want

to join our group so again we want to

acknowledge just what they've set forth

and what we're going to continue to

build on and I think the things that in

terms of talking equai and talking to

Paul it's the toughness the hard play

the drama free in the premiere market in

the National Basketball Association we'd

like to acknowledge right now two

players who won't be returning shake

guiltless Alexander and Danilo Gallinari

[Music]

Shay is gonna be a special player in

this league gala is already a high

performer we wish them nothing but the

best and we'll be pulling for him

throughout their careers as much as we

loved our team last year we knew we

needed at leat talent to compete at the

highest level one of the hardest things

that do in the NBA is to get one

superstar let alone two superstars who

respect and complement each other like

Kauai and Paul do it was only a month

ago that collide took home another

Finals MVP trophy he is a champion he is

a winner he wins everywhere he goes from

King high school to San Diego State to

the NBA

Paul shares many of those same qualities

he's an elite scorer and a relentless

defender who is one of the most

versatile players in the NBA one of the

reasons we stockpile draft picks was to

trade for a foundational star like Paul

Kauai and Paul our franchise changing

players who are force multipliers they

make everyone in the organization better

they're the two best two-way players in

our game today

they work relentlessly for everything

they get and they always have since

they're prepping collegiate days not too

far away from here we didn't just pursue

because their tremendous talents we

pursued them because they fit so well

together amongst our group as well and

in quiet Paul the roster is both an

immense privilege and a huge

responsibility one we take seriously

they expect to win championships so do

we we can't wait to partner with them

and maximize the extraordinary

opportunity in front of us thank you

next I would love to bring up the head

coach of your Los Angeles Clippers Doc

Rivers

[Music]

thank you how's everyone doing I didn't

get any cue cards like Mike Lawrence has

so I'm just doing this from what I see

number one thank you Kauai and PG all

right but this is not this is a great

moment right

but what everybody agree with that this

is a good moment it's not our finest

moment that's coming you know what I'm

saying and that's that's why we're here

today we're here to celebrate all right

we're here to celebrate that not only

just the Clipper brand this feels more

like a movement to me it really does but

this is more about what's coming and

that not today today is for them today

is a great day for them and for the

franchise but then when you guys leave

the gym we're gonna get to work and

that's the moment that we want but we've

done some winning we want to be the

winner

the chance to do the only real thing we

want to do I gotta say being number two

being number four we're only here for

one reason we want to win it all there's

only one reason I'm proud of our

leadership team to put us in this

position where we could put together two

of the guys who I have most admired

season year no yeah little injury third

in the MVP voting third a guy who could

be first third why MVP of the NBA Finals

man that's pretty damn good

[Applause]

you don't think we can win some baggage

this year with Poliquin our team want to

win some ball games but there's only a

few games we need to need we need to win

the last game played during the NBA

season that's the game we got to win I

said something when they won the

championship this year about Valerio be

the only thing that matters is the Larry

old pee when I first got here I think I

called it the Lawrence O'Brien from now

on it's all about the very old B so

we're gonna get a chance to hear quiet

all here in a minute but we did a little

video we'd like to show you first thanks

[Applause]

for the support my goal was to get to

the EPA and finally :

from Lorena Valley California

trying to be mind clear I don't make a

name for myself

he's one of the very best forwards in

all of college basketball you know I've

been working my whole life to get here I

like to win games and be a champion for

myself growing up in Palm D'Or I knew I

loved the game I didn't know how far he

was gonna take me

I just feel like I got a lot of

potential to continue to grow do not

think the sky's the limit the Indiana

Pacers select poll

Kawhi Leonard from San Diego State

University

the superstar

new inquiry are pretty close those two

players align with a roster that is deep

they are talented deep and stacked with

Houston we both some Intel guys why is a

close

Paul George is a closing George over the

we both wanted to play for the city

something special

mr. Banyon Sam Presti a partnership that

we had there was a great two years there

for me you know helped me find my way

back home and very appreciative of that

moment it's pretty dope it's pretty

awesome

I remember uh when I was in India and we

drafted why I was a little confused by

it because I was the two Gardere and

Quietus of composition and I was pretty

nervous for that competition I was

coming but would be fast for that and

knowing what I know now being the player

that I am the player he developed into I

wish they would have kept at bay

special things in Indiana play it's

great to fast sports where we had now

you're both here in LA it just seems

like it's this was destined there's

postal play together so here we are

Thank You mr. Baumer hello Frank coach

lar way

[Applause]

[Music]

Leonard

[Applause]

oh yeah me too just before I get started

on my clickers you know I think the

wrong director things you know I have

social media so paragraph or whatever

like I was going to say just think of

Toronto the city of the country you know

it's a great amazing season best Parade

ever thanks to the doctors for you know

delivering my baby my baby boy he's

three months now and still healthy

also when also we just wanted to you

know thank the city as far as the

restaurants you know giving up that

quiet died throughout the playoffs took

advantage of that

you know the players he already knows

context facetiming will talk

coaches staff as well and the whole

organization really just think the whole

see thank you

but now I'm on my next journey I think

we've got a great feature Paul is always

a player that I wanted to play with like

you just saying and I got dropped into

the faces of Mike they already got a you

know toy player pretty much you know as

our career is moved forward you know

I'll see how it develops er develop and

I wonder if we would have stayed in

Indiana

you know we're here together in LA both

Southern Cal guys play right down the

street with each other in a Honda Center

not with each other but game after one

another championship game then watching

them since then you know now me on the

Clippers and is just I think we got

something special we could make history

here and you know we got the right team

that you receive Lawrence and Doc

championship head coach and I'm excited

you know watching that video that they

just presented all ready to go

[Applause]

we're gonna open it up for questions

here in just a second they'll be some

wireless mics passed around we are live

on Fox so if you could please state your

name and affiliation and wait for the

microphone before you talk it would be

appreciated by all I'll start it off

while I'll send it your way first what

does it mean to be playing basketball

for you here in Los Angeles in front of

friends and family means a lot to me you

know these are the Clippers probably one

of the first NBA games I can't obviously

it's a different staff organization now

as far as the people that's leading it

but just be able to you know friends my

family hood you know jar to the game

watch me players you know method and

they will just enjoy the time here it is

gonna be great oh how exciting is for

you that your basketball career brings

you back here to Los Angeles I think the

same as you know what Clyde said I'll

just family friends just being able to

be here full-time the interactions I

have with you know people are grew up

people that's been around since I've

been a kid I'm here

be touched am able to you know be here

full-time be around my niece nephews my

kids here dirty work their cousins

it's just you know I think it's a great

fit all around the longest month played

back home and see what that was like do

something from a hometown so I'm I think

now I'm here raise your hand

name affiliation wireless mic should be

passed around of course the first

question always goes to generations

welcome home what does it mean to you

that all these young people here and

business rumbles for your press

conference and the other hitters

what was it like and what was it about

the Clippers it may be one poison to

them when you have so many options

for me I grew up a Clippers fan I think

I answered the first part first I think

this is pretty awesome I was as much as

the Clippers fan I was I was a Kobe fan

Kobe like was my so I think now what

Meatwad can do we didn't you know

inspire the next generation to want to

go out in that quote I think how we play

it's a lost art in the NBA what God's

gonna get after it on both ends and

that's how Kobe was for me he was a guy

that didn't care who he matched up

against foods from play against he

wanted to be beaten both hands and that

was what I was used to watching throwing

up so I think for us we get that the

same opportunity to give back to the

next generation kind of rebranding

basketball in essence but you know

Clippers been my team so for me it was a

chance to come back home and be a part

of something that was already special

I'm not a guy that coming with an ego

you know that um demand like I want to

be a part of something special I want to

help build something special and you

know this is surreal be home do it for a

team that I grew up in and wanted to be

a part of ever since they missed out

being trapped that wasn't all that

wasn't on Steve's time so nobody's here

so it's cool let that roads go away

you know for me

we'll just feel like you know the dark

being a championship head coach you know

that's something that I wanted

experience coach and the front office is

you know very uh transparently you know

they want to win I want to win again I

know just this opportunity for us that

just build our own you know what I mean

to make history they haven't been to a

Finals they haven't won a finals so you

know that was something big and exciting

for me to you know make my decision

guys damn lucky with the Los Angeles

Times question for both of you

there's a culture that's anyplace around

a little bit of team that played a

certain style with a certain intensity

Lassie

I'm curious how much of what was here

last year and certified and you factor

in your decision I think is just how I

play you know pretty much just as good

but it says black top team they're going

hard they have it all with me as far as

I'm seeking every attention you know

it's not my night or not my game you

know I'm willing to pass the ball and do

it what it takes to win I feel like they

have that culture yeah I mean that was

the biggest attraction with just how

hard they play and I mean we coached up

honestly getting everything out of this

players

I mean asked us such a special gear

postgrads you should see their

connection on Cory

you know everybody's on the same page

their buttocks ability one another and

everybody elevated you know their canes

so you know to be a part of that that

you know camaraderie would be a part of

what they already had just sprinkling

will be know how to offer you know

that's that's what made it such an

attractive attractive you know spot for

me yet I'm gonna shell one of these been

uh I'm gonna try to ask two questions if

you can yeah first question is what

conversations have you guys have the doc

about how you're gonna build this team

and how you're gonna play so far and the

second question is is simply what both

you I was a free agent Paul you got here

in a different way but about two factors

into this idea that we have about player

empowerment and players getting to

choose where they want B & B where they

want to be just sort of your thoughts on

we both rank in that conversation well

to answer the first question me and doc

still got a dinner to go to he blew me

off

I'm house-hunt pretty good excuse for

right now but you know I you know I look

forward to the dinner and to really just

unravel you know figure out what

wants me what I need to do we go from

there and just with the whole player

empowerment stuff I mean I didn't do

nothing I was you know I work

click it there and you know it was a

mutual game between both of us that you

know the time was what's up and you know

we both had ideas of doing things

differently so I don't think there's

nothing wrong with it I think this

should be sure pretty even being if both

parties can be on the same page at the

end of the day they got a career as far

as you know the team and players have a

career as well so as long as there's a

mutual respect between both

with Doc you know he gave we watched a

few clips together talk had lunch but

you know this is not over yet you know

still operated was getting a room not

just us three it's gonna be a team

effort making this work the 15 kind of

bitch has to be everyone's will to know

what he needs to do is roll you know we

still got things to build on we have

still gone through the transition as you

know Paul said he's house and everybody

still trying his cell so you know that

work yourself out as far as the player

of power you mean I mean I was afraid so

I'll get you out

already

hey guys Miriam Swanson Southern

California's group welcome back

so Callie you guys Congrats Kauai on the

baby boy question you guys it's sort of

you're talking about the front office

transparency that was important because

a little bit words that and then why was

it important for you quite a fennec

business dealing it was quite during

this process just because this you know

a lot of things are made up now in

today's world with NBA you could you

know start a website or blog you know

push that out and say cause I miss my

man but it's always important to me you

know me to understand I mean everyone

who just be transparent it was good or

bad you know I feel that that Beatles a

great relationship

you know

you know once we had our meeting I felt

like they were truthful they were not

that really got out it was a dirty City

like I said we had a head coach Geter

must've made me you know the good for

how this whole orange watch might need a

little bit

yeah over here bill classy Los Angeles

Times for PG and Hawaii over here you

both grew up here you understand the

dynamics of the of the NBA in this town

and a giant shadow cast over the

Clippers by the Lakers all these years

how important it for both of you to lead

this team out of that shadow I mean as

far as the last few years as far as a

basketball standpoint favors have been

better but it's just this media you know

I mean they're gonna get the attention

the Los Angeles Lakers gonna change for

a long time but like I was saying it's

just a media aspect even if we do win

who knows how the coverage will change

over and I don't feel like I'm focused

on that I'm just wondering you know I do

things that make myself and my teammates

happy whatever is on our goal and my you

know that's gonna be my focus and drive

to

just make us happy and because if a

championship win and we're gonna get no

coverage that's fine with me

um I mean I just think Lakers as Lakers

we got our own identity we chasing

something else you know we we not

looking at the Battle of LA you know we

got bigger things in mind and bigger

goals to accomplish other in you know

the shadow and like none of that really

means anything you know they they got to

come out perform the same way we got to

come out before I think for us at the

end of the day we want to be holding

that trophy and that's all that matters

we'll build our legacy and we'll build

our our clipper nation along the way

time for one more question

no Andrew Greg from the Los Angeles

Times there's a lot of anticipation

about seeing what you two can do

together on the court but a collide last

year he had a lot of success I mean you

can warp load in at the right time for

playoffs how important is that to

approach this year this same and then

Paul what is your realistic timetable

for being back on the court coming off

here

I mean last Cheryl's I came in here you

know not fully healthy so you know we

laid out is pretty much the schedule for

myself and to see what that's the

possible fit for it for me for a long

time to everything and issue in for

what's gonna make the team better but

you know this year coming up I feel like

imma be at full strength you know it's

just one of those things you just take

it down bro to see how your body's

feeling you know it's a day that

anything if anything comes up you know

how many being season is it's a battle

82 games but the goal right now is to

play this season so we'll see what

happens for me there's no no set date I

mean I've been progressing really really

well I'm at a great point right now my

rehab you know so it's this you know

take our time look forward to returning

whenever that day is and just being

understand healthy well I'd like to

thank everybody and ask questions I

would like now to have doc Lawrence and

Steve come up we'll do the jersey

presentation both Kauai

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Applause]

[Music]

well thank you everybody for being here

we have one more thing but first we have

to get moving outside these kids have

been flawless through this whole time so

we need to get them moving but what I'm

going to ask for you to the love
