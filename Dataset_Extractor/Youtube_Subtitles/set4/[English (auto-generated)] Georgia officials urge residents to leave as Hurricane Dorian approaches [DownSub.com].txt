well look if you got property close to

the beach and you have that kind of

storm surge insert' astray your property

which I think you know if you're living

there at the time can cause issues I

don't know will if you have anything

else on on that but I mean certainly for

people you know seeing pictures of

people surfing in Florida I mean that is

not a good idea right now the storm is

going to be being honest very quickly

it'll be here in the morning and that's

the kind of things that we just want to

avoid people I mean we do not want to

have a death here in Georgia because of

the storm or because of somebody not

taking this seriously it really is a

unique storm and how slow it has moved

because it's truthfully it's sat for two

days now without moving and and as the

governor mentioned it has downgraded a

little bit in wind speed but the

expectations are that as it begins to

move it's going to be moving over warm

water again and it's gonna potentially

be building strength so this storm could

be more powerful when it reaches our

coast than it currently is and and as

the governor said the track from this

morning's forecast to this afternoon's

for class actually has moved it closer

to our coastline and when it comes to

the evacuation the only thing that I

could add to that is is that people that

stay not only are you going to be cut

off and there's going to be no stores no

place to go your power is going to be

out but your your city or counties

they're going to be cutting off the

municipal water systems and the

wastewater systems so that's something

you need to factor in your

considerations if you really want to

stay or not the reality is this if you

stay there is nothing you can do to

protect your property or save your

property the storm is going to do the

damage that's going to do regardless of

whether you're in your home or not the

only thing that you have done by staying

there is increasing the probability or

the chances that you could be injured or

worse and and for what purposes

at risk there really isn't a valid

reason for anyone to do that err on the

side of caution leave and we're going to

be very diligent and making

recommendations to the governor's office

about getting people back in when it's

safe to do that we want you to be out

and be safe and then we're gonna work

really hard to get you back to your

property so you can assess your damage

or see if you have any damage
