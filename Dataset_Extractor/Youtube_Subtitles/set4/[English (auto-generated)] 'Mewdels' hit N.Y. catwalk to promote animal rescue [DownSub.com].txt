well this year's fashion it's based on

it's a small world so we have ten cats

and nine countries represented from

around the world so of course we have

the US and we have the UK and we go as

far as Egypt we're supporting the

mayor's Alliance for New York City

animals which encompasses one hundred

and fifty shelters Vasavi was a rescue

he was dumped in a garbage can when he

was three months old and he was rescued

by a doctor I work with animals I'm a

veterinary technician as well so he was

dumped with and the doctor rescued him

and she had him for about a year or two

but he had a lot of congenital defects

his paws his respiratory is everything

and then I took a minute and I've done a

lot of workup on him to give him a

longer lifespan what feline fashion is

different everybody sees dogs and

costumes and they used to saying that

but very few people see cats in costumes

so it's a fun way of raising awareness

and the cats don't whine their

professional Mutis

or I should say perfectional noodles and

it's fun
