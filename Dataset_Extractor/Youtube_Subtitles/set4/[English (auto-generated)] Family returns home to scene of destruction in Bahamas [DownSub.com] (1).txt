they are images that immediately put you

there a family escaping their home

forced out by rising floodwaters now

taping it isn't most people's first

instinct but the man with the camera is

also a journalist I'm coming

I just saved some photo

this was photographer Tim Allen

returning to his home two days later for

the first time the escape was through

the window going back in they used the

door Ellen would spend much of the time

recovering memories photographs of his

children and his wife the woman whose

decisions he says saved their lives

she turned the power off she said the

window not the front door

Ellen's home is about three kilometers

from the ocean he says he never even

considered flooding the water hit

suddenly it rose incredibly quickly

about a foot in a matter of minutes they

considered going to the attic but

figured they'd be trapped and said they

went out searching for higher ground

there the current was very strong it was

cold water they were explaining they

were shaking no Ellen is able to

describe the harrowing escape almost

clinically what he has trouble with is

something else it's incredible they have

at the amount of outreach that Pyrrhus

since his family story got out Palin

says support has been pouring in and

it's needed you know we're all wearing

the same clothes that we escaped this

house in so sorry

so it's just really good to get that

support and know that you can rebuild

like we'll just find another house and

just start again it's a cliche to say

everything is just stuff as long as

everyone is safe but for Allen the

things that were lost can be replaced

the family members who made it out

couldn't have been

my carbs from global news
