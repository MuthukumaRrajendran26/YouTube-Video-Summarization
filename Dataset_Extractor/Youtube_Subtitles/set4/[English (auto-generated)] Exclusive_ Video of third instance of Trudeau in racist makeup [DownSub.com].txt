interest in this story is not confined

just to Canada the Canadian Prime

Minister Justin Trudeau has apologized

after a fir picture of him in brown face

surface it has made international

headlines the leader once seen as a

champion of progressive ideals now

splashed across the world in brown and

black face our Ottawa bureau chief

Mercedes Stevenson broke the story about

the latest images of Trudeau in

blackface Mercedes what more do we know

about that video well Donna we know that

it is Justin Trudeau because the Liberal

war room has confirmed that to us and

that it was some time in the early 1990s

beyond that the Liberals have not had

much to say about why he was wearing

that racist makeup in those images

they've explained the other images for

theatrical that one was a play that one

was a themed party but they have refused

to elaborate on what he was doing in

this video as to why he was in full

blackface from head to toe so that's a

big question that remains at this point

we know that the source and the

Conservative Party that brought this to

us said that it was on a whitewater

rafting trip you can see in the

background there is somebody wearing a

life jacket in that image we've asked at

the de Liberal Party about that

specifically as well and they've not

responded to it so still a lot of

questions about what exactly he was

doing here and questions about why he

didn't reveal it earlier because he said

that he found it embarrassing and didn't

disclose it during the vetting process

listen to what he said to reporters

earlier today I never talked about this

quite frankly I was embarrassed it was

not something that represents the person

I've become

the leader I try to be and it was really

embarrassing so there's this question

Donna of how many other times has this

happened and Justin Trudeau didn't seem

able to remember that today he was asked

he would not put a number on how

frequently this had happened that

suggests the perhaps the Liberals are

concerned that there could be more of

these images to come out also he's not

the only person across the Canadian

political spectrum that is facing this

tonight the Conservatives have a

candidate named Tamara Jenson who is

running in Langley BC images of her

apparently from 2016 have surfaced on

social media she's not wearing blackface

in the photos but she is posing with a

number of actors who are in blackface so

this is really a new question for

Canadian politics as parties are going

to have to look at their candidates and

figure out how many may have something

that's embarrassing and this negative in

their past
