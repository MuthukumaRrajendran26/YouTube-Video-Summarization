it was just before 3 p.m. yesterday when

our officers with York Regional Police

were called to the residence that you

see behind me here on castlemore Avenue

in Markham

it's just east of Ming GAE Avenue for a

report that were part that there were

possibly multiple people injured inside

the residence when our officers arrived

they did find a man at the front door

the residence that man was taken into

custody and has been held in custody

ever since shortly after that our

officers did go inside the residence and

that's where they located the bodies of

four people all deceased I can tell you

that those people were not transported

to hospital they were all deceased at

the scene last night was a very active

and ongoing investigation inside the

house the coroner did attend as well as

officers from our Forensic

Identification unit I can tell you that

this scene is going to be held for quite

some time as there's a lot of work for a

Forensic Identification to be doing

inside the residence here I'd also like

to update at this time that the man that

we do have in custody has now been

charged he's 23 year old men has zalman

last name is spelt said AM am 23 years

old from the city of Markham now facing

four charges of first-degree murder he

has appeared in court this morning and

you've been getting updates that you can

from the courts from there I can also

tell you that the identification process

for the deceased is going to take quite

some time as post-mortems need to be

done by the coroner once those post

mortems are complete we'll be able to

advise who the deceased are but at this

point in time I can tell you that

there's three adult women and one adult

man all deceased that's that's pretty

much it that we have for the update to

so far we are not looking for any

further suspects in this case at this

time

we do believe that the man we have in

custody that's now been charged is

responsible for these murders and now

facing four charges of first-degree

murder we want to reassure the community

that say York Regional Police has been

here throughout the night been here ever

since we got that report and I can

guarantee this community is very

concerned there were two hundred plus

people last night when I was here at the

scene and we want to reassure them that

we do have this person in custody he's

now facing charges and if anyone needs

any sort of emotional support or help

dealing with this very traumatic event

we'd urged them to seek that

help and support that they might need

anything except the suspect

at this point in time until we have the

identification done with the coroner

we're not providing any information on

any sort of relationships we need to get

that identification process done once we

have that we can then provide with a

little bit more information but I also

want to remind everybody this is now a

case before the courts it's for charges

of first-degree murder obviously the

most serious offenses in this country so

as far as information at this point I'm

coming oh we're going to be very limited

in what we can provide as most of that

is now evidence before the courts as far

as the injuries go we're not providing

that information cause of death as well

we can't provide until the coroner has

completed the postmortem

so other than to say that when our

officers did enter the house all four

people were deceased they were not

transported to hospital suffering from

injuries they were all deceased inside

the residence can you just help the

suspect

we're not providing any information on

where the suspect reside or where the

suspect was from other than to say this

the man charges from the city

we're not providing details on where

that first call came from at this point

in time other than to say that the

report that we had received was that

there may be possible multiple people

possibly injured inside the residence

that's the call that we responded to and

then when we got to the front door of

the house that's where we confronted the

man at that 23 year old man who's now in

custody and then officers went inside

and found the bodies of the deceased

people we don't provide any information

I need sort of background he was

involved with police prior to his first

name is spelled M e n8 a said last name

Zalman Zed am a n 23 years old from the

city of Markham

the accused was taken into custody when

officers have got here to the scene they

confronted him at the front door he was

taken into custody

then officers went inside for that I'm

not aware if there was anybody else

inside the house

I'm unsure of what the the response

actually was other than the report of

four people possibly injured numerous

officers work here at the scene when

they took that man into custody then

obviously significant police presence

I don't have that timeline available

this point in time

other than to say that it was just

before 3:00 p.m. that we received that

report of four people possibly injured

inside we're not giving out the

relationship at this point in time as we

have to wait until the post-mortems are

done to confirm identity of those

deceased we don't give any prior history

by the call type I'm not sure exactly

what the call type was in a call type is

what our officers would be responding to

other than to say the information our

officers were given was that there was

for multiple people possibly injured

inside the residence that's what we were

responding to

suspect posted

you know there's lots of information

that's not available at this point in

time and like I mentioned this is a case

now before the courts four counts of

first-degree murder so any sort of

evidentiary information some of that

we're not gonna be able to provide at

this point in time do you know

I don't know if there's been any

next-of-kin notification at this point

that's all I have for now thank you very

much
