we've gotten too used to this these are

our communities places where our

families and our friends live our loved

ones live and as a native Ohio it's so

heartbreaking to see this gun violence

exact in such a heavy toll so close to

home I just met one of the sons of one

of the women that we lost last week and

it's heartbreaking to see heartbreaking

to feel but giving up is really not an

option we have to be able to live

without the fear of being shot we have

to come together to make sure we do

something about it we don't have to live

like this

there are meaningful actions that we can

all take to stop gun violence in this

country

we've heard politicians in their

thoughts and prayers while failing to

act we are done with that

we're tired of American children growing

up thinking active shooter drills at

school are normal

we're tired of hearing people say that

they worried about being shot every time

they go into a public place like a mall

or a movie theater a restaurant of

school a house of worship or a music

venue

we're tired of bigotry and hate turning

lethal because of easy access to guns we

can do better and we must do better
