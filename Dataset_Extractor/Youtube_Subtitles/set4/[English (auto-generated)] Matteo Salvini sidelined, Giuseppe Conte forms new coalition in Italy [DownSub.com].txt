Guiseppe comte's term as Prime Minister

looked to be over after just 14 months

but a week after stepping down amid a

political crisis the independent

academic is back asked by president

sergio mattarella to form a new

coalition they were no fussing wolf to

delicata the country is in a very

delicate phase he said we must get out

of the political uncertainty that

uncertainty was triggered earlier in

August when the far-right League party

pulled out of their coalition with the

populist five star movement incidentally

personally the party tone

Conte blasted league leader Matteo

salvini for putting political interests

before the country salvini was looking

to capitalize on strong polling numbers

to trigger an election and become Prime

Minister

clearly salvini is calculated I think

that is quite obvious rather than step

into power salvini ended up sidelined by

his former coalition partners in the

five star movement they shocked mani by

teaming up with their political enemies

the center-left Democratic Party and it

turns out that a lot of and peace

especially in the fight star are very

aware that if there are fresh elections

they are now gonna be returned to

Parliament five star and the Democrats

have similar economic and environmental

policies but their biggest conflict

could be Mediterranean migration five

star supported Interior Minister salvini

in his decision to close Italian ports

to rescue ships so that's why I'm saying

it's a big question mark and I don't

know myself out there gonna square the

circle salvini took to Facebook on

Thursday Runa Gokul intentionally poll

Drona throwing back the same accusation

he faced a week ago that of power

grabbing he's calling on his supporters

to join a protest march in October the

new coalition still faces an online vote

among five star members and some

challenging math in a Senate vote noting

his air

easy in Italian politics Redman Shannon
