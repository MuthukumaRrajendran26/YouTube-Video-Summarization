today is not a celebration it's a deep

sigh of relief we have lost so many of

our heroes and sadly more will continue

to get sick and war will die and today

is not about the politicians who are

here to serve the public we work for the

people here standing with us and those

who couldn't be here today it's all

about them their families their selfless

service and that they answered the call

of duty when our nation asks it's about

the people standing behind me who have

been here for weeks and months and years

over and over and over again coming back

here where they never should have had to

do that so before I answer these so

before I introduce our speakers I just

want to thank so many of the people who

worked so hard to make this bill

severs and Margaret Alvarez I now like

to introduce Senator Chuck Schumer and I

can tell you you've never had a fighter

like Senator Schumer on your side

someone who's never given up who's never

given in who's made sure he stood by for

every single time this bill passed

senator schumer thank you senator

Gillibrand and let me thank you for the

amazing job you have done she worked the

floor endlessly getting names that we

never thought like cotton and Cruz who

could be on this bill and the proof for

the pudding the great job she did and

all the people behind me did is set in

two numbers 97 and to 97 and to

righteousness sometimes sometimes in

this mangled town sometimes prevails and

thank God today it did I want to thank

all the people in Kirsten thanked most

of all all the folks behind us now they

can do what they want to do they never

wanted to come here they would have

rather been with their families with

their brothers and sisters who they knew

were ill with their friends ministering

caring as our first responders are

trained to do and have always done not

on 9/11 but on every day and now they

can go back and do what they really

wanted to do they didn't want to be here

they didn't like being here but they had

a sense of duty and nevertheless they

persisted and we've achieved this goal

I'd like to say particularly we have

great 21st century heroes whose names

are a droga and Pfeiffer and Alvarez and

I'd say to the Zadroga and Pfeiffer and

Alvarez families many of whom are here

your losses painful as they are are not

in vain as today shows the men you lost

and all the others did what the Bible

says we should all do not curse the

darkness but light a candle and today

that candle burns very very brightly so

to all of our friends who made this

happen for all of us who now breathe one

gigantic sigh of relief particularly the

men and women behind me thank you

this is tough times for America

sometimes we doubt its goodness and it's

awfully hard to have that good shine

through but today it did thank god it

did let it be a beacon to everyone else

I put on this play at 9:00 12:01 I wear

it every day

it represented close to 3,000 people who

were lost and unfortunately every day

this flag represents more people but

we'll never take it off as long as there

are brave people who stood up for us and

this flag and all flags will remind us

that we have to stand up for them who's

next

next speaker is senator Cory Gardner who

had the courage and bravery to lead the

fight on behalf of the Republicans in

our chamber quite pregnant

Thank You senator Gillibrand for your

incredible leadership on this on

September 11th the days following we all

remember what our country was going

through the flags that were waving and

draped across bridges people standing on

street corners rallying to their

nation's cause the men and women

standing in this group today didn't

hesitate to take that call I can't put

into words the people that I have met

with here or a home who did so much for

this country not knowing that it could

cost them their life for a loved one's

life not knowing they would ever doubt

Congress and the resolve of this place

to do what is right but out of the ashes

and debris of September 11th arose hope

and courage and strength and commitment

and those acts resulted in a vote today

of 97 to - I won't forget we won't

forget and today you know all of them

that this country stands with you and

for you thank you for your work you

resolve your sacrifice your commitment

and courage because when this country is

called upon again we can all say please

stand up because we have proven that we

will stand up for you that's what we've

done

our next two speakers are John feel 9/11

first responder and 9/11 health advocate

and John Stewart you know Mitch

McConnell said politics is a contact

sport these people lead the lumba they

they tackle the Congress and then the

Senate and I can't be more proud of them

you know when I was here a couple weeks

ago we tested on the house I said this

is no longer about legislation we knew

we were gonna get the bill passed this

is about the bond and the friendship of

those on the hill those in the media and

those who I walk the halls of Congress

with passing this legislation there's no

joy there's no comfort yes I cried with

John but that was to exhale that was to

get 18 years of pain and suffering out

and I believe it's out I'm gonna ask my

team now to put down your swords and

pick up your rapes and go home and

hopefully we don't have to come back

when I'm going to miss the most about DC

is nothing and no offense to Chuck and

Kirsten and Carolyn and Peter who and

I'm not being biased there dad better

people than they are elected officials

and they're pretty good elected

officials and I and I mean that

sincerely and you know to Mitch

McConnell he kept his word to me he kept

his word to those men that were in the

meeting with me and my while I don't

always agree with his politics he was

honest he was sincere and everything he

said he did so I think Senate Majority

Leader Mitch McConnell that's for Rand

Paul and Mike Lee told you so we whipped

your asses 97 2 to 97 when when does the

Senate ever get that I mean I'm just so

proud of these guys behind women behind

me what Dave accomplished and what they

sacrificed that they drove down 95

countless time stopping and rest was

taking medications having their wives

and yelling at me make sure my husband

takes his medication watching them throw

up watching them shake watching them cry

their toll on these guys physically and

mentally I don't know how much longer

they would have made it but I know we

would not have made it to December where

we would have got attached to a larger

vehicle in 2010 we got unanimous consent

the 2015 we got attached to a larger

vehicle we saw an opportunity we had a

small window and we took advantage of it

and we're leaving

DC on all terms and we're going out with

dignity and class we got I was straight

up and down vote 97 to 2 that is the

most amazing thing I've ever seen and

I'll leave you with this in the

beginning of change the patriot is a

scarce man brave hated and scorned

when his cost exceeds the timid join him

for then of course nothing to be a

patriot Mark Twain

my next speaker is John Stewart and I

have to say this is a man who didn't

have to do what he did he spent all the

capital he had gained over a lifetime of

success and he spent it helping the

people here yes I think we can all agree

on the real hero hard not to see it that

way there's been the honor of my life to

work with the men and women behind me

today it's about the heart James who

drove good and Joe in the integrity of

rape fight fur and the courage of Lou

Alvarez and the tenacity of John feel

they they lifted this 9/11 community on

their shoulders and they carried them

home and I will always be so proud to

have been associated with it and we can

never repay all that the 9/11 community

has done for our country but we can stop

penalizing them and today is that day

that they can excel because

unfortunately the the pain and suffering

of what these heroes continue to go

through is going to continue there have

been too many funerals too many hospices

these families deserve better and I'm

really I'm hopeful that today begins the

process of being able to heal without

the burden of having to advocate

and I will follow you whatever your next

adventure shall be our next speaker is

congresswoman carolyn Maloney who has

worked this bill for almost 20 years and

she has worked from the very beginning

as the first person to introduce it and

someone who never gave up first of all I

want to recognize and thank the first

responders and the survivors and their

families for their selfless and tireless

work on this bill and thank you to my

colleagues in the House a speaker Pelosi

leader Hoyer and my very good friend

congressman Nadler and King for their

leadership Nadler cannot be with us he

gives his warmest regards and they led

us to 402 to 12 in the house I think

it's the most strongest bipartisan vote

building on that is this vote today in

the Senate I I thank our advocates uh

John field John Stewart and really the

the real Twin Towers of New York the

inspiration to me throughout this bill

their work on that day the police and

fire New York Fire Department York

Police Department for what they do for

us every day and today of the

extraordinary leadership of senators

Gillibrand Schumer and Gardner were

evidenced with this very strong vote

where we passed the never forget the

heroes James Zadroga ray Pfeiffer and

Luis Alvarez permanent authorization of

the September 11th Victims Compensation

Fund Act that's the title of the bill

and it would not have happened without

all the people standing here today labor

advocates families everyone it has been

an honor to stand beside you in this

fight I just wish it hadn't taken so

long and that we hadn't lost so many

friends along the way including the 18

we've lost in the past two weeks since

louis alvarez died this moment is for

James Zadroga a fight for Louis Alvarez

and what they stand for and all of the

others who have gotten sick or passed

away because of their time spent at

Ground Zero the Pentagon and the

Shanksville crash site the vote today is

a win for our country and the heroes and

survivors who were there for us the 9/11

community now knows that they and their

families have the measure of security

that comes with the permanent funding of

the Victims Compensation Fund

permanently for their lives we we have a

moral obligation to take care of the

people who took care of us and those who

take care of them first and foremost for

what they did on 9/11 in the days and

weeks and months that passed afterwards

but secondly because of the toxic lie

that our government told them that it

was safe to work on the pile when it was

not we want to underscore and be clear

that 9/11 was an attack on our nation

not just on New York and the people who

need and deserve this program live in

all 50 states and in 433 out of the 435

congressional districts if you remember

9/11 you remember that we as a nation

vowed to never forget today the Senate

kept that promise today we did the right

thing for the right reason for the right

people today is a day of which all

Americans can be proud

god bless our heroes in our nation and

thank you

[Applause]

all right our net speaker I feel like

the cutoff I would wear the coat till we

pass the bill well done our next speaker

is Jose Drogo the father of NYPD

detective James Zadroga was the first to

die because of a 911 illness

[Applause]

hey is it today is a great day let me

tell you it started for this a Drogo

family December 2001 he came home sick

we went to the hospital we went to

Columbia Presbyterian

that's all monologist in this state and

you know what he told us I'm not gonna

treat it and that went on for five years

trying to get him help try to get him

treatment went to hospital torn out of

hospital at the hospital spoke to news

TV stations nobody wanted the story

nobody wanted to talk about it took his

death for it to come to light that

people were sick and only then did the

TV challenge from down News Channel come

down and took up the story if it wasn't

for that medical examiner in New Jersey

who had the guts to come out and say he

died from 9/11 who knows how much longer

it would have been before the governor

came to realize not realized meant that

people were dying from 9/11 illnesses

I'm gonna thank a lot of people here I

know I'm gonna forget a lot of people

but we have to mention the people that

were there from the start I I was asked

to speak in front of a congressional

hearing and Senator Hillary Clinton was

there she took up the fight she was the

first one to take up the fight for the

responders she got billed as

for the police and the fire and later on

for all responders congresswoman Maloney

was right there with her I will never

forget her I never forget nilly and

Senator Gillibrand picked up the fight

when Hillary moved on to other things

first time on TV

Neil Caputo 20 seconds on TV speaking

about 911 about people dying I said

didn't yell I said 20 seconds this is

after this game don't worry kid

this is going to go this is going to go

past didn't know what TV recognition did

but we moved on I'd like to thank the

North the NYPD they were great

taking care of Tyler in after her father

died one thing they do they take care

efforts at Grant Ground Zero I am here

to be raised voice Ray was part of this

team to feel good foundation team they

were working to get the passage of

health care bills over the years getting

the support they needed Ray's passion

was to help

walas brothers and sisters dying from

9/11 illnesses and Ray came down here

wheelchair up and down the halls and

doing the best he could unfortunately

his hips ray was a husband a father and

a firefighter which he lived for where

in pain for seven years with 11th

surgery

work for the responders have had paid

off

and I just want to thank the dissenter

to have some peace and not have to worry

maybe day by day or year by year whether

or not they're going to be cut off from

the support that they have earned you

know almost eighteen years ago this

nation was attacked and starting on that

day and all the days and weeks and

months that followed

we're proud of our own but it was

workers across all the sectors that

served it was in the recovery and rescue

and then cleanup stages that everyone

from the trades and the electricians

everyone who was at Ground Zero and

sacrificed their own health to serve a

nation and the last thing I'm thankful

for having been at this for a long long

time mr. leader as you know is that I'm

thankful that we won't have to come back

speak this morning while I was on the

train down emotions for every first

responder behind me are right back to

911 I didn't want to fumble my words so

I wrote them down good afternoon the

bill not only represents the sacrifices

at 37 Port Authority police officers 23

New York City police officers and 343

New York City firefighters but the

countless first responders that came

running to Ground Zero to assist with

the rescue recovery efforts as all of

you are aware first responders came from

all departments across our country this

is also about Patriots patriotism why

our ironworkers Operating Engineers the

building trades doctors nurses and

countless others that ran to help us

this is about ordinary citizens that

went to work and we're the victims of

the worst attack on American soil since

Pearl Harbor

this is about every citizen who was

affected by the attacks every family

member that lost and continued a loss

lose loved ones myself and my fellow

responders came running when you needed

us and now 18 years later you're

honoring your commitment to never forget

for our brothers and sisters that are

sick and dying we will never forget your

commitment in sacrifice or your families

good afternoon

on behalf of New York City Fire offices

both active and retie I'm here to say

thanks I'll keep my comments brief but I

would have to say thank you to New York

allegation both in the house and in the

Senate because they stood there with us

from day one right through this play

it's been a long journey a long fight it

was a fight with many faces but in the

end we came together as a voice of one

and out of that dust out of those ashes

Rose the words never forget never forget

I'm here to tell you that from coast to

coast America did not forget and what we

witnessed in the house and today in the

Senate our elected officials they stood

by those words and they finally never

forgot us thank you

[Applause]

our next speaker is Mario salento our

president of the New York State Senator

Schumer's making fun of my Brooklyn

accent already the dues in the dollars

away I'm driving Fitzgerald president

UFA I got to keep my comments brief also

I want to thank the New York delegation

this would never have gotten done

they've been fighting for this for a

long time I think person as long as

you've been on you're the newbie but

we're very proud of the New York

delegation and how they got bipartisan

politics but the vote today I'm not

gonna call it bipartisan politics I'm

gonna call it that it was bipartisan

humanity and twelve people from the

house and two from the Senate proof that

they don't have enough humanity to have

oded this into legislation so I'm proud

that it's got done I guess I'm happy the

only problem is is that somebody has to

get sick or die to collect this money so

there's not a lot of celebrating on this

it's important that every every time

that somebody is in that position they

always say all I'm worried about is my

family will they be taking care of I

know they the police the fire department

we take care of our own I'm sure

everybody is in that but those are the

two that I'm familiar with I think that

will continue but having this money

there will help as they as they are

getting ready to meet their maker and

it's important so thank you very much

thank you to all the politicians across

the country that did the right thing

thank you

our next speaker is Mario salento our

president of the New York State afl-cio

integrity and Thank You Jon and Jon feel

it goes without saying thank you let me

just say this you know I'm proud having

worked at the State afl-cio for over 27

years to say this that 18 years ago the

labor movement made a promise throughout

the state public sector unions and

private sector unions and building trade

unions from Buffalo to Brooklyn to Long

Island and everywhere in between that we

would stand side by side and shoulder to

shoulder with our brothers and sisters

who led this fight to be there to

support them to be there for whatever it

was that they need and and today we kept

our promise to all of them and we keep

in mind one last thing is that you know

in the labor movement we consider

ourselves a family we call each other

brothers and sisters for a reason but we

also know intuitively that we don't have

to be blood-related to be a family and

we don't have to look alike or talk

alike or sound alike to be a family a

family is a group of people who join

together for a lot of different reasons

who care about one another who helped

one another who support one another and

who pick each other up when one of us

falls down and if you pick on one of us

you have to deal with all of us that's a

family and today we showed what a true

family is we show the family

of the labor movement we also also

showed that we can be a family of

citizens as Americans and as human

beings and I think that's why today 6x

all day and why we're all thankful to be

here thank you very much our last

speaker is Lila Nordstrom a student at

Stuyvesant High School during 9/11 my

name is Lila I was a student at

Stuyvesant High School on 9/11

Stuyvesant is three blocks in the World

Trade Center and we were there for about

eight months of the cleanup and I'm a

little bit at loss for words because

I've never actually gotten to speak at

one of these things without having to

threaten to see everyone back here in

five years this has been sort of the

work of my entire adult life at this

point I'm 35 I made my first trip down

here at 22 and every five years I've

sort of I've been coming back and

telling the same story and trying to

convince the same people that the same

issues still matter and so it's a huge

relief that I don't have to make that

threat this time a huge amount of thanks

is obviously owed to our wonderful New

York delegation to carolyn maloney and

Peter King for ushering this through to

Jerry Nadler for always making sure that

the survivor community was included in

this legislation for always making sure

that we were a part of the discussion

and then of course to our great New York

state senators for assuring this through

the Senate and also to my classmates and

the many responders who live outside of

New York who made calls to their local

representatives and let them know that

this was a constituent issue for them as

well I've been living in California for

12 of the 13 years I've been doing this

a lot of my classmates live outside of

the city outside of New York State and

for all of us it was really important

that we see this kind of unity in the

vote because this really is a

constituent issue for every single

senator a lot of us who do this work

don't just do the work of educating you

guys about our exposures we also do the

considerably less glamorous work of

reaching out to our community making

sure that they are taking care of making

sure

that they are aware these services are

available to them and able to take

advantage of them and having the danger

of these programs expiring every five

years made that work much more difficult

so it's with huge relief that we will be

able to go back home and engage in that

less glamorous but much more important

work without our communities worrying

that they were gonna be forgotten in a

few years without people worrying that

if they don't get sick by next year they

have no one you know no one will have

their back and as part of that work I

have one final message which is I know

survivors don't see ourselves reflected

in coverage of this issue very often so

I just want to reiterate that this

program is for us - it is for you if you

are a survivor if you are someone who

like me got sent in to lower Manhattan

as a child and spent eight months in a

toxic environment if you are somebody

who had you know who was encouraged by a

by a government lie that you know to go

back into your home and was not given

proper guidance about how to clean that

up if you returned to work and had smoke

blowing into your window for four months

and heard again and again that there you

know there was nothing to be afraid of

and only now or finding out that there

was something to be afraid of then you

have done your part to earn access to

these programs if I could cut out of my

life the amount of time that I spend

convincing six survivors that they are

worthy of these programs that it is ok

to apply to them that they should not

feel guilty about taking advantage of

these programs I could probably write a

novel or learn a new language or

something um but so as a final note I

just want to make sure that survivors

all over all over the nation realize

that these programs are for us too and

I'm thrilled that from now on we'll be

able to look forward instead of looking

backwards and trying to continually

revisit this part of the issue

there are ways in which the survivor

community will you know there are big

implications for us in the larger

healthcare debate there are research

implications for us and we want to make

sure that we can talk about those issues

instead of just constantly revisiting

this money thank you so much

I just want to thank everyone who's here

today for coming for being part of this

effort and I just want to say thank you

one last time to the men and women

standing with us today thank you

[Applause]
