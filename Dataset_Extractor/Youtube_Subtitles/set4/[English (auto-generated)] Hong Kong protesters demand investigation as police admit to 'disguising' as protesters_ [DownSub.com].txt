Hong Kong has just seen its darkest

weekend in his contemporary history we

saw Kwai Fong station being turned into

a gas chamber and protestors being

pushed down a moving escalator by the

police at iku where they had also fired

at the protesters within a meatus range

of an airgun the protesters are

repeatedly being cold and treated like

cockroaches by the police

such dehumanization is a psychological

manipulation that was once used by

Hitler's regime to sanction and justify

the genocide of the Jews who were surely

dehumanized by the Nazi the police must

put must be put under the investigation

of Independence Committee immediately

the police are also suspected to have

incited and committed violence and

framing the protesters for these acts it

has been documented in life videos that

some policemen dressed up s-- protesters

by putting on black tops and gas masks

have infiltrated the crowd

these Undercovers were also seen wearing

earphones with which they might have

communicated with their colleagues I

know you're gonna fall digging you know

I was in shock so - so I see Ghana so

it's in danger I'm motivated what's he

doing

more data time I killed it can I see

good yeah we like my God we're gonna die

tonight
