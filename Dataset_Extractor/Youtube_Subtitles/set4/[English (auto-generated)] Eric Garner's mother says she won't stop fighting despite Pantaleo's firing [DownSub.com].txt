I thank you all for coming out with the

support that you have been giving me for

five years it's been five long years

that I have fought this for fight

I have not fought it alone because many

of you have been out here with me many

of you have been here from day one we

fought and fought to get the NYPD to

give us a phone number so the CCRB

we bring charges against Pantaleo we

heard that for fight for a couple of

years and then what they do to try to

appease us they give it all to us on the

anniversary on the fourth anniversary

the leave of the fourth anniversary of

my son's death that was supposed to

appease us well let me tell you it

didn't it just made me more angrier

but you know what Pantaleo you your your

regime London your can appeal all you

want but I'm still out here I'm out here

for the long runs you come out here

against me I'm out here and you cannot

scare me away gear Pantaleo you may have

lost your job but I lost a son January

I'm sorry July 17 2014

I lost my son you cannot replace that

you can get another job maybe at Burger

King

okay so much but you know it's just it's

just as heartening to go through this

and like we say we're not finished we

have other officers that we have to go

after would you have heard the names we

know the wrongdoing that they have done

I won't say that I was totally surprised

I am just glad that he made a right and

a conscious decision on my son's behalf

because we all saw the chokehold so

there was no denying that everybody

recommended it would have been such a

disgrace for him to go another way when

three people before him recommended

firing him you know if who was he gonna

listen to Pat Lynch

it

do say who catlins oh well don't know

anything

he can't take credit for that because

five years ago he could have fired

that's right charges was recommended in

2015 and nothing was done that's right

he could have fired him on the spot but

he was waiting for the DOJ as he said he

thought that the higher power would have

recommended remedy charges but the

criminal charges could have came please

just give him off the force Daniel

Pantaleo being fired goes to this woman

right whoo whoo
