hello I'm Mercedes Stevenson and this is

the West block politics perspectives and

players climate change and the

environment are set to be front and

center in the upcoming federal election

campaign extreme weather is being felt

from coast to coast to coast damaging

floods in the east devastating forest

fires in the West and searing heat waves

in central Canada leaving homes and

lives destroyed many climate scientists

are drawing a link between extreme

weather and climate change last year

insured damage from severe weather

events reached 1.9 billion dollars

according to the Insurance Bureau of

Canada for the first time ever the Bank

of Canada flag climate change as a

vulnerability for the national economy

but could Canada benefit from a warming

climate the point is it isn't the dire

catastrophe that you keep hearing about

a Canada would in fact be a beneficiary

just in terms of the the arable land

issue the three prairie provinces have

double the territory of France and the

the Government of Canada the Agriculture

Department estimated an increase of

between 26 and 40 percent of of arable

land potentially by 2040 and that's

that's really significant and none too

soon because the UN said that where the

world is going to need 50 percent more

food by 2050 so this is a very serious

contribution that Canada can make will

benefit but the entire world will

benefit as well

according to NASA 97% of climate

scientists believe humans are causing

global warming in climate change

glaciers are melting into the sea sea

levels are rising and many nations are

spending millions of dollars to

reinforce coastlines and relocate

residents affected by rising water so

what are the costs of climate change

joining me now from Vancouver is

chi-chan he's a professor at the

Institute for resources environment and

sustainability at the University of

British Columbia thanks for joining us

Kai

thanks for having me on the show now we

just heard from Joe Oliver former

federal finance minister he argues that

there's a lot of benefits that Canada

could see as a result of climate change

he's not arguing over whether or not it

could happen he's saying look it's not

all bad if it is happening how do you

respond to those arguments do you

believe that climate change would be a

good thing for Canada there are gonna be

some benefits for Canada for sure but

the way that Joe Oliver is presented it

is really misleading and so you know one

of the arguments is that the economy is

going to be a net neutral unless its

climate change goes to a really high

level now that's really misleading

because that's measured through GDP and

GDP as a measure of economic output

Rises when we have extreme events that

cause catastrophic damage that we then

have to repair right so those

construction activities actually

contribute a lot to the economy the way

that the GDP measures it right it

doesn't properly characterize the losses

that we experiences as individuals and

his communities he cites that Moody's

report as having more arable land that

could be farmed more areas that could be

drilled what are some of the specific

costs that Canada would incur if climate

change continues at the same rate yeah

so for every benefit there is a similar

kind of cost right and so it's true that

there is more arable land and but as

precipitation patterns change we're

gonna see less precipitation and some of

those important growing areas much

longer droughts more risk of forest

fires greater risk of floods and then in

particular up north in northern

communities we're gonna see a melting of

permafrost that is going to cause a ton

of damage to the infrastructure there

because that infrastructure is based on

the permafrost as the permafrost melts

so that's basically frozen ground

underneath then the building's really

buckle buildings and bridges and roads

buckle and just kind of sink into the

ground so there are going to be lots of

costs that are associated with climate

change and there are going to be a few

benefits and one major question is

whether those who are bearing the costs

are really being compensated for that

and I don't expect that the benefits are

actually going to

way the cost when you take a whole

perspective to it some say look the

science is clear there is consensus

there is climate change happening and it

is as a result of human activity others

say no if you look at it it's not as

clear as people think look we just had a

cold summer it can't always be warming

if I'm experiencing something that tells

me differently what does the science say

about where we're at in terms of climate

change and what's causing it so the IPCC

the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

Change is really clear and this is the

most authoritative body on climate

change they say it's virtually certain

that climate change is happening and

that it's due to human causes so there's

really no more room for doubt about that

absolutely there are natural causes that

also contribute to climate change but

it's they seem to be smaller

contributors than human caused ones

including the rise in greenhouse gases

global climate change although it's

going to warm the planet on average is

going to have regionally variable

results so when we look at the average

global temperatures it is clear that

those are rising but that manifests in

weird weather right and so some

scientists are calling it global

weirding and in order to account for

that fact that in some places we are

gonna see some cooling actually at least

during some seasons and but we're also

gonna see a lot of other strange things

like increased floods and fires etc and

speaking of those floods and fires one

of the things we talked to mr. Oliver

about was the link between climate

change and extreme weather events which

can be very expensive for governments

for individuals for insurance agencies

and he was saying that that IPCC report

doesn't clearly make the link between

climate change and extreme weather

events what do we know about the science

that that suggests whether or not there

is a link and how much do we really know

about that yeah I mean it's really clear

from my read of the IPCC that they

established that there is a very clear

link between forest fires between floods

and other kinds of extreme events

especially droughts of course with he

might be thinking more of tornadoes and

hurricanes there it is less clear

whether climate change is contributing

to an increased incidents so an increase

in

number of those extreme events but it's

pretty clear that it is contributing to

a large greater magnitude of those

extreme events so going back though to

the ones where it's more clear more

flooding for sure when you've got a

warmer atmosphere that warmer atmosphere

can hold more water and it releases it

in more it's more extreme events right

more stronger rainfall it's not the only

cause in terms of contributing to

flooding we also have land-use patterns

and um the clearing of wetlands too much

concrete basically in cities fires also

very clearly contributed to climate

change through the increase in droughts

which dries out the fuel load and then

also makes the temperatures in many

cases warmer so you've got a long dry

summer sets up basically a tinderbox and

some for us so that those those

connections are made very clearly in the

IPCC report not sure what Joe Oliver is

talking about when he refutes that CAI

there are those who say look people are

being alarmist what do you think the

consequences are if we continue at the

current rate both in terms of climate

change and in terms of the level of

action that the Canadian government is

taking for Canadians living right here

at home so there's two ways of seeing

this I mean one is to recognize that our

most important role in terms of

contributing to this problem and and

receiving impacts from global climate

change is basically our perception on

the world stage and how that roof is

reflected in foreign policy as we

receive it as well as exporting

Canadians have this reputation when you

go abroad for the most part people think

of Canada as the same place as a good

contributor to the world that a

reputation has already been eroded

somewhat due to our policy on climate

change the fact that for many years in

international climate negotiations

Canada won the fossil of the Year award

meaning that it we had the most outdated

policies the most regressive and the

most you know the most dangerous in

terms of contributing to an undermining

of the world order right so already

we're seeing can

kind of role as a responsible agent in

the world being eroded we've already

seen a lot of dangerous fires like the

one in Fort maurice Murray from a few

years ago and floods including in

Calgary in Toronto and elsewhere in

Ottawa over this last year so these

kinds of events are surely going to

continue they're going to become more

and more normal as climate change picks

up pace which it will do just because of

the inertia in the system so it's time

to get serious about turning that around

and slowing climate change down okay
