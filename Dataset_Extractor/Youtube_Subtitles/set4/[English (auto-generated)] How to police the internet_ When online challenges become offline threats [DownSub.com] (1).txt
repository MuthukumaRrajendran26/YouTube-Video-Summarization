police are adding patrols on the streets

of an entire New York City neighborhood

tonight in response to a possible uptick

of the so-called knockout game the

disturbing challenge were teens pump up

their lips a game popular years ago is

making a comeback children eating Tide

Pods they call it the tide pod challenge

I think a social media challenge is the

same kind of challenge that we've seen

kids and teenagers do for decades we do

tend to dare and challenge our friends

and there is a point where that becomes

more prevalent usually in sort of

teenage years where we're looking to

challenge our friends to be risky so I

think a social media challenge is the

same kind of idea just taken to the

landscape or the medium of social media

and the internet no dying as I mentioned

it's somewhat normal to an extent so

adolescents and teenagers it's part of

their independence seeking it's part of

them pushing the boundaries further in

their development as fully fledged

adults they began to be take more risky

behavior but also in addition to that

encouraged or dare their friends to take

more risks and engage in sort of risky

challenges and that kind of thing and

some of these things are benign and

rarely are like relatively harmless but

I think in some cases they can be

endangering to not only the person

undertaking them but also to the public

as well it's called the knockout game

where teenagers randomly attack

strangers to try sickening game playing

out on the streets of cities across

America without national trend often

caught on the video that is downright

disturbing potential victim jonathan l'm

asking walk the streets of Little Italy

one

and then the next he would spend the

summer eating smoothies out of a syringe

so we have mischief laws those laws

apply online and offline so they're not

specific to the internet the law that we

have is general enough to apply to the

internet as well as offline so generally

speaking if someone is committing a

crime and nobody knows about it until

they've posted it online it's the it's

the posting itself is not criminal in

most cases there are some exceptions but

the public the publicizing of that crime

will get police to be like hey look at

this you know we should look into this

we place a lot of value as society these

days sadly on internet faman more in the

younger populations this appetite for

internet fame has certainly increased

and I think that in combination with the

natural healthy normal developmental

desire to fit in to belong to have the

approval of your peers at that age can

be a dangerous combination with these

challenges jean-luc Jordan who went to

Mountain Ridge Middle School in Colorado

Springs died after playing a choking

game he saw on the Internet Lonnie

O'Connor first learned about the choking

game too late from a nurse in the

emergency room the night their

twelve-year-old son Evan died nearly

three years ago it's called the choking

game 11 year old Garrett Pope died doing

it a few days ago in South Carolina

consent is important because it allows

someone who's charged with assault or

some crime to say look the person asked

me to do it the person said I can do you

know I agree to this being done so when

it comes to something like property not

such a big deal when it comes to hurting

someone else then the question becomes

is that consent informed does that

person really understand what they're

consenting to and there's a general rule

that you can't

sent to being physically harmed so

someone may consent to being choked

temporarily momentarily but if that

choking leads to the person's death it's

not necessarily a defense to say that

the person consented to the choking

because the choking led to the person's

death and the person didn't inform to be

choked to death you know you want your

criminal laws you want any laws whether

they be civil or criminal to be flexible

enough to cover most situations you

don't want to have to go and fine-tune

the laws you know every every time some

new invention comes out I think our laws

need to be technologically neutral and

and in Canada for the most part they are

nibbling Mickey oh you sound clear today

but it may really the issue in a video

like that is the person licking the

ice-cream is causing mischief by

damaging the property of the supermarket

the viral video of someone in Texas

licking a container of Blue Bell ice

cream and putting it back on the shelf

inspired a copycat and that Catholic

copycat er was here in Louisiana Lenise

Martin a third will be in court today

for a bond hearing is essentially what

happened the person that says he filmed

her had himself filmed licking the Blue

Bell ice cream he Louisiana and then

after that he purchased that same

container of ice and so he arguably

didn't commit the crime of licking it

and leaving it but by posting the

content he was trying to get attention

on the Internet

[Music]

and and that statute was designed

specifically for copycats trying to get

the art are people that are doing

something so outrageous that it gets

attention initially but I think I think

there's more value for society stopping

copycats than the original perpetrator I

don't know if anybody's been convicted

it's kind of a specialty law but the

penalty is up to five hundred dollars in

six months enjoyable one or both yeah I

mean I can't speak to the law of

Louisiana and I'm not familiar with that

law but whenever we have a situation

when there's a new technology and you're

trying to take old laws and apply to new

technology that is a challenge there's

nothing new Under the Sun in terms of

you know human behavior but in terms of

taking the old laws and applying it a

lot of times it fits sometimes there may

be technical nuances that don't allow

that and that's when the legislature or

the courts need to step in to fine-tune

that I think that it's fine to use a

broad interpretation of laws that can be

expanded enough their interpretation to

apply to what's happening but there are

gonna be instances where you need to

have something specific right you know

this this statute here in Louisiana is

specifically designed to stop people

from trying to use criminal activity to

get attention on the Internet

but if you're gonna always have

situations where you're going to need to

come up with the law if you actually

want to regulate you know you obviously

you can't rely on the service providers

to like YouTube or Facebook or Instagram

to regulate themselves because they're

there it got shareholders and that's

really all they care about well I mean I

think there's a there's a lot to be said

here about the role of social media

companies and the intermediaries and

what role they have in policing the

content whether it's harmful content

mischievous content however you want to

clear up clarify it classify it there is

the a role here oftentimes the social

media companies will

manipulate your feed based on what

you've seen becomes like a little bit of

an echo chamber but I think it's clear

today that they do have a role in

shaping the the content that we see and

and they need to be held accountable to

it

true or false

making a video where your friend appears

to choke you and you challenge others to

try it is okay as long as no one gets

hurt in your video the answer is false

content that encourages illegal or

dangerous activities is not allowed on

YouTube

neither is content that risk serious

physical harm or death

[Music]

so what you have here is unfettered

access to a medium that offers constant

reinforcement so what I mean by that is

when we post something on social media

if you have notifications for people's

reactions to your post setup you will

get a notification on your cell phone or

even your desktop device or whatever it

is that you're using you'll get a

notification that someone has reacted or

responded or engaged some way with your

post so when that happens every time you

get that sort of notifier whether it's

that little red sign you see on your

phone or it's a ding a lot of people get

a sound what that does in the brain is

it actually hits the reward system of

the brain so these social media

notifications act as rewards so from the

from the standpoint of the brain itself

every time a person gets a notifier that

someone has engaged it's activating that

reward and reinforcement part of their

brain and it's causing them to want more

to repeat the behavior to continue going

further down that path when the internet

was new people didn't realize that what

they did online had online

ramifications they didn't realize that

publishing something online could

potentially be illegal I think people

are shaped up to that and they

understand that yeah if I do something

online it could have online consequences

it could it could come back to bite me

in real life same here

somebody does a crime they record it

they upload it the sharing of the crime

and in and of itself may not be the

sharing of the video in and of itself

may not be criminal but what they do

will be evidence

and that could that's all they may need

to have conviction I decided to do the

wasabi challenge purely because I was

dead to do it by my friend I thought

about no repercussions whatsoever

I was 22 at the time I think that people

do these social media challenges because

of well really peer pressure and now

that we have Instagram and social media

and and clickbait I think that that's

really kind of that's been the snowball

effect for this
