to have Joe thank you very much thank

you both for being here they're busy

they're very busy people and I think

we're gonna meet on a certain subject

later on Joe and that's good Jerry was

born in Sheila and West Virginia in 1938

the fifth of six children he grew up

hiking in the woods fishing in the

Clearwater and exploring the beautiful

mountains of West Virginia a great great

state I shouldn't say this Joe but I

wanted by 43 points that's a lot we love

West Virginia probably helped you

getting this who are today when you come

from West Virginia we like you Jerry

but the more than anything else but

Jerry like doing is playing basketball

in West Virginian starting at age six he

taught himself on the dirt surfaces of

his neighborhoods back yard when he

rained his sister would call him and say

it's it's called the mud wallow do you

remember that at all Jerry the mud

wallow but nothing ever stopped him

Jerry later reflected that everything

I did I tried to do perfectly not just

well but perfectly and it hasn't changed

I don't think too much as it

we ended a great great senior year Gerry

spent it in high school with a West

Virginia scoring record of 1501 points

approximately 60 major colleges and

universities tried to recruit Jerry but

he decided very intelligently to stay in

West Virginia and he went to West

Virginia University in 1956 donning his

famous number 44 Jersey he said 17

mountaineer records was named the NCAA's

most outstanding player in 1959 and was

a two-time consensus all-american Wow

West Virginia won 87 percent of the

games in which Jerry was in the lineup

and won the Southern Conference all

three years he played varsity after

graduating Jerry played on the 1960 US

Olympic team which swept every matchup

including a much anticipated showdown

with the Soviet Union in that game Jerry

was the highest scorer accounting for

nearly a quarter of America's points and

to this day the Olympic gold medal is

his most prized possession is that still

so Jerry then joined the Los Angeles

Lakers we all know that and in the years

that followed he was to become a legend

and made plays that will be remembered

forever I know many of them in a January

1962 game against the New York Knicks

Jerry scored nearly half of the Lakers

total setting a personal scoring record

of 63 points in less than 40 minutes in

Game three of 1962 Finals against the

Celtics

Jerry rallied the Lakers and tried and

tried very hard I will tell you he tried

so hard and it was a great rally and he

was up 115 to 115 with only three

seconds left the Celtics had the ball

and Sam Jones he was a good one

Sam Jones they were all good on that

team

passive oh that's very Bob Cousy who was

here a few weeks ago and I don't know if

he'd want this oh so we will tell it

very quietly but Jerry suddenly rushed

forward stole the ball before it reached

kuzey and made a layup in the final

second to win the game in that iconic

1962 season Jerry Jerry earned the

nickname of mr. clutch the name that

stuck over the course of his 14 NBA

seasons he broke the record for the most

points scored in the history of the

Lakers was named the NBA Finals MVP and

was inducted into the Basketball Hall of

Fame but perhaps the greatest

commemoration of his legacy was the

legendary playing career is the NBA logo

today the silhouette of Jerry West is

displayed on every uniform court and

basketball in the league still the same

one after his playing career ended in

1974 Jerry wanted to coach the Lakers

for three seasons and later served as

general manager and executive vice

president of basketball operations for

nearly 20 years in the summer of 1996 he

succeeded in securing both Kobe Bryant

and Shaquille O'Neal to truly great

players creating an unstoppable force in

the NBA under his management the Lakers

won four championships and he was named

executive the Year in 1995

Jerry went on to serve as the president

of basketball operations for the

struggling Memphis Grizzlies where took

them to the playoffs three times who was

named executive the year again in 2004

he then joined the executive board of

the Warriors recently he became a

consultant for the Clippers and helped

sign why Leonard who really has played

he's some players we were

that and the combination of the two of

them is going to be a very interesting

season I think you're pretty proud of

that group yes we're gonna see you had

some great ones

Jerry is one of the greatest negotiators

managers and executives in the history

of the NBA in addition to his sterling

professional career Jerry helped raise

millions of dollars for charity in Los

Angeles contributed to a flood of relief

efforts in West Virginia and generally

just incredible supporter of West

Virginia and West Virginia University

he's also brought awareness to the risks

of our Trail fibrillation oh I didn't

know that Jerry that's very good and as

a passive supporter of our nation's

veterans Jerry works harder than just

about anybody I can imagine helping our

nation's veterans Jerry West is one

extraordinary American and I'm now like

to ask the military aid to come forward

and present Jerry Allen West with the

Presidential Medal of Freedom this is so

richly deserved thank you very much

[Applause]

begin you know it never ceases to amaze

me the places you can go in this world

chasing about a chase bit began in

Chilean West Virginia where I strung a

wire basket with no net to the side of a

bridge if you shot didn't go in the ball

rolled down the Long Bay you'll be

chasing it forever so you've got to make

it I was a dreamer my family didn't have

much but we have a clear view of

Appalachian Mountains and I like I'd set

alone on our front porch and wonder if I

ever make it to the top of that mountain

what while see on the other side well I

did make it to the other side and my

dreams have come true I've been able to

see it I've been able to see the sides

thanks to all thanks to that bouncing

ball I spent my childhood in West

Virginia and my adulthood in Los Angeles

two of the most profoundly different

places in this country and have been

shaped by wonderful people in both I

would never made it through West

Virginia University without and an RD a

surrogate mother

of sorts who gave me a room in her home

in her house and constantly fed me to

pack weight on my 160 pound frame she

cussed me when I needed it and boy that

was a lot like the time I fled back home

before my freshman year personally

convinced that I did not belong in

college and hug me when I needed it

which was probably at the same time and

was strong sassy Italian not so much

different than another incredible woman

that eventually met in Los Angeles Mary

thank you Karen for accompanying me in

tolerating me on this long rich American

journey I've experienced a country at

war a country at peace a time when we

huddled around a radio with terrible

reception to hear President Roosevelt's

weekly addresses to a time when we read

on our cell phone president Trump's

instantaneous tweets you're pretty good

I suffered excruciating losses both

personally and professionally

I'm not gonna say how many a NBA final

losses those damn Celtics and

exhilarating victories but the one I

cherished most was with a group of

fellow America meters at the 1960

Olympics as I stood on the gold medal

standing next to my friend and

soon-to-be adversary Oscar Robertson I

thought about my brother David who had

died fighting in Korea when I was 13 and

how proud I was to represent the United

States of America in West Virginia in a

state of West Virginia

I tried in my life to do for others what

David did for me lead protect and assist

whenever possible the David Wesson

Willie Akers academic center at West

Virginia University is a place where I

hope young men and women in my home

state can also dream about the top of

the mountain and take the first steps

towards realizing those dreams I am

surrounded here today by my wonderful

family although my sister Hannah and

Barbara are not able to make this trip

I've been blessed with five remarkable

sons David Michael Moore Brian and John

I've been privileged to work for four

fantastic basketball franchises the Los

Angeles Lakers were celebrated in most

memorable triumphs where I've worn the

most painful setbacks and partnered with

a true visionary

Jerry Buss to change the landscape of

professional sports

Michael Heisley the Memphis Grizzlies

gave me the opportunity to rebuild a

franchise looking for its way the Golden

State Warriors

where I witnessed some of the most

beautiful basketball ever played

alongside a most unique and successful

ownership group and now the LA Clippers

I work with incredible and an

inspirational leader Steve um

and maybe I'm being prejudiced but the

best staff that I've ever known

I've had many great coaches and

teammates I will never forget as a

player I was flanked by the great Elgin

Baylor the most supportive and the

greatest player of that era and later

the great Wilt Chamberlain as an

executive I've been just as fortunate I

have been involved with truly incredible

group of the greatest players who have

ever played you scream

Kareem worthy Maji Shaquille Kobe with

the Lakers Steph

Klay Kevin at the Golden State Warriors

and now Kawhi Leonard and paula jory

with the Clippers I marvel at them at

the joy they brought basketball fans all

over the world the bouncing ball brought

me hit there and here when Kurt Caron

first read on the internet that I was

going to receive the Medal Presidential

Medal of Freedom we were both shocked

and surprised and amused I thought it

was a joke when then when the West

Virginia Senator Joe Manchin confirmed

West Virginia Jim justice
