what is it about this

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

five grown men singing in harmony and

dancing dare I say it in sync that make

adult women and men act like this

gushing shrieking teenagers it is so

hard to explain my heart I'm getting

goose bumps the whole shebang I'll be

sitting down hanging out waiting for

them as soon as they get out just jump

on my feet I'll be screaming I'll be

dancing I'll get yelled at by the people

behind me I felt like I was 13 and

reliving a dream the truth is

backstreet's not back they've been here

all along producing music every few

years for the past two decades when they

dropped their tenth album DNA this year

it topped the charts the last time that

happened was almost two decades ago with

the release of black and blue in the

year 2000 so what explains the not-so

boy band's popularity suddenly spiking

well look around are you noticing a rise

of 90s nostalgia even Tamagotchis are

making a comeback and the resurgence is

no coincidence

today's nostalgia really targets

millenials because they are of that age

where they're just feeling the

beginnings of a midlife crisis just

feeling what it means to be working

every day of your life for the rest of

your career to understand what it means

to be parents for the first time what it

means to be married and coupled and it's

you know it's being at all and and

Millennials are experiencing that right

now so marketing their nostalgia for the

freedom they've lost is the commodity

that you can tap into right now so what

does a Backstreet Boy think of this

theory absolutely have to have credit to

this whole resurgence of 90s music and

and all the other artists that are out

there doing very well as well like you

said it's it's it's really helped us

almost to a point have you know

lightning striking a bottle twice which

is amazing because a lot of artists

especially when they have success that

we were blessed with that magnitude

trying to get that again twice is very

hard it nostalgia with some hard work

and some good timing it goes a long way

BSB aren't the only 90s musicians

touring this year the Spice Girls aqua

and Hanson are all back hopefully that

we bring this

our fans back to that moment when they

first heard that song the memories that

they created with us and then most

importantly maybe it's because there was

a one guy in the group called Howie D a

lot and one in the group that makes it

makes them really wanna come back

playing games this wave of nostalgia is

nothing new in fact it's right on

schedule

it just targets a different generation

every time if we go ahead to the 1980s

we had this huge thing for the 1960s

where people were all you know nostalgic

and and thinking about how wonderful the

60s now interesting the 60s were if we

go into the 1990s there was a real

fondness for the early 1980s in the late

1970s with all the punk and new wave and

and electro pop stuff that was coming up

he adds that this too shall pass so we

might as well enjoy it while it lasts

yes B on the other hand say as long as

they'll be music they'll be coming back

again we're never gone we had a CD

called never gone as well so you know

we're still here

[Applause]

so tell me why no pun intended
