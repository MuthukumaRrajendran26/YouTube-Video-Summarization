look I think that's it that's a very

fair question at the end of the day I

think one way hasn't we've been in the

country for 10 years and I can bet

surprises a lot of people we have 1,100

employees in the country I think that

surprises a lot of people and I think

that it's important that you know in

addition to just being excellent

you know sellers of network equipment we

also communicate with Canadians about

what we're doing and sort of the

partnerships that we have look I think

at the end the day we're operating a

business right I'm not a I'm not a

diplomat it's not I'm simply not able to

speculate on how other countries will

react what I can say is that Huawei's

presence as an equipment provider in the

north is long-standing it longs it long

predates the the current presidential

administration in the US and you know

our hope is that kind of politics can be

put aside and and you know we can all

recognize that improving connectivity

for remote and rural communities is

something we can all sort of support

yes so um I've always been in Canada

since 2008 and since 2013 there's been a

program called the security review

program run by CSC for three genes sort

of 4G equipment and so that requires you

know a large amount of almost-daily I

don't to say daily certainly more than

weekly touch points between huawei

Canada as well as security agencies and

so the the equipment that is provided

under this is fully compliant with the

rules under that program it's all radio

access network equipment so you know I

think that the terms of formulation is

used is non core equipment and so it's

um it's very much in line with with that

program and it's fairly standard to what

we would have with other providers there

there would be no regulatory issue with

this just like there would be no

regulatory issue with any one of our

other commercial agreements with other

wireless providers look obviously this

is a time of real tension between Canada

and China on a number of fronts I

honestly can't pretend to know the

latest status of diplomatic talks

between Canada and China what efforts

have been made behind the scenes what

efforts have been made with the

Americans I simply don't know because I

work at Huawei Canada you know I don't

work at sort of global affairs but I

think sort of generally in response to

your question the sorts of diplomatic

tensions that exist are can only be

solved by by governments not by

companies

while we share former ambassador John

McCallum's view that it would be more

advantageous regime so that's a very

fair question may be very clear John

McCallum doesn't speak for huawei Canada

never has and I think Minister Freeland

very helpfully clarified that nor does

he speak any longer for the Government

of Canada I think all I would say is

that I we want to associate ourselves

entirely with the views expressed by

Minister Freeland that no Canadian

should ever advise or counsel a foreign

government to take sides in a Canadian

election it's totally inappropriate so I

could just move like you left and I

thought I'll get back I think that's a

very fair question and I'll address it

in parts so first of all why away

globally operates and I think 170

countries maybe a few more and I really

only have lined aside into Canada

because I work at Huawei Canada so I'm

simply not able to speak to what happens

globally however I would note that one

of the global spokesman for Huawei Joe

Kelly denied the report denied the

allegations but I think the I think the

the the the bigger issue is is one of us

want to thrust right and it's at the end

of day Huawei has been in Canada since

2008 we have been we've worked

productively with Conservative

government's we've worked productively

with Liberal government's we have a

close relationship at the sort of at the

at the operational level with Canada's

security agencies and and at no point

has Huawei Canada ever received you know

a complaint from one of our security

agencies or from one of our customers

about about our equipment and that's why

our customers including ice wireless

keep coming back to us to for us to

supply their equipment Oh

do not you have a presence in North

Korea right now what would you say to

Canadians who are upset about mr.

Kovarik and mr. spadework attention does

while we canvass share Canadians

concerns that these people should be

returned it's sort of possible that

paying government's concerned through

arbitrary detentions yeah so look the

last thing I'm gonna do is speculate on

a complex GOP geopolitical issue because

I don't want to make matters worse

however obviously we're concerned like

all Canadians are concerned about their

well-being and this is a time as I said

a real tension between Canada and China

and it can only be solved by governments

and I just can't pretend to know where

diplomatic talks are between Canada and

China sounds like you're saying we hope

everybody ignores all of that other

stuff and just focuses on what huawei

Canada has been doing and not all the

other stuff that's out there no Mike I'm

not sure I accepted the premise of that

question right look it's clear that

Huawei globally was founded in China

it's also clear that most of its revenue

now is earned outside of China in

countries around the world such as

Canada I think you know as I said this

is a time of real tension between Canada

and China on a number of fronts I can't

pretend to know the status of the

diplomatic relationship but I think that

when one when one talks about Huawei

Canada and when you consider koala way

Canada I would say the two most

important things to keep in mind or that

we've been operating here legally

supplying carriers since 2008 and we

have more than 1,100 employees you know

I can tell you that you know if you go

to our office in Canada or you go there

you know I go to our office in Markham

you know this this this perception that

you know it's sort of dr. Evil's lair

and we're toiling away at the latest you

know world ending scheme is false you

know it's a bunch of engineers solving

engineering problems and I think I think

that ultimately

Trust is built over time and in the case

of Huawei Canada we've operated without

complaints without issues since 2008 and

so we would ask to be judged on our we

would ask for the government to judge us

on our record in Canada and for

decisions to be made based on technology

not politics sorry Heather so I think we

don't is it because our commercial

agreements are commercial and they're

commercially sensitive we don't sort of

as a practice talk about kind of market

share in the north right that's just not

something that we do however what I can

say is that Huawei has been providing

equipment in the north for for a long

time and we are a major equipment

provider in the North I think part of

the reason why we were a major equipment

provider in the North is because

operators turn to us for some of the the

world leading technology that Jean

Francois talked about as well as our

superior kind of the performance of our

technology and and and the performance

of our personnel and how we go out of

our way to help

operators deal with some of the complex

challenges that come from them building

a network in the in in in the Arctic

huawei Canada has been operating in

Canada since since 2008 and it's a it's

a company that is registered in Canada

with industry Canada the names of our

directors or public it's our president

Erik our CFO Eddie and a bunch of our

senior officials I think our head of our

and TE our head of R&D

one of our senior CTOs and so the the

kind of the information about Huawei

Canada is it's just a private company in

Canada now obviously

Huawei globally is a major multinational

company that's based in China and that

operates in 170 countries Canada is one

of them every kwame employee in Canada

whether it's our president Eric whether

it's our chief cyber security officer

Oliveira whether it's me

whether it's our CTO Rob has to follow

Canadian laws right I don't know

anything about Chinese laws because they

don't apply to me because I'm living

here in Canada so we all have to follow

Canadian laws Canadian laws on these

sorts of issues like like espionage and

pilfer and data and all that are very

clear which is that it's illegal and so

so it's Canadian laws that apply to

huawei in Canada it's Canadian laws that

apply to what every single flower

employee in Canada the Canadian laws

that we follow there's never been any

sort of complaint from either security

agencies or our customers that we have

not complied with Canadian law and I

would add to that and nor nor would we

ever you know Norton would be obviously

I'm not comply with Canadian law but I

would add to that that our founder in

China has said that were he to receive

an inappropriate request he would refuse

to comply with it so I think the way I

look at it they're sort of there's

multiple levels of protection here in

Canada every single huawei employee in

Canada knows that we have to follow the

laws of Canada and the laws of Canada

alone however the the founder of our

parent company has also said that under

no circumstances would he comply with an

inappropriate directive on the

Washington Post article I know you said

that your president has denied it but

somebody's been in this type of business

you know that bad press is bad press how

worried are you that despite the denial

that this reporter the Washington Post

will negatively affect Canada's decision

to include Huawei in the 5j I mean I

think that the Government of Canada has

set forward process by which they will

make these decisions we we are

respectful of that process we work we're

confident that based on what we've

reassurances we've been told that

decisions stemming from that process

will be made based on technology not

politics and so how the ongoing kind of

media coverage effects that those are

questions to ask

I think the Government of Canada but

from a huawei perspective we are

respectful of the government's process

and it's our hope that any decision

that's made is made based on technology

the rule of law the fairness not

politics
