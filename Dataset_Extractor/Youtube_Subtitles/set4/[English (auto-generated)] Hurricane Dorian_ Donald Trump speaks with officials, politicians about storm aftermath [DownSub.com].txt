so we were going to take a helicopter to

Emerald Isle in North Carolina which was

hit very very hard Atlantic Beach was

hit very hard certain areas were really

hit the governor is with me Roy thank

you very much for being here

the governor was standing in the rain

for a long time along with a lot of

talented people that have really helped

us a lot

Lindsay I'm glad you here with us and we

appreciate it very much and kevin is

here summon behind hello Kevin

thank you thank you for being here

we have a big rally tonight for Dan

bishop I was going to go from Emerald

Isle right back into the rally but now

we'll be very early for our rally that's

the one thing but it was I guess where

there's a very dangerous flying

conditions I said let's do it anyway

they said sir would rather not so I said

okay I'll take your word for it the

greatest pilots of the world

we will be spending a little time we're

going to be giving a presentation as to

what's happening in North Carolina and a

little bit about a couple of the other

places I just spoke to governor Henry

McMaster and they're in great shape in

South Carolina and they've done a really

good job

boy maybe I could ask you the same few

words and what do you need from the

federal government

first mr. president thank you for coming

enjoyed our working relationship

probably too much Feynman was glad to

have mr. Gaynor here with us and of

course we've had to see the team

invented with us in our Emergency

Operations Center in Raleigh this is the

third hurricane that has crossed coast

of North Carolina in less than three

years

this is something that we take very

seriously the widespread damage durian

did not approach the damage that we had

from Florence and Matthew but it was

still significant in some parts we've

had three deaths

related to this

fell off ladders while they were trying

to get their house floor to the store

and the other death happened postal work

with a chainsaw accident with cleanup we

still have about 3500 people without

power but we had a couple of hundred

thousand at one point disintegration one

of the hard-hit areas it's a Ocracoke

Island which they said it's the worst

that they had ever seen I thought

you had a house built in the 1870s and

they have never seen that that powers

still out there

we're providing food resources working

with all of our federal local partners

we provide health care the place that

you were going to go in a while as the

storm approached that had an ef-2

tornado

an RV park

the damage was significant many homes

absolutely

we had issued an evacuation order and

therefore most of the people were gone

the few people who were there survived

in a lucky that they are alive did they

I'm sure they appreciated the fact that

you had planned to go and see and I know

we have local government officials here

who were ready a nuclear power plant and

Brunswick would have it be powered down

form in today it's the powers back up

but we think everything's okay with that

we still have about 20 road closures we

don't have anything approaching but the

last news in two storms but we still

have some there

we've got 125 National Guard activated

down down from 577 what we would request

mr. president is an expedited disaster

declaration

debris removal and for emergency

protective measures and we got a joint

limitary damage assessments going on

right now stay FEMA local try and

determine determine the extent of damage

the other thing I'd like to mention is

that hurricane Florence in this state

badly you were

or that but in less than a year ago we

have a number of people who

or not in their homes yet that were

affected by durian so any help that you

can give us with bud publishing the

federal what if your sir

for the CPP our money for the hurricane

Florence we would appreciate we've had a

good relationship with secretary Carson

but

there's a couple of things that would be

helpful I think long term puts the EBG

they are money which

the universal application for all

disaster survivors that worked with FEMA

was work with SBA that

with that I think that we

things down and they get a lot easier

looking and also maybe codify

[Music]

for that I have with me my Secretary of

Public Safety Veracruz

[Music]

rifle for his work at our local business

we've done a great job

yes sir mr. president for my aspect I

like the emphasizing partnerships that

we have all throughout the Department of

Homeland Security Coast Guard people

they're always at the table and they're

at the table when things are relatively

peaceful solo tragedy you know all has

it's us we're ready and we're partners

relationships and small Thank You mr.

president I gonna have one more thing to

add for all of us here as we were in

communication throughout the storm but

the Coast Guard did amazing work but

during Lawrence enduring norian they

helped us rescue a man from the copilot

and help bring him off and one closely

without a scar we're grateful for our

Coast Guard

I've always said for the last 34 years

there's no brand that has gone out more

than the United States husband

in Texas they save thousands and

thousands of lives they've done a job

like I've never seen and you went to

Florida then you went to Puerto Rico

then you went back here and the job

you've done in the Bahamas has been

incredible so please extend my wishes

everybody would you like to say no mr.

president and governor to purchase the

Coast Guard was justified to be part of

the team we have a great relationship

with the state with our federal partners

local partners and that we were happy to

be part of the team as you know as this

storm came up we uploaded resources that

had ready to respond and then the focus

was the wideness wants when it needed

and then opening the ports as quickly as

possible we did that and I think it went

about as well as could be expected so

you've done a fantastic job how are the

new Coast Guard cutters they're doing

great sir we had to pull them out of the

region but we floated back in and they

were of course to get offshore to play

mates they are absolutely adamant we go

getting very old now you have brand-new

beauties read this of the best American

workers

Thank You mr. president as you know

we're here in support of our state

partners and government Cooper his team

commissioner hook outstandings Brown the

effort

I'd like administrator actually

administrator pink Gator give you a

little bit a sense of the preparations

we had in place the additional response

and of course majority to joint

yes sir as soon as we realized that

Dorian bypassed universe now

where we go and was not to touch me and

again I'll monitor in the NRCC the

National Response more instead of

was a big big small bit response he had

staff material equipment Miami to Fort

ap Hill

continue making sure that we can fly all

the governors

whatever they again it takes

partnerships make it all happen when it

works well it's great in the city so I

thank everyone here that is part of the

federal team

and I have to say Ron DeSantis and Brian

Kemp and Henry has been fantastic in

South Carolina

and yourself the governors have really

done a fantastic job it worked

whether it's Republican Democrat doesn't

matter in this case we're talking about

one that's on the other side and the

relationship was perfect right

a really good relationship to get it all

together I want to say that FEMA first

responders law enforcement it's been

incredible really on the ball and they

were ready at Puerto Rico

everybody thought is gonna headquarter

Rico we're all set and fortunately a

Miss Puerto Rico what it did to the bomb

is just incredible the government of the

Bahamas has asked us now but we have a

lot of assets over there right now

trying to help actually a life-saving

mission

the Coast Guard and FEMA and all of you

have done a fantastic job

would you like for senators

okay Lindsey Graham please well one

thank you for calling Henry to my

friends in North Carolina I used to be a

reservist and Seymour Johnson so now

they all have been hit really hard and

unfortunately our delegations in South

Carolina and North Carolina are getting

pretty good returning the funds around

and Kevin and Nancy worked well together

so we've got to fund the government

entirely by the end of the month but I

promise you we'll do everything we can

being your neighbor I'm really sorry I

know it's been really hard

so thank you mr. kotis you've done a

great job they can let you very much

and later what do you think

I know what the Democrats we're getting

things approved graphically how's it

going yeah I think it's working well the

one thing I do want to credit and thank

all of you for how well everybody's work

together coordination knowing how this

storm would change course the modeling

continue to go and just the preparation

I know you saved a lot of lives by the

cranberries

our responsibility Lindsay and others

making sure the resources are there and

there was a drop to FEMA ahead of time

there was enough money and there's more

needed

thank you very much coming in that role

thank you for keeping me in touch

he was with me all the way no matter

where I went the Adler's right there

we were able to do a lot of good by

being there so thank you would you have

anything to say listen with regard to

the Bahamas because much of the

attention has shifted there now mr.

president USAID the agency for

international development their office

of foreign disaster assistance is in the

coordinating lead working directly with

the government of the Bahamas respond to

their request for the most acute

humanitarian needs of the Bahamian

people and as you talked about it's a

very concentrated area of the Bahamas

that was affected the rest of the

Bahamas almost the sized the stand up in

California

is unaffected open for business and so

Bohemians are helping Bohemians

evacuating people to other sections of

the Bahamas that have not been affected

and not only the United States but

foreign governments and non-governmental

organizations are also there in Flor is

providing the humanitarian aid that's

needed so people are unaware of the fact

for the most part that the Bahamas

a much bigger place than people would

understand that most people would

understand so you're actually moving

large numbers of people into safer areas

and areas that weren't affected in the

Bahamas by the hurricane right so the

government of the Bahamas is actually

doing that assisted by others moving

people from the most affected islands

generally the Abaco island which is

toward Nassau which is an area of the

Bahamas that was relatively undamaged it

has the resources to help those folks

out they've really done a great job

thank you very much

so we have now people standing in line

trying to get into the arena and I will

tell you that they are soaking wet

because Roy and everybody just walked

into the plane and you

bad weather out there but we have a

tremendous crowd and we're gonna be

there in a little while we're going over

a little bit earlier than anticipated so

I hope you're gonna be able to join us

and we'll have some fun good rally yes

the budget agreement that you have

negotiate for the House and the Senate

no agreements perfect but if we are not

done the budget deal would go back into

sequestration you would not be having

new ships the biggest winners with the

DHS military as a whole so times like

this I appreciate what you did on the

budget because sequestration would

devastate and I think it's really

important to say Mexico is fast at

Canada's best at the u.s. MCA is vital

for our country the economics of our

country

two countries that have gone through the

process fully we're waiting for an

approval from the house I think the

Senate will approve it rapidly so we

hope they could get that moving it's a

great thing for us the farmers even the

unions are really liking it a lot we're

going to make certain little changes but

bobwhite ours is dealing with Nancy

Pelosi I think they're getting along

very well Steve minuchin said well and

hopefully they can get a vote on that

very quickly the USMC a very important

thank you

thank you folks thank you harassing over
