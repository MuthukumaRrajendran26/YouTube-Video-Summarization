relief is spreading across a northern

Manitoba community with news that an

intensive manhunt for two murder

suspects is now over people in the town

of Gilliam are starting to get back to

life as normal but as our CMP crews wrap

up and pull out of the region questions

are lingering about the two men accused

of killing three people in northern

British Columbia there are still no new

details on what may have motivated the

killings of three people American

tourists China Dees her Australian

boyfriend Lucas Fowler and UBC botanist

Leonard dick the family of Leonard dick

has sent little in the week since his

murder but today his cousin Eric Friesen

opened up to global news about the pain

his family has endured from the day they

learned he was killed to the news

yesterday that the manhunt was finally

over finding out that you know the two

suspects were were found dead up in

Gilliam

kind of brought those feelings back in

in a different manner you know

understanding that Leonard was gone

understanding that even though finding

these guys did her life was going to

bring him back the feelings been been

very difficult the process at this point

in the community of Gilliam people are

still processing the events of the last

few weeks

Global's Joe Scarpelli is there tonight

with more on how the town is doing you

can see it you can feel it Gilliam is

now returning to the town of people knew

before Brier schmegle ski and cam

McCloud became household names Karin

Donnell and Fischer owns four businesses

in town including this grocery store

since sir Miguel schema cloud became

murder suspects she's had to cut store

hours make sure two people were always

working at once even letting staff who

feel scared stay home the biggest fear I

think for the majority of us was that

there would be no resolution raid like

that they would disappear into the night

and we would have to continue honor that

hanging over our heads and not just for

us living here but for the families of

the deceased as well this is what should

be the final sighting of the two

suspects in northern Manitoba resident

Brian Olsen it feels a huge sense of

relief to his life was changed for two

weeks the last scare he can recall in

town was a bear sightings so far it

looks like everybody's really relieved

and able to finally go about their days

without having to look over their

shoulders or wake up Dumbledore

wondering what some random noise at

night was sightings in Ontario were

mistaken stress levels rose all while

the fugitives were right in the backyard

of this now internationally known town
