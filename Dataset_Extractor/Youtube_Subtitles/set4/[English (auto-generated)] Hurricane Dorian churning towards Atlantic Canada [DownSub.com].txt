has been such a long a difficult week

for those in the path of Dorian and it's

set to do more damage it's expected to

reach Atlantic Canada by late tomorrow

Global News chief meteorologist Anthony

Farnell is in Halifax where a hurricane

warning is in place Anthony it looks

nice there now but I guess that's soon

going to change Donna it's a beautiful

evening here in Halifax but that is

going to change quickly throughout the

day we've had tourists and locals alike

coming down to the boardwalk looking out

over the harbor and while asking me when

this system is going to arrive and I can

now say I do think this is going to be

the worst storm to impact this area

since hurricane Juan and everybody

remembers that back in 2003 now we are

in relative calm conditions but that's

going to change in a hurry because of

the speed of Hurricane Dorian let's take

a look the satellite imagery still shows

a distinct eye as it moved off the North

Carolina coast and now it's growing in

size and it's not really weakening as

far as the winds right around the center

currently 150 km/h so it is going to

move right towards Halifax any deviation

to the left

any deviation to the west will create

more of a storm surge here in the harbor

and they are worried about that with

winds of 150 km/h in gusts so the

strongest winds will be on the right

side and the heaviest rain on the left

and that's going to be throughout the

day Saturday and even into early Sunday

we're up to a hundred and 50 millimeters

of rain could fall a hurricane warning

in effect for Halifax all the way off

towards Cape Breton there's also a

hurricane watch for the rest of the

province and a tropical storm warning

for parts of pei new brunswick and then

all this heads towards newfoundland just

off the coast 10 to 15 meter waves are

expected and we've seen a lot of the

Navy ships today heading out to sea to

ride the storm there rather than here in

the harbor where their boats can get

damaged that's the very latest from

Halifax
