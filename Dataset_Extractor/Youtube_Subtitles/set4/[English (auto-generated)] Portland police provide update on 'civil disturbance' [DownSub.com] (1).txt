let's go ahead and

good evening I'm lieutenant Tina Jones

the Portland Police Bureau public

information officer we are here to

provide updates about today's

demonstration events in downtown

Portland these updates will be

transcripted and posted to our website

after the press conference first I would

like to introduce to you mayor Ted

wheeler mayor thank you well good

evening thank you for being here I'd

like to start off by thanking the chief

and the men and women of the Portland

Police were required to do and they

performed like the professionals that I

know that they are this was a dynamic

event with demonstrators frequently

moving from one part of the city to

others and that made the job even more

difficult given the continuing movement

the number of people involved I'm

grateful that this was largely a

peaceful event police did an exemplary

job of de-escalating the situation

keeping the extremists on both sides

separated for the most part and

preventing people who wanted to engage

in acts of violence from confronting

each other when these events take place

we always have exactly the same goals

first we want to protect the safety of

the public second we want to make sure

that the city continues to function

third we want to protect people's rights

to assembly and to express their

opinions and fourth and finally we of

course want to enforce the law based on

the information that we've been

receiving over the last several weeks we

were preparing for in planning for a

worst-case scenario and I'm very pleased

that at least so far this did not happen

the weeks of planning in preparation by

the police the assistance offered by our

federal state and local law enforcement

partners helped hold the overall safety

of the public here in the city of

Portland City Burroughs also

collaborated with our federal and our

regional partners in an unprecedented

manner and I want to thank them for that

everyone came together and as the mayor

of this great city it's been humbling to

witness that you've heard me say it

repeatedly this is our city this is our

home we do not tolerate violence here

and those who engage in violence will be

held accountable thanks to the

dedication and hard work of the Police

Bureau and our Associated law

enforcement partners we did just that

thank you thank you thank you now I

would like to introduce to you Portland

police chief

Danielle outlaw good evening thank you

we had two primary goals today the first

one was to keep everyone safe including

demonstrators portlanders visitors and

officers and the second was to

facilitate everyone's ability to

exercise their First Amendment rights a

free speech and assembly ppb used every

available officer today to ensure that

we could achieve these goals and we

called upon the number of local state

and federal partners to help us those

include the Bend Police Department

Clackamas County Sheriff's Office the

Eugene Police Department the Federal

Bureau of Investigation the Federal

Protective Service Gresham Police

Department Lake Oswego Police Department

Multnomah County Sheriff's Office the

Oregon State Police

of course the Portland Police Bureau the

Salem Police Department the Toledo

Police Department the University of

Oregon Police the US Marshal Service and

Washington County Sheriff's Office in

addition to thanking them I also want to

thank our non law enforcement partners

including the Portland Public Schools

for their help we spent several weeks

preparing for today's events and we are

grateful for everyone who stayed focused

on the mission without without regard to

politics our ideologies

our law enforcement personnel are human

beings and today was a long and arduous

day it's not all for them and I commend

their continued commitment dedication

and professionalism I'm proud of the

work that was done today and

appreciative of the level of

professionalism that was demonstrated by

our officers and all of our partners

demonstrators began to arrive downtown

at approximately 8:30 this morning

almost immediately officers began to

seize weapons over the course of the day

those seizures included chemical spray

air spray metal and wooden poles knives

shields and a stun gun at around 4:15

this afternoon the incident commander

declared a civil disturbance in the area

of Southwest Park and Southwest Yamhill

due to information available at her in

the time at that time including the fact

there were numerous conflicts between

protesters overall we estimate that

there were approximately 1200

demonstrators at the peak of the

demonstrations our team spent many hours

monitoring the various groups as they

gathered splintered reformed and moved

throughout the downtown core and back

and forth across multiple bridges to the

east side of the Willamette River the

disruptions were held to a very small

area of downtown Portland in the

vicinity of Waterfront Park Pioneer

Courthouse Square and along the east

side of the Willamette River we have

maps to provide you to show you that

areas impacted this operation was also

complicated by a number of factors the

geographic spread of the protests the

number of hours over which it developed

the fact that four different ridges were

affected and the purposeful conduct of

participants officers that we know of at

this time it's what a little bit after

6:15 made at least 13 arrests we believe

these arrests allow us to hold those

committing violent acts and other crimes

accountable while at the same time

deterring others from acting

at this time we know of six force events

involving officers there was one

instance where an officer deployed

pepper balls the other instances

involved takedowns or control against

resistance currently we know of six

minor injuries related to the

demonstration these were injuries that

were not caused by law enforcement

personnel of the six one individual was

transported to a local hospital there

was a seventh person who received

medical attention for an unrelated

medical issue

we appreciate the Portland Fire medics

who are available today to provide swift

medical treatment to all who needed it

we're still gathering information from

our investigative teams but currently I

can tell you that these individuals that

were arrested faced a range of charges

including disorderly conduct interfering

with police resisting arrest possession

of a weapon in a park and unlawful use

of a weapon we will have more details on

those arrested divisional individuals

and specific charges in the coming hours

it's still very early so please keep in

mind that any information that we're

providing you right now is preliminary I

ask that you hold off on making any

judgments about what happened today

during today's events until all of the

information is available to us by way of

example earlier today some were of the

opinion that we showed bias towards a

particular group shortly before noon a

group of demonstrators communicated to

our liaisons that they wanted to leave

the downtown area at that point we

determined that it would be in the

interest of everyone's safety to allow

them to remove themselves from the area

we allowed them to cross the Hawthorne

Bridge at that time we did not show

preferential treatment but rather

facilitated a de-escalation of potential

conflict while the greatest potential

for conflict appears to be winding down

they're still considerable work to be

done we will continue to monitor hot

spots throughout the evening to ensure

that we are prepared if any

demonstrators attempt to re-engage in

conflicts with one another beyond that

our officers and detectives will be

spending two hours and days ahead

writing reports conducting interviews

and pursuing investigations we know that

there is a possibility that assault or

other crimes occurred outside of the

view of officers in this case we ask

that if you witness a crime or if you

took photos or videos of crimes in

progress please share those with our

investigators send your information or

photo and video files to us at Crime

tips at Portland Oregon gov crime tips

at Portland Oregon gov thank you

so we're able to take a few questions if

anyone hasn't the closure of the

Hawthorne Bridge was done for safety

reasons and the chief already covered

the reason why one particular group was

allowed to use the bridge for safety

every event that we learn of is

different and we make an assessment

based on what information we have out

there the city of Portland in 2018 had

two hundred demonstrations in the

downtown core area and the vast majority

of those did not require a law

enforcement presence

I'm not going to speak to specifics for

prior demonstrations for a variety of

reasons listen here in Portland Oregon

we support the rights of people to

assemble and we support the rights of

people to express their opinions but

when we have people like Joe Biggs from

out of state say that they're gonna come

here every single month until we do

whatever it is they think we should be

doing I want to give this some context

these types of demonstrations and the

kind of response that we had to put in

place today cost millions of dollars and

if we're spending money here today doing

this those are resources that could go

to other top priorities in this

community so there are number one

misusing public taxpayer resources and I

hope they think about that more

importantly

I hope that he understands that in this

national environment where we had some

mass shootings just a little over a week

ago there is an environment of fear that

is national it's not unique to Portland

but a time when people are expressing

hatred at a time when people are

expressing intolerance when there's

rhetoric that is aimed predominantly

women and people of color and immigrants

it creates a sense of uncertainty in a

sense of fear and so mr. Biggs and

others saying that they're going to come

here that feeds in to that sense of fear

so I want to be very clear we do not

want him here

in my city period

our community our mind introducing

yourself I haven't met everyone in the

room before so our officers with our

liaison team team had prior to the event

and during that made outreach efforts by

phone and person and also solicited or

event organizers to reach out to them

and a variety of means we are not outing

or saying exactly who we talk to you but

we have made these efforts in a clear

attempt to increase the safety of this

event for everyone involved

I don't know as you know the the culture

of protests and counter protests has

been with our city for decades as you

also know article 1 section 8 of the

Oregon Constitution gives individuals

the most or amongst the most expansive

First Amendment rights of any state

anywhere in the United States those

rights extend beyond what is actually in

the US Constitution so there's always

been that desire to defend and protect

that core American value of free speech

and assembly we had over 200

demonstrations in Portland over the

course of the last year and most of them

don't get any attention at all

we had a small handful that led to any

violence whatsoever those tend to get

the lion's share of the attention so I

wouldn't say it's new for us to have

demonstrations in the city of Portland

but obviously in this larger national

context where we are seeing increased

incidents of hate speech we're seeing

increased situations where where there

are mass shootings and other large-scale

events we have to be mindful that there

is a dynamic there there is a sense and

I believe that to be true that

nationally we're seeing more hate speech

more intolerance more device

this and as I say a lot of that

animosity is being geared towards women

and people of color and towards

immigrants and we are now confronting

the reality that in the United States we

have a lot arising white nationalist

movement based on white supremacy in

this country and it is impacting the

entire nation but we're certainly seeing

that play out here on the streets of

Portland and so we need to continue to

confront that reality that reality of

the growing white nationalist movement

and white supremacy in the United States

and Portland being a very progressive

community is always going to be at or

near Ground Zero when it comes to this

battle

that's just the reality so that was two

questions the first one is we don't so

when you're talking about arrests we

will be putting out information and a

press release as soon as we're able to

get it from the field about the

identities of the people involved and

the charges that they are facing the

Police Bureau does not categorize people

or put them in categories based on

political affiliation or otherwise and

so that is not for us to decide and we

won't be doing that what was your second

question so we had over 700 law

enforcement officials working in a

variety of capacities for this event I

think everybody that's all the time we

have and we'll be pushing out more

information please follow us on twitter

at portland police and we will also put

the video and transcripts up on our

website thank you thank you
