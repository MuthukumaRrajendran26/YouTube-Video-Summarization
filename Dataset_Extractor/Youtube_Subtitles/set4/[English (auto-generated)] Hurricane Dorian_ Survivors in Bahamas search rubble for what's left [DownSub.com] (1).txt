Atlantic Canada is just the latest stop

on Durin's destructive path first

pummeling the Bahamas as the strongest

storm to hit the island nation before

soaking the Carolinas floodwaters are

beginning to recede in North Carolina's

Outer Banks where the eye of Dorian

briefly came ashore Friday as a category

1 storm but hundreds of people who wrote

out the storm remain without power and

emergency officials are using boats to

ferry supplies to the islands after rows

that link to the mainland were damaged

by Dorian in the Bahamas the death toll

from hurricane Dorian has dumped to at

least 43 people but officials are

certain that number is going to rise

dramatically it's believed the storm has

left more than 70,000 people homeless

today hundreds of people lined up to

evacuate the hardest hit Abaco are Mike

Turley toward the devastation on Great

Abaco island today Mike Robin this is or

rather was the picturesque town of Marsh

Harbor on Abaco island seeing it from

the air is one thing but when you're on

the ground it's something else

15 to 20-foot swells came through here

and wiped out everything there is

nowhere for people to live nowhere for

people to work no way to make any money

as you can see the infrastructure is

gone people are scavenging for anything

they can hope here is gone

the lineup to evacuate Great Abaco was

long but orderly the make no mistake

these people were desperate to leave

four days they baked in the heat with no

food and only makeshift shelters part of

what's kept them going is a shared anger

towards a government they say has

abandoned them 19 of us trying to get

out of here how are we supposed to

sustain myself in a situation like

there's no banks nothing we don't know

where the next dollars coming from many

Bohemians have ties to Canada the

t-shirt gave the bostwick's away whose

son Barry lives in Thompson Manitoba it

was four days after Dorian before they

were able to let him know they'd

survived it wasn't me and my other two

sisters who owned the vehicle and we got

stuck in the stall for three and a half

hours and I thought I was not gonna see

him anymore

very few Bohemians are in the towns that

Dodd Great Abaco this is why they left

and this and this destruction everywhere

nothing is where it's supposed to be

these million-dollar boats were moored

at this inlet as protection against the

storm Dorian flung them around like toys

and in Marsh Harbor the only real way to

describe it is the town was annihilated

the few people who stayed are sifting

through the rubble looking for anything

to help them stay alive

many of the Haitians who live here took

refuge in the strongest building in town

but are now being told they have to

leave whether or not they leave the

island is up to them

the important thing is that choices

always rest with people they rest with

people today they rest with people next

week and a decision that's made doesn't

change what they want the decision to be

in the future

mud town was one of the three primarily

Haitian shanty towns on the island a

four and a half meters storm surge wiped

it out completely complicating matters

many of the Haitians here don't have

legal paperwork so in many ways they're

in limbo no house to live no show even

though you are morning you don't have no

shop to buy which were you gonna buy

stuff the hyenas right

there's a lot of anger focused on the

government and how slow it's been acting

that's common in disaster zones we can

say that aid is trickling and we've seen

the helicopters flying over but it's a

slow process what's going to be

extremely difficult is figuring out the

futures of everyone who lives here can

they stay should they go that's going to

be an extremely long process
