but as I said that was John was an

incident unlike anything I've seen in my

30 years with that many police officers

who were struck by gunfire and

fortunately they're all okay even equal

the important those veins were struck

including a suspect for that night we we

know to the second part of your question

about solutions as was stated previously

there is no one solution you should hold

your police department accountable to

some of the grieving about we don't

shirk their responsibilities the only

thing that we differ one really is

internet is when you place a sole

responsibility and it always happens to

be a little bit because you get people

who in one breath would say this is

clearly not a police problem in the next

breath the same people will say what are

the police your fault you know this is

almost like a default but if people have

when we don't know what to do about a

problem this is what we do and so that's

nice but doesn't solve what was that

those a couple hours like pretended

absolutely unnerving and I'll sweep that

for me always responsible for all these

men and women and so with that you know

comes with degree of anxiety in a

situation like that this was no

differently you know you have two police

officers who were trapped alone with

civilians upstairs with the gunman who

is

showing you why this president that he

was willingness still fire at police

you're worried about getting everybody

else safe and you don't know at the

moment how you're going to do that

because you know anything can go wrong

at any one moment and so one of the

things that you know I'm just amazed by

is the ability of those two officers to

remain calm for as long as they did out

and so they were in communication with

an officer who's standing right next to

me on a telephone and that in many ways

guide in our decision to do what we

needed to do what would have been far

worse for us is if he had lost

communication and didn't know whether

they were alive whether he had am at

gunpoint and so that would have forced

the Natalia every situation or works yet

if we knew that this individually

decided in charge of steps upstairs

where they work so knowing that they

were safe they were very calming and

reassuring knowing that at different

times it was a lull in the shooting and

then we took advantage of that

all those things were advantageous to us

and we were able to really think it

through and wait it out where normally

or whatever different circumstances we

wouldn't have had a choice
