MTV Video Music Awards the VMAs Taylor

was there Liz Oh Shawn Mendes but

despite all of that everybody this

morning is talking about another John

Travolta mix up here's what happened

Taylor Swift won a VMA yeah so in her

video for you need to calm down it

features a group of drag queens and

Taylor brought a bunch of them on stage

with her as you can see one of the

performers there is Jade Jolie who's a

Taylor Swift impersonator but Jonny T

apparently got a little mixed up and

thought that was the actual Taylor Swift

you know it's hard to take that one back

right it's like oh sorry as we know this

is not the first John Travolta award

show faux pas yeah he's got kind of like

a history of doing this sort of thing

right yes you may recall the Oscars

idina menzel was to perform let it go of

the iconic song from frozen let it go

introduced her as and here is adele

dazeem

yeah which i think for a solid year

after that's exactly what idina menzel

was known as everybody was making that

joke and you remember years previous to

that it was I think the Golden Globes he

won a Golden Globe and forgot to thank

his wife Kelly Preston going through his

acceptance speech the camera just kept

going to Kelly waiting for that

recognition yeah and it never came and I

think it was even registering on her on

her face going he's not gonna tell me

everything so the question begs is John

Travolta is he the greatest thing or the

worst thing for a watch oh my gosh like

I would think he would say I'm out guys

but everyone's saying stay him oh no

you're making the highlight reel every

as a matter of fact Jon we got a ticket

Canadian Country Music Awards and a

couple of weeks here on global okay we
