restoration crews were at work early

Sunday morning as post durian cleanup

continued some crews have worked around

the clock they're focused on clearing

downed trees blocking roadways across

the region many residents were out early

doing their part and I heard the tree

snap then turned around and actually saw

it fall directly into the windshield

Dorian made a mess but in terms of the

passing tropical storm Halifax may have

dodged a bullet

early reports show the eye of the storm

passed south of Halifax

although the winds did reach well into

the hurricane-force category some of

those strongest winds didn't quite make

it on shore so in that respect

absolutely but the front end of the

storm did bring wind gusts when landfall

happened were clocked between 120 to 150

kilometres an hour range toppling at our

crane where police remain on scene

Sunday Police Chief Dan Kinsella said

police did speak with the construction

company and others about securing sites

before Dorian's the Ministry of Labor

has been contacted and they are going to

be looking into the details around how

and why the crane itself collapsed it

will be their investigation to complete

and and continue the site will remain

closed for the investigation meaning no

work will be allowed are obviously

concerned about what happened on some of

the construction sites and the debris

that happened but I think one thing that

is demonstrated to all Nova Scotian is

that when they get a warning like this

they need to pay attention to it the Red

Cross continues to run three emergency

shelter sites and the Halifax Regional

Municipality have added five comfort

stations to give residents without power

a place to go and power up and recharge

even as prepared as Nova Scotia was the

Dorian cleanup won't happen overnight

it'll take some time to get back to
