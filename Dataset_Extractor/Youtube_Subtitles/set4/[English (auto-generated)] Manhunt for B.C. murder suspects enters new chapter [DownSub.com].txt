as the RCMP begins to scale down their

search efforts and move out of northern

Manitoba some of the focus is now

shifting to Northern Ontario police

received a call yesterday that suggests

they may have been looking in the wrong

place an unconfirmed sighting in the

small town of Kapuskasing Ontario near

Timmins a full day's drive from Gillam

Manitoba police received a call about

two suspicious men who looked like the

BC murder suspects driving a white car

officers responded but their search

turned up nothing in just the past week

Ontario police say they've received

dozens of tips but still no sign of

Canada's most wanted men

the longer they're not found in the bush

the more likely they will be dead but

then there's also another scenario

flipside that's somehow they they're

there someplace else so there is that

that element that of the unknown did

they somehow escape the dragnet the

absence of answers is breeding unease

across the country and probably nowhere

more so than in Gilliam the small town

at the center of the massive manhunt is

now watching police pack up and head

home

well there's mixed feelings some people

are still feeling the effects of this

and still feeling unsure and and

concerned another few others are going

back to a life of normalcy a trying to

carry on Manitoba's top Mountie says

that some of their officers will remain

stationed in Gilliam and the search

there will continue but the RCMP is

asking everyone regardless of your

province to be on the lookout and if you

see anyone that matches the suspects

description don't approach don't post on

social media but pick up your phone and

call police
