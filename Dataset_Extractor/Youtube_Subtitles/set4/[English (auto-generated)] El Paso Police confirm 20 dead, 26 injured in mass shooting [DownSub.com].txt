as they show to me what a video taking

place in this community about how people

in this community we're standing in

lines around buildings to give blood to

provide water to provide support and as

they pointed out El Paso is defined not

by the catastrophe that struck this town

the way El Paso is really defined is the

way this community comes together and

supports each other to bridge the divide

of this catastrophe this happened today

toward the pathway of where El Paso will

be tomorrow Texas and everybody in this

community we must do one thing today one

thing tomorrow in each and every day

after this we must unite and especially

I want to emphasize the importance of

every man and woman black brown white

whatever your race may be now is the

time protections to come together to

support each other to help these

families in need and to make sure that

El Paso is going to be able to take a

step forward that it needs to take I've

known for more than two decades a man

who has a passion for El Paso and the

people of this town and as your great

mayor who will speak next

Thank You governor we appreciate your

attendance here under these

circumstances this is a tough time for

El Paso something less would have ever

imagined my condolence and prayer

condolences and prayers go out to all of

El Paso as we mourn those who have been

impacted by this tragedy Adair and I

with the rest of El Paso will pray for

and mourn those who we have lost we will

remember their lives and honor their

memories together our community will not

be defined by this senseless evil act of

violence we will be defined by the unity

and compassion we showed in the wake of

this tragedy United our community will

heal El Paso was too strong to be broken

by a cowardly act like this one I want

to assure that the assure the el paso

community that we are safe we are safe

thank you to the El Paso Police

Department and our law enforcement

partners for their swift response and

assistance I will now turn it over to

chief Allen for specifics thank you very

active shooter called one out this

morning to 911 at 10:30 9:00 a.m. police

response first officer on the scene was

10:45 a.m. a six-minute response time

from this shooter we have 20 confirmed

fatalities and we have 26 wounded the

ages and genders of all these people

injured and killed are numerous in the

age groups

situation needless to say as a horrific

one crime scene is being assisted by the

FBI various law enforcement agencies

respond to this scene the Sheriff's

Department

DPS border patrol everyone that carries

a badge in this town pretty much showed

up to that particular scene but needless

to say the scene as a horrific one

unfortunately because of the nature of

the situation the scene will be in play

for a long period unfortunately the

deceased will remain at the scene until

the scene is processed properly for

evidentiary purposes to be gathered for

later prosecution the state of Texas

will be the lead agency or entity

prosecuting this particular individual

it has the Nexus at this point in time

to a hate crime the FBI will be looking

into that with other federal authorities

right now we're looking at potential

capital murder charges for this

individual I'm not going to give you his

name right now he's a 21 year old white

male I love Alan Texas and with that

I'll turn this over to chief Agostino

who personnel responded as well thank

you chief Alan I want to highlight what

the chief and our mayor was saying and

this incident that happened this morning

it activated the whole system and the

system was successful from the first

calls that came to 9-1-1 getting crews

on the scene within within six minutes

we had hundreds of responders not just

from local but state and federal as they

said as tragic as it is luckily we had

no first responders injured in today's

events but it does take a toll I'd ask

that the community keep their thoughts

and prayers not only with the victims

and their families who lost their lives

or were injured today but with their

first responders as well with that I'm

going to turn it over to the FBI

religion in charge thank you my name is

Emerson Bui EMM er s o nbu IE as a

member of this community for the last

two years words cannot express how I

feel right now because this community

has embraced me with open arms and I

share the sentiments of everyone at the

table as to how we all feel for the

families and the victims today the FBI

has a federal law enforcement agency

responsible for a number of jurisdiction

has come in to assist with the other

federal agencies as well as state and

other local agencies just to provide

support in the investigation as this

murder investigation continues as well

as look at other aspects of the

investigation that could potentially be

looked at from a federal standpoint the

investigation is still early on the

primary concern of course is the victims

making sure they receive the care and

courtesy that they deserve and as we

continue to move to this investigation

we will provide updates along with our

other partners we'll take a few

questions it would be best for the FBI

to answer that question

well first and foremost I did not call

it a crime I said we're looking at other

aspects to ensure what potential

violations are out there before we can

label any type of investigation we have

to ensure that the evidence and the

precursors are there and they have to be

reviewed to make sure that we are

executing and moving in the right

direction so at this point in time we're

reviewing the evidence that we have

collected so far we're pursuing other

leads we have mobilized additional

officers for assistance in that vein and

we will conduct investigations just like

we have in other incidents again no

right now it is a murder investigation

there is potential for a number of

different other types of violations and

we're reviewing all the evidence to make

a determination as to what potentially

else is out there in addition to the

violations that have been stated that

the local authorities are pursuing and

in that vein we will assist them in that

effort as we work together with state

and local and other federal agencies all

over the country to do and we will keep

you updated as the investigation

proceeds right now we have a manifesto

from this individual that indicates to

some degree it has a nexus to potential

hate crime they didn't mean to step on

FBI stoles on that but we are taking

this down the road of simply a murder

investigation with numerous casualties

and as I said the state of Texas will be

the lead prosecuting agency in this

department sir well I can't get into

specifics on that right now

because we have to validate for a

certain certainty that this was the

manifesto from this individual that

we've arrested so with that in play we

still have to be aware of the fact that

this person is still entitled to a fair

process as far as the law we don't want

to complicate that by making any

statements right now that might be

tainting the investigation

would you mind repeating that we're not

able ascertain that right now simply

because hospitals will not release that

information to us specifically again

those are details that we're going to

keep under play right now as far as the

investigation goals we have one weapon

that was put on social media I'm sure

you're aware of that which was a ak-47

we don't know if there was pictures

released in social media where the

actual individual so right now again

going back to the fare process for this

individual we don't want to tank the

investigation by matter-of-factly saying

things right now you mind repeating the

head

know the capability of the weapon

allowed that and then his intent and

then the location of worried chose was a

Walmart a super mark where people are in

large numbers there so if your friend

are firing randomly appeal it damage

again know

again the initial information coming in

well several suspects that information

was put out to the field we had

misleading information going to

different locations as far as

supermarkets Costco was one location

Dillard's was another everyone was

responding to that social media somewhat

influenced that but in the final

analysis of all this suspect was

arrested at Sun Mount and invite out

which is on the west side of the Walmart

out there where the initial shooting

took place I'm sorry yes he surrendered

to the approaching officers I don't know

that matter-of-factly but he surrendered

to police upon being seen right now we

only have one you're asking for

specifics right now right now that's

still under investigation

that's for psychologists the answer it's

something that is definitely I think in

play but that's beyond my skill sets

I only caught the blend of that man we

train we train for active shooters

events all the time and as I've said to

my staff into the department we trained

for this not expecting that to happen

but nonetheless we have to prepare for

it to happen and we try to get the

community as much as involved as we

possibly can to participate in this

event so that everyone is under

understanding of what this potentially

might cause this responding to a

situation like this to try to make sure

it doesn't have it again is a

replication of what we just went through

during the last legislative session it

was May a year ago when we had the

horrific tragedy of a shooting at Santa

Fe High School that led to three days of

hearings that are conducted at the

Capitol to get input from people who

were educators who were students who are

victims of shooting crimes as well as

experts in all different kinds of fields

to help us be able to strategize the

best ways to students safe and to

prevent incidents like that from

happening again that led to hearings

that were conducted by the legislature

before the session began then additional

hearings and then legislation that was

passed by the state of Texas and is now

law then includes bill after bill after

bill that makes sure that we are doing

more than ever before to keep students

safe at school during that time we did

not as far as I know evaluate for and

plan for an incident like this that said

I can tell you that perhaps the most

profound and agreed-upon issue that came

out of all of those hearings was the

need for the state and for society to do

a better job of dealing with challenging

mental health based issues we know

that's a component to shootings that

take place in schools I think it's a

fact probably is a component to any type

of shooting that takes place including

for example

the shooting that took place in

Sutherland Springs bottom line is mental

health is a large contributor to any

type of violence or shooting violence

and the set of Texas this past session

passed a lot of legislation and provided

funding for the state to better address

that challenge so the question about the

manifesto and this emerging narrative

that we're seeing throughout our country

as to domestic terrorism which is you

know and obviously I want to say we

don't know we have to allow the

investigation to continue I respect the

process very much so

but without regard to this particular

instance not speaking about this

particular instance which is still under

investigation but the the manifesto

narrative is fueled by hate and it's

fueled by racism and bigotry and

division and ALP it's it's you know I

want to say the national media is

watching El Paso has historically been a

very safe community

we've been safe for decades we will

continue to be safe this is someone who

came from outside of our community to do

us harm a community that has shown

nothing but generosity and kindness to

the least among us those people arriving

at America's front door and so we'll

wait to see what happens with this

investigation

once we have a determination by law

enforcement then I think you will see a

lot of us coming together to make some

very strong statements but for now we

will let the investigation continue I

want I let me just say one thing in

closing to echo what Congress

and Escobar said this person did not

come from El Paso it is not what we were

about we are a special community and

this would not have happened from an El

Paso and I can assure you now you may

have I want to thank the governor and

other elected officials who have

expressed their support here and there

also you all may want to know if there

going to be any more updates on this and

I'm gonna let chief Allen close with

that will do another press conference if

we find out anything different that we

can expound upon later everyone thank

you all for coming
