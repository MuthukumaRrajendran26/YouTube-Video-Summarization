the remoteness of this location is on

full display as the RCMP search for two

men wanted on canada-wide arrest

warrants in connection with three deaths

in BC at this point a number of people

are questioning why these two

individuals would choose this location

Gillam Manitoba it is in the far north

of Manitoba close to Churchill which is

of course known for polar bears now the

mayor Dewayne Forman talked a little bit

about the area and says he's not sure

why these people would come here because

really there's nowhere to go

PR 280 is a 197 kilometer gravel road

stretching from Thompson to Gilliam

it's a very rough road but at junctions

often a junction point 30 kilometres

north of here where junctions off - 290

PR - 90 is what heads to Fox Lake area

and

that's where some of the officers are

right now and additional officers are in

the gilliam area now we did have a

chance to drive around the community and

we saw a number of children on bikes

people out in their yards enjoying the

evening so there is a mix in the

community some people obviously upset

hesitant about their safety but still

trying to continue on with regular life

I know that some people are scared I

mean something like this has never

happened so a lot of people are kind of

worried lock keeping their doors lock

like normal safety measures we do notice

that some there aren't very many people

out on the streets that could just be

the time of day but RCMP are still

asking people to stay vigilant to pay

attention to anyone in the area and of

course call them if they see something

one of the things that we have been

centered around as far as information

here in gilliam is a vehicle that was

located burnt out RCMP confirming it was

connected to the two wanted individuals

that vehicle we can tell you has since

been moved out of Gilliam it is now in

Thompson Manitoba RCMP are dealing with

that right now at this point the

investigation the search is ongoing for

these two individuals who have made

their way somehow from BC to northern
