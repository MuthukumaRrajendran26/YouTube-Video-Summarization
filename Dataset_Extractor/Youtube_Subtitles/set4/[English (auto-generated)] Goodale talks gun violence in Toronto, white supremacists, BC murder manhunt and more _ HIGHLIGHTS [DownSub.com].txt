Julie as you know we have taken a number

of steps already to to deal with the the

risks and the threats of gun violence

bill C 71 included a number of measures

including stronger background checks

license verification better

record-keeping rules around

transportation and so forth all of those

aimed at at making our society safer

we've also invested significantly with

provinces and territories in a guns and

gangs strategy 214 million dollars will

be flowing to provinces and territories

to assist them with local

community-based initiatives including

law enforcement measures but also

prevention measures as well

there's also over fifty million dollars

that is going to the CBSA to strengthen

its capacities at the border to

interdict smuggled weapons and there's

another twenty five million dollars

incremental amount for the RCMP to deal

with straw purchases and illicit

tracking systems and so forth I would

also mention the ongoing forty five

million dollars a year for our various

crime prevention strategies in addition

to that the Prime Minister asked

Minister Blair to conduct an extensive

consultation which he did

listening to all manner of opinion on on

these issues and he has provided his his

report to the to the prime minister the

content of that report and other facts

and information including ongoing events

are shaping the the policy proposals

that we will be making to to Canadians

in the weeks immediately ahead and

Canadians will have an opportunity to

listen to the competing views of all the

political parties but they'll see a very

strong presentation from the government

I

and Canadians will be able to decide and

mr. Blair's been studying us for a long

time

New Zealand brought in a band within a

month of the Christchurch shootings what

is the holdup here we are taking all

relevant factors into account to me well

I I can't comment on other countries but

I do say that we we are we are examining

our own circumstances where we're

observing obviously what other countries

have done or not done and we are are

taking our own Canadian decisions and

we're doing so obviously on on the the

eve of a very important democratic

decision the Canadians will have to take

we had a very interesting conversation

about that set of issues about extreme

right-wing organizations white

supremacist organizations neo-nazi

organizations in the context of the of

the vise meeting in in London just as

that as that meeting was was beginning

the shooting in California took place

that the the Garlic Festival and then

followed by obviously other tragedies

and at least in some of those cases it's

pretty apparent from the evidence that's

available so far that there were strains

of right-wing extremism and violent

extremism that that laid the foundation

and contributed to that behavior we have

indicated for some considerable time now

that we are concerned about this the the

head of the the security intelligence

organization has indicated his concern

is concerned as well David vino we have

taken a number of steps both in the

context of our response to the incident

in Christchurch

but also as a part of a process that had

begun even before the the incident in

Christchurch we have taken the step of

listing certain explicitly listing

certain right-wing organizations under

the the Criminal Code the the

organization known as blood and honor

and the other one known as combat

eighteen that have a particularly

violent record in places around the

world they have a presence in Canada

they are now listed as terrorist

organizations under the provisions of

the Canadian Criminal Code which

enhances the tools available to law

enforcement to deal with those

organizations and obviously we will be

examining others as that becomes

appropriate on the basis of the of the

right of the right evidence but when you

think of the circumstances that have

caused serious and tragic losses of life

in Canada the the pattern is is

disturbing if you go back far enough the

the shootings at at ecole polytechnique

and at Dawson College were were acts of

misogyny that that have its roots in

that kind of extreme right-wing

mentality the the shooting at the mosque

in in Santa is another illustration the

shootings that killed police officers in

various locations Merrythought and

Moncton for example would indicate again

that same kind of right-wing extremist

mentality the the van attack along Yonge

Street in in Toronto another

illustration of that same kind of

negative

extremely violent right-wing perspective

citizens but maybe don't have the

financial capacity or the technical

know-how to be able to do it the large

company should assist the smaller

companies in in being part of the

solution rather than being part of the

problem and and one argument that I have

constantly made is transparency about

the algorithms so that so that there is

common public understanding about how

those algorithms are being used to draw

people in and to to pursue a certain

business model for the companies but but

the public has a right to know how their

information is being used shared and

potentially abused so the algorithms

need to be as transparent as possible so

that the public knows what's happening

with the information their own

information or the information that

they're exposed to maybe this

incentivizes them if if human harm is

done if a child is terrorized for the

rest of their life because of what

happened to them on the internet if

there are other damages and costs then

maybe the platform that made that

possible should bear the financial

consequences

a separate matter do you have any update

on the manhunt for the BC murder suspect

I I don't have anything as of today the

the RCMP will be providing as much

information as they can as this

situation unfolds obviously from what

they have done they have left no stone

unturned in the pursuit of these two

culprits they have used resources within

the RCMP they've reassigned resources

from other locations to where they're

are finding tips or leads to to follow

they have called upon the external

resources of the Canadian Armed Forces

they've been using technology they've

been using the k-9 unit and the

amphibious unit clearly the RCMP are

treating this whole case with enormous

seriousness and they continue as of

today to follow every new lead to follow

every na I I don't have anything as of

today the the RCMP will be providing as

much information as they can as this

situation unfolds obviously from what

every new tip to take the appropriate

steps to examine where the where the

evidence may be and as they are able to

comment in any tangible way about a

particular sighting or a lead or a major

break in the case

they will they will do that but the

public can be assured that their efforts

are continuing together with other

police forces in the country as well

that are totally engaged in making sure

that the public is safe from these two

people thank you all very much
