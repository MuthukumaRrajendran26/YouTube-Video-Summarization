it's time for the best meteor shower of

the year the Perseids you may not

realize this but we get meteor showers

as a result of comments comments like

planets orbit the Sun as they do this

gas and dust are lost from the comet

escaping into space

giving it its tail as Earth orbits the

Sun it intersects the path of a comet in

the case of the Perseids we pass through

109 P Swift Tuttle's orbit this comet

has an orbital period of a hundred and

thirty three years but the debris hangs

around space for a long time now because

earth is orbiting the Sun at a speed

180,000 km/h it plows into the debris

which in turn burns up in our atmosphere

producing the lovely meteors we see
