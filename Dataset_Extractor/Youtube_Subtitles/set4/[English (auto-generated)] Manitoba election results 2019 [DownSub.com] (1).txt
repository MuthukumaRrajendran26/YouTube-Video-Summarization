three the home of Manitoba's government

is quiet tonight soon these halls will

be filled with the provinces 42nd

Assembly but who will lead that group

and the province tonight we find out on

September 10th 2019 in the upcoming

provincial election and with that the

stage was set for the forty second time

in Manitoba history the people have the

opportunity to decide the future of our

province Brian Pallister challenged by

fresh faces with Wahb canoe now leading

the NDP and Dugald Lamont with the

Liberals there are people who are not

happy with what happened with 50 Palika

theses promises have been made more jobs

predictable stable funding we've got to

roll back the changes that we're done

and through it all we listen to you this

is not an isolated situation this has

happened to other people I would

definitely link the robberies that we've

seen to just fast cash to drugs

licensed practical nurses working whose

jobs were totally eliminated will

Manitobans stay the course with the

Progressive Conservatives for his new

leadership needed this is decision

Manitoba

[Music]

good evening and thank you for joining

us for decision Manitoba 2019 this is

your provincial election headquarters

global news and 680 C J OB are teaming

up for extensive coverage tonight

bringing you election results when they

happen along with analysis of what the

future holds for Manitoba our team of

reporters is positioned at the leaders

headquarters we'll be hearing from them

throughout the night

Global's Brittany Green slate is

standing by with the Progressive

Conservatives Kevin Hirschfeld is

keeping his eye on the NDP Global's Joe

Scarpelli is watching the liberal camp

tonight and a Burma gouken is with the

Green Party in the woolsley riding as

they look for their first seat ever in

Manitoba tonight now the polls have just

closed and as soon as data becomes

available to us we'll be bringing it to

you if you're watching on TV you'll

notice to the right of the screen

results from individual ridings will

cycle through we also have a running

seat count it will show you the total

number of seats a party is either

leading or elected in and remember each

party is hoping to get to 29 seats the

number needed for a majority now for

those of you listening on radio or if

you'd like to follow online tonight you

can head over to global news CA /

Winnipeg for results and a live stream

of this broadcast

now as the numbers begin to reveal

themselves this evening will be bringing

new commentary of what it all means and

for that I'd like to welcome 680 CTO B's

Richard clue che and Global News chief

political correspondent David akin to

the show gentlemen let's begin by

talking about the big picture well the

big picture is Brian Pallister

has 40 last time around in 2016

40 of 57 seats now with healthcare being

a key part of this general election will

you be able to keep that 40 and what

does that mean for the other parties

here David the NDP are trying to build

on 12 seats from last time around that's

right this is a really interesting

election in that there are four parties

that could all say mission accomplished

at the end of the night and let's take a

look the PCs want to hold the majority

but they could lose 10 seats and still

have a majority

that's the PCs mission accomplished

while canoe in the

get to 12 16 18 seats that's mission

accomplished

Duke Lamont's liberals they want to hold

official party status that's mission

accomplished and for the Green Party of

Manitoba never ever want to seek before

maybe tonight's the night I think

they've got a chance and that would be

mission accomplished for that party so

Lisa there's lots of stories within the

stories that we're going to be tracking

this evening you bet all right we're

also joined by global senior current

affairs reporter Eric Sorenson

he's helping keep an eye on those key

ridings and the entire province Eric

Lisa if Brian Pallister has one

advantage this election night

it is Manitoba's own history the

disposition of Manitobans to elect a

government and then re-elected a second

time in the 99 year history of the

Manitoba Legislature building only the

government of stirling lyon in 1981 did

not get a second mandate that history

and the will of Manitobans will be

tested once more tonight I'm not aware

of any rift in the Conservative Party

for over 60 years

only the Conservatives and New Democrats

have governing Manitoba Conservative

premier Duff Roblin won four elections

then ed Schreyer assured in the very

first NDP government for two terms a

pattern unique to Manitoba was

established a battle of left and right

with ample time for each to govern

there's also the north/south divide

conservatives have won consistently in

the rich farmland of southern Manitoba

while the NDP has usually won in the

less populated mining and indigenous

communities in the north in Winnipeg New

Democrats have won primarily from the

city core to the north to the east side

the Conservatives have often won the

neighborhood's in Winnipeg south and

west

the battleground to form government

often decided by ridings that swing

between north and south left and right

and when Manitobans are ready for change

and so new democrat Howard Poli won two

elections then Gary filmin won three for

the Conservatives then the NDP came back

to win four times three with Gary dewer

and one with Greg Selinger and that

brings us to 2016 the electoral map went

massively blue and Premier Brian

Pallister hopes Manitobans will do what

they've done so often give a first-time

government a second term so a Brian

Pallister

enters this election night with a little

history on his side now history

also suggests the main challenge will

come from Wahb canoe and the NDP though

Dougal of Lamont and the Liberals hope

to change the course of manitoba history

and the Greens hope to write a brand new

chapter all together the results will

begin to fill in our virtual legislature

the pcs in blue with 38 seats at

disillusion are defending their place on

the government benches the new democrats

in orange have just 12 seats at

disillusion the bottom line for the

Liberals in red retain official party

status with at least four seats plus

three other independents in gray the

total 57 but on this night the count

starts at zero the slate is wiped clean

fifty-seven separate elections are under

way the counting just beginning from

Manitoba's 42nd Legislative Assembly

Lisa all right thanks for that Eric

Soren sent a wealth of history there

yeah I just wanted to point out that we

do have zeros zeros zeros across the

board

nobody is leading or elected right now

and for those listening on CGI be

watching at home trust us we've got a

pipeline to elections Manitoba the

minute that they count a ballot it's

going to show up in our results at the

bottom of our screen and we'll be sure

all night long I'm going to tell you if

you're listening on the radio online

right now nobody is leading or elected

anywhere in the province it's still what

three minutes in yeah we should have

some results probably within the next

ten minutes and one of the other things

I'll be looking for tonight is that

voter turnout last time around it was 56

percent a lot of people are saying I'll

be it'll be amazing if we get to 50

percent all right David akin Richard

Cloutier thanks for that now let's check

in with our reporters again they're

stationed throughout Winnipeg tonight

Britney Greenslade joins us from the PC

Party headquarters Britney the Tories

hoping to retain that comfortable

majority what's the vibe down there

tonight yeah Lisa a lot of nervous

energy here at the Conservative Party

headquarters now the Tories want a

majority government back in 2016 putting

them in power for the first time in 17

years now Brian Pallister kept his

promise and lowered the PST in the first

term but he also brought in widespread

health care reform so do Manitobans

agree with those difficult decisions or

is it too much too

tonight is the test can Pallister hold

on to that majority government and how

many seats can he keep away from the NDP

that's where our Kevin Hirschfeld is

live tonight Kevin well the NDP is

hoping for redemption tonight it was

three years ago when they were

resoundingly booted out of power tonight

they come in with a new leader Wahb

canoe and they're hoping to take back

many of those seeds that they lost in

that 2016 Tory landslide now canoe has

said it since the start of this campaign

health care is the number one issue he

says the Tories changes have been

reckless had been too fast will

Manitobans agree with him we can find

out very shortly the Liberal Party also

hoping to make major gains tonight and

send it to their headquarters now where

Joel Scarpelli is joke Kevin thank you

Liberal leader Dougal Demont believes

his party is stronger and more organized

than it's been in a generation and

tonight the Liberals are trying to prove

just that but for one lawsuit and the

Liberals are once again without official

party status now let's check in with

Amber McGowan covering the Green Party

[Music]

thanks Joe the Green Party is hoping to

make history here tonight getting their

first seat ever in Manitoba and Wolseley

is where they're putting the most of

their hope here tonight last election

they were about 400 votes away from

securing the seat and the NDP incumbent

is out there thinking this could be

their year and polls are showing about

one in ten amount of Tobin's say they

would vote green so we'll see how they

do here tonight back to you Lisa all

right thanks so that so much for that

Amber Magoo can now begin now we're

gonna take a look at a handful of

ridings we're keeping a close eye on

tonight beginning with Saint Boniface

David akin yeah so I picked this riding

why because voters in a by-election said

they're gonna do something different

this was great Salinger's riding a

course in Dougal Mont wanted in a

by-election I liked ridings that could

be up for change all my friends and

Steinbach I'm sorry I know what you're

gonna do tonight you're gonna like to

progress a conservative boring st.

Boniface those voters there they made

some changes last time so I'm looking at

that we got a liberal leader

larysa Simpson the Democrats she'd be

the other favorite I think if Lamont

doesn't win so we'll keep an eye on st.

Boniface all night long that's one of my

key writings all right we now have

woolsley and this is where you saw the

really tight Green Party race last

election that's right so my NDP insiders

are pretty confident that new Democrat

Lisa mailers gonna win here but I like

the green story greens are the Official

Opposition in PEI Greens won three

ridings in New Brunswick they won their

first riding Ontario and Greens hold the

balance of power in BC will greens

tonight will Manitoba join that trend

will the Greens win one at least tonight

because if they do I think there's gonna

be walls Lee David knickers is the green

candidate and that's why I'm watching

Wilson well and I'm watching a tube but

that riding is less granola than it used

to be because of redistribution so Lisa

Naylor I still think is the favor there

for the NDP but it'll be fascinating now

I have two ridings as well in winnipeg

st. Patel to me is key if the NDP are

going to make inroads on the healthcare

issue

Jamie Moses who has been knocking on

doors for the past six months with Nancy

Allen who used to have that riding for

the NDP Colleen Maher is a cabinet

minister so she goes down we'll find out

early whether or not the NDP are making

that comeback

that's a key Winnipeg ride

for me but I don't want to be accused of

having perimeter itis so let's go to

dolphin out in the western part of

Manitoba this is a riding that the NDP

need to retain if they're gonna grow

from 12 they lost it back in 2016 they

need to get this one back it used to be

always solid NDP territory so it's one

of those writings that if we find out

early in the evening that the NDP are

doing well and take that back then

suddenly I think the NDP are making a

comeback is that a thing for remedy

writers can you really get that in this

demo you can I do have some ointment for

it I think there's vaccinations all

right right no numbers to report just

yet but stay with us still to come

this weekend only welcome back we're

gonna try to bit about the big topic

this election and that's healthcare the

Pallister government made some major

changes Lisa we're still waiting for

results and the big changes here were in

Winnipeg in battleground Winnipeg in the

north and the Northeast and in the south

and really if the NDP are going to make

any inroads David it's going to be on

that healthcare issue ya know I think so

you mentioned that to me you're talking

about dolphin is one of the NDP

strongholds they have to snap back

dolphin Thompson Brandon EES fine

then there's three ridings right in

Winnipeg that are affected by the ER

closures that they could win Radisson

McPhillips trans Kona those are right

now PC ridings and we could get

something coming up first results now

along the bottom of the screen and for

our listeners we're gonna tell you we

have leading and elected right now the

Liberals showing one Progressive

Conservatives NDP and Green Party all

sitting at zero right now in borderland

the Liberal candidate Lauren brawl

showing 45% of the vote

over Josh Gunter from the PC Party but

right now that's one out of 46 one call

and this ain't gonna be the way it

finishes tonight I'll bet you Looney

absolutely borderland cliff Grayden is

running as an independent after he was

tossed out from the Progressive

Conservative caucus this will be one

that's interesting to watch throughout

the evening yeah I think the

Conservatives are Progressive

Conservatives are favored they're cliffs

an outside shot if the Liberals win

there they're gonna have a fabulous

night all over the throttles let me tell

you that all right David akin Richard

clutch a thank you now another part of

our coverage tonight

is our panel that's being hosted by 680

CJ o B's Julie Buckingham Julie welcome

inside the PC headquarters at the canons

Polo Park and honor

panel joined on my far left by my 680 CJ

ob colleague Hal Anderson former

political or retired political scientist

Shannon Sanford and a one-time mayoral

candidate Jenny mock colic and they'll

be providing us some insight what we've

heard from listeners on the air from

their background as a politician and

covering the politicians for many many

years and this has been really a

campaign that I think Hal and I have

talked about on the air that we've been

concerned that there haven't been enough

issues to really pull people to the

polls to the ballot box last time around

there is that appetite to really boot

out the NDP do you think there was

enough issues Jenny to really get people

fired up I think that was part of the

strategy Julie you know it's a classic

frontrunner campaign that was run by the

PC party Manitoba and I think the

results will play out in their favor the

truth is I agree with you I don't think

there was there were an awful lot of

exciting issues to talk about obviously

healthcare is something that people are

talking about but let's face it we have

to do something to fix the health care

in the problem face it

ladies it was a boring game results I

don't think that was the bigger the big

gamble of the NDP to make this a one

party one big issue health care and he

failed they failed at it miserably how

did lob fail and Bob failed by just

focusing on health care and I think he

should have been much broader he could

have done the math crisis he could have

done education he could have been

broader an illustration would have been

very welcome from my perspective you

know we talk a lot about how we're gonna

spend our money we're gonna spend money

on healthcare and spend money on

education I think though for me I'm

really looking for somebody to tell me

how we're gonna make some money right

how are we gonna really truly drive our

economy in the province because let's

face it money is the thing that we need

do all conservative the NDP if they were

to be really sharp should have stepped

in though and talked about the math

crisis and I think that you know if

you're going to talk about it in the

healthcare crisis the math crisis is the

bigger driver but if you pull minute we

saw in the polling though that the only

issue Manitoba

health care that was actually created

that was created by the NDP and by the

unions I think that was created I don't

know it's real you think that the the

union vote had a real impact on this

camp I think the union's

vote did have an impact and also I think

the fact that the unions were so busy

the first two weeks fighting inside

inside themselves it's possible that

that was another part of a front-running

trilogy absolutely in a summer election

in Manitoba very smart mr. Pallister so

Shannon what do you think the strategy

was behind the Pallister campaign to say

at times we are working on health care

we are pushing it forward and then other

times saying this was an NDP report that

we are acting well you know he was very

smart mr. Pallister in a lot of ways he

was very humble and very very clear that

you know what maybe we did come in a

little too fast but you know we're

willing to talk to you about how we

could do it better yeah if you give us

another mandate that was smart of him to

say you know maybe we did a little too

quick we're ready to kind of come back

on it we're gonna pause the pin that's

right and we'll keep coming back to you

throughout the evening for our thoughts

let's throw it back to the desk it's

good all right Julie buckingham thank

you right now leading and elected the

Progressive Conservatives are showing

for the NDP to the Liberal and Green

Party still at zero right now let's

check in on some of our early results

key word early three out of 46 polls

reporting in borderland Josh Gunther the

PC candidate with 29 percent of the vote

moving on now to lakeside we'll see what

the numbers are looking like there again

it's very early in the evening one poll

reporting there where Ralph Eichler the

PC incumbent is showing the lead with

57% of the vote to the NDP candidates

32% insane fatale now I know Richard you

wanted to talk a bit about this writing

Jamie Moses in the lead right now over

the Liberal candidate but again only one

out of 42 polls reporting but if the NDP

are to make inroads tonight they need to

take this riding back so far 40 percent

47 percent of the votes in st. Vittal

for the NDP and the night is kind of

turning out a little bit the way it

should be pcs out to a lead 7

over the NDP - all right and a quick

look at the POC ME sack again - out of

54 polls reporting Amanda Laflin 86% of

the vote the NDP incumbent they're over

the PCs Ron Evans and I should point out

in all the polls that are reporting so

far all the incumbents are pretty much

holding except in st. for tau that right

now is the only pick up of the night

it's an ND pick up NDP pick up over the

Conservatives all right we're gonna toss

it over to Eric Sorensen now with a

quick tour of our electoral map Eric

over to you Lisa the map is beginning to

fill in and it is looking interesting as

every election does for example the NDP

if it's going to make a comeback would

expect that they could take back

Thompson but for the moment they're not

let's have a look at that board and see

what is going on in Thompson Manitoba

and you can see that Kelley bindle has a

a narrow lead over Danielle Adams again

for the NDP this is I must take back if

they are actually going to challenge on

the evening looking at that map again we

can see that there are some ridings

filling in there's the Paul cami sac is

going to the NDP for the moment but a

Swan River Riding Mountain both going

conservative there's borderland remember

earlier we were talking about it being

liberal that was momentary and that may

have only been be the only time it goes

that way

now of course we want to go in and look

at Winnipeg Winnipeg has the most

ridings in the province it has the most

swing ridings it is where these

elections are usually decided you can

see right there sandy tell that's what

David was talking about it is the one

riding so far that looks like it might

be a take away inside the city of

Winnipeg and that is Kildonan River East

I believe that would be expected to be a

hold for the Conservatives back to you

Lisa

all right Eric Sorensen thanks so much

for that we're gonna check out a few

more ridings in Manitoba right now as

the early results start to come in

riding Mountain the PC incumbent Greg

Nesbitt ahead with 61% of the vote again

- at 81 polls reporting it's very early

in the night riding mountain is one of

those ridings where it's PC all the way

Kildonan River east one poll reporting

there pc incumbent Cathy Cox in the lead

with 49% of the vote elections Manitoba

doing a good job getting these Rizzo

then polls have been closed now for 23

minutes and it species 9 NDP for liberal

zero green zero leading an elected in

Steinbach there is one of your PCs

leading Kevin Gertz didn't I tell you

Steinbach was gonna send us a

Progressive Conservative Kelvin ger to

Lima back I'll bet my bottom dollar and

right now he'd be disappointed it only

90s you are there you are rich you all

right and swan river still just one poll

reporting your PC incumbent Rick Wow

Chuck with 71% of the vote so the night

is unfolding as I said you know sort of

to plan we saw a couple of pollsters

active again PCs nine twice as much and

more than the NDP at four seats Liberals

are not leading and elected anywhere and

the greens are not leading and elected

anywhere but we only have 13 of the 57

seeds now with any results and as you

listen to this and as you watch this you

have to be reminded that you have to

draw a line really from Dauphin Manitoba

right through the heart of the city of

Winnipeg to Steinbach everything on the

north of that riding that line is

usually NDP territory to the south and

west is usually progressive conservative

and as these numbers are coming in right

now it's the pigs very similar to that

pattern it goes back to the history of

Manitoba politics alright our show

tonight is being simulcast on 680 CJ OB

and we want to mention that our

reporters are paired off with CJ OB

reporters and hosts throughout the night

let's check in now with globals Britney

Greenslade she's live down at PC

headquarters tonight joined by 680 CJ

obese Greg Macklin hey Brit hi Lisa one

of the biggest things we've been hearing

out biggest issues to voters this

go-around has been health care so I want

to bring in 680 C GOP host Greg Macklin

now and Greg you've been getting a

listeners to call in for months now what

have they been saying about health care

and really what it matters to them we've

heard from everyone from Mon paw Jane

and Joe Q public nurses doctors people

that are within the system and they all

have an opinion union leaders if you've

had health care you have an opinion on

this and it runs the gamut from it's

great we didn't need to change a thing

too

admitting that we needed to change some

things but I think even premier

Pallister at the time admitted in the

last couple of weeks or so that maybe

this was too much too quick while canoe

is admitted that yes changes needed to

take place but has been uncomfortable

with the speed of those changes and I

think that maybe has been the refining

commentary on this topic throughout the

last several weeks of the campaign we

know change is hard it's difficult

people don't like it's the one thing

we're really gonna be keeping an eye on

tonight is those ridings around the ers

that were changed to urgent cares what

have you been hearing from people in

those areas well I live in one of those

areas and I live close to Concordia

Hospital and people are not happy about

the fact that the ER at Concordia has

been closed people are not happy about

the fact that Seven Oaks Hospital closed

their er Wahb canoe has pledged to

reopen those obviously would have to be

in government in order to make that

happen the changes we just heard on C

gob this morning someone who joined us

on one of our open line shows that said

very impressed with the changes versus

some of the experiences in the past so

just like opinions this is ones all over

the map in terms of how people view this

as either a smart move or something that

needs to be reversed 680 C GOP is Greg

Macklin joining me here at PC

headquarters tonight we are gonna be he

and I closely on those ridings

surrounding all of those hospitals back

to you Lisa all right thanks for that

Brittany David akin and CJ Obie's

Richard cliche joining me now let's hit

on these big numbers which you just said

Richard brace yourself because they're

about to go quite quickly they are and

the press if conservatives are elected

and leading in 14 the NDP and six so far

nothing for the Liberals and the Greens

the magic number for majority is 29

alright Brian Pallister currently

leading in his riding a fort white just

one poll reporting there but Brian

Pallister right now with 53% of the vote

over B brusky from the NDP in Brandon

West the PC incumbent with a healthy

lead they're still just one poll

reporting reg shalwar should be able to

take this riding quite easily

moving on now to point Douglas where

Bernadette Smith an NDP riding she's the

incumbent there with 70% of safest NDP

riding in the province pointed and

Portage la Prairie Ian Wishart the PC

incumbent 75% of the vote just one poll

reporting and again the number the

big numbers shaping up as we anticipated

the Conservatives came in with a

majority likely to go out with a

majority maybe reduced their on track

right now they're leading or elected in

15 the New Democrats leading elected in

seven and right now it's a two horse

race there's no liberals or greens on

the board Bob can you the NDP leader

yesterday said that if you want to vote

against Pallister you have to park your

vote with the NDP Mart movie enough

painting on how the splits go will see

whether or not the Liberals get any of

those votes at this point but so far any

anti health care vote is going to the

NDP all right let's check in on what our

panel has to say so far tonight

Julie buckingham from 680 CJ OB let you

take it from here

Hal Anderson joining me as his Shannon

Sanford and also Jenny McCulloch and we

saw earlier that Rick whoa Chuck is

leading in his riding he was the center

of some controversy this week having

breached policy and Bob canoe the leader

of the NDP has had his own criminal

background in history exposed does that

make a difference to voters because we

see I mean it's very early but what will

Chuck was leading and does that make a

difference should people care about the

background and whether it's an HR issue

or a legal issue well I think people

should care whether or not they're

premier has a conviction and criminal

past

I think it's an it's an issue and I

think also people should care whether or

not there's a sort of a sign of misogyny

against women well I don't think there's

any chance of one canoe being the

premier after tonight well can I make a

quick prediction here I want to say this

because at the start of the show David

Aitken talked about missions a couple

that may not be accomplished tonight

WOB canoe and the NDP may not get enough

additional seats for him to keep his job

and I think the Liberals are gonna fall

from four official party status down to

two that will cost Dougal lamont his job

and then who wants four

the Liberal Party so I just wanted to

get that out there because I think

that's what's gonna happen

do you think that Jenny that it was a

mistake for the NDP to select log canoe

as their leader given his background I

was shocked when the members of the the

New Democratic Party elected web can

you've given that all of those

allegations and not even allegations but

criminal convictions were exposed during

the leadership campaign and it's it's

not just about being an NDP for the sake

of being an NDP but every member of

every party is a person and we have to

examine the people and their values and

who they are when we choose to put them

in power but you know what interestingly

enough I did not hear a lot of that when

I opened up the phones on my top who was

the alternative right I mean come on

Steve there was no alternative at the

time thee there were their backs were up

against the walls so frankly they could

they got what they got I'm just

surprised he stuck with him as long as

they did we'll talk more about this and

many other issues as the evening goes

along for now a returning to the desk

all right Julie thanks for that the big

picture right now the PCs leading or

elected in 18 ridings the NDP 10 the

Liberals and Green Party still showing

zero but we do want to say we expect a

lot of ridings to be reporting within

about the next 10 minutes so you're

gonna want to stay tuned in the meantime

let's throw it down to Eric Sorensen

he's gonna tour you around man I told

this rural ridings Eric yep we're gonna

we're gonna get to that we're gonna

start first with a look at Winnipeg just

because we're seeing some ridings fill

in here for example the conservative

riding right here there's Brian

pallister's so I mean let's bring that

board right up if we have it just to see

how he's doing so far in fort white it

is only one poll reporting he has a

healthy lead that would be a surprise if

he did not go on to win that let's come

on back out to the map again and just

see though that there are some things

happening for the NDP that aren't too

bad for the moment that's savvy tell

that's turning orange for the NDP

they're Kildonan River East that's

another that would represent another

takeaway for the NDP let's bring it out

to what we're calling the Red River

Valley sort of the Greater Winnipeg area

and you can see one more that is Selkirk

now that's Allan Lodge emoti a for the

Republic for the Conservatives who holds

that riding they have switched it around

because Selkirk used to be a little bit

further to the east they brought it over

the

community of Selkirk itself came over

with that he would hope to to hold this

but if we have Selkirk as a board to

look at we'll see what's happening in

its Mitch Oh Bach who is a head of

lodging OTA by a more than 200 votes

only with one poll reporting but the

it's not a bad start to get a 280 vote

lead with only one poll reporting we

have other tools that we're looking at

and one of them that's worth looking at

right now would be the popular vote

just because you start to get a sense

then of what how these parties are doing

you've been talking about all of them

you can see that right now the

Conservatives can't be unhappy with 47

percent that would still be almost a

high-water mark for them not quite as

much as 2016 but not much of a comedown

yet the NDP will have gained almost 10

points with what we see so far

the Liberals are off a bit the greens

are not having this kind of breakthrough

that we might have been expecting but

that's just so far we can't be too sure

and of course the other thing is we've

talked about is what we call our a

majority meter this is the race to get

to 29 because the Conservatives are more

than halfway there right now they're

standing at 19 they just want to get to

29 or beyond and at right now they seem

to be on their way the NDP looks like

they're the ones that are picking up the

most seats so far but far short of what

the Conservatives are doing Lisa all

right Eric Sorenson things for that

right now we have the Progressive

Conservatives leading or elected in

nineteen ridings the NDP 13 and the

Liberals showing one do we know what I

was just saying to Richard I was

sneaking in I know if you heard that

whisper River Heights and who's running

in River Heights well it's going to be

the good dr. John Gerard and in the

green one riding it's good that's the

one but so far in st. Boniface that's

the key for the liberal fortunes and

their leader in Saint Boniface but for

Kerry is one of those very interesting

ridings Lisa because they're so far the

NDP are leading Marquess ilio is the NDP

candidate former while he's still a

Winnipeg trustee but he's running there

he's a lawyer he's run in federal

elections before but if the NDP are

going to be a solid opposition party and

that's where it's looking right now but

if they're gonna make a comeback they

have to win those ridings safe to tell

Fort Garry in the in the urban part of

Winnipeg you're absolutely right I just

want to also mention the nd

or picking up seats no other parties

picking up seeds in the NDP are picking

up seats Kildonan River East McPhillips

right now in burrows and at the cost of

the Liberals that liberal vote as Eric

showed us is going right down that's

right so right now the NDP are at 14

seats remember they started the night

with 12 and I heard how a minute ago

thinking maybe the NDP parka to be

mission accomplished we'll see but right

now they're doing better than when they

started

but the PCs are comfortably ahead with

19 still some lots of ridings that

haven't reported a single vote yet all

right the Green Party of Manitoba

looking for just one seat tonight let's

throw it down to Global's amber Magoo

Caen she's in the woolsley riding this

evening and she's standing by with the

greens campaign manager Mel Hebert hey

amber

[Music]

at least say yeah that's right in with

Melanie we're at the Green Party's

campaign organizers O'Malley we've seen

some success for the Green Party across

Canada how do you think that might

influence the results here in Manitoba

yeah we're definitely building on that

momentum I think what people are seeing

is that greens they're a serious party

no they're a serious party ready to make

you know bold changes and yeah we're

seeing that definitely in Manitoba and

what would it mean for you guys you've

not had a seat ever yet before what

would it mean for you guys to secure one

here tonight so what we're finding

across Canada right now is once people

get that first seat in parliament sooner

more to follow so for instance if you

look at P I they got their first seat in

2015 now in 2019 they're the official

opposition in BC they got their first

seat in 2013 and now they have three

seats so so we're one green is sooner

and more to follow so it's just up from

here right thanks so much Mel back to

you in studio East Africa good all right

amber Magoo can thanks for that right

now leading or elected the Progressive

Conservatives 22 ridings the NDP 15 this

means some NDP gains so with more

insight there we're gonna give it back

to Eric Sorensen hey Eric

hey Lisa so I mean this map doesn't look

unlike a lot of maps in Manitoba

elections where the conservers are

winning a lot or ridings in southern

Manitoba NDP maybe coming back in in

Kuwait and look hard to know for sure

because you know early night not that

many votes counted do we have the board

for Kuwait look just to give you a sense

of how close it might be because in some

of these instances I looked at it a few

moments ago and in Kuwait they had about

a three vote lead and in another writing

Interlake I think if we have that one it

was also a very narrow lead that uh

here's key wait look right there and

what is the lead well it's only one poll

the lead is three so there you go Ian

bushi trying to take that away actually

from the Liberals Jason Harper because

the that was there writing last time Ron

so there's Keewatin up but if we come

back we can have a look at the map again

and you can see that there are some

other writings that are kind of

interesting Interlake just down here

it's it has moved south because the Paul

Kami Shack has also kind of brought the

paw

riding further south before in between

the two lakes and now the inter Lake

area is a little

further south than it was before there

you can see it this is a case again

where the where the lead is very narrow

at this point let's take another look

just at Winnipeg because every so often

it's changing over we just want to get a

sense of what the map is looking like in

Winnipeg for the moment you can see the

Liberals are actually leading in to

righties right now and I can tell you

that's River Heights that would be no

surprise the one just on top of it just

over the Assiniboine that would be

woolsley now everybody's been talking

about the Green Party winning there and

the NDP saying no we're going to take

that back hey that would be something if

the Liberals ended up winning in

woolsley back to you Lisa all right Eric

thanks so much for that this is a great

time to take it down to NDP headquarters

let's go to Kevin Hirschfeld he's

standing by with our friend from CJ Obi

Loretta McNabb hey Kevin yeah down here

at the met and we talked to folks

earlier who said there's optimism

they're encouraged they hope all the

hard work before the campaign pays off

and they've gained in a couple of spots

so far 15 seats at last check which is

more from the 12 that they came in with

and we're joined now by six ADC Joey

wheeler n McNab from the start and the

Wren you've covered plenty of elections

you've seen the NDP at their high points

and you've seen them at their low points

2016 one for example do you think

they've done enough this campaign to

maybe get moving in that right direction

again I think so the question is how

much you can call this take back night

payback night call it whatever you want

they're looking to get that swagger back

in their step I can tell you back in

2016 there are still people today who

are still feeling battled and bruised

from what happened to them back then

they they lost in season they should

never have lost up so this is about

power

whether it's return to power or just

gained a bit of that power back they

might have made an inch forward they

might have missed out on some few key

issues though for voters and for our

listeners yeah hoping to do that with

their leader Wahb can do we've seen some

I'm with lob signs here but you

mentioned use your the listeners every

day

the NDP has said it from the start

health care is the number one issue but

from what you hear of listeners were

they focusing on the right spot do the

listeners think that health care was the

main issue here in this election the

question is is healthcare the issue

because you had a bad experience like

the mom who came to see Joe beam said

she had a 16-hour wait with her daughter

in the ER or did you also have that wait

five years ago and you're saying to

yourself yeah I don't

go back to the way things were

Healthcare may be a big thing I think

they missed out on crime and I'll tell

you where it might hurt them Brandon

East it was a writing that in its

creation and its lifetime had never gone

Tory

it went Tory the last time the NDP are

hoping to win that back but here's where

crime could play an issue their Liberal

candidate their Kim Longstreet is a mom

of a recovering meth addict

she's with the Brandon bear clan she's

pounded the pavement she's been yelling

about crime for years she put she put

her name on the ballot and she might

take some votes from the NDP and

writings like that and there might be

other places like that tonight all right

we'll be paying attention to the results

all night lemak now from six CDC Jo B's

at the start we'll send it back to you

here from the met Lisa in studio all

right thanks team we want to mention it

is 8:40 as we wait for these numbers to

come in Brian Pallister has won his

riding of fort white no surprise here

that Pallister would win there but what

is absolutely fascinating David right

now is that this really is a horse race

we're still four seats away from that

magic number the majority meter of 29

seems when the PCs are winning or

elected in 25 seats the NDP 17 the

Liberals in three a whopping majority in

Manitoba is about 30 to 33 seats but the

NDP so far the story early is that

they're making it come they're showing

some strength and we haven't seen a lot

of traditional NDP ridings count yet so

here's where we're at just to give you a

sense of what's going on this is our

leading or elected board remember that's

that's the combined total in what we

call the chiclet at the bottom but

here's the chart that says PCs are

leading in 20 elected in five and we

just told you for example Brian

Pallister elected and for white the NDP

will only have them leading right now

they're not elected anywhere our

decision desk saying still leading in 17

and that's still very good very early in

the evening that liberals leading in

three not elected anywhere one of those

as River Heights they're leading in the

other one that they're leading in by the

way is Wolseley is where they're leading

of course we thought that would be a

green NDP fight it may yet be but right

now liberals are leading in woolsley all

right well as the numbers begin to come

in quicker we're gonna take some time to

talk with our panel with host from 680 C

gob Julie Buckingham hey Julie

I'm Lisa and let's I want to pick up on

something that Jenny maciolek just said

I can't always you could only be here

when the cameras are off I'm still here

I cannot believe the voters of Manitoba

want to go back to the dark days of 17

years explain Jenny look for a long time

we had the NDP and government is you

know Gary dewer was a very popular

premier there's no doubt but the fact of

the matter is is that Manitoba has the

highest taxes we have that among the

greatest amount of public service we

have among the least amount of

private-sector activity were worst in

education our health care is terrible

and so Brian Pallister was real was

elected three years ago to transform

this and he has taken a goes approach

and incremental changes on the right

path yeah but it's but these it's early

and this is leading in I think basically

Wahb canoe played a fear campaign you're

going to lose your classrooms you're

going to lose your health care you're

going to lose it's all typical NDP

tactics and you know even things like

they're closing the ers they are not

actually closing the hospitals they are

transforming them from an ER to an

urgent care and let's face it 99% of the

time when any of us go to emergency it

is an urgent care issue it's not but do

you want for emergencies not also think

that pallister's campaign and just the

way he is is a turn-off to some people

in me in my career City working to my

job I agree but I had lawyers saying to

me I don't like how he says I don't mind

being the tough love premier I think

this province needs oh but you know he

played great offense I have to tell you

and when he didn't want to talk he sent

in his really strong front bench tell me

do we have a strong front bench from the

NDP listen I don't think so flora

marceline oh my gosh and you know what

that's an important thing to note as it

is about bench strength because one

person doesn't govern this

right and the fact that Brian Pallister

has attracted and recruited such strong

candidates such experienced people that

we can have confidence in our cabinet

going forward - so he said on CJ Opie if

he wins tonight he's in it for the next

four years

oh we're talking about a strong bench so

who is waiting to fill those very large

well after he says first of all do you

believe he's gonna say yes or no he says

he's gonna stay we'll find out yeah I'm

five foot ten and blonde no think about

it and tell us who you think could be

the next leader of the pan by the way by

the way Shandy strong is the liberal

leading in woolsley the trans advocate

congratulate put a pause on this for now

return you to the desk

[Laughter]

all right thanks Julie Buckingham we're

gonna take a look at some progressive

conservative takeaways tonight the PCs

sitting leading or elected in 30 ridings

the NDP 16 the Liberals three in

borderland we're 12 out of 46 polls are

reporting right now the PC candidate has

been elected that's Josh Gunther was 61%

of them once again the PCs have crossed

the magic number of 29 they're leading

or elected in 31 now so 29 is a majority

PCs are at the promised land right now

all right and in Fort Garry PC candidate

Nancy cook just slightly ahead of the

NDP candidate there I expect this riding

to go a while here Dan C cook 37% mark

was silly 35% for the NDP Craig Larkins

at 21% for the Liberals that's one of

those key ridings if the NDP are going

to make inroads they need to win this

one back but redistribution favors it

towards the progressive and the fourth

gary was on one of those lists i saw

from NDP inside as i said you know if

we're having a really good night ridings

like for Gary are coming their way and

it yet could it looks like a tight race

at Fort Garry but the story so far

tonight is that majority were at that

that 31 elected or leading for the

Progressive Conservatives and again like

I say in Manitoba 33 34 is a healthy

majority government yes the NDP are

making a comeback but not enough to

make a real dent in the progressive

concern let's remember Pallister won an

all-time high of 40 in 2016 at

dissolution he had 38 so you know that

was crazy good they could give up some

seats night and still have a happy

majority all right with that let's take

it down to PC Party headquarters where

Brittney Greenslade is standing by with

our 680 CJ ob partner tonight Gregg

Macklin hey Brittany hi Lisa

it is getting busy down here people

starting to make their way in and we

have Conservative MP James bazaine in

here with us right now and James you

have your own campaign to start thinking

about but you've been doing a lot of

door knocking as well tell us why it's

important to help out the provincial

campaign - well you know I'm still a

Manitoban first and foremost and so

being part of our PC team and helping

our provincial cousins win this majority

PC government with Brian Pallister

returning as our premier was so very

important I think that this is a great

day for Manitoba and of course we got

our big kick-off tomorrow and it's going

to be a lot of hard work out there but

you know the issues that I heard on the

doorsteps with our provincial cousins

there are the same ones that we're

hearing about people are concerned about

affordability but leave more money in

their pockets and I want to make sure

that they are seeing those tax cuts and

the proper investments in our health

care system in our education and we're

seeing that with Brian else for the PCT

a lot of working together here what were

you hearing out when you were

door-knocking about getting people and

convincing them to revote for the

Conservatives here locally well you know

I think that none of them saw any future

with Bob kanoon andp or with the

Liberals or the Greens for that matter

so that their choice was Brian call from

the PC team and they're coming out in

droves tonight and giving us out

majority government I can also say it's

because of the hard work of our

candidates and our incumbent Emily's

along with the amazing volunteer system

it was a ground game and that is where

the fight was won

because we had such an incredible team

out there working everyday finding those

votes and making sure they showed up and

put it there they're cast our ballots in

the ballot box James thanks servant of

MP thank you so much for joining us

you're hearing lots of cheers here's all

of those votes and polls are coming in

Lisa will throw it back to you

very good thanks for that Brittany right

now the PCs leading or elected in 30

ridings the NDP 17 let's take a closer

look at those leading and elected

numbers tonight and again once we get

more elected in the cattigan the the

column for the PCs they're elected in 10

leading in 20 for a total of 30 as we

get more and more elected we'll be

closer and closer to saying it looks

like a PC government and it does in fact

they're over that majority meter NDP

you're leading only in story leading in

14 elected in two liberals are leading

in four not elected in any ridings at

this point but this is the areas where

Cindy Lamoreaux

in Tindall Park is leading for the

Liberals and their leader Dugald LeMond

and Saint Boniface is also leading but

still early I'm gonna go back to mission

accomplished that's for for the Liberals

mission accomplished NDP and the mission

accomplished territory pcs in the

mission accomplished territory just got

to get the Greens in there though but I

would be shocked because sandy strong is

leaning in woolsley that's a battle

between the greens and the NDP yeah no I

agree with you all right in the 2016

election

the NDP saw a humiliating defeat they're

really looking to make a comeback

tonight with more on that here's Eric

Sorensen Eric yeah at least I mean you

can see it on the big map first of all I

mean the POC hami sack down in Dauphin I

mean this was historically an NDP riding

it looked like it might be beginning to

turn blueish but for the moment this

could be one of the stages of their

comeback same thing for Thompson which

now goes all the way up to Hudson Bay

and and in Keewatin which now only goes

as far north as the Nelson River but

this was liberal last time around this

up here was conservative that would be

to take back for the NDP doing very well

kind of retaking northern Manitoba which

is the way the maps looked for most of

the last 50 years now looking at

southern Manitoba this begins to show

you where in fact the Conservatives are

winning once again if they're going to

win government let's look at that one

right down

that is Morten Winkler they you know

they they fight with each other in

sports in Morton and Winkler but when it

comes to politics they're pretty much of

one mind let's look at what the how that

race is going tonight

and there's cam freezin cabinet minister

seventy-eight percent it's pretty

uniform that Morden and Winkler's appear

to get along when it comes to politics

and then let's now have a look at

Winnipeg itself now we're seeing some

things that are interesting for example

in Oh oh there that's changing though

because that's a that's the boroughs do

we have that board for us just to see

how that one's going this is interesting

the NDP taking boroughs right now they

would that would be a take away from the

from the Liberals because Cindy

Lamoreaux gave up on the borough's and

then moved over across to fight in a

writing next door so I mean we'll just

get a closer look at that in a moment

folks but first of all let's just look

again at the popular vote because if

that 33 to 16 is to hold up we should

see a clear lead for the Conservatives

in the popular vote and what are we

seeing exactly that in fact it's still

almost a two-to-one in the popular vote

and that's a very big spread in Manitoba

politics

it happened in 2016 but this should be a

bounce-back year for the NDP they may be

getting it in seats but I'm not so sure

they're getting as much as they would

have liked in the popular vote but the

majority meter the thing that gets us to

the finish line

the Conservatives right now they're not

there I mean in a funny sort of way

they're across the finish line but some

of those writings we haven't called yet

so they have to pull it back a little

bit because we're not the twenty nine

yet because it can't be called yet back

to you Lisa we are getting awfully close

thanks for that Eric Sorenson stay with

us this is decision Manitoba 2019

growing we are not losing another

container to that landfill his brother

never made it everything we're gonna the

landfill

their fate depends on you recycle the

right stuff recycle everywhere

welcome back we have breaking news

Global News is projecting a Progressive

Conservative government Brian Pallister

a second term as your premier Manitoba

all six foot eight inches of Brian

Pallister the key question here though

is it will it be a majority government

we're not quite there yet David

absolutely we're very confident and the

decision desk has said it's going to be

a PC government for sure

majority-minority still TBD because the

PCs are leading or elected in 34 seats

NDP leading or elected in 18 seats and

so in the view of our decision desk

there's still enough close races out

there involving Progressive

Conservatives they might fall back from

first to second and so we're gonna wait

a little bit to see if it's a majority

minority but definitely it's gonna be

premier Pallister tomorrow morning all

right sure to be a celebratory tone down

at PC headquarters right now let's go to

Brittney Greenslade Brittany yeah Lisa

there's been a lot of excitement here

tonight a lot of people starting to make

their way down here and after we call

Brian Pallister getting that seat and

now making government a lot of people

very elated we know that premier Brian

Pallister is watching from a back room

here at canons pull dough park he is

with his campaign manager we are

expecting him to come out here a little

bit later but for now he is holed up

watching these election results with his

family and hopefully we'll be hearing

from him very soon Lisa back to you all

right Brittany thank you with that we're

gonna send it down to NDP party

headquarters and Kevin Hirschfeld Kevin

yeah you wouldn't you know what you

wouldn't know it by being here that the

NDP has just lost the election that the

music is playing people seem pretty

ecstatic still but again the news the

NDP not hoping for but they're gonna be

watching for those number of seats now

they come in right now with 12 coming

into this election now they have 18 so

how many more of those seats can they

gain in the legislature of course many

of those ridings they lost in that 2016

Tory election they're hoping to get

those back tonight so again not the main

result the NDP wanted here tonight but

folks still encouraged we're hearing

loud cheers every time an NDP candidate

comes up on the screen so they're hoping

to get as many seats as they can tonight

blob canoe is watching with his family

at the Radisson they're watching the

results together and we're expecting to

hear from him in a little while to see

what he has to say we'll send it back to

you Lisa all right just a recap we have

declared a Progressive Conservative

government right now the PCs are leading

or elected in 33 ridings to delve into

these numbers a little closer for you

Eric Sorenson Heric hey Lisa we're just

looking that map of Winnipeg and we're

still trying to sort of say so where is

it how is it that the Conservatives are

winning another election here and where

do you really see it in the northeast

part of Winnipeg where you have say Ross

smear you know these are areas that at

one time I'm not talking about the you

know River East but in Ross Mir for

example when that turns conservative you

wonder can the NDP come back there or

the demographics changed but in Radisson

in Radisson this would be an area again

where the NDP would hope to come back

the way they are in trans kkona which is

going Orange

but if we have the board for Radisson we

can take a look at that and just see how

they're doing there this is where the

power of incumbency can help because

James Tito is is your MLA from there and

he has a reasonable lead at the moment a

hundred and two vote lead over ROG

Sandhu but these are some of the

writings where the demographics are

changing a bit and maybe a way in which

the Conservatives can kind of shore up

inside the city of Winnipeg when you

look outside the city of Winnipeg well

this is a very common familiar look to

the map of Manitoba by the way we should

mention only a couple of ridings not

reporting yet one of them is Flin Flon

up here but

we go down and look at southern Manitoba

I think we can look for example it just

the types of writings they win and they

win them over and over again right here

you have well this is spruce woods for

sure right up here that's Agassiz we

have the board for Agassiz I think we'll

see Elaine Clark is winning their

cabinet minister for mister Pallister if

we have Agassiz and we do so Eileen

Clark there with a 1200 vote lead she

has been I think declared yes she has

declared elected no surprise there these

are the writings where that when the

Conservatives build that majority if

they're going to get to a majority it is

built on the foundation of varieties

across the sort of southern and central

in the Parkland in in southern and

central Manitoba back to you Lisa

Erickson said thanks so much well no

doubt our panel of political insiders is

abuzz with more on that here's 680 SC Jo

B's Julie Buckingham we're absolutely

abuzz and I don't think any big shock

amongst the panelists but Hal Anderson

looks like you and I and our CJ ob

listeners will be talking about premier

Pallister and his government for the

next four years yes congratulations mr.

premier the tough-love premier I think

it's um I think it's safe to say that

for the most part premier Pallister said

here's what I'm gonna do

he did it and yes getting another chance

to do another four years we played the

tape where he says he will remain

premier for the entire tour he told our

Richard cliche in fact that he's going

to stick around for the full term can I

just quickly say about health care we've

had a couple people Greg McClain was one

Laura McNabb said this I think that the

people that were upset about health care

the changes that were being made were

very vocal the opponents were vocal but

anecdotally I've been hearing lately

from people that have actually been

using the urgent care and using the ers

and and almost all of them have said

it's been a better experience the WRA JS

came in and said that the actual wait

times are coming down now whether or not

that's political or not yeah they're

they have said the three times are

coming down the truth is is that you

know all depends you have to watch the

source right when people that health

care is being cut we've never spent more

money on health care the wait

times are up the wait times are down the

truth of the matter is it was it was an

ugly quagmire and Brian Pallister and

his Health Minister are making efforts

to make it better couldn't get worse

could it can't get worse I lived in

Alberta in 1993 when there was a problem

with health care and Klein came in and

decimated in health care yep this was

nothing like 1993 and health care you

know why would characterize you know

premier pallister's last term as

incremental steady as she goes don't tip

the canoe but you know and now I

wondered that if you know depending on

the strength of this man of this mandate

I wonder if he's going to be emboldened

to maybe move a little faster a little

bolder in the night and over again is

why aren't we getting what we're getting

is Ford and why aren't we getting what

we're getting with Kenny when we get

Pallister and maybe we should be

thinking the lucky stars we haven't so

far and is that coming well I guess that

you know I guess it all depends on your

perspective Jason Kenny let's keep the

the boat in the canoe next time around

and we'll return it to the desk all

right thanks for that Julie why didn't

we think of our that's a good one all

righty the Liberals the leading or

elected in three ridings right now the

PCs 33 the NDP leading were elected in

nineteen so let's take a look at those

ridings that the Liberals are leading

and beginning with River Heights

Jean Girard has a healthy lead with 48

percent of the votes a 192 vote lead

over his conservative challenger 7 out

of 46 polls reporting in Saint Boniface

this is Dugald Lamont's riding he is of

course the incumbent there right now

leading with 50% of the vote and he of

course he's the leader of the party and

he just won that from where Greg

Selinger used to be and it looks like

voters in st. Boniface are saying I like

that Lamacq I'm sticking with him and

you're into this one Richard cliche

Tindall Park this really talks about the

power of Cindy lamoureux and the

Lamoreaux name in that area so far it's

a tight lead

68 vote lead 46% over Ted Marcelino of

the NDP

but it's one of those writings to watch

especially if the liberals want to get

that party status all right and we want

to touch on this the Riding of Fort

Rouge we're NDP leader Wahb canoe has

been elected now this riding was

interesting because he was up against

the Green Party leader James Betim who

came in third right and the Green Party

may decide it's time for a new leader I

mean a third-place finish not a

second-place finish a third well we'll

see how this could be adjusted worse

only ten out of fifty one pulls in but

betim was a bit of a reluctant leader

and he may go maybe soon yeah and he has

and I think he's got more ambitions

towards federal politics well guess what

we've got a federal election you might

even a Richard coming up tomorrow we do

but Wahb canoe the leader winning big

time in his own writing yeah and listen

Gary dewer I want to take a little

history I know I'm not from the promise

but I've read up in my history Gary Doer

in 1990 took over the NDP with 12 seats

and in that election his first he won

twenty now Wahb canoe was no Gary dewer

but look at the bottom they started the

night with 12 seats canoes got him up to

20 seats and that would be there doing

cartwheels if they finished the night at

20,000 and they're not electing one

either literally elected I'm just saying

that this is going this is going

according I think to the NDP master plan

here alright the Liberals looking for

four seats tonight let's check in with

our reporter Joe Scarpelli he's live

down at liberal headquarters tonight hey

Joe

hey Lisa I have 680 CJ ob host Jeff

courier standing beside me and Jeff the

Liberals are flirting with official

party status territory do you think they

can hang on well it looks like a tough

fight right now Jo and they're going to

lose key wait nook which is a seat they

will now lose to the NDP that's going to

go back to the NDP River Heights here in

Saint Boniface it looks like the leader

Dugald Lamont is going to retain his

seat Tyndale Park right now they're in

the lead and that looks as though that

there's Richard couch a spoke about

Cindy lamb who's got a strong ground

game there she's got brand recognition a

big liberal machine behind her but

they're gonna have to pick up a seat

somewhere else in order just to retain

that official party status okay and for

anybody at home who doesn't know what

official party status means can you

explain why that's so significant well

in a fifty seven seat legislature you

need a minimum of four seats to be

official party and what that means

there's a whole lot of additional

funding office space it gives you a lot

more leeway it gives you more time in

the legislature to press the government

okay you can forward your agenda a lot

more and outside of that the unofficial

part of that is it it makes it a lot

more challenging to do a private

fundraising to get people behind you if

you're still not an official party and

they became an official party a year ago

when Lamont won this seat in a

by-election a traditional NDP riding and

it looks like he's gonna hang on to that

but they've got to find some way to pick

up a seat somewhere else in order to

retain those four alright well should be

an interesting rest of the night that

680 C gob host Jeff Courier and we saw

all send things back to you all right

Joe Scarpelli and Jeff thanks so much

for that

Eric Sorensen is gonna take a closer

look at some of the close races

happening in our province tonight Eric

yeah Lisa there are some close ones and

that's why those numbers at the bottom

of the screen are not final numbers at

33 for the PCs NDP 20 liberals three not

final that does add up to 56 which means

we are still waiting for one to come in

and guess which one it is Flin Flon it

is not unusual for them to be slow to

report they also have a low turnout

generally speaking but that could put

potentially be another number in the

column for the NDP let's go down into

Winnipeg now and look and see some of

these other very close races that are

happening right down here at Fort Garry

we can bring that up for a second in

Fort Garry this is one of those writings

that is generally becoming a kind of

swing riding so both the NDP and the

Conservatives would like to take this

riding if we have the board for it

you'll see that it's a tough fight right

now mark whassa lou has a narrow lead

105 votes over Nancy cooked both mark

and Nancy are well known in the

community so this is a real struggle

between the two - to win that riding for

their parties and the Liberals we were

talking about the Liberals before

Tyndale Park for the moment that would

be Cindy glamour who moved over from

burrows possibly winning their River

Heights no surprise for the Liberals st.

Boniface that would be three for the

Liberals they want to get to four is

there anywhere they can get there nobody

would expect it but this riding now on

the outskirts which it goes up to

Headingley now this is a not Macomb this

is Roblin let's have a look at Roblin if

we have it or is it is it Roblin is the

one we want to look at I think so if we

have it court might be McPhillips there

it comes

it is Roblin myrna dredger she's been

around a very long time I think she's

seeking about her sixth term right now

and there was a point there where she

had a very narrow lead

it is not so close at this point all

right 33 222 three for the Liberals the

the thing that is interesting about as

we say we're looking for ridings where

are the Liberals in a position to get

that fourth one will we be back with

that with that idea in a few moments

back to you Lisa

Eric thanks for that we want to make a

mention the only riding not reporting

right now is Flin Flon they have just

started counting there so we're gonna be

waiting on that for a little bit well

right now if anyone has a reason to

smile tinnitus the NDP they're leading

and elected in 19 or elected rather in

19 ridings that means some gains for

them

Kevin Hirschfeld is down at NDP

headquarters tonight hey Kevin

yeah of course we're calling a PC

governments but some happy faces around

here at the NDP they're not only

regaining those seats that they've held

for a long time but they're picking up

some of those seats that they lost in

the last election joined now by be

brusque who's the campaign co-chair also

an MLA in the Fort Whyte region you lost

your leader Brian Pallister but as you

see these results come in what are the

thoughts you're currently eight seats

higher than you were coming into the

night up to 20 now what are the thoughts

when you see those results come in we're

very happy and enthusiastic about the

results coming in we see that the trend

is additional support for the NDP which

is great which is what we've been

hearing on the doorstep where we've been

working very hard to rebuild over the

last number of years and certainly the

selection is a full year before we

thought it would take place so we're

very enthusiastic and just looking back

at how you ran the campaign are there

any regrets or things that you wished

you would have done heading into this

campaign I wish we would have had more

time outside of that I'm really

impressed by how the candidates got

their act together very quickly got

their volunteer-based together very

quickly platform was developed very

quickly and how everybody came together

with very few resources as compared to

our competitor of course and so I'm

actually very very positive about how

this campaign has run and I feel that

we're in a really good place to maintain

and to maintain the accountability and

the you know certainly the counterpoint

to what government has been wanting to

do over the last number of years yes

certainly we hear the positive chatter

going on behind just just one one last

one for you be you kind of touched on it

there what's the future hold for the NDP

party what do you see the future like

the legislature representing us they are

bringing a dynamic new voice and that's

going to be an addition to the existing

MLAs that have been working really

really hard in the last three years I

think we have a great future all right

be brusque campaign co-chair of the NDP

who's making some gains tonight here in

Manitoba back to you Lisa all right they

seem happy with both that you have some

insight info from our pollster friend

yes we're a friend Curtis Brown of probe

research he's deep in the decision desk

in the back rooms here crunching numbers

and he just tweeted out if you want to

fall along that he is noticing that

liberal support is pretty strong in the

southeast and southwest of the city of

Winnipeg and that is making things a

little tricky for some PC

and for some Democrats and we've talked

about how Democrats have to push down in

the south that's where they have to go

when they want to win government so

innocent here liberal support is higher

than we might have expected together and

I have to say one of the last articles I

read yesterday was about that area and

the power of the suburban mom type

that's where they are well that's part

of it and I think also the power of

Justin Trudeau and the the federal

Liberals as well and in one of those

writings in the south and the power of

the local candidates as well that is

huge for the Liberals they've got some

quality candidates and of course

federally those are liberal ridings

federally in that part of the city as

well all right thanks for that guys

let's take a look at some of the close

races right now actually so the big

picture leading an elected board first

right now the Progressive Conservatives

are leading or elected in 35 ridings the

NDP 18 the Liberals eight let's break

down these numbers

all right in Riau your pc incumbent

Rochelle Squires leading with 40% of the

vote no she is tied right now this is

tight it's a to vote LeAnn Michelle

squash and for Rochelle Squires who has

aspirations for leadership of this party

this is one of those close ridings it's

historically always close and Squires

who's a cabinet minister in for a very

tight race all right now the writing of

a Cinna boya

Scott Johnson the PC income it with 44%

of the vote joel mchale up from the NDP

35% one of those swing ridings again

that's gone between the NDP and the PCs

historically in Port Richmond the PC

incumbent Sarah gue marred with 36% of

the vote over the Liberals tangi negra a

Liberal candidate in second place there

former president of the University of

Manitoba student unions she's been

working this riding hard

all right and let's take a look at the

writing of Roblin no surprise here

murdered Rieger re-elected with 51% of

the vote

huge lead there with 20 of 46 polls

reporting in the Roblin constituency and

we're at the point now Roblin a lot of

polls we're seeing where half of the

polls were in so we argue to the point

where a lot more elected in our leading

and elected count once again let look at

the bottom of your screen if you're

watching on to eat for those that

listening on see gob pcs leading or

elected in 35 seats NDP leading or

elected in nineteen seats liberals

leading or elected in three greens have

yet to lead or very early I think was

there leading in any event there 0 now

it have been for at least an hour all

right there really and it's going to be

tight right down to the road all right

we have some breaking news

here it is Global News is projecting a

progressive conservative majority

government we did project that

Progressive Conservative government

earlier this evening but we are

confirming now it is another solid

majority for the Progressive

Conservative it's not historic territory

reduced from last time around of 40

seats but 35 David for a majority

government in Manitoba that's a big

majority government it could still be 33

it could still be 34 we've declared it's

going to be a majority more than 29 so

congratulations bring your palace from

the PCs mission accomplished I'm going

to keep coming back to that check mark

for the PCs it wasn't the big win of

2016 but it's a big win nonetheless and

Brian Patterson sees can take that as an

endorsement of their program

particularly on health care reform and

so far the NDP are doing well enough

that Wahb canoe can keep his job

the key question tonight the Liberals

will they get that party status they

need those four seats and so far the

greens aren't there yet but I expect

woolsley to go a little ways alright you

did say that mission has been

accomplished for the Progressive

Conservatives let's go to Britney

Greenslade live down at their

headquarters right now hey Britney hi

Lisa we heard big cheers as you guys

called that PC majority government now

the biggest question that we're gonna

have right now is what happens next we

know premier Brian Pallister is watching

from Canada Anne's Polo Park here with

his campaign manager we saw some big

names re-elected you can see there's

lots people here behind us as people are

starting to stream in here we've also

seen a number of MLAs making their way

in here tonight

what is clear right now is that people

agreed with the decisions Pallister was

making and we're gonna be talking with

six ADC Joby's Greg Macklin in just a

little bit we'll throw it back to you

Lisa all right Brittany Greenslade

thanks for that let's go to Kevin

Hirschfeld he's at NDP headquarters this

hour hey Kevin

hey Lisa big cheers behind us right now

they just announced walkin new house

been reelected in Fort Rouge but another

PC majority government yet I think the

vibe here is a little bit different than

it was in 2016 we talked to be for us

the campaign co-chair earlier she's

encouraged she's happy with all the hard

work they've done and they've made some

gains here especially considering the

time they had of course this election is

a called a little bit earlier than they

thought so there's a lot of

encouragement tonight they're not only

retaining those seats that they've held

for many years now but they're getting

some of those seats back that they lost

in 2016 so again there's a majority who

again will go down in another election

and again Wahb canoe is at the Radisson

Hotel watching with his family were

expected to hear from him shortly wasn't

it back to you Allison all right Kevin

thanks for that and while Global News

has projected that Progressive

Conservative majority government there

are still a lot of numbers still left to

watch tonight with more we're gonna send

it down to Eric Sorenson hey Eric hey

Lisa so we now have 57 ridings reporting

as well the last one Flin Flon and there

it is up in the northwest and it is

turning NDP and there is no surprise

there

now let's go down into southern Manitoba

and give you a sense then of what has

brought this government about for the

Conservatives once more this is a this

is more than we clear we talked about

them this is a borderland is right on

the US border and then that one up there

they'll recognize it if they're watching

this Steinbach let's have a look at that

because since Steinbach if you think

Morten Winkler tends to go conservative

well Steinbach does too Kevin kurtsyn is

the Education Minister getting 81

percent of the vote Robert Jessup for

the NDP only 8 percent I mean nobody's

even up to 10 percent from the other

parties it gives you a sense of how

strong the conservative the conservators

showing is in rural southern Manitoba

now the gains and losses we want to look

at that because when you look at that 36

to 18 there's borderland we want to talk

about that as well for a second Josh

Gunter is leading big time down there as

you might expect by 2300 votes with most

of the polls now showing now with the

gains and loss

this is an interesting statistic because

if you just looked at this you would say

Wow

good night for the NDP and it probably

it really is because they have picked up

six seats as David's been talking about

all night if they could pick up and get

back to where you might expect them to

be after a downturn election to pick up

a few seats and show they're coming back

holding off the greens holding off the

Liberals they seem to be doing that the

PCs are for the moment they're only down

two seats that's actually a good night

for the for the Progressive

Conservatives given that they started

with 38 and an almost historic showing

in 2016 so losing only two seats and

they're not minding that's who too badly

back to you Lisa thanks Eric Sorensen

now we're gonna take it down to 680 CJ

Obi's Julie Buckingham to see what our

panel has to say about the projected PC

majority hey Julie thanks Lisa

returning to our panel Hal Anderson of

CJ Obi Shannon Sanford political

scientist and also Jenny McCulloch who

ran as a municipal election and we're

looking at some of those numbers now and

Jenny do you think that the the numbers

that we're seeing for the NDP is really

an endorsement of Wahb canoe or the NDP

brand I have a very hard time believing

that there's any endorsement of Wahb

canoe but that's my personal feeling you

know I honestly believe that Brian

Pallister has done a good job of moving

the province in the right direction

anything that the voters of Manitoba

want to keep going in that direction and

they are looking for people to actually

bring a little transformation to the way

that we govern and the way that we

manage our province and the NDP's entire

campaign theme seem to be we want to go

back to the way it was and yet Shannon

it resonated with people clearly as well

as they're picking up I think Jenny's

being a little too hard on Rob canoe you

know when it comes down to it I know I

know but when it comes down to it he was

pretty charismatic he did tell the

stories that he needed to tell he won

the leaders debate on television hands

down he did he did do what he needed to

do for the young voters and he did do

what he needed to do for the Winnipeg

voters any resident

young voters like him they'd like him

they just find him very charismatic and

for some reason they'd like him what

canoe is very curious if compared to our

six foot eight premier that people find

scary you know I can see why people

would choose him he does come on yet

interesting that people didn't choose

him right the people chose Brian

Pallister some people did but there was

no change in the air this time around

right last time it was like we're gonna

run these buns on it you know I am this

time it was time you have to understand

I don't think anybody showed up to vote

this time it'll be interesting to talk

about the voter turnout and your

predictions Hal Anderson we wrote them

up on the board at CJ Obie yeah I wrote

down a very sad number in my estimation

which is 48 percent so we'll see we'll

see where it it we will see where it

ends up but let's face it I mean yes the

NDP number is is getting bigger but why

is it getting bigger

the Tories tonight have still won a real

nice majority it was you know record

numbers last time it's not surprising

that that number would come down a

little bit it's it will talk about the

tournament next time around are as they

say in the sports world a w as a W is a

W it's not a squeaker no no we're

talking about it as if as if the PC

party Manitoba lost tonight well they

were re-elected with it with a strong

majority and a strong mandate to move

Manitoba forward as air signs say and

we'll move forward back to the deck

thanks for that Julie there are still

some very interesting races in play

tonight so we want to keep you with us

we eagerly await the leaders speeches

when we return stay with us this is

welcome back I'm Lisa Dutton joined by

six atcg Obie's richard clukey and chief

political correspondent David akin for

global news and David you wanted to

touch on voter turnout well yes just cuz

the panel was talking about their

guesses on voter turnout well we do have

some numbers we get the statisticians

crunching numbers and right now it looks

low the projected turnout at this point

in the evening around 46% and again in

the 2016 election was 154 56 56 % so

there's quite a bit off 2016 which was

as Hal just said a throw the bums out

kind of election this one's sort of a

state of course election 45% that

turnouts not good Manitoba and what

still got you hooked tonight Richard

well there are a few very interesting

races and as you look at Eric's big map

you see the NDP retaining and getting

back some of those seats that they had

lost in 2016 so this is more of a

typical type of Manitoba result yet

still the PC with a whopping majority

only down two seats but there are a

couple of really tight races in the

southeastern part of Winnipeg Rochelle

Squires

in a real tight race in her seat this is

the future of the Progressive

Conservative Party Squires is has

leadership aspirations now Brian

Pallister were jumping ahead but this

pallister's stick around for his entire

four years he said he would to me nobody

believes that well you just mentioned

we're going to hear

the leaders speeches are gonna be coming

up soon we'll probably hear from I would

expect Dougal Ahmad first maybe James

Bentham I'm not sure but Lamont first

then canoe then Pallister at the end and

I think a lot of people will be looking

at that speech from Pallister trying to

read between the lines is he staying is

he going and and who might who's

positioned close to the leader trying to

get into that shot in case there's a

future leadership campaign all right

we're gonna take it down to Eric

Sorenson now he's focusing in on the

Liberal Party and and their focus Eric

well that's right I mean first let's

look at the big map here because you

know the Liberals are sitting with only

three they'd like to be at four if not

more than that double riding day one

last time was key wait nook with Cindy

clasp and though the liberal that was

that wanted in 2016 she's running

federally this time next octo and now

the liberal of the NDP is taking it back

and they're taking it back quite quite

handily now I just want to pick up on

what the mister Cloutier was talking

about which is how this map looks not

untypical so I've gone low-tech here

just to show you a little bit of what

the maps look like so this is 1990 map

and this is 1995 and 1999 see how those

look see how they look that looks pretty

similar to what we're seeing right here

which is northern Manitoba turning New

Democrat southern Manitoba mostly

conservative now to give you a better

sense of the faint hope that we are

being that the Liberals and the Greens

are facing right now we'll go into

Winnipeg and you can see liberals with

the three seats that they have that's

Tindall Park River Heights and then over

in st. Boniface where are they going to

get a fourth interestingly now if you

come down here there's Waverly and then

right next to it is Fort Richmond let's

look at the board for Fort Richmond and

see if there is some hope here for the

Liberals Sarah will McGill Mart has 38

percent but tangi tonigh drah for the

Liberals is only a hundred and

twenty-eight votes of votes behind for

the Liberals this would be perhaps their

best shot at getting to four but they've

got to keep bringing some votes in there

but this is this is a riding where I

don't think anybody expected to see the

liberal challenging the conservative now

we were talking about the the Green

Party talk about faint hope everybody

was focused on woolsley that was the

riding that that everyone had expected

could be the one that for the first time

would paint something green right now it

is

DP Orange and if we look at the board

we'll see why because Dave knickers is

sitting 20 points back of Lisa Naylor I

think the NDP poured a lot of effort

into this they didn't want to give this

up and David is actually doing less well

than he did last time so just to look at

the popular vote again and I think

what's interesting about this is how

similar these numbers are to what they

were in 2016 the PCs were a little over

50% a bit higher than this but that's

what they were in 2016

the NDP they're about four points up but

the breakthrough where was the

breakthrough that the liberal that the

Liberals and the NDP Green were looking

for the Liberals finished in 2016 just

over 14% there they are same thing again

the Greens were around 5% they're now at

a five point eight percent I mean they

were hoping to do much better there are

many that we're looking in from I think

greens across the country we're thinking

this is our chance we've been breaking

through in Ontario in New Brunswick in

British Columbia Manitoba is next needed

it'll be right in Winnipeg and we're not

seeing that tonight anywhere in Manitoba

Lisa all right Eric Sorensen thanks for

that are things unfolding as you

expected for the Liberal Party they are

in many many respects I'll be very

interesting for Richmond and whether or

not the former president of the

University of Manitoba Student Union is

able to pick up there but yeah they are

unfolding because of strong local

candidates Lisa all right we're gonna

take it down to Joe Scarpelli he's live

at Liberal Party headquarters this hour

with John Gerard the communications

director for that party hey Joe

hey Lisa so yes I have Jean Girard

standing next to me right now John you

entered the room to a lot of cheers what

was it feeling like I want to thank the

people in River Heights and it's just

great to be reelected it's a phenomenal

to be a member of the legislature of

Assembly of Manitoba and to be able to

continue to make a contribution we're

going on 20 years right yep

this is 20 years and this will be the

sixth election that I've won so I'm

really thankful to the voters in River

Heights I want to thank my wife who's

just been incredible the last several

months and I want to thank David Mintz

and I had an amazing team of people who

just worked so hard and they made all

the difference this is quite you know

quite a run for you what's keeping you

going there's still a lot to do in

Manitoba and a lot of need here in the

province and I love helping people with

individual problems as well as making a

contribution which I think I can do in

the Liberal Party and with do little

amounts leadership we've got a team and

it's a lot of fun having a team and

we're working hard and we're gonna

continue to work hard how about some of

the the younger candidates some of the

newer candidates liberal candidates

trying to you know get to a position in

one day have a one like yourself what

advice would you have for them we had a

lot of amazing candidates and

a lot of the results are not final yet

until we get the advance poll numbers

but a lot of advance bold you won't know

for sure and quite a number of these

races but it's exciting to see so many

really really qualified highly qualified

candidates young people involved in the

Liberal Party it's a we've got an

exciting future no matter what happens

the rest of the night all right well

thank you for your time I know there's a

lot of people here that wanna speak to

you Lisa

I will send things back to you all right

congratulations to John Gerard reelected

in River Heights

talk about storylines to watch tonight

ministers in trouble let's begin with

st. Vittal Colleen Mayer your PC

incumbent she's losing right now - Jamie

Moses by a substantial percentage 48%

for Jamie Moses of the NDP Colleen there

with 32 percent of the vote race the

Crown Services Minister Brian Pallister

appointed her to give her more profile

Jamie Moses has been working the doors

with the former MLA Nancy Allen of the

NDP she's been working that riding with

Jamie Moses so far it's paying dividends

to Moses and rial where Rochelle Squires

the PC incumbent is sitting with 42% of

the vote

Mike moist from the NDP on her tail with

39% since we last checked in Rochelle

Squires last we looked had a to vote

lead she's now got a hundred and

thirteen vote leads a long way to go

only 18 of 46 polls are reporting so

there's a lot that can go back and forth

here but she does represent the future

of the party she is again a front bench

Minister and it's all part of those

swing ridings in the southeast part of

our city the future for her she's got to

worry about the next two hours in the

future and then we get to the months

ahead

well we're enjoying the commentary from

our panel tonight and see gob host Julie

Buckingham Julie will start this time

around with Jenny McCulloch and we were

speaking as we saw some of the results

come in about the Liberal Party and and

I feel that they certainly have more

leadership than they did this last time

last election in 2016 with Rana Bakari

but you think Dugald Lamont made some

tactical

errors he was more of a strategic error

in the way that they presented

themselves that reminded me of Justin

Trudeau in 2015 in 2015

Justin Trudeau moved that party as far

left as he possibly could he became in a

horse race with the NDP federally to get

really differentiate themselves from the

from the Tories federally and here what

I see that Dougal Vermont did the same

thing with the policies that he that he

put forward we're really moving to the

left of the spectrum and in my opinion

that presents him more as an alternative

to the NDP so now you've got people with

you know voting tendencies on the Left

trying to decide what I vote liberal or

will I vote NDP he could have done the

opposite and if he had moved their

platform over to the right right and

presented himself as a knoll and and

dismissed the NDP yeah and presented

himself as the alternative debris I've

seen a different that's very interesting

I don't know actually I think I think

that's actually a good point I think

what he needed to do is become more

centrist he did come up with some good

policy ideas he came up with some

bonehead ideas at the same time like

what and well the problem that I had was

this idea of having a provincial police

for it doesn't work there's also some

ideas of the one thing that he did have

going for him though he had some really

strong candidates this time around and

for their first time we did not see them

have a total complete blow up halfway

through the campaign with people getting

fired and walking off the job so they

did a good would jump had a great

campaign in that regard right there were

no big gaps no big missteps and that's

why I'm saying I think was more of a

strategic error than anything else thank

you very much can I just say that we you

know we have these results boards we

should have built a Shannon Sanford

results board so that we could see all

of Shannon's former students that are

running for office tonight how many I

have six and how many have one none

you're not very good

okay let's find a great professor maybe

just not good how many of my students

are actually working behind the scenes

most of them are and they're doing a

great job did they represent those

aggressive conservative and NDP and

liberal all right no question if you

want to learn about politics work an

election right that's it they're having

too much fun down we gotta bring up our

game here on the fun meter all right all

right decision Manitoba 2019 continues

but first let's take a quick look at our

leading and elected board and again all

the elected now filling in so the PCs

leading an eighth elected in twenty

eight out for a total of thirty six so

they could that is gonna be Richard as

you said a very solid majority NDP

leading in seven elected in eleven

liberals leading in one elected in two

for a total of three greens it's not a

very nice night for the Greens the

popular vote is down and even in

woolsley where we thought they'd do well

mm I'm still having some trouble there

so right now as we've said PC majority

government NDP is the official

opposition and a healthy one liberals

hoping for one more to get official

party status we did talk about it

earlier in the night when we projected

that PC majority government the future

of Brian Pallister

your interview with him Richard where he

said he was gonna stay the course and

serve that full term do we believe him

well I don't believe him in the end

simply because I think when you ask that

question of a leader they have to say

during an election campaign it's their

intention to stay the full term but with

this type of result 36 seats and all the

controversy over health care changes why

not stay once your premier why not stay

as premier yes that I understand he's

got this place in Costa Rica we don't

want to spend some more time adding you

can't spend as much time as you can when

you're premier but and he is 65 years

old and people do start to think about

the retirement usually once they hit

that particular age so he's gonna get a

set for sure if he's not probably gonna

speak to reporters tonight I'm sure he

will tomorrow and it's probably gonna be

one of the first things that you or

the reporters going to well a lot of

people give him 18 months but you never

know once your premier once you're in

power

you like the trappings of power Lisa all

right let's check in with Kevin

Hirschfeld and 680 CJ o B's Lauren

McNabb they're down at NDP party

headquarters tonight

hey Kevin hey Lauren

yeah I loose it down here at the mats of

the Wren you know think back to 2016 you

covered that election I mean what's the

vibe like cheer compared to three years

ago even though it's another PC majority

government to me I was just thinking

that so bizarre there's cheers going off

all around us someone was just holding

their baby up in the air just now for a

kiss from who knows who that the point

is they're celebrating here tonight we

talked about that early in the show but

getting that power back getting that

swagger back and you're seeing it and

you're feeling it here tonight with the

cheers that keep going on this isn't a

show for them they're not pretending

that they're happy they're happy there

was a time just weeks ago they're

worried we might not get past four to

twelve we may not get to 14 and here

they are inching in around 18 19

territory and so I think the mood here

is not only vastly different but it goes

to show you the ground that I think that

they can cover in the months and years

ahead they talked about how encouraged

they were with the results considering

the short period of time they had to

campaign this thing was moved up a year

earlier what do you think they did so

well that's allowing them to get at

least a little bit of a game here you

know this is a union party they've got a

bit of those votes back we're watching

things in trance Kona we're watching

things in the inner city with boroughs

and then Tindall Park as they've gone

back and forth but what that shows there

in those tight races I think is that

they were able to get back some of their

supporters safe a towel you know a NDP

law strong support there and so that's a

big deal they're challenged still and

perhaps where they could have done

better was over the past month they

actually had to fight with their own two

party supporters because there was a

union issue going on all the unions were

bad battling to get votes for the union

vote that palster had made them all

little

from you knows hundreds of health care

unions to just store so these guys have

been pounding the pavement for months

now on the union vote that took place

you have to wonder how many more people

they could have got out to push that

vote celebrations every time the end now

it's one of those key feet just quickly

before I let you go around Wahb canoe as

the leader you know maybe there were

some questions going into this could the

NDP make these gains or would they fall

even further what does the future this

party look like now with wot canoe as

the leader and some games to go off up

here tonight this is a refree for him

that would be my what I'd be saying I'd

say he'd be relieved tonight on a

personal level for the future of himself

but not just for his party this this as

far as what I'm hearing from people here

tonight is a mandate to go forward with

him it doesn't put to rest the questions

about him it doesn't put the rest of

questions other people might have about

him and whether he's the future for

years beyond remains to be seen but this

gives them a strong clear mandate to

move forward for this term for sure all

right

Lorraine McNab from 680 CG Obie's at the

start and still some ridings up for

grabs so those NDP games could get even

higher tonight Lisa all right Kevin

Hirsch rail to Ren McNabb thanks for

that decision Manitoba 2019 continues as

we await results on some of the close

races still in play and speeches from

Brian Pallister

needed and I think homes provide them

this is the way where our staff and our

our community interacts with this

normal it's just nice to be able to be a

expect to hear from people soon we're

wet you know the order is gonna be the

guy who finishes third than the guy in a

canoe we're waiting for him to speak

hear what he's got to say

I think he's going to be very secure in

his leadership and after that we'll hear

from Brian Pallister who will tell us

essentially give us a we think it not a

throne speech but a very rough draft of

what now Manitoba's can expect for the

next couple of years all right in the

meantime let's throw it down to Eric

Sorensen with a look at how the manitoba

ledge

yeah Lisa we're gonna actually show you

a layout of the ledge before and after

in just a moment too to make the point

but but you have to ask yourself like

what is the real picture tonight when it

is 36 to 18 because the PCs have twice

as many seats as the New Democrats after

what everyone is saying is a good night

for the New Democrats so where do they

pick up from there because they've got a

lot of ground to make up here if they're

going to lose Swan River and they're

going to lose dolphin for example if we

go down into southern Manitoba and you

can see of course they're going to win

in these writings use you would expect

for the for the Conservatives but if you

get past that and look at the writings

all around Winnipeg you can see kind of

a vice-like grip taking place here I

mean these are some of the places up and

sell

kirk and red river north and the new

riding of springfield reshot these are

places where perhaps our Dawson Trail in

fact the places where the NDP has won

these are areas that the NDP is won in

the past but this whole city is

encircled by the Conservatives and if

you look at Winnipeg you get kind of the

same picture you're used to the NDP kind

of controlling the the center of the

city and the north and towards the east

but you have this encircling that's

happening with the new wider boundary

all the way out to Roblin and the new

northern boundary with McPhillips and

all the way around the south now you can

see the Conservatives kind of taking

charge and over there on the east I mean

that Radisson one that has to hurt a

little bit for New Democrats who were

very used to having trans Kona and

Elmwood and and all of the writings over

there being being New Democrat orange so

this is the way when you say oh well

it's a pretty good night for the NDP

let's look at the well for example

there's South Dale we want to look at

South Dale and this one it would in a

sense be up for grabs because there was

no incumbent there and audre Gordon is

narrowly ahead but it's a hundred and

sixty eight votes now we want to come

out and show you then what this all

means for example here is our our

legislature and this is what it looked

like at disillusion and we had this

massive win by the Conservatives and

they still had 38 of those seats held

when when we're at disillusion after

winning 40 in 2016 and you can see they

had so many spilling over onto the far

side of the of the legislature well

let's look ahead now to where we stand

tonight if everything stands as it looks

right now and it's not very different

you have the Conservatives on the

government benches kind of in charge you

have some a few more conservatives to

spare the NDP is a bigger force over

there but they still have a long way to

go the three independents that existed

they're gone but the Liberals have gone

from four to three it's not exactly what

they were looking at when they look down

at this as well so I think one of the

things that kind of comes out about this

is our is there any kind of realignment

happening I'm saying some of your

experts we want to look at that to say

our Conservatives beginning to win in

ridings where it'll be very hard for the

NDP to win back because again as we say

36 to 18 that is not a close race at the

end of the night Lisa

thanks for that Eric Simonson and

Richard couch a thoughts on that well

and just to pick up on Eric's point here

is this a realignment well generally

Manitobans give their governments two

terms we're pretty kind that way but

what we might be seeing in the northeast

part of the city of Winnipeg is this

realignment to issues here first of all

health care was a big issue of Concordia

in Sevenoaks hospitals those writings

haven't really turned as much as we

anticipated if health care was going to

be the big issue the second thing is

suburban development you drive trans

Coney you drive these areas you've seen

more and more houses more affluence has

gone into that neighborhood gone are the

days that this was just strictly Union

based type of constituencies these are

more suburban constituencies now that

would suggest that they're there for the

Progressive Conservatives to pick up all

right we're gonna go to Brittany

Greenslade she's live at PC Party

headquarters tonight Brittany we're

eagerly awaiting that speech from Brian

Pallister any word yeah we are waiting

we hear it could be at any time now

earlier tonight they were saying around

10 o'clock but we are still waiting for

an exact timeline but I want to bring in

680 C GOP host Greg Macklin now now Greg

we've talked about health care reform

and we saw some big-name ministers and

MLAs reelected so what does that mean

what did Manitoban think well by any

measure this is a resounding victory for

the PCs let's be honest over 50 percent

of the popular vote no ministers no

major members of the caucus unseated if

the Blue Bombers 136 to 18 we'd be

pretty happy if you're a blue bond or a

fan well I think the PCs are pretty

happy with this result it's a clear

mandate we've talked about health care

but I think we're gonna hear more about

education as we move into this next

phase of this now to term government one

of the big interesting takeaways that we

saw was Josh Ginter 25

years old picking up a seat in border

last day the youngest elected in this

election we're seeing other young people

running other people now elected and to

go with the sports analogy you need

young blood in your party in any

organization new ideas in order to keep

things vibrant to engage with the

electorate in order to get other

candidates potentially involved as well

it's critical and from my point of view

it's a wonderful thing to see he said he

wants to bring more affordability to

Manitobans with that one of the issues

you heard about during this election

listen taxation has been an issue in

Manitoba since I was old enough to think

about and comprehend the idea of

Elections it's always been a back and

forth issue it's a huge deciding factor

for a lot of people on how they vote

tax-and-spend NDP versus more

traditionally fiscally conservative PCs

well we know which way Manitobans are

leading right now this could also be

good for the Blue Bombers I want to put

that in real quick 1990 the PCs got a

decided majority in an election in 1990

the last year the Blue Bombers won the

Grey Cup Lisa with that we will throw it

back to you at the desk thank you well

that's interesting

all right go Bombers go please please

when the Great Cup all right we take you

to break with a live shot of NDP

headquarters as we await leader wampa

news speech stay with us this is

decision Manitoba

[Music]

you

my dad started independent jeweler back

in 1937 and I think he'd be very proud

if he knew that his grandsons are now in

think homes provide them this is a way

where our staff and our our community

interacts with this community in a

just nice to be able to be a part of

that

with so many important voices in your

life it's far more rewarding to deal

with hearing loss that a pretend it

isn't happening

call today and book your free no

obligation here in consultation help is

on the horizon

Verizon Hearing Centers Luke is going to

space one day it's all he ever talks

about it's more than a dream it's his

future and today today is a good day

but today would be the last day of his

life

Luke is one of the 100 Manitobans to die

on our roads this year but we can do

something about it his life matters it's

the first bangers tan sale gets 60

percent of his spring law pocket oil set

fifty-five percent of this Sealy

Posturepedic set or the Sealy

Posturepedic Kovac it's only $7.99 plus

mattresses from $1.99

or to us it's not just coffee or latte

it's a moment of calm an icebreaker see

to us it's more it's 100% ethically

sourced Arabica beans it's freshly

ground espresso with fresh milk steamed

and froth and every sip is as rich and

smooth as the last and now until

September 29th its $1 for any seismic

cafe premium rose coffee and $2.00 for

any small latte because to us every cup

counts yeah welcome back a live shot

there of NDP headquarters but a quick

recap of the numbers for six ATC govt

listeners tonight the Progressive

Conservatives leading or elected in 36

ridings the NDP 18 the Liberals 3 the

green not turning up anything tonight we

have projected that progressive

Progressive Conservative majority

government yeah and the NDP to just over

at the met here in downtown Winnipeg

that's where they're gathering and yeah

it's been do see here that you know the

mood is relatively buoyant again they

didn't win but they did a lot better

than they did in 2016 and Watkyn and I

think is going to speak to that sense of

optimism that the party has now and we

have projected that PC majority but

there's five races in play right now

that are very close let's take a quick

look at them the first in South Dale 25

out of 41 polls reporting let's talk

about this one Richard Audrey Gordon has

really been working this riding she is a

veteran PC she has a 143 vote lead over

Karen mish lousy of the NDP again this

is one of those swing ridings of the NDP

when they were in government had

actually won it and I know that the NDP

they want this riding that's the route

they're really pushing for it

McPhillips 22 or 247 polls reporting the

PC incumbent Shannon Martin 38 percent

of the vote Greg mcfarland from the NDP

37 percent no business for Shannon

Martin to be winning this at all given

the health care changes he parachuted he

in from south of Winnipeg but the PCs

figured that they could actually win

this riding such a tight race between

them and the NDP yeah it's a 31

vote lead after 22 polls a couple of

thousand votes in and Shannon Martin is

just out by 31 votes Fort Richmond 33

out of 40 polls reporting so we're

getting close there Sara Gilliam are the

PC incumbent with 2029 votes just behind

her 10 jeet negra from the Liberals with

32 percent of the vote she has 1619

again this is a riding where tangi has

been working the doors she's from the

University of Manitoba was the former

student union president there a lot of

university students in that riding to

vote for maybe she got them out she

probably didn't she probably did a good

job of that the Maples 10 to the 36

polls reporting min to sandy from the

NDP close race with deep breath from the

Liberal Party right we're 143 votes are

separating the NDP in top then to the

Liberals and even that not fart not that

far behind are the PCs with 378 votes so

this is a tight one and there's a long

way to go and in a cinebulle 3 8 out of

44 polls reporting there but just a

hundred and sixty-five votes ahead of

the NDP candidate PC incumbent Scott

Johnson and again this is always one of

those tight ridings historically a

cinema win will swing to the government

party at times but joel mchale up of the

NDP he's got 39% of the vote with 38 of

44 polls reporting depending on where

those polls are again right down to the

wire

yeah the window is kind of closed and I

think for Jo mikela he's got to close

that gap pretty fast not a lot of polls

reporting and don't forget this year

there is write-in ballots people can

write in anywhere and they can be

dropped in do we expect the write-in

ballot to really affect many races

probably not why we've been told from

elections Manitoba the total number of

writing ballots for the entire province

is about a thousand so it's really not a

whole lot of votes but those will be

ballots it will have to be counted

they'll be counted them in the days

ahead all right let's take a look at our

leading and elected board coming off

that and a closer look at these number

of statements yeah so again elected is

really what we're looking at there we're

getting to the point the night when we

can say for example the PCs are elected

in 29 so that's the majority

they're already elected but they're also

leading in another six ridings for a

total of 35 leading and elected and DPR

elected in 12 and again that's where

they started the year that night they

had 12 and they've got 12 there and a

leading in seven for a total of 19 all

right Julie Buckingham is standing by

with our panel of political insiders and

it's been entertaining listening to you

folks Julie well we appreciate that and

I want to pick up on something Greg

Macklin he was using the whole blue

bomber

analogy so I want to take you from the

field to the sandbox and the premier who

will remain premier is not notably

that's a play well with others there's

been a difficult relationship between

Broadway and Main Street and also

between Broadway and Ottawa that's right

do we expect that to change I'm not

thinking it's going to and one of the

things that's going on too is a dynamic

of we have Kenny

we have moe and we have Ford there's a

lovely dynamic that's going on across

the prairies and into Ontario

conservatives solid solidarity as it

were that's going to work perfectly if

the Liberals are reelected in Ottawa and

if the sheer goes in we're going to have

all sorts of interesting things happen

as well in terms of policy and

conservative policies I think you're

going to see a better relationship

between Broadway and Main Street as

Julie put it I think with this

incredibly impressive victory all right

I think premier Pallister is gonna kick

back to relax a little bit and I hope he

does and I'm not saying it's his fault

I'm not saying it's Brian Bowman's fault

but come on but no romance Bob come on

guys let's put all that aside and get

things done for Winnipeggers you told me

makes me crazy so let's just let's just

admit the fact that the majority of

Manitobans live in Winnipeg right right

so we have two levels of government

representing us here and the fact is is

that they must play well with others

they have to get along because there is

only one voter there is only one tax

rate

and we expect nothing less from our

premier come on change the people at

Main Street figure that one out the

first meeting that they had in a couple

of years was just before the election

call that's right I don't know who you

believe because you say Brian Bowman

will say listen Brian Bowman will say

the premier won't meet with me and the

premier will say something else and just

like whether or not health care spending

is up or down or if there's cuts or no

cuts they needed couples we don't really

that's what they need you have one that

you're very form I can set them up okay

so how lenders is setting them up while

we throw you back to the desk

all right thanks for that Julie well

this campaign began with attack ads on

Wahb canoeing with a look at the numbers

tonight I'm gonna say they didn't really

work well yeah they don't think they did

I mean I think it depends on who you

talk to there were some younger voters

who did not know what Bell wad canoes

back a background rather and when they

learned about it when whoa look at that

you know kind of a rough and tumble

obviously I think a lot of older voters

and when I say older rittany over 35

they had some inkling they'd heard about

some of the stories etc so it may not

have been shocking but very I would say

almost vicious campaign by the PCs to

really hammer home you know it's

criminal this and rapper that to make

him look like a real gangster but David

it worked they think I think it did work

and I think it helped solidify their

message they were on message on that and

again it wasn't Brian Pallister knock

and wob canoe in those ads it was the

Darth Vader voice if he will somebody

else not you know this is the Darth Bane

and in this way the Progressive

Conservatives go down three seats with

all the health care changes that we have

seen and all the negatives that Brian

Pallister has when it comes to to even

women voters they still are able to get

35 seats in this and wahb canoe I think

tonight yes he gets to hang on to his

job but if you're a NDP strategist

you're thinking how do we grow this how

do we grow this in the next four years

we're gonna say a lot more different

changes from the Progressive

Conservative forgot you've had your shot

now at wat canoes background that's not

going to be an issue in four years

you've taken the shot it's just as when

you know Stephen Harper was the bogeyman

for the Liberals and o4a working out for

it didn't work when they've tried that

again I know six to get one shot and

making your opponent look like the bad

guy it goes to your story of comparing

canoe to doer in the sense that now he's

established himself who is going to be

the next competitor for the Progressive

Conservatives because I'll tell you four

years from now it's not likely going to

be Bryant Allison and of course we

should let people know we're just

waiting now on WOB canoe we're expecting

that WOD canoe may come into his room at

down at the the diplomat very shortly

let's take a look at the gains and

losses while we've got a minute here so

the PCs down three but you know what

they're gonna shrug their shoulders are

that because that's still a monster

numbers you've been planning on a

laundry her number yes happy plus seven

a monster number for them we want to

take a look at the writing of Union

Station 34 out of 56 polls reporting and

this is where the NDP made a big in Road

tonight elected the candidate they're do

use up I'm gonna get you to help me out

on this all the way up there you go

51 percent of the vote over the Liberal

candidate with 19 percent Notre Dame 25

at a 38 polls reporting the NDP

candidate elected in that riding malaya

Marcelino

[Music]

in Kuwait in Kuwait nook in bushi the

NDP incumbent elected there these are

where the NDP made some gains tonight

and and it's not close and this was this

is part of the writing we're very we're

going to be to it a general election

federally tomorrow and of course Nikki

Ashton is from that part of the world an

NDP MP she's looking to hold that in the

federal and the NDP in boroughs Dungey

bar with 40% is now elected five hundred

and ninety eight point lead over Jasmine

Brar of the Progressive Conservatives

they needed to take that back and they

did

and there's trans Kona I've been saying

again I've mentioned the federal

election a couple of times so the

provincial NDP has shown some strength

in some you know traditional areas in

downtown Winnipeg jump meet saying the

federal NDP leader he's having a not a

very good month he's been kicked around

a lot of regions of the country but I

think the federal NDP will look and say

wow Wahb can do and the NDP are back on

their feet

in Manitoba that is gonna make the

federal MP Daniel Blakey feel a little

more confident and I think it's gonna

make Robert Falcon to let the Liberal MP

and Winnipeg centre nervous that the NDP

are gonna take his seat in the federal

election you following all the elections

there with me Richard back and forth so

it's so this night is good for the

federal NDP I think as well they're

gonna be feeling a little bit encouraged

because they've had a little bad news

recently in st. fatale the PC and

comment Kali mayor she's trailing the

NDP elected candidate we have an elected

NDP er there Jamie Moses with 46% of the

road and a cabinet minister goes down

howleen Mayor was there and was brought

to cabinet Crown Services Minister she

loses there in st. James adrian salva

new democrat is elected we're calling

that one

Michelle Richard the Progressive

Conservative finishing second Liberals

finishing third and there's a greens

disappointing 9% at this point for the

Greens

in fourth place all right we're going to

take you back to that live shot of NDP

headquarters as Bob Kearney we have word

that

his way into the room and up to the

podium for his speech tonight I know

Richard wasn't wonderful you sat down

with him yeah and again he has overcome

a lot in this campaign and again the

negative ads he was very calm and how he

handled that explained himself away and

for all those NDP strategists they said

if he can get to 16 if he can get to 18

or 19 we're quite content with that and

he is now I think he'll get up and he'll

start talking about the fact that

Manitobans have spoken loud and clear

and some key constituencies but this is

kind of where the NDP were hoping to

rebuild because they knew that they

would be out at least two terms yeah

listen it's if this was a David and

Goliath fight the PCs had control of the

timing they didn't get punished at all

for breaking the fixed 8 election law

they had money there you know well

organized the NDP were trying to collect

themselves had to run through a

leadership race after that terrible fog

it results in 2016 and they got this

surprise election to deal with them they

didn't have the resources that the other

guys did so in this David and Goliath

fight it kind of turned out the way that

Goliath absolutely won the PCs but David

didn't do too bad at 19 seats and I

think as I say that is what Bob canoe is

going to be speaking to the future of

the new Democrats in Manitoba and how we

can prosecute what he'd like to do which

is fight Bryan pallister's health care

of the forms all right here it is

again this is coming from downtown

Winnipeg just a few blocks firm we are

here at the corner reported Jemaine he's

at the diplomat the hotel man since I'm

at pardon me type the diplomat and and

you know he's gonna be there probably

family behind and cheering them on and

this is what the crowd is going to show

their walk loved because he has taken

them from 12 to 18 seats and and again

as we heard from people down there

that's that's a big success back

humiliating defeat in 2016 this is a

rebuilding time for the NDP and I think

it's played out that way yep absolutely

it has played out as far as rebuilding

is concerned and again when you look at

the stage the NDP trying to broaden

their representation from all points of

Manitoba and that a young indigenous

leader here head of a major political

party that still is historic not only in

this province but this country here we

go thank you so much Manitoba and thank

you so much New Democrats way to stand

up for all of us in this province how do

you do I'm Rob canoe I'm feeling pretty

good tonight

[Applause]

a very proud of you the Manitoba NDP

you've done such a great job all the

candidates all the staff and the

volunteers make some noise thank you so

much so just a few minutes to go I

called Brian Pallister to congratulate

him on his victory tonight it was a

local call

I was you know very inspired by the

showing we had this time around but

Manitobans chose to give him a second

mandate and so I congratulated him you

know humble and victory humble and

defeat that's my goal but I don't think

we were defeated tonight I think

Manitoban sent a very very strong

message and the seats that we took back

made it very clear that Manitobans want

us the New Democrats to not only be the

conscience of Manitoba not only to be

the opposition of Manitoba but to be the

progressive voice for Manitoba and so

we'll get back to work at the

legislature very soon and I want to

congratulate our new MLA elects under

tremendous performance you've made

history but you've made us proud

I also told mr. balusters that he should

bring in the Agri recovery protocol no

response in the room whatsoever but this

is a very important thing that our

livestock producers need and I just want

everybody across Manitoba to know that

we are serious about representing your

concerns whether you're inside the

perimeter whether you're in rural

Manitoba or whether you are in the north

we are a party for all of us now we had

a very clear message in this campaign we

said this election was about health care

and I think the signs that many

Manitoba's agreed with us are all the

new Democrat MLAs who are going to be

coming to the legislature this fall and

so there will be tough times ahead

you know mr. Palace are called this

election early because the full impact

of his cuts to health care have not yet

been felt and so we will be there each

and every day holding him accountable

and asking him to do better when it

comes to health care because the seat

pickups we gain tonight show Manitobans

want much much better from their health

care system than they've seen these past

three years

I also spoke to many Manitobans across

the course of this campaign who are

thinking about education and the fact

that we had so many teachers running as

part of our slate this time was a clear

sign that we must stand up for an

education system for all of us in

Manitoba a strong education system isn't

just about preparing people for jobs

though it does just that an education

system that works for all of us is about

ensuring that every single kid in

Manitoba has a fighting chance including

those exceptional kids with exceptional

needs we have to give them all a

fighting chance in our province and I'm

very proud to say that we've got a new

MLA from the woolsley who's going to be

joining us and I'm also very grateful to

have been given a second chance to

represent for Roush and what I take what

I take from those results and the

results across the province is that

Manitobans want us to be strong when it

comes to climate justice Manitobans want

us to solve the climate crisis

Manitobans want us to solve climate

change and so we will take that ask with

honor we will carry it forward and so we

will be there with the young people who

are walking out of their classes on

September 27th for the global climate

strike

you are calling on us to act and we will

listen our new team a very fresh

exciting team by the way our new team is

going to have twice as many new MLAs as

there will be veterans on the team so a

lot of new energy a lot of fresh blood

but also a strong tie to the past and so

we are going to stand up for the

environment we are going to stand up for

climate justice and we are going to

stand up for a Manitoba that works for

all of us

[Applause]

and so I want to thank my family my

beautiful wife Lisa my siblings in-laws

everybody I've been really blown away

you guys have really sacrificed to be

able to allow me to run this campaign I

could not have done it without you

literally so I just want to say thank

you or as we say back home

meegwetch

[Applause]

and so it's with great humility that we

accept the results tonight not because

we feel any kind of way about the

outcome of tonight's election but we

accept this with humility because the

people of Manitoba have given us an

awesome job they have made us the

official opposition they have sought fit

to give us an increased seat count in

the legislature and they have sent a

clear message to Manitobans that the new

democratic party is the progressive

voice here in Manitoba and so we accept

that with honor we accept that with

grace and we accept that with great

humility because over the next four

years we are going to work hard each and

every day we're going to keep knocking

on doors we're gonna keep showing up for

all the community events and four years

from now we are going to take Manitoba

back and form a new democratic

government

thank you merci beaucoup

and big wigs all right NDP leader wok

canoe concedes defeat but also focusing

on the new energy injected into the NDP

tonight yeah yeah and you know Curtis

Brown I thought pollster friend was

known and just done his Twitter feed and

I agree with him for a guy who you know

lost by what nearly 20 seats and that

set for etc pretty chippy performance

you know enthusiastic feeling very

upbeat you could confuse this for the

winner speech they're feeling pretty

good about themselves good lying about I

just talked to Pallister it was a local

call always taken the digs and Pallister

and whether or not he's here in Costa

Rica I can assure you he's here yeah I'm

sure I'm sure the Prima was watching on

the the feed on wherever he is I hope he

takes it in good spirit it was just just

kind of fun alright we wait to hear from

Brian Pallister next stay with us this

is decision Manitoba 2019

[Music]

container to that landfill his brother

never made it to landfill

their fate depends on you recycle the

started independent jewelers back in

1937 and I think he'd be very proud if

he knew that his grandsons are now in

charge of looking after this habitat

building I think you know in this area

as an area where comfort is needed and I

think homes provide them this is a way

where our staff and our our community

interacts with this community in a

little different way than normal it's

just nice to be able to be a part of

[Music]

because whatever brings you here

[Music]

today homes are designed for living for

it isn't just where we are it's who we

are

it's the backdrop to our lives and it's

walls are the keeper of our memories

discover how homes have evolved for

living at the Manitoba Home Builders

Parade of Homes proudly supported by SCU

Manitoba's largest credit union welcome

you have a copycat I'm flattered and

deeply concerned

you

all right we're gonna show you a live

shot now of PC headquarters of course

leader Brian Pallister will be speaking

soon coming off that wob canoe speech

and an exciting evening down at PC Party

headquarters tonight and I'll say that

this is a whopping majority for the

Progressive Conservatives at 36 because

the majority in Manitoba is usually 31

32 over that 29 mark with 36 seats a

back to back healthy majority for Brian

Pallister does say something David I

know

the NDP at 18 whop canoes saying that

yes we have grown we are the opposition

here but let's not lose sight of the

fact that back to back massive

majorities and now some of the reelected

Progressive Conservatives gathering at

the Kennedy uns Polo Park Scott fielding

is there

he's been reelected the finance minister

so only one big loss of a cabinet

minister and calling mayor in in st.

Vittal but really as it says moving

Manitoba forward Brian Pallister takes

this as a cue to continue on with the

health care reforms in rural Manitoba

and to continue on with education and

other economic reforms it's going to be

all systems go yep and as we're watching

that shot at PC headquarters clearly

it's successful candidates there's

Rochelle Squires for examples getting

behind you know they do the potted plant

routine they're gonna stand there in

clap for the leader and they're very

happy and why shouldn't they be you know

we mentioned you mentioned that one

cabinet minister but just to mla's

losing tonight for the PC so you you

come in with a record and you pretty

much darn near defended that record from

last time around they started the day

with 38 and they're down 36 that's a

really good night you're quite right for

the PCs and they should be very pleased

with themselves you know I think going

into this too and you know the where's

the excitement that we saw in the in

both places

I think the NDP were just a little more

excited because they come from further

down you know these guys are the kings

they know they're the kings they're

acting like the kings down there -

you're saying they're over near Polo

Park that's their names Pullo Park and

the expectation was going into this

talking to their pollsters was it they

were going to get 38 36 seats as well

they

expected to win this thing interesting

story though is the liberal vote because

that slid right right down and canoe

going to the public yesterday and saying

if yeah if you don't like our games

health care I'm your man so that's

solidified it for the NDP certainly did

but again Brian Pallister is going to

have license to continue on with some

monumental changes in this province and

dare I say if you're listening and on

six ATC J OB and watching outside the

city of Winnipeg brace for a lot of

health care changes in the months ahead

where you're gonna be wondering about

your local hospital as they read Jake

healthcare massively in this province

and I can tell you that that

congratulations are coming in from

around the country right next door in

Saskatchewan premier Scott Moe has

congratulated premier Palestrina coast

those two guys four peas and a

conservative pod when it comes to

fighting things like the carbon tax the

federal conservative leader Andrew

Shearer he is preparing to open up his

bid to unseat Justin Trudeau he'll be in

twelve Revere Quebec tomorrow he has

sent in his congratulations

you know the Conservatives in the

country you know Brian Pallister is part

of the famous resistance on that acclaim

and it's a good point that you make

because I think it Pallister in his

speech will make a reference to the

federal government and Justin Trudeau

and he knows the fact that Justin's

going out tomorrow to officially launch

that federal election and he's also

going to be talking about opposing some

of the federal government policies that

have enacted here in Manitoba and listen

there are three federal seats right here

in Winnipeg held by liberals that the

Conservatives absolutely have a target

on Douglaston and the Charles wood st.

James riding up and kill Bona st. Paul I

don't think anybody expects Mary I'm a

hit chick to come back and if we look

down and Winnipeg south as well Terry do

good the Liberal MP I think the

Conservatives are pretty confident about

that and oh guess what where were the

Progressive Conservatives doing real

well tonight all on the provincial

ridings that map on to those federal

ridings and we are going to be paying

especially close attention to this

speech because there is still a bit of a

question mark surrounding Brian

Pallister and whether or not he'll serve

out that full term yes I expect him to

say we've been elected for four more

years and that there will be no hints

that he's going to leave

anytime soon that's going to be up to

the whisker whispers of some of those

cabinet ministers and some of those PC

insiders but tonight he's going to be

saying we are rewarded with a big

massive mandate there's gonna be all

sorts of echo coming out of our pre man

you know what my bet is listen to the

crowd chant when he comes to the podium

they'll be going 4 more years 4 more

years and it's been of a slightly

different meaning given that we're

talking about Pallister because he's got

he's got fans in the party even though

as he said you called him the tough love

premier he called himself the tough love

frame let's take a look at some of the

PC landslides tonight we want to look at

that and the writing of Midland where

your PC incumbent reelected Blaine

Peterson was 74 percent of the vote

handily taking down sandy breezes

and don't forget we you won't miss

Pallister speech we'll be right back to

it as soon as they see FAL with your

papa Calvin Gerson will be disappointed

that he only got 81 percent of the vote

in Steinbach almost 5000 volt lead over

the NDP and Stein huh yeah it's not

close that's like and I told you early

on I called that one early on it's not a

really tough one to call that one that's

rocket science

and Gordon Winkler Cameron fries and the

PC incumbent re-elected there with 81%

of them he got it freezing got about 81

percent last time and a future leader of

this pod the victory and Health Minister

he's the Health Minister and I'll be

interested to see if Pallister continues

with him as health minister in Lakeside

all the polls reporting there your PC

incumbent re-elected Ralph idler you

bring me make a good point Richard that

one of the stories as well for for you

and and all our colleagues at Global

News is going to be cabinet speculation

certainly it's time to shuffle things up

cabinet wise maybe give some newer

people some some important assignments

there is you can start a little bit of

regeneration that's very important for a

party to sustain itself but then you

don't also want to annoy some of your

close friends and make a neatnik

anything seem like there's demotions for

anybody it's a tricky thing

Brian Pallister has the reputation of

and last candidate shuffle he shuffled

that front deck

and that was to keep ministers on their

toes and I honestly think that Pallister

he may be done in 18 months but he's not

going to show his parts at all tonight

or anytime soon no and where are those

that where he does name cata ministers

people may also be starting to try to

read the entrails in terms of who's got

an inside edge to succeed Palace here

it's it might be easy to do from a

finance ministers position or a Health

Minister position although you know what

if I was I don't know if I'd want to be

Health Minister because as we believe

there are going to be some quote

controversial reforms in rural Manitoba

coming down the pike and rural Manitoba

is PC Heartland and then you're the guy

trying to sell to your Heartland some

health care reforms that may or may not

be so popular

Cameron Friesen went from finance

minister where he was very content to

Health Minister and he was frankly

surprised at that move so when you look

at possible contenders for this Rochelle

Squires who is in a still a very tight

race we haven't declared her elected yet

in real

she's the future of this party as well

Scott fielding who you see on the stage

right now the finance minister he's a

former Winnipeg city councillor he is

somebody that has leadership aspirations

this is a type one in Southdale 36 out

of 41 polls reporting a tight race

between the NDP and it's a lead change

since we last saw it

this is Southdale so Karen mish Kowski

is up by 20 votes 20 votes she's the new

Democrat up 20 votes over Audrey Gordon

of the PCs and we're almost all the

votes are in I mean this could go down

to the last poll maybe the right of

balance will be an issue with this war

certainly re-election but Southdale is

one of those bellwether writings that

the NDP when they have been in power

have one handedly this is going right

down to the wire and safe it's how we

want to cite to that saw some some

significant boundary changes Richard it

did but also it Nancy Allen who was the

former MLA for the NDP out there she was

door-knocking with the candidate the NDP

candidate that one there

Jamie Moses and Moses has been spending

a lot of time out there again 46% and

835 lead there

but Moses elected with 38 of the 42

polls reporting in st. Mattel and we're

just keeping an eye over there at PC

headquarters we'll get Brian Pallister

on TV or on the radio as soon as we see

is the clap for more years what did I

say I did they wouldn't miss that chance

for more years the caucus behind them

the cabman the caucus behind them that

are in Winnipeg

again Brian Pallister making his way up

to the podium shortly overall can I ask

did this play out how you expected it

would they make it yes it does for me

certainly on the top line the PCs and

the New Democrats that they I think

again I talked about checking things off

mission accomplished certainly for the

pcs at NDP the Liberals yeah obviously

they definitely be disappointed that

they don't have party status and I am

surprised to see that Manitoba seems to

have no interest doing what many other

provinces have done and get a green

person into the legislature so I guess

that's gonna have to wait another four

years well and and the Greens tried

really hard but in woolsley where they

had a real good chance last time around

redistribution affected that big time

the Liberals not getting party if there

was a good idea for I know James Bentham

is from Fort Rouge do you think it was a

good idea for him to run against the

deal leader that maybe better might have

wanted to find another writing I don't

know which other writing it they would

have been really I suppose if he was

gonna go somewhere else

yeah and that's where he should have run

but he didn't because again he's a bit

of a reluctant leader the Liberals at

three yes they gave they do not get

party status but they'll still claim

victory Dougal Lamont retaining his seat

and Saint Boniface is still something to

build on for him we heard Wahb canoe and

saying that yes we are the future he is

the future right now there's not going

to be any challenges for his job and

while the PCs are looking right now

leading and elected in 34 that's still

in historic Manitoba terms of very good

majority government for him and I

remember I think he made this comment

the day after the debates if you didn't

correct me but I think that you thought

that James betim really had trouble

connecting in the debate that he seemed

a little more professore II 'el it you

know he really wasn't a lot of the

criticism there was that he sounded

better on radio than he appeared on

television and I watched on TV I wasn't

listening to on radio and I thought he

just doesn't seem again think of the

federal leader Elizabeth May she's been

around for a while of course but she's

very popular personally because I just

think she connects with people in very

conversational informal way so Richard

why did they keep Alastair on such a

tight leash well because they didn't

want to make any real foe paws and I

talked to one insider that said

if we could have sent Brian Pallister to

Costa Rica for maybe two weeks of this

campaign they would have because I think

and I'll give credit to David McLaughlin

who ran this campaign he's a veteran

conservative insider that ran this

campaign and again this is a strategist

that says okay we're targeting our

ridings our specific ridings we're going

to get that vote out so when we look at

the advanced polling and all those boats

that come back we're going to see we're

gonna see those advanced polls come back

and they targeted this big time all

right there he is making his way up to

the podium Brian Pallister horse's wife

with him by his side you know I don't

have to all blind polisher is that his

wife must be as it just about it is tall

Thanks Brian's one of the tallest guys

I've ever met as a fact who's doesn't

play professional basketball

he did play basketball early on in his

career and will always cite that every

once in a while but for Brian Pallister

here is a man that's early on during the

former film and government here in

Manitoba in the 1990s he was you know on

the outside and he won cabinet and then

went to the federal politics and spent a

lot of time in federal politics and it

was essentially anointed leader of the

Manitoba Progressive Conservative when

no one wanted that job and built that

job big time and now he can say to

people in he he is a controversial

figure my way or the highway

but certainly they have won again with

Brian Pallister at the helm all right

high fives all around for Brian

Pallister

it's coming in for a second term as

Manitoba preview

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

hey thank you Manitoba Thank You

Manitoba thank you very much

as you know as in every election

Manitobans had a chance to make a

decision they made a choice whose have a

fail vote rush wha not backward forward

[Music]

forward forward to balanced budgets

forward to better care and sooner

forward to new schools for our children

and grandchildren forward to a stronger

economy for all of us and forward to

more affordability for families with

lower taxes and more money right on the

kitchen tables of Manitoba

Thank You Tsar in order I want to say

first of all thank you to all the

candidates all the supporters and to the

leaders of the other parties for making

democracy work for giving people choices

that's what democracy is all about

tonight they chose and those other

candidates for those other parties and

those other leaders deserve our thanks

and our congratulations for giving

people in Manitoba a chance to choose

I want to say a special thank you to our

whole campaign team and to David

McLaughlin and Tannis Drysdale for all

the work that they have thank you I want

to say a very heartfelt personal thank

you to all of the dedicated volunteers

we are the volunteer party thank you to

all the volunteers who worked on all our

campaigns right across the province and

I want to say a special thank you as

well to the best slate of candidates

that ever was presented to the people of

the province of Manitoba all the PC

candidates and their families thank you

for your dedication

and if you'll permit me I also want to

say thank you to our family to my family

to Esther's family for their support for

their love for their advice and counsel

and to our good friends who have stood

by us through thick and thin when we

were not as good of friends as we should

have been because this job is consuming

and I thank them and I thank them from

the bottom of my heart and I thank all

the friends across Manitoba of our MLAs

who will serve the people of Manitoba

with diligence and dignity and grace

thank you for your support and your love

and your kindness thank you so much if

you'd allow me I want to reflect for a

moment on twenty-seven years ago when we

had a one-year-old who's not one anymore

and we decided to get into politics

because our town was dying and we

accepted a challenge that many others

have as well of getting into public life

and Esther and I became empty nesters

this January and I don't like it but she

did all the work so she's fine with it

but this is the first campaign in my

political time of service that I've been

able to campaign alongside my wife

Esther and I want to say I thank God for

Esther and I thank Esther

but you all know and Manitobans

recognize that we inherited a mass of

responsibility some would call it a mess

but like the Manitoba bison that is in

our logo and that inspires us we are

accepting of those challenges the

Manitoba bison unlike most species when

faced with a challenge always turns and

faces toward it and we did that and

we've done that and we've done it with

focus we face our challenges together

Manitobans do that and today and tonight

they said they appreciated the fact that

we fixed the finances and we're

repairing the services and we're

rebuilding economy

there is absolutely no doubt that

Manitoba is now Canada's most improved

province

we are the Keystone province we are the

center of Canada we are no longer

Canada's best kept secret and next year

when we unite to celebrate our 150th

birthday our 150th birthday in the most

beautiful and blessed country on the

face of the earth are Canada we will

come together next year and we will come

together to honor our past but I assure

you ladies and gentlemen that we will

also come together to celebrate the

future of Manitobans worked with us all

hands on deck Manitobans have repaired

Manitoba's foundation and now Manitobans

and we will join with them in this will

rededicate themselves as we will

rededicate ourselves to building on that

renewed and strengthened foundation to

build the Manitoba of our dreams to

build the home of hope right here in

Manitoba to build the place where truly

Canada's heart beats Manitoba United

never backward like the Manitoba bison

always forward

the sky used to be dark but the clouds

will lift

perhaps not tomorrow or the day after

but they will lift and there will be a

new day and it will be a brighter day

and it will be under a blue sky and I

say to you because of your dedication

and because of the values that

Manitobans demonstrated today in

choosing forward the only thing better

than today in Manitoba is going to be

tomorrow

all right of notes no congratulations to

walk or do coke yeah oh I'm not a bit

odd or just a second I mean he did

congratulate all the candidates on the

ballot yes that is lop Canoe by

definition but you wouldn't say to your

opposition leader congratulations to the

opposition I look forward to seeing them

at the legislature you know I guess he

could take it or leave it but Richard

you were saying that these guys are the

the friendliest of fellows in any event

well but I'm always struck by not only

the words but the images and for our 680

CJ you'll be listeners Brian Pallister

at the podium

Heather Steffensen deputy premier kind

of tucked to behind him and then a lot

of older middle-aged MLAs behind him

with no women and very stark contrast to

the NDP headquarters where you had Wahb

canoe a young person indigenous people a

variety of people in that room and you

could make the argument that one

represents kind of the changing reality

of Manitoba they lost tonight versus

kind of the older Manitoba here in Brian

Pallister now that's a stretch to make

that analogy because there are a lot of

young Tories here as well and on that

stage there are a lot of women that

represent the Progressive Conservatives

but as far as images are concerned I

think David that does say something and

if you're a party insider you're going

to have to answer as to why those people

were behind Brian Pallister because

during the campaign he made sure he had

diversity behind him right and I can

tell you this anecdote as a matter of

fact this is something that that all

politics particularly white Pawlik white

male politicians are thinking about as

they campaign in a multicultural

multilingual diverse environment men

women in this case indigenous people we

want our politicians or our political

groups if you will to look like Canada

to look like the groups they're

representing in in legislature and I

think this clearly seem to be an

oversight it is all the cabinet minister

and it is all the caucus and they seem

to have just arranged themselves as

opposed to the normally it is quite

stage-managed we're going to make sure

we have as I say people from from from

all around and it did look different

than then wob there's a different energy

and you know I think that's something

that pcs have to be aware of I think

that you look at you know the party

pulls well Brian Pallister as an

individual does not and this is sort of

a testament to that I feel like a lot of

the same feathers are ruffled yeah I

mean just taking a look at one thing

when we talk about participation in our

political process we want more young

people to vote we want more women to

vote we want more women to run as

candidates that's if that's a real push

for a lot of political parties and we

want a digitus people to vote look at

the projected turnout right now and

objective turnout David Greenslade is in

that scrum right now at Progressive

Conservative Party headquarters at the

Canada ins that pull apart alright still

that's a live shot of the Big Blue Room

tonight in Manitoba you have decided and

Brian Pallister is serving a second term

as your premier a progressive

conservative majority government is the

result tonight we're waiting on

Pallister to finish up with this scrum

and hoping to turn around some clips

from that I think that that that speech

left people wanting maybe a little bit

more well clearly the reporters

definitely want some more I mean he had

some very nice things as saying again

it's not a throne speech we're looking

for but he did talk about the 150th

anniversary that is gonna be a big deal

for Manitoba obviously he wants to be

part of that but no hints on healthcare

reform no hints on when he might recall

the legislature in other words I'm gonna

assume he probably wants to wait out the

federal election now right so and that

election doesn't finish till October

21st so there'll be a lot more questions

for the premier tonight and tomorrow

okay some close races still in play your

time now is 1044 we're gonna go to Eric

Sorensen now he's standing by life

thought we should take another tour of

the maps of Manitoba here because I mean

this looks a little bit like we've seen

a lot in the past

the NDP coming back to win the four

northern ridings but if you look at

southern Manitoba you've got twenty-one

ridings outside of Winnipeg the

Conservatives have swept the table on

that one all the way down to Brandon

even Brandon where they want in Brandon

West which is not unusual but they want

Brandon East so they've won their two

terms in a row after 47 years in a row

where the NDP held that riding so that's

it that has to be a disappointment now

going over to Winnipeg itself you can

see that the the the Conservatives have

done pretty well in the areas you would

expect in the kind of the western part

of this the city all the way up to Mick

two Roblin the the new bigger riding out

here of course the Premier himself down

to Seine River on the north side this

will be as we said earlier a little bit

disappointing for the New Democrats if

they lose in Ross Muir it's not a done

deal yet there are a couple of close

races to look at as you were saying Lisa

let's look at those now first of all

South Dale Karen Mackowski has a 28 vote

lead over Audrey Gordon in South Dale

now

thirty-eight of the 41 polls are

reporting but 28 votes can be turned

around pretty quickly in McPhillips

there Shannon Martin you know you said

that hey he went from down south of the

city of course he lost his riding and

Morris he had to find somewhere to go

his musical chairs for some of those

ridings when they lost one of the rural

ridings in Manitoba to a Winnipeg so

Shannon Martin landed in McPhillips but

he has a very narrow lead still over

Greg McFarland just 70 votes and that

one's too close to call and we just

wanted to show you the Maples it's not

so close but it's not quite done yet

because only 21 of the thirty-six polls

are reporting and the reason for looking

at it in with min to Sanders lead it's a

lead of 330 it's pretty healthy but if

the Liberals were to have a chance to

win to get their fourth seat and

official party status this is where it

has to happen so it's a tall order but

that is the place where they would try

with a deep bra now the popular vote you

heard Wahb canoe talking about this he

emphasized it twice and I think what's

important here is first of all let's

start with the NDP they rose about five

points to 30.8 and the Liberals are

actually down for the moment a little

bit at thirteen point nine they now have

more than a two to one lead it was much

closer in 2016 there was thinking that

the greens would come through with a big

breakthrough well they have scored more

votes total in total this time around

even though it's a down election in

terms of voter turnout the Greens will

have I think at the end of the night a

record turnout but still six point three

percent and no seats that is a

disappointment for them the Liberals

have to be disappointed if they only end

up with three seats and only thirteen

point nine percent the big story though

has to be that the PCs themselves 48.4%

hey it was bigger in 2016 but there

hasn't been anything this big since 1977

when sterling lion won so to be able to

follow up 2016 with a showing of 48.4%

for the PCs that's a pretty good showing

for for the premier who is re-elected

back to you Lisa all right Eric Sorensen

welcome back let's check in one more

time with Julie Buckingham standing by

with our panel let's start to my left

Hal Anderson final thought you know what

Julie I'll just say this impressive

victory for the Tories tonight and what

has happened over the past three years

not necessarily a roadmap to re-election

but it happened and I think there was a

lot of courage shown by premier

Pallister the things he did not

necessarily popular but I think

necessary in the province

Shannon Sanford I think Bob who did a

fine job and maintaining the status quo

premier Pallister congratulations job

well done and we get to do this all

again tomorrow morning federally and I

wait Jenny mock : congratulations again

obviously Brian Pallister but to come

out with nearly 50% of the popular vote

again is a resounding mandate

notwithstanding you know wob canoes you

know jubilant concession speech I don't

think it was a great night for the NDP

and I think that we've shown that

Manitoba is you know looking forward to

all of the things that Brian Pallister

is promised in his mandate so we've had

decision Manitoba 2019 now we get set

for a federal election but first back to

the desk all right Julie thanks so much

for your work down there tonight into

the entire panel one more stop with Eric

Sorensen he's standing by as we wrap

things up here hey Lisa you know I think

one thing that does give I think

everyone pause is the voter turnout

you've talked it a little bit about that

earlier we don't have the final numbers

in but it's beginning to look like the

voter turnout may be down very close to

50 percent that would be an historic law

in modern Manitoba political history so

we'll have to see all those numbers come

but running have having this campaign as

it ran late in the summer after only

three years it's possible I heard a

chant that said three more years at the

Conservative headquarters but let's look

then at what the final standings look

like in our virtual legislature and you

can see it's not that different it's a

pretty good showing for the NDP they've

bumped their numbers up by about 50%

the Liberals have to be disappointed

that they only get three and they won't

have official party status sitting back

there

and those back benches but of course the

Conservatives have a very healthy

majority so it's a very good night for

Brian Pallister and the Progressive

Conservatives Lisa Eric thanks so much

tonight for that tonight Eric Sorenson

reporting there now let's go to the big

picture our gains and losses board make

sense of these numbers for everybody

before we head out tonight guys the

Progressive Conservatives leading and

elected in 36 still a historic at night

the NDP in the 18 the Liberals in 3 this

is one of those situations where it's

more like the Manitoba we're used to

when it comes to these three major

political parties disappointing night

for the Liberals losing party state yeah

a disappointing night for the Green

Party as well in a quick look at the

popular vote David akin that's right of

course Eric just ran through this and

49% almost 50% as our panel was just

saying that is terrific for the PCs 31%

for the NDP liberals unhappy at 14 and

the greens again I'm just saying

Manitoba's are just not where the rest

of the country is in getting excited

about the greens but overall turnout

though just around 50% though overall

turnout is projected to be 52% but we'll

have to wait for the final tally from

elections Manitoba so off not as much

off but certainly a bit off from 2016

all right now while this election has

finished up here in Manitoba another one

is just about to get underway tune in

tomorrow morning at nine o'clock for

special coverage of the federal writ

drop Donna Friesen will be joined by

David akin as we look ahead to decision

Canada quick turn around I'm just gonna

sleep under the desk and get up and or

into the federal election it's gonna be

a lot of fun all right thanks for being

with us everybody
