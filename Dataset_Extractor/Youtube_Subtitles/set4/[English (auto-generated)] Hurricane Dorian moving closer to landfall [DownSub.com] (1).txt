hurricane durian is moving ever closer

to land and it is gaining steam the

store storm is now considered a category

5 and expected to slam the Bahamas today

before moving on to the United States

Jackson Prosecco is live from Daytona

Beach Florida this morning and Jackson

it it really seems like this can still

go any number of ways for people on that

coast ya really can can't first of all

spare a thought for the folks in the

Bahamas because they're going to be

dealing with those category 5 conditions

for 16 to 18 hours as this thing

essentially stalls overtop of them

all the models suggest that after the

Bahamas it's going to take a sharp hook

to the north and essentially skirts the

coast of Florida but it's going to be a

very close shave we're talking a

distance of kilometers making a

difference between seeing

hurricane-force winds and rain on land

or not at all so people up and down the

coast still getting ready here in

Daytona Beach you can see all the

businesses along the boardwalk finish

their final preparations yesterday

boarding up and packing up and moving on

out here on the beach side a few folks

are still left behind enjoying the the

bigger surf and waves this morning as

the tide comes in but most tourists have

packed up and left they're moving on you

know the bottom line here Kansas people

are not taking any chances they're

writing this out as long as they can

because that forecast track starts to

firm up they're getting ready to move

out

vacua ssin orders for people like people

are being told to leave or for the most

part people obeying those in what about

the airport we talked yesterday about

Orlando's Airport closing is that still

the case yes I think this gives you a

sense of just how much things are in

flux here some of those evacuation

orders have actually been rescinded they

were supposed to come into effect this

morning others are going into effect

this morning but they're very limited

there just for outlying islands like the

one that we're on this one by the way

not under evacuation order yes but

really they're targeted to people who

might live in mobile homes for example

and Orlando's Airport closing well

that's now being delayed by a full day

to Monday night it was supposed to

happen tonight

the airport here in Daytona Beach is

supposed to shut down though at the end

of the day today after the last flight

and so far no plans to change that again

everyone just watching this very closely

as they try and figure out what exactly

to do

and for the people who are leaving do

you have any sense where they're going

at this point or is it just scatter as

far away from the coast as they can yeah

it's a mix there are emergency shelters

that have opened up and some of them are

fairly close to the coast but their

structures that people know can sustain

a hurricane so if you live in a mobile

home obviously you're gonna get to a

well-built concrete structure that just

makes common sense in other places

though further up the coast into the

Carolinas and Georgia where there's some

speculation the model suggests this

could still head people have simply

started reserving hotels a few hours

inland hoping to drive away stay there

in a nice well-built concrete structure

and then return once the storm has

passed

okay certainly still in flux thanks

Jackson that's Jackson prosecco who is

reporting live from Florida for us this

morning
