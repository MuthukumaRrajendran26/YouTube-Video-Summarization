the protest that took place on Sunday

shows if protests are peaceful rational

and orderly the police will not and have

no reason to intervene

farlan only begets violence is never a

solution

the police appealed to members of the

puppy to reject all forms of violence

and revert to peaceful and orderly

expression of speech but very often we

found that our warnings for deaf ears

and and that's why and a lot of people

will gather around and it's necessary

for us if at the time we need to use

force we will try our best to inform the

general public before we use that and

given the escalating escalating violence

and the kind of weapons being used by

the processor there there is a need for

our officers to escalate they they use

of force
