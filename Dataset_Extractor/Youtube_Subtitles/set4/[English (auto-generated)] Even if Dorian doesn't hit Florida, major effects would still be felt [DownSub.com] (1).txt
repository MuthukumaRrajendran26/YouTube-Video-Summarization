I would remind people as you're looking

at these forecasts you know a bump in

one direction or the other could have

really significant ramifications in

terms of impact if it bumps further east

that obviously is positive if it bumps

just a little west then you're looking

at really really significant impacts and

so don't make any assumptions remain

vigilant and be prepared we're going to

continue to monitor the situation here

in the state with fuel and traffic flows

and take action as it's necessary but

everyone should continue to monitor the

storm and follow the direction from your

local officials as many of you know as

of this morning the following counties

have issued mandatory evacuation orders

Brevard County starting on Sunday Martin

County has issued a partial and then a

number of counties have issued voluntary

evacuation orders Glades Henry Martin

Osceola Palm Beach st. Lucie obviously

those evacuation orders could change so

just continue to follow local updates

but remain prepared continue to make

preparations and you know we will hope

you know that the trend continues but

there is still significant chance of a

strike on the state of Florida if you

look at that cone anyone inside that

cone needs to be prepared and so you

know we're continuing to click on all

cylinders here and are gonna continue to

be to be monitoring the situation and

working with both our local and federal

partners and we do have FEMA has been

engaged with us from the beginning we

really appreciate that and we have time

to take some questions

two counties that have issued evacuation

notices are you doing anything to

enhance that evacuation lifting tolls or

you're going to monitor the traffic

flows and if the traffic becomes

abnormal then then we will we will take

needed action to alleviate that however

at this point we do not see any abnormal

traffic on the roadways and so so those

options are on the table and if need be

they can be exercised and when are you

worried that people are seeing the track

and just assume it'll think you don't

want to over-read these tracks I mean

because you can look at a little bit of

a movement to the west and then all of a

sudden we're looking at a much different

scenario if that were to come out say

later today but I also think that I

think what we've tried to do here is

just be very factual be very direct with

people you know we haven't tried to

overreact but we've also tried to you

know put out the information and explain

the risks and so I think the fact that

that we've taken that approach I think

people look and say okay it looks it

looks like it's been positive movement

but we're not out of the woods yet so I

think people are gonna probably still

understand you know that the

preparations need to be made and

understand even if it doesn't directly

strike Florida you know this is a big

powerful storm you're still looking at

really significant storm surge on the

east coast of Florida you're looking at

major flooding events in different parts

of the state and so the effects can

range but but you're still looking at

significant impacts even if the the

storm remains hugging the coast so so

just be vigilant listen to your local

officials follow the news and do what

you need to do to protect yourself and

your families

better yeah they've been we had the

trucks they were in all-night refueling

you're starting to get you know those

are now and moving to the gas stations

obviously as the track has shifted a

little bit I think you're just naturally

gonna see less people and say miami-dade

County waiting in line for gas and so

some of that will be I think taken care

of where what demand but but we had all

these things going all night we we did

the escorts as necessary so I think the

situation will likely be improved and

you know actually I I spoke with the

president about it last night and and

and he offered support we're not sure

that that's going to be necessary but

we've we've been working with with with

with the federal partners to see if

there was a need you know what we'd be

able to do for that well I think there's

a number of places I mean you know

there's places that aren't even on the

East Coast that have been flooding

already and so you know even if they get

outer bands of rain that's gonna be

problem you have places that that have

that have king tide that are already I

mean some of these docks people the the

waters already up to their docks and

then you have things like the st. Johns

River where if that gets heavy rainfall

so there's a lot of of spots around the

state that'll be affected by this even

if it does stay stay off the coast of

Florida

you know waves and tides and everything

is there concern about people going out

and you know go into the beach and

planning for I mean I think people

should listen to the to the local folks

about you know where those risks are but

I I think people who have covered these

things know you know when you have

storms approaching it creates waves that

attracts people because they want to do

that but that is hazardous and that's

very dangerous and so so people need to

heed the heed the warnings and if

there's you know any type of orders

issue with respect to that they should

certainly heed those because you know

that that could be very very hazardous

change I think it I think it focuses the

response and the preparations a little

bit more I mean we were here two days

ago and the cone covered almost the

entire state of Florida okay well we can

have generally I mean they can have

people in Fort Myers ready to go now

when it's as it shift eat as it shifts

East you know that means Southwest

Florida Northwest Florida you know the

chance of them being affected you know

the chances have gone down dramatically

and so that just makes us I think be

able to do more you know with the

resources that we have and so that's you

know part of this is I think the trend

was has been positive but part of it is

you know we do have more certainty now

today of the general direction of this

thing than we did 48 hours ago and I'll

tell you you know you're looking at some

of this stuff and there's gonna be more

data that comes out you can't you know

guarantee it's gonna do this or that you

know some of the trends have been

positive like I if I if I knew some of

these models were definitely the case

you know I'd feel a lot better but you

know some of them are right some of them

are wrong I mean those European

spaghetti plots are great right now they

all go into the end of the see well you

know they haven't necessarily been right

in the past on everything so so you got

to remain vigilant

director Moskowitz during the briefing

that was mentioned that Hurricane Andrew

was expected to make the same turn this

storm is expected to make but it didn't

does that give you pause well I think as

the governor just outlined right I mean

people need to be vigilant the Division

of Emergency Management is still doing

our job obviously there's a category

four storm off of our coast so you know

there's a lots of things that you stay

the course on but obviously you start to

make smart more targeted decisions like

the governor was talking about as things

start coming out of focus I mean just a

couple of days ago we were looking at a

worst case scenario with a category 4

hurricane coming across the peninsula

winding up in the Gulf and doing a

double impact into the Panhandle that's

no longer predicted right so those are

the scenarios you can take off the table

and the preparations you can take off

the table but at the end of day there's

still lots of things we have to do you

know just remind ourselves about

hurricane Matthew hugging the coast so

these are the things that we're

preparing for thanks
