we are seeking monetary damages for the

wrongful death of Brian and we are

seeking a court order requiring sheriff

dueling to immediately make changes to

make sure this type of thing never

happens again we have alleged that the

Hartman County Jail engaged in

unconstitutional practices in July of

2018 and we're concerned that they have

continued to engage in those practices

to this very day

Brian Lawler's death should never have

happened and would not have happened but

for these constitutional violations we

went there basically with the intention

of bailing Brian out and after meeting

with sheriff Doolin and bringing Brian

in to the meeting with us he convinced

us that that Brian had a problem and

that they would help him deal with it

and if we left him there I'll never

forget his exact words he looked me

right in the eyes and said I can promise

you this I'll keep personally keep an

eye out on Brian will take care of Brian

and the last thing he said was here

Brian will be safe I'm just I was in

shock and I'm just staring at Brian's

body and I took a picture of Brian and I

I texted it to chef Doolin and I said

remember when you told me that Brian

would be safe I believed you

and I said him that did he ever respond

to that he sent he sent Becca forward

response he said I'm sorry for your loss

we're a grieving family and we're

sticking together trying to help each

one get through each day and if we can

prevent another family from going

through what we have culture for the

past year

that's what we would like to see happen

this shouldn't have happened
