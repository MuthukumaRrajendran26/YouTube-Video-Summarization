a white pickup truck in this cellphone

video that's on your screen right now

that is the description of one of the

videos or one of the vehicles that was

hijacked from Odessa we do know that

there were shooting incidents in both

Midland and Odessa as far as initial

reports we know that there's at least

one innocent bystander dead at least ten

injured we have received reports that

there may there's a little bit of panic

going on at the Music City Mall in

Odessa what we're working to confirm

everything with officials right now

we've been in contact with the Midland

Police Department the Odessa Police

Department in the county Midland

District Attorney's Office and right now

we have a Melissa Hendricks peach our

news director and they know obviously I

was ready to grill today and watch a

little bit of football and not prepared

to come to work but it's one of those

days where you drop what you're doing

and get out here and help out we've got

room it only took a few minutes for me

to realize the severity of the situation

given the amount of phone calls that we

got the panic any people's voices right

and once I got a hold of DPS for the

first time the severity and everything

kind of settled in yeah just kind of

been in reaction mode since then yeah

national story right now we're getting

phone calls from all of our fellow

colleagues and family members so a lot

of us here have not had a chance to

respond to family members who are

worried about us because they're hearing

these reports and we are trying to get

in touch with them to let them know

we're okay and then also get them

updated on the information so but it's

one of those moments where everybody's

pitching in and getting the very latest

information out that we can while

helping to get that information to

family as well so let's update what we

have so far I know everybody has been

talking about this from beginning to end

but what we do know is that there was

the chase on i-20 right

drivers were heading westbound right it

appears that's where the initial shots

were fired disappeared that's where the

DPS officer was injured we do have

reports that he's in stable condition

and it appears that several people

bystanders may have finished

you

active threat in Midland that was the

latest information that we got from

Midland about 20 minutes ago so as far

as where the latest activity of possible

active shooter right now would we would

have to estimate that there might be

more threat in the Odessa area but that

doesn't mean that people in Midland

should go outside or start patrolling

around and trying to everybody right now

in Midland and Odessa needs to stay

inside that's the latest information

never tell you when they choke so about

how my hunties what I'll do is give a

very short opening statement I'll take a

few questions then I mean surely you

guys understand that this is a very

fluid situation that we're just we're

gonna have to get back to ok and

understand also that we will have

periodic updates this won't be it will

will keep you guys informed will make

sure everyone knows what's going on

well what a horrific day for Odessa

actor county in building Midland County

let's start at the beginning

situation started about 3:17 this

afternoon when a DPS trooper attempted

to stop a gold Honda when the DPS

troopers got the car stopped

he was then shot by the occupant of the

car the vehicle will continued westbound

into the city of Odessa and shot an

individual at I 20 in our West excuse me

Mary easily apparently the subject then

drove on our east loop to 42nd Street

where there are multiple scenes and

multiple victims at some point the

subject stole a mail truck ditched his

car and there were other victims after

that the victims in went eastbound back

on 42nd towards synergy which is a local

movie theater and at that point it was

contacted by law enforcement the

officers from the old Ethel Police

Department the Midland Police Department

the Texas Department of Public Safety

and then I'm sure others again this is a

very fluid changing situation so please

understand that what I'm telling you is

is not written in stone these these

facts these this knowledge can change

okay at that point this subject was

contacted by law enforcement and he an

exchange of gunfire happened and that

subjected deceased at that location we

have law enforcement injured we have the

DPS trooper in Midland County we have

one MPD officer and one OPD officer they

were struck as far as civilian

casualties we have at least 21 victims

21 shooting victims

at least five deceased at this point

I'll please understand that this is not

just a NOPD in a Midland Police

Department and a DPS thing both

Sheriff's Office Midland County

Sheriff's Office and Edgar County

Sheriff's Office was involved in the

hunt for this guy our local school

district Police Department our

University of the Texas of the Permian

Basin school excuse me police department

was involved this was a joint effort by

just a multitude of departments to find

this animal and bring him to justice at

this point I'll take questions right now

I'll tell you that he is a white male in

his mid 30s I don't have a positive

identification on him yet I have an idea

who he is so I won't release that

information until we're absolutely

positive we have we've had calls which

is to be expected because obviously our

citizens are a little jumpy after this

which is also to be expected but at once

this individual was taken out of the

picture there have been no more victims

there have been reports that that's

possible but again there have been new

no confirmations of that I can't I can't

tell you that right now and in you know

the big thing is it's so chaotic still

at the local hospitals that it's very

difficult to get that information

well again once we are able to compile a

list of victims names we can absolutely

put that out

sorry the hospital has set up area for

patients families Medical Center

Hospital has another area per patient

sandwich in the cafeteria and maybe

chocolate so we got reports of two

vehicles earlier today what I guess is

that not confirmed I think what the

issue with that was that you had the the

original vehicle and then you had the

mail truck at one point we didn't know

that that was the same person but that

is confirmed now same person

anything else obviously it was a gun at

this point I'm really not sure how did

the incidence again it started with this

traffic stop the attempted traffic stop

by the UPS you know I would I would tell

people to still be cautious still trying

to stay in their residences if all

possible we do believe that we have the

threat contained but I can't be 1000%

positive if that's the case at this

point no no absolutely I can't tell you

of a motive at this point I do not at

this point I don't know I would assume

that he's part of the victim list but

I'm not sure of his status not to my

knowledge

thank you guys I'm gonna go back to work

and we'll we will update you

periodically okay this is police turkey

inside if ger ke is Goerke Turkey yes

[Music]

John Alvarez testing one

two things

oh sorry chief john alvarez jo hn al VAR

e z fire chief odessa fire risky well so

far we've got 21 victims that were

transported to either medical center or

or MC we've also had some that were

transported to Midland Memorial Hospital

so that that's the cow at this point as

our our Pia public information officer

said that once we get that information

once we get the list then we'll be able

to put that information out to the

public to be able to reach out to the

loved ones somewhere yes for the most

part that we're going to shock victims

important unfortunately we did have the

count right now is five deceased

according to the the reports that I have

received so that's what we have at this

point that is my understanding I mean

I'm not not law enforcement but that's

that's the understanding that I have is

that it did move from Midland Odessa and

unfortunately we did have some

casualties here well it's too early to

say right now at this point but I can

tell you that right now is just you know

just shelter in place right now I'm sure

the the police department has sent out

that message to the community to make

sure that everybody's aware of what's

going on at this point that that count

we're just trying to figure that out at

this point but I can tell you that we've

notified Medical Center Hospital we've

also notified or that's a Regional

Medical Center and middle of Memorial

Hospital so we've also notify our

outlying communities such as Andrews

crane for any assistance we do have

Midland Fire Department here

that is assisting us they've had got

several units at our assistant that are

provided to us to assist Cistus with any

any thing that comes up ma'am I do not

know I do not know that as I'm not law

enforcement but all I can tell you that

we've had several casualties that we

transported we had several of our units

we to the point to where we had a call

for men the fire department to assist us

with some of our EMS runs out here thank

you thank you

okay well back here at the newsWest nine

studios we're just going through all

this information trying to kind of

digest it one of the yeah one of the

things that came out of the press

conference is that they are not sure

what kind of firearm was used so right

now we don't know what the shooter was

using I don't want to speak out of turn

obviously I'm caught up in the fluidity

of this situation when I was speaking

with DPS officials they told me that the

shooter had a rifle now that's from

that's not a désolée stai mean obviously

these law enforcement agencies all have

to speak with one another and confirm

information with one another but that

came directly from a DPS official that

we rely on for a lot of confirmed

information it was also in the heat of

the moment yeah but it's just not

confirmed right now but it appears he

told me that they were using a rifle

also really important to note that

whenever they're doing those press

conferences they're doing that as a

courtesy to the public to let them know

what's going on and get us updated

they're taking time during a very hectic

moment to give us the very latest

information that they have that he chief

Goerke was expressing concern about

giving information out that could

possibly change even what he was giving

exactly yeah and he painted a little bit

of a timeline that kind of cleared up

that to shooter situation for us still a

little bit of a questions about what was

going on with that white pickup truck

obviously there could have been

different descriptions maybe something

else happened would we just knew that we

did have reports at Cynergy that came

from police gurkey so but if you listen

to what he had to say he basically said

again as we had suspected that this all

started with a traffic stop just after

three o'clock

DPS officer tried to pull over a gold

Honda on i-20 that suspect that driver

firing shots hitting that DPS officer

and then taking off

I twenty-two East loop and then East

loop where he said another person was

shot in that area and then from East

Loop to 42nd Street where apparently

most of this chaos took place and that

kind of lines up with everything that we

heard from social media reports everyone

was what's going on at a Home Depot

what's going on at Twin Peaks such a

heavy police presence and from police

Goerke chief jerky he said multiple

shootings and multiple victims in that

area before he traveled to Midland and

then back east to synergy where he

appears to have been killed when that

trooper initially pulled the suspect

over in the gold Honda the suspect in

that gold Honda shot that trooper right

there and this is where the whole thing

started that vehicle went west

like you said East Loop 250 and traveled

to 42nd Street multiple victims there

and then multiple victims at Cynergy

again Odessa police

Ector County Sheriff's Midland police

Midland County Sheriff's School District

police even the colleges and the EC is

dmpd everybody is helping out with this

and something that's not uncommon to

this area but obviously given the scope

in the the gravity of this situation you

love to see that our officers are

pulling so able to work together in such

fluidity and another if you missed it in

the press conference he did identify the

suspect as a white male in his mid-30s I

found it interesting I don't know if you

caught it but he said that he had an

idea of who he might be

leads us to believe mate obviously we

don't make any assumptions or play the

gossip game but maybe this person was a

local he seemed to have I mean that's

just what I took away from it

considering that he said he might know

who he was that will obviously be

released in the near me in anything you

know they run plates and and find out

who it is it was true they just aren't

releasing any names but he did say that

he had an idea of who

that might be the suspect again that

suspect was shot and I think it's really

important to mention the victims in this

case because there are 21 victims shot

and at this time we don't know the names

of any of those victims they aren't

releasing those and one of the reasons I

think that they're not releasing those

as they said they're compiling a list of

names and of course next of kin and

things have to be notified if there is a

death involved we know 21 victims were

shot we don't know the severity of those

injuries but we do know that five people

right now are confirmed dead right

outside of those 21 Williams yep and

right now we do have some new sound we

have some breaking sound that just came

in to our newsroom from apparently a

witness to one of the shootings so we're

gonna go and take that sound bite for

you really quick police officers and

then there was police officers nearby

the area so as we were leaving that's

when we saw the the US postal van going

right as we passed the street and a

hydrated to be going east like towards

energy and they had behind energy they

had the road blocked he ran into a

police couple police officers and they

were shooting at the van when when they

came to a stop once I guess they got

nearby and they realized that he was he

was not alive is when they they pulled

him out of the Vans crazy and I just

never realized that we would have

experienced anything like that here in

our own community because everything we

were running and yet at the same time

you're looking out for your loved ones

making sure that they're behind you're a

close by you know your hearts going in a

hundred miles an hour thinking are we

going to get out of here alive it's it's

it's it was crazy it was it was scary it

was crazy

it was all hearts were racing and you

know so the husband I was I didn't know

we were gonna run out the front door and

get shot or run up the front door and be

safe obviously just a very scary

situation and kind of hear the fear in

her voice there

as they kind of she kind of laid out the

end to that a shooters life at Cynergy

where he appears to have been shot and

she was kind of there for that I

remember we spoke I spoke with when we

were kind of receiving all of these

phone calls and the really the heat of

the moment and everything was unfolding

we got a call from one of our sales

associates Simona who was at Cynergy as

well and she said SWAT had run into the

theatres and she you can I was trying I

had so many things to do and I didn't

want to obviously put her off as a

friend and a colleague I was trying to

confirm information but just hearing

that that that fear in her voice it's

just it's something that's it's tough to

deal with at times I mean anyways now

we're gonna go ahead and toss it over to

Lauren who has some reports from social

media for us that's right Dana I'm still

on social media just still looking at

y'all's tweets

still looking at that information that

you're wanting to know from us or maybe

hear if you've missed it but like we

said we the press conference has

confirmed that five are dead and 21 have

been injured but of the of those five

I've actually come across a tweet we

cannot confirm this information this was

not confirmed in the press conference

Danielle lei has said mail carriers

whose vehicle was stolen is dead they

did confirm that that mail carriers

vehicle was stolen but she's saying that

the mail carrier is dead my husband

works for USPS and he has confirmed it

it was a young lady that was just tragic

um do you all know where that mail

carrier was when it was stolen at the

time we believe it was out of Odessa at

this time we're not sure exact

we know that the vehicle went west on

i-20 and according to chief Goerke

headed down east loop you know Desa to

42nd Street was at some point and that

movement of the suspect that he

abandoned his gold Honda and then stole

that mail truck

yeah as you can see on her screen right

now we've got some of our local

officials I've seen Brooks Landgraf this

is Jerry Morales and we obviously had

the statement from governor

just a few moments ago who are all

expressing their condolences and asking

the public to remain safe and you know

please stay away from going outside

tonight just stay at home that's been

the message all along since this all

started at about three o'clock and now

we're actually going to go ahead and

toss two Tate

Owen who's still at the Medical Center

Hospital and she's going to give us a

little bit of an update from out there

so Tate what do you have for us

yeah thank you so you'll have a care in

Medical Center hospital in Odessa

keeping an eye on the situation as it

unfolds and you know we're actually not

seen as many ambulances arrive as we

would expect to see with a situation

like this now we do have reports that

are confirmed five people are dead

including in Midland police officer

Odessa police officer and a state

trooper again we do have confirmed

reports that 21 people are also injured

so if I step out of the scene for you

just a little bit so you can take a look

at what we've been looking at you can

see that there is an ambulance right

here now he's getting ready to leave the

premises as we're speaking

[Music]

so again as this situation unfolds I

will keep you updated I'm going to stay

out here at the hospital and watch

things and all nothing you

thank stating just for some clarity I

know she's got a lot going on out there

at the hospital as a she continues to

try and compile the latest information

for us it kind of sounded like she said

that five people were dead and that

included the Midland Police Department

officer Odessa Police Department and DPS

officer that doesn't appear to be the

case according to the police chief

querque we don't believe any of the

officers and I'm getting a little I'm

getting a social media report this is of

course unconfirmed all social media

reports are but we are getting a social

media report about an area on i-20 from

Jay jbs Parkway that there are trucks

out there and lots of blood on the road

and it appears to be an oilfield sand

truck so lots of reports like that

coming in where folks are out and about

and may not be aware of what's going on

and coming across these scenes and again

we if you if you have relatives that are

out and maybe running errands and may

not be aware you might just kind of

check on them or ask them to you know

stay stay put for just a little bit

while law enforcement is working a very

difficult situation yeah and you know a

little bit removed now from the police

conferences I guess if just in case

you're just tuning in we should probably

go ahead and run through the facts of

the case as of right now although we

started with a active shooter threat

appears that threat is over here in the

Permian Basin that's the latest from

police chief Odessa police chief mr.

jerky he says the suspect has been

killed we do know that 21 victims were

shot we know that five are dead we know

this all started with a traffic stop

which it appears to have taken place and

I believe Midland County off i-20 and

then that's where that off that's where

that suspect during that traffic stop

just shot at a DPS officer the traffic

stop was being conducted by DPS shot the

officer and then possibly shot maybe a

civilian there

we know that of the 21 we haven't

confirmed how many were shot in each

since incident but after that incident

after that traffic stop he fled the

scene fled to Odessa shot somebody at I

20 in East loop and then took east loop

to 42nd Street where we got all of those

reports we got all of those phone calls

about so many different shootings kind

of unraveling there and by the Twin

Peaks by the Walmart by that very

popular reports of multiple yeah it

comes there yeah very popular shopping

area we got reports that UTPB had been

placed on lockdown and think all of that

kind of work together in that situation

and after those string of shootings what

appears to be he then fled back to

Midland and at some point excuse me I'm

getting ahead of myself at some point he

hijacks a mail van right flees back to

Midland shoots a middling officer and

possibly more victims and then heads

east to synergy and that appears to

where this all came to an end and dps

and as we mentioned all officers on

Midland County Sheriff's Office Midland

Police Department after County nearly

every local agency kind of came together

converged onto the suspect and were able

to shoot and kill that suspect we know

that suspect is chief Goerke says is a

white male in his mid 30s

we know that chief gurkey says that he

believes he knows who the suspect is and

has him identified but they are not

releasing any names at this point until

they are completely sure and have that

information confirmed we'll get you that

information as soon as we have it

confirmed and we will let you know more

importantly we will get you the names of

the victims as soon as we know they are

compiling a list of those victims we

know 21 victims so at this point we know

that five are dead you know an

interesting thing that we don't know yet

is they have not said exactly what fire

what type of firearm was used and they

have not said why that gold Honda was

pulled over initially we don't

no it's so far they're just no reports

of that so we are working on getting you

that information we have a newsroom that

is full of people right now and support

coming from all of our stations across

the state of Texas to help us out with

this story so we will keep you updated

on digital and social media as well as

here on the air right and I do have a

new statement from President Trump on

Twitter as we remain kind of in the

focus of all of the nation at this time

given the horrific nature and the

gravity of this situation president

Trump has tweeted and I'll quote just

briefed by Attorney General about

shootings in Texas FBI and law

enforcement is fully engaged more to

follow and again we already know that

Governor Abbott to help brief

I guess federal officials and local law

enforcement and kind of try to move

forward from this tragedy you know you

know Melissa it's not something that I

really wanted to talk about but

obviously I think if you if you follow

newsWest nine you know I was in El Paso

and I shot I saw that community that had

to rally together and I didn't think

that I would have to report on something

like this again so soon it's just it's

it's so it's so painful because you know

we just look at the numbers right now as

we try to bring you the latest

information we know that 21 people are

affected we know that five are dead we

know that 21 those 21 people branch out

and the families and friends and that

make up our community and obviously we

don't know the condition of those people

that are hurt and whether how many will

survive and how many we could end up

with more and just the loss of life at

just it's something that senseless it's

senseless senseless and yeah this is

something that no communities is

prepared to deal with but certainly

something that you never expect

happen to you and you hear so many times

people saying that whenever gun violence

is going on and you know lots of finger

pointing and the bottom line is that you

know we've got the bottom line on today

and saving lives that unless we need to

remember them correctly we need to mourn

them this gives the community a chance

to to come together in in tragedy and

hopefully eventually send a message to

these people of violence that that they

won't it's just it's just so tough to

come here yeah and and at this point

again you know hang on to your loved

ones tell them to stay inside tonight an

extra prayer for those victims certainly

for the victims and we'll we're hoping

that we don't get any more reports of

any more victims 21 right now five dead

is that tragic no idea why do you month

oh yeah no idea what sort of injuries

but we do know that that 17 month old

that's just under two years old a little

toddler shot in the face from what we

understand and is heading out to

University Medical Center in Lubbock for

hopefully the best care that we can

possibly get that child so keep in mind

that it's important to stay out of the

way of officers who are trying to work

these scenes it's important to let them

do their work and do their jobs so that

if there is a second suspect they'll

find them at this point they've not

indicated that there was anyone else

involved they believe there is only one

individual that was causing all of this

chaos we believe that's a white male

mid-30s they believe they know who this

white male is and and one thing I wanted

to touch on you kind of mentioned that

there is they don't believe there's

another threat out there right now they

believe that one suspect was the case

and one suspect has been killed but we

have gotten reports of the Odessa City

Mall we've gotten reports of the Midland

the Midland mall and police chief Goerke

addressed that he said you know these

calls are ok if you're frightened

they're for you if you feel something

might be miss out of place please call

let us look into it let us have our

officers respond to it let's prevent any

other violence from happening he

understands people are a little jumpy

and he understands you know given the

nature of this case that people are a

little on edge so remain vigilant remain

aware of your surroundings but as of

right now many places rightfully so went

on lockdown and I know we had a bureau

reporter out at the Ector County

Coliseum they locked down that Ector

County Coliseum he was inside he said

there was nothing there that was out of

the ordinary and that they did take them

off lockdown but kept that heavy law

enforcement presence just outside of the

gates to make sure that everybody was

safe inside so again law enforcement

taking extra precautions to keep people

safe we know that Music City Mall was

also an area that they were concerned

about to get inside make sure that you

know that the folks that were inside of

the mall were ok and at this point we

don't have specific details but I

believe many of those folks out there in

the mall were evacuated as well so just

taking those extra precautions and

making sure any times a situation like

this take every precaution necessary

it's always better to be safe than sorry

now right now we do have another sound

bite that's come in from a witness to

these shootings we're going to go ahead

and let you here pick up here went into

the Coliseum just trying trying to get

to safety because there were you know

groomers those factors that the shooters

in the area of course that's all been

confirmed now so a lot of people just

taken shelter inside the Coliseum

there's there's a mother kind of running

out towards the Midway where the rides

are and whatnot saying he was going

after her daughter oh my gosh she had to

get her daughter and I was testing

everybody into a little little frantic

situation

right there but she got her daughter and

after that I had a few people came

running in the Coliseum heavy law

enforcement presence on the premises

still and I would imagine though

continued to be the case

still okay well we are getting some new

information into the newsroom at this

time we do know that there are some

events going on in the Permian Basin

right now and Caribbean Basin Fair which

is there at the Ector County Coliseum is

still going on as is being reported from

one of our reporters but the crowds are

very thin and really you're not

recommended to go out there if you had

plans to go out there go out another

night maybe reschedule it for another

time because tonight is just you don't

want to be on the roads there are still

investigations there are still police

presences out there you don't want to

get involved with that and our other

reporter was able to inform us that

summer mummers has also been cancelled

for tonight so you know sure you can get

a rain check on those tickets it's a

great event

everybody loves summer mummers but not

tonight I'm getting in I'm getting an

unconfirmed report that is an update on

the Midland police officer who was shot

this unconfirmed report says that he is

out of surgery and is in stable

condition now this again is very

unconverted be very good news very good

news and any other reports that we have

coming in we actually have a breaking

report right now I don't want to

interrupt you but we are going to have a

press conference from the Medical Center

hospital with Tate so let's go ahead and

hear the latest from what's going on

there maybe we can find out what's going

on with all those victims that we know

we're affected

secured them we're taking care of them

while taking in all these people at the

same time pace you're just joining us we

we are covering a very difficult event

here in the Permian Basin DPS trooper

tried to pull over a gold Honda this all

started with this one car being pulled

over when that DPS trooper tried to pull

that Honda over that driver of that

Honda shot that DPS trooper that vehicle

been traveled down east loop in to

Odessa on 42nd Street multiple victims

there where he stole a postal van and

took off believed going to back to

Midland shot of what we believe was a

Midland officer maybe some more victims

we don't really know about I mean we're

trying to we do we're doing the numbers

as we get them we know 21 victims we

know 14 and medical center house but we

know one was airlifted and we know the

dot the officers know we don't know

exactly how many people were shot and

what sitting you know what that case may

be but well obviously paint that picture

after going to Midland though went back

to Odessa and to the synergy there and

again multiple victim we do have

something in those various locations we

want to go ahead and we know we have a

lot of college students in the area and

a lot of this craziness was taking place

at that Twin Peaks in that 42nd and

University area

so UTPB they had issued a lockdown of

their campus so right now we just got

this tweet from the University of Texas

of the Permian Basin that's asking

students and I'll read and quote if you

are on campus resident we will be

verifying that you are okay if you live

in the RDH your Ras or hall director

will be checking with you if you live in

apartments please come to the Parker

ranch house at 6:30 to check in

obviously just want to make sure that

all of their students are okay and that

everyone is accounted for we are getting

messages speaking of social media though

I don't want to interrupt you we do have

Victor Blanco on deck who's been wanting

to share with us some of what's going on

in social media he's definitely the most

in touch and into a guy that we have so

Victor what's going on in the social

media world Thank You Dana thousands of

people are reaching out to address what

is happening including including our

president ret president Trump reached

out to said he has received a brief on

what is happening as well as local

government you can see behind me here we

have President Trump we tweeted about it

saying that he was addressed by general

bar about the shootings in Texas as well

as other law enforcement agencies that

are engaging I'd also like to share with

you some tweets from local government we

had J Ross lacy tweeted out prayers for

both communities of Midland and Odessa

this is truly a tragedy and of course

representative brooks Landgraf he

reached out to say the tragic situation

unfolding in Odessa is serious please

stay in your homes I've been in contact

with DPS officials speaker and

government governor and we are working

to help in any way possible but in the

meantime he's asking that you pray for

these victims and again you're not alone

there are grief counselors out there but

if you're not able to make it to them

and you just need to speak with somebody

please feel free to reach out on social

media our newsroom phone number line is

online you can reach out anytime let's

go ahead and toss things back over to

you Dana and Melissa thanks thanks

Victor

we just found out that Medical Center

Hospital is gonna have another briefing

it's about 7:45 about an hour from now

so there they will continue to to update

us on what's happening there they're

treating 14 victims from the shooting

right now the total in all is 20

one victims with five of those already

confirmed to be dead we know that a 17

month old was transported to University

Medical Center Hospital in Lubbock and

is going to be treated there our

thoughts and our prayers are going out

to all of the families involved and

again recapping a traffic stop for

reasons right now that we do not know

Goldin we don't even know why he was

pulled over it's still another big

question gold Honda's DPS trooper wasn't

was he speeding was driving recklessly

to get pulled over just so many

unanswered questions obviously those

will unfold in the investigations to

come but speaking of the Medical Center

hospital we're gonna go in toss things

back out to Tate Owens and she has a

another update for us from the hospital

all right yeah so I am out here at MCH

and I'm talking with some people out

here they're all bystanders just kind of

taking a look at the situation and

really trying to take it in for what it

is now we just heard from a hospital

official they told us that it is

definitely a scary situation that's

unfolded he said that if you're able to

hear his voice or I guess my voice at

this point that you should hug your

loved ones and be thankful that you're

here now he said that the town

definitely needs prayers they do have

grief counselors inside the hospital at

the time to help the families kind of

cope with everything that's been going

on so again he did tell us that there

are 14 people here at MCH that are being

treated now like I said earlier there

were people that were transported out of

the hospital to make room for those more

critical patients that was what we heard

from Medical Center officials now again

we've been told that the blood supplies

are good they're not needing any blood

or anything right now the hospital is

stable but it is on lockdown now he said

that was for the safety of both the

hospital officials and the patient so

that is what is happening right now I'm

gonna step out of the way just a little

bit so that you can get a good look at

the scene now the hospital official also

said that information is coming in wave

so he's going to continue to update us

as information comes available now

victims started being brought in

approximately around 4 p.m. at this

particular hospital he also mentioned

that they're pretty much

pasady so they can't really handle any

more patients if any more need to

brought in he couldn't say whether or

not they're aware victims at other local

hospitals at the time but we do have by

people that were confirmed dead and 21

injured so we do know that they have to

be at other locations just kind of by

trial of elimination now of those people

dead we do know that it for sure has to

included a Midland Police Department

officer Odessa Police Department and a

state trooper so just keep in mind how

serious the situation is the hospital is

going to provide us more information at

7:45 this evening and as we get more

information of course we'll continue to

update you so just go ahead and stay

tuned with us at newsWest 9 I'm going to

send it back to you guys in the studio

that you

get everybody accounted for at this time

let's go ahead and throw things back

over to you Dana and Melissa Thank You

Victor so thanks Victor as we continue

to compile this information I think

every time every few minutes we should

probably just try to relay what happened

as we learn about it and we kind of

digest it I'll go ahead and go through

the facts of what we know in this case

and again it all started at just after

three o'clock a traffic stop in Midland

County by a DPS officer on i-20 that

traffic stop led to the driver shooting

at the DPS officer which then struck

that DPS officer he was injured but in

stable condition the the scene then goes

the that driver then fled the fled the

area went west on i-20 ended up at about

the East loop in i-20 shot another

person according to police and then

headed east towards 42nd Street that's

where a lot a majority of this mayhem

took place we're told that there were

multiple shooting scenes multiple

victims and that's also where police

have said he hijacked a mail van took

that mail van back to Midland they're in

Midland apparently shot a Midland police

officer and then headed back east and

again this is where it all kind of comes

to an end by reports of police that he

made it to about the synergy the Odessa

synergy and that's where so many local

law enforcement agencies were able to

converge on this suspect get him pulled

over get him stopped in his vehicle and

at some point exchanged gunfire killing

that suspect who has been identified as

a white man in his 30s some of the

things that we're still unaware of or

how many people were shot in each

location and the gun that he used the

firearm again I spoke with DPS in the

heat of the moment they told me that it

was a rifle we don't know what kind of

type of rifle or what kind of

and really anything else about the

firearm other than the speculation that

that DPS officer in the heat of the

moment mentioned that it was a rifle

we know 21 victims right now I believe

chief gurkey said that those victims

were shot but we do not have any sort of

idea of the severity of the victims and

the no no indication right now about

we're working right now to to get that

information and we know that out of

those 21 victims that were shot one was

a DPS officer one was a Midland Police

Department officer and one was an OPD

officer five people are dead now from

this shooting rampage and we know that

14 of these people are being treated at

Medical Center Hospital again all with

varying conditions varying conditions

and Medical Center Hospital is compiling

a list of names of those victims and

hopefully we'll get some more

information for you on those victims

Medical Center hospital did say that

they would have another press conference

in about an hour at 7:45 I think it's

about an hour from now and so we hope to

bring you some more information and of

course we are tracking all of this

information on social media and we are

you can get information on our web page

any anything that we can get you that

comes into our newsroom we have an

entire team and they're working on this

right now so information is still coming

in and again we've gotten a flood of

information we try to confirm everything

that we can with officials obviously

you've seen the press conference making

sure you know even chief Jerky's

information said could change so just

know that what we are giving you is the

best information that we have so this is

what we know right right this is very

fluid what we know one shooter is what

it appears to be chief gurkey stands by

that statement one shooter stole started

with a traffic stop shot a DPS officer

stole a mail van shot multiple people

within

within Midland we have 21 victims as of

right now five people are dead of those

victims don't know the gun man that was

arrested as a white male in his 30s and

he is dead killed by officers at what

appears to be synergy indeed chief

Goerke said though that they they didn't

have any shootings after that suspect

was caught so some good news there that

day be contained you know nervous calls

jumpy calls people something's going on

people are nervous and which is

perfectly understandable and they

respect those calls and they enjoy they

don't enjoy those hoses long term but

they appreciate those calls because they

they want to make sure everyone's safe

and they take every precaution but as of

right now like you said no other victims

and it doesn't appear to be an active

threat now we do have some new video

coming in this is from within Twin Peaks

I haven't seen it so if you were aware

okay is this is this raw video this is

raw video from a shot by a viewer yes

okay

[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

in this video that appears to be looped

you can see the officers and heavy

artillery with their armored Iran and

their helmets and assault rifles in hand

a scary situation for anyone obviously

eating at that restaurant we did get

reports that that suspect went up went

east on the east loop and at 42nd Street

there was a really a scene of mayhem

where there were multiple shootings and

multiple victims

obviously officers responding with all

force needed right there in that

situation just it's scary to watch I

mean you have to have the utmost respect

for our officers who are willing to put

themselves in harm's way anytime their

duty is called and heavy artillery every

every heavy firearms armored gear just

ready to take on what appeared to be a

very dangerous situation now it didn't

get resolved there that suspect was

obviously able to make his way to

Midland according to chief Gerke and

then make his way back east to synergy

where that's where he finally ran into

that final road stop of local

authorities who were not going to let

him take this dangerous situation one

step further and lots of unconfirmed

reports coming in right now about what's

happening with surgeries and with law

enforcement surgeries and saving lives

out there so hats off to our medical

staff here in the area who taking care

of these these victims they are trained

for this and they do trained throughout

the year for active shooter type

situations or for situations where

multiple victims are coming in at one

time so they're really being put to the

test today because it's it's a difficult

time can't stress enough that we do know

that the suspect is no more shootings

after that suspect was taken down by

police but we are encouraging everybody

and law enforcement is is asking you to

stay out of the way of their work and to

stay home while they make sure that this

situation is

is under control like you said cook cook

a home-cooked meal staying with the

family hug your hug your loved ones stay

close with everyone tonight and just say

a prayer for the victims obviously we

have quite a few victims and like I can

kind of mention before from my

experience in El Paso you see how

quickly that branches out into a

community with 21 victims there will be

friends there'll be family there'll be

friends of friends and obviously we'll

have more stories we'll identify them

and remember them and mourn them and we

can expect those kind of things to

happen in the near future as we learn

more about who those people were and how

their lives were tragically cut short

right now we have another look at the

screen we're going to cut to that this

is a look at Cynergy this was the scene

we obviously have told you that that

shooters life the active shooter threat

came to an end

nearby that synergy so you can see just

how many law enforcement officers are

there heavy police presence from Odessa

DPS I'm sure there's Midland Department

I mean just in that small little frame

of maybe 20 yards we see about 30

vehicles there Oh

law enforcement has in the area has

pitched in to help out we know that we

have Odessa police department the Ector

County Sheriff's Department Mill and PD

the Midland County Sheriff's Department

and even the MISD and Ector County

Independent School District Police as

well as the colleges here in the area

with their police patrols are helping

out so a very good show of support and

teamwork amongst law enforcement here in

the Permian Basin to handle this

situation for everybody which is so

important because given the proximity of

Midland and Odessa and the the fact that

the suspect was racing from one city to

the other without that kind of

communication with that cut now that

kind of fluid response there could have

been a lot more danger that could have

been a lot more damage not to not to

understate anything that's happened here

but obviously you have to be thankful

for the police's response and how they

were able to kind of converge and end

this situation

dangerous situation for everyone

involved absolutely well at this time we

have been on air now for about two hours

we want to continue to broadcast to you

ahead and take things back over to Dana

thank you so much thank you Victor and

as we continue our digital coverage here

obviously just a very scary situation

that unfolded in our community again

this all started at just about after 3

o'clock where a traffic stop led to a

shooting to a of a DPS officer now at

this time I'm gonna go and give you all

the details that we do and don't know as

I break down this timeline we know the

traffic stop happened just again after 3

o'clock about 3:17 a gold Honda was

pulled over we don't know why the car

was pulled over but that driver opened

fire hitting the DPS officer and then

took off he then drove west on i-20 to I

to the east loop is what we're told by

police chief Goerke where he shot

another person at that time and then got

went ahead and went east on the loop to

42nd Street and this is really where all

the mayhem that were told unfolded we're

told there were several shootings

several victims and at some point this

man left that gold Honda behind and then

hijacked a federal mail van and then

took that mail van back to Midland I'm

not sure if he was eluding authorities

or if they had caught up to him at this

point but he shot a police officer in

Midland and then headed east where he

was stopped at about the synergy right

there on 151 we've seen plenty of cell

phone video we'll take some of it here

in just a moment to show you some of the

scene that we saw out there when they

surrounded that van which ultimately led

to this demise that we're told that that

shooter exchanged gunfire with police

and they were able to kill him in his

van now going over the victims we were

told that there were 21 victims total

were told that 5 people are dead of

those victims we're told that one

Midland police officer one Odessa police

officer and one DPS officer were injured

they all appear to be recovering in

surgery some of those reports are

unconfirmed but we don't we did get a

official report that the DPS officer

officer was stable

again the suspect has been identified by

police as a white male in his 30s we

don't know exactly what kind of gun he

was using at in the heat of the moment

as I was speaking with officials and all

of this was taking place

DPS officials did tell me that he was

armed with a rifle

now since since the shooter was killed

police have said that there have been no

other victims confirmed there have been

some reports of some suspicious activity

at we've heard the Music City Mall in

Odessa the Midland mall the Ector County

Coliseum obviously people on edge people

a little jumpy and the police chief

Goerke said you know this is fine

calling these reports we appreciate them

we want to make sure we take every

precaution but they have investigated

they have been working through them and

as of right now we have no other active

threats reported in the Permian Basin

but still I think it goes without saying

in the community tonight you're asked to

just stay inside cook a home-cooked meal

stay with your family you know embrace

your loved ones say a prayer for the

victims

obviously there are 21 family there are

they're friends of their friends and

family of 21 people who are going to be

in a very sad and tragic place tonight

so here at newsWest 9 we extend our

condolences and we hope the community

will come together and embrace these

victims and hopefully as we move forward

mourn them in the proper way as for

those 21 victims we we as of right now

we are told that you know 14 of them are

at Medical Center Hospital continuing to

receive treatment all of their

are varied we do note

the Medical Center Hospital what we just

heard in the latest press conference

that it is on lockdown as of right now

so if you have some sort of medical

situation tonight you might want to have

to find another place to go because for

the safety of those victims and for the

safety of the staff that hospital

remains on lockdown as of right now

we're gonna go ahead and toss things

over to our social media guru Victor

Blanco who's been checking in on social

media and he's also with Anthony France

Dana I just wanted to take this moment

while we aren't talking about people

reaching out and helping out right if

it's not life-threatening there is a

Facebook people are reaching out for the

Odessa shooting and the Midland shooting

offering help offering food offering

water right so any and all help is

definitely necessary and also very

appreciated if you can do so something

that is when we have a tragedy like this

is coming together it's something that

we really need to do it's very important

and it's not an exactly an emergency

maybe you're just scared I want to check

in with people right you know the

emergency services are gonna be

incredibly busy so please check in with

someone checking on Facebook checking on

Twitter just let someone know you are

okay again at UTPB they are holding

they've they've tweeted out several

areas that you can go to they're holding

little get-togethers and gatherings for

food if you just need shelter or

anything of that sort and we are

continuing to receive an outpour online

of just it's yeah it's overwhelmed

gotten so much in here it's overwhelming

how much people were coming together

right now already and we just need to

continue to do that for other 21 victims

here and at least the five that have

died today in this senseless shooting so

you want to talk about Brooks addressed

again there you can see all of our local

officials have been reaching out to you

know send their condolences

representative Landgraf is one of them

here saying the tragic situation

unfolding in Odessa is serious

please stay in your homes he has said

he's spoken with DPS officials the

speaker and the governor governor Abbott

who said he will be coming to make a

visit tomorrow and that they will be

working in to help in any way possible

and again

asking for those prayers for the victims

for the law-enforcement for anyone

involved and again just make sure you're

checking in with your own family in the

area check in online make sure everyone

knows where you are and that you are

safe in this trying time we'll continue

to monitor social media if anything any

updates come there we will we'll let you

know Dana back to you yeah thanks Victor

so as we continue to break down the

information that we've received we just

want to kind of go through over and over

for you guys

for those who are just tuning in as we

kind of move forward you mentioned

Victor and Anthony about the outpouring

of support that social media has seen

from across the country I can speak from

my experience in El Paso I won't get

into too much but it's at times like

this that communities have to pull

together in order to remember one

another in the bonds that we have and

remember the victims and mourn the

victims moving forward we're gonna go

and show you some video right here this

is a scene outside of synergy where that

suspects life was apparently ended

before he killed five people and injured

another 21 in the shooting now police

chief Goerke tells us that the suspect

ended up at Cynergy after well it

appears to be a wild ride of shooting

and hijacking cars it started with a

traffic stop where if he shot that DPS

officer and then made his way eventually

to 42nd Street near Twin Peaks where

several other shootings took place and

then before going to Midland and then

coming back east to synergy where we

take you right now with this video as

you can see the crime scene kind of

setup and obviously just in that little

10 15 yards of the camera shot you can

see how many police vehicles converged

I'm sure there's many more around the

area in that area this is obviously all

blocked off and locked off and still

under investigation so I think the

message tonight is uh as you can see

right here from heavy police presence in

investigations given the nature of this

incident that traveled all throughout

Midland and Odessa there's gonna be a

lot of police presence there's gonna be

a lot of investigations there's gonna be

a lot of police activity tonight

that's why local authorities are asking

you to just stay inside tonight stay

inside tonight and protect yourself

embrace your loved ones and most

importantly you know allow police to

finish securing the scene and finish

their investigation and to operate doing

the things that they need to do to

compete to keep this community safe

right now we're gonna go to some sound

that we have sent to our newsroom from a

witness to one of the scenes of the

shooting psynergy was surrounded by

police officers and then there was

police officers nearby the area so as we

were leaving that's when we saw the the

US postal van going right as we passed

in the street and a high rate at the be

going east like towards energy and they

had behind psynergy they had the road

blocked he ran into a police couple

police officers and they were shooting

at the van when when it came to a stop

once I guess they got nearby and they

realized that he was he was not alive

it's when they they pulled him out of

the Vans crazy and I just never realized

that we would have experienced anything

like that here in our own community does

Coliseum there's there's a mother kind

of running out porch down towards the

Midway where the rods are and whatnot

was in everybody into a little little

frantic situation right there but she

got her daughter and a couple other

people came running into the Coliseum

Kevi law enforcement presence on the

premises still and I would imagine that

will continue to be the case still yeah

we continue to cover this story here

where five people have unfortunately

passed away 21 injured in this senseless

shooting tonight or this evening yes in

fact our very own Sammy was right there

been sad scene right there too yes as we

all mourn the loss of at least five and

21 others that were injured yeah this is

not much else to say about it I'm

Twitter so many people from around the

country around the world are talking

about midland-odessa right now just a

national story that's unfortunately you

don't always think that this is gonna

happen where you live and that sounds

cliche and people always say it but it's

true I was just watching college

football today and I saw messages keep

streaming into our Facebook feed about

shootings and I couldn't believe it and

it's just hard to believe that this

happens here

yeah I live right next to synergy and I

heard the gunshots from from my

apartment and I ran down there to see

what was going on didn't know the

situation at the moment but basically

saw it unravel as it happened and it was

just tough to be there it's tough now

knowing what we know

senator Koren just tweeted out he said

that tonight we are with the entire

midland-odessa community especially the

victims of this horrific tragedy he

wants to thank law enforcement first

responders and everyone involved for

their courage in a possible situation

just continuing outpour of support I've

seen so many messages like that and

while those are all appreciated that

there are some things that maybe we can

do to donating water donating possibly

blood donations and we'll try to get you

information on that and how you can

donate as soon as we know how we can do

that - all right well I believe our

reporter Phoenix O'Connor has more

information for you Phoenix what can you

tell us Thank You Jana so right now in

the parking lot of the Medical Center

health and wellness it's right off the

191 it's also where the Veterans

Hospital is now if you pan over there

you can see that the scene is very much

active now what we are told is that the

shooters vehicle that he was in is over

there in that area now I cannot confirm

that that it's just like what we have

been told I can also say that the

traffic is moving pretty steadily off of

191 but you are still advised to stay

indoors if you are there as I just

mentioned maybe about 30 or 40 minutes

ago

the Edessa police chief said that they

are not sure whether or not there was a

second shooter or not they're still very

much in the still beginning stages of

the investigation I also see that I see

some ATF agents that are here at the

Medical Center Hospital right now it

looks like they are kind of going around

the perimeter right now now if you're

worried about your loved one and you're

wanting to know whether or not they are

okay if you go over to the Odessa

Medical Center they are having an area

in the cafeteria where loved ones can go

and speak to someone that is out there

now the names I have been told have not

yet been released but we can say they

21 people have been shot we can't

confirm that five are dead we are

staying on top of this story

we are also on Lonestar radio we've been

going on for the past two hours Dana

again we're continuing to get that out

of more we've seen more tweets come in

Ted Cruz just tweeted a number of tweets

saying that he and his wife Heidi are

heartbroken by the heinous act and

they're lifting up prayers for all of

the victims the families and the entire

community banking law enforcement and

and the heroes that have risked their

lives to act swiftly stop the shooter

and save others and I believe we've had

even more you said you saw

representative or excuse me senator

Bennett or or tweeted as well just

tweeting how we need to come together

here in Midland and Odessa and just have

that community spirit and we can make it

through things like this we don't want

to have to deal with these kind of

things but it's insanely sad but it's

something that we have to come together

as a community and be able to just fight

through it

and again if you are alone at home and

you need to reach out there's Facebook

there's Twitter

UTPB has set up a number of areas church

services there get coming together the

whole community is just coming together

in the wake of what the this tragedy and

again we'll continue to bring every all

the information up today as soon as we

can and share some of the tweets that

we're getting in again we already heard

from some of the Senators some of our

representatives and as we continue to

get that what we'll share more with you

let's go ahead and send things back over

to Dana for a moment and see if we have

any further updates Dana thank you guys

for your hard work and continuing to

keep your ears out to social media

obviously there's a lot going on out

there in the social world people want to

know information people want to reach

out to us and people want to express

their condolences and obviously

officials from Texas we've heard from

Ted Cruz we've heard from Governor

we've heard from Ken Paxton we've heard

from better o'rourke even the president

everyone's being briefed on what's

happened and everyone has expressed

their condolences unfortunately that's

one of the only things we can do at this

moment

is to remember those victims and to

mourn them and to think about how we can

prevent these things from happening in

the future let's go ahead and I'm going

to recap everything that we know about

this deadly situation today that

happened here in the Permian Basin in

our home starting just about right at

after 3:15 and approximately 3:17 there

was a traffic stop in Midland County it

was conducted by a DPS officer

we're told that d PSI d PSI fficer was

shot by the driver that DPS officer is

in stable condition but that driver

would then fled the scene heading west

down i-20 to about the East loop then

again in Odessa at that intersection or

that area we're told that he shot

another person and and he traveled east

on the loop to about 42nd Street in that

Twin Peaks Wal Mart that very busy

shopping district and we're told that's

where a lot of the mayhem unfolded or

told there were several shooting

shootings there several shots fired

multiple victims and at some point that

officer was a bird that excuse me that

shooter hijacked a vehicle a federal

mail van nonetheless and then took off

again back towards Midland this

obviously this the timeline that police

Odessa police chief Goerke has painted

for us and at that point on his way back

to Midland we're told a Midland police

officer was injured in a shooting and

then that suspect at some point made its

way back east circling around and then

getting to that synergy where we're told

that suspects life was ended as police

departments

the Odessa Police Department Midland

Police Department DPS and several other

local law enforcement agencies were all

able to converge and funnel that suspect

into one spot get his vehicle stopped

exchanged gunfire and killed that

suspect now that suspect has been

identified as a white male in his 30s by

police chief Goerke and what we know

about the victims so far we

really know where people were shot when

people were shot or how many people were

shot in each location but as of right

now we're told that five people are dead

21 others were shot and injured and that

includes one MPD officer one OPD officer

and one DPS officer who we all expect to

recover and are not suffering from

life-threatening injuries as far as at

the Hospital and Medical Center hospital

they took after this incident and once

this emergency was in place they brought

in all of their staff to help

accommodate this emergency we just heard

from them in a press conference not too

long ago approximately about 30 minutes

ago and they told us the first words out

of the Medical Center hospital CEOs

mouth rustle tippin were to embrace your

family tonight to hold your loved ones

to call to check up and to appreciate

the life's that we have and for too many

people tragedy will struck strike them

whether it be friends or families of

those 21 victims that were shot and the

five that were killed too many people

will have to have a painful conversation

have to have a painful phone call or

have to mourn from just a sentence such

a senseless act of violence moving along

with what took place at that press

conference we heard that Medical Center

Hospital is hosting 14 victims and they

also set up a staging area for families

where they can get food water stay in

touch with one another at the hospital

to be comfortable there with the victims

of the shooting and that they also

providing grief counselors now the 14

victims that are at Medical Center

Hospital all have varying conditions we

don't know how many are in critical we

don't know how many are serious we don't

know how many are stable at this time we

expect to hear from the Medical Center

Hospital again at 7:45 for a follow-up

press conference now

as far as officials this story obviously

has made national news it's gotten the

attention of everyone in the country as

we have to deal with another one of

these horrific shootings that claimed

senseless lives we do know that

President Trump has taken to Twitter a

little earlier today and he said he was

briefed by the Attorney General's about

the shootings in Texas FBI and law

enforcement are fully engaged and that

there will have more to follow in the

next coming hours or possibly tomorrow

as we learn more about what the

president's response will be and we also

know that Governor Abbott will be in the

Permian Basin tomorrow to meet with a

victim's families in to meet with local

law enforcement as they try to take the

next steps in moving forward from a

tragedy of this nature

he was just an El Paso just a few weeks

ago to address that situation I I saw

him there and the governor spoke very

diligently and expressed took time to

meet with families and victims and

everything so we can expect that same

kind of outpour of support we know

Midland and Odessa is a very tight-knit

community and we know that the people

here will come together and we will

honor and mourn and make it through this

as difficult and as painful as it might

be now we're gonna go and toss things

over back to Victor and Anthony who have

more from social media thank you as you

said we have been going through this and

there is a warning on Twitter that will

tell you some of the content you'll see

on there it is fairly graphic people who

were on the scene as it as it has been

absurd thing as everything unfolded

people are able to snag some video and

unfortunately some of that's very

difficult to see so it's just a warning

if you do go and look for that kind of

stuff

some of that information some of that

video some of those images are hard to

look at yes but it is very important

that we do all come together at this

time again on Facebook you can reach out

there mark yourself as safe let people

know call your loved ones and it's just

the community needs to come together

right now

rebuild after this terrible tragedy and

as Dana said Trump was tweeting and he's

joined by lots of other government

officials Kamala Harris just tweeted out

that she's also heart broke

for the families and victims in Odessa

in Midland and she's hoping for a future

without manciple

multiple mass shootings but again the

outpour just continues to come in and we

just see we've had tweets from of course

president trump we've had tweets from

better O'Rourke and Patrice from Ted

Cruz Senator John Cornyn tweeted tonight

we are with the entire Midland Odessa

community especially the victims of this

horrific tragedy I want to thank law

enforcement and first responders for

their courage in an impossible situation

that's something that maybe sometimes

will get overlooked as the law

enforcement that were able to stop this

man finally without doing any more

damage than he already did and again

I've already marked myself safe here on

Facebook people are offering all kinds

of support beyond just medical emergency

so if it's not an emergency and you just

want to reach out to somebody maybe you

need some food some water let somebody

know that you're safe that's that's

where you can do that and again more

information will be made available on

newsWest nine comm and our own Facebook

and Twitter will be sending out all of

those live updates as well right and but

yeah just basically we just a situation

like this we've talked about this plenty

of times it's just incredibly difficult

to know what to do right now people may

be in shock right now but it's important

to just beautyrx family hug your loved

ones tell them that you love them right

now because life is precious life is

short sometimes it's sort of in

sometimes we expect and something like

this is something that makes a situation

where we just need to come together as a

community as a Midland and Odessa

community and just fight through it it

is so terrible that that anyone would

lose their life but purchas funeral

homes here in Odessa has given the green

light they will be giving free funeral

funeral services to all of the victims

so they wanted to put that news out

there and they shared that via social

media as well so again we're continuing

to monitor that and we will check in

once again a few moments

let's throw things back to you Dana and

see

there's any more updates Thank You

Victor Anthony your work is very

appreciated you know we're gonna try and

compile all the latest information that

we can get we know that there will be

another press conference at 7:45 will

certainly be streaming that live for you

from MCH as they briefed us on the

latest of what's going on with the 14

victims that they have set up at the

hospital right now we one thing that

they told us was that their conditions

vary so we don't know how many people

are in critical we don't know how many

people are in serious or just stable

conditions so we'll have to monitor that

and we'll have to continue to look for

the updates that we can get on that so

we can you know continue to express our

support and possibly if we need to

donate blood we can get the word out and

local agencies can set up events so we

can get the blood that's needed to

continue to care for those victims who

may be in a critical state that's that's

what we have coming up you know it's

it's a tough day in the Permian Basin

it's something that I don't think

anybody ever expected this community so

close-knit this community Midland and

Odessa everyone and since I've been out

here for the two years that I've been

covering inland Odessa I've never never

met anybody that I would qualify as mean

or nasty it's been nothing but friendly

and welcoming and it's just a shock to

me that this kind of incident could take

place in a community like this I know we

are going to log off here at 7:30 as we

can't continue to compile information

and we'll get you that press conference

live stream and we'll certainly have

more from it tonight we'll be live at 10

o'clock for a regularly scheduled

newscast will allow you to get back to

scheduled programming we do have some

video coming in right now that's

attaching if we don't get to it right

now we'll certainly share it with you a

little bit later and unfortunately it's

of that 17 month old victim as she was

airlifted to the University

Medical Center Hospital in Lubbock where

her condition also remains unknown but

here in newsWest 9 with the last thing

I'd like to before we depart here is

just to let you know that please stay in

tonight police are still active police

are still working there are still police

presence there's still investigations

that need to take place given the nature

of the shooting and how he hijacked cars

and shot people here and shot people

over there there's still a lot of

investigations allow police to secure

their area allow police to conduct their

investigations stay in tonight enjoy a

home-cooked meal love your loved ones

embrace your loved ones call a relative

you haven't spoken to in a while tell

them how much they mean to you and we'll

obviously be doing a lot for the victims

here in the next couple of days and it's

a sad day here in the Permian Basin but

we will continue to move forward we will

continue to provide you the latest

hold on one second we're going to make

an adjustment right here at move okay

that appears to be all for our coverage

at this moment we're going to go ahead

and toss things toss things up

okay so we're gonna go ahead and toss

things back over to Victor and Anthony

apologize for the confusion as we

continue to report on Thank You Dana and

we did just want to share a couple last

things that we found out there was some

help coming that you heard from San

Angelo right we heard that Saint Angelo

the city is sending blood over to

Midland and Odessa so a very good thing

there and if we do need more additional

blood donations if we hear of that will

definitely pass that information along

to you as well yes and again people are

reaching out through Facebook to offer

food water even work if you need some

help just adjusting it's such a big time

for all of the community to come

together and to just share in the

tragedy which is a terrible thing to

unite us but is it important at this

time that we come together very

important to do that I mean you really

hope that this situation never arises

but you're exactly right even though it

did arise that means we have to come

together to make sure that the the

victims families are okay are going to

be okay it's going to be there's going

to be some wounds that are going to be

have to take some time to heal though as

we come together as a community we can

make that happen just by being there for

each other loving one another and being

a Permian Basin community here in West

Texas and if you want to reach out again

you tpv has set up several centers there

are church areas you can find them all

online more details are available on

newsWest nine com I believe we have a

little bit more right sorry we have a

little bit more we'll go ahead and send

things back to Dana to go ahead and

close this out thanks guys we are going

to go ahead and stay on the air until we

get to that Medical Center Hospital

conference that is scheduled to take

place at 7:45 at the Medical Center

Hospital with the CEO of the Medical

Center Hospital Russell Tippin we do

know at the Medical Center hospital that

again they have 14 victims there of all

varying conditions so we'll see if we

can get some clarity on that matter to

see how many are in critical how many

are stable and if we need to get the

word out on whether there needs to be

some blood drives to take care of those

victims and the coming days

at this time I want to go ahead and

recap of what we know given the nature

of the situation if you're just tuning

in or if you're just trying to cope and

understand what happened I think as we

all are within the community today we'll

go ahead and start from the top we know

that just after 3:15 at approximately

3:17 a traffic stop by DPS of a gold

Honda turned into a shooting when the

driver opened fired on the officer who

was conducting that traffic stop he was

shot then after shooting that officer

that suspect / driver took off fled the

scene headed west to about I 20 in

Odessa and the east loop where we're

told he opened fired again and struck a

civilian at that point he went ahead and

headed east on the east loop now this

timeline that I'm telling you just to go

ahead and preference it it is uh this is

what has been reported by Chief Odessa

police chief

Goerke and he's basically told us that

this is the most accurate information

that they have at this time though it is

subject to change at any time so back to

where we were of the suspect after

shooting some people on i-20 at the East

Loop he had east to 42nd Street and that

again is where the majority of the

mayhem is being reported we do know that

the rear we're gonna go ahead and

interrupt this timeline and go ahead and

toss things back out to Phoenix O'Connor

who has another update from us so

Phoenix what do you have Thank You Dana

so I am still at the medical health and

wellness center I'm here in the parking

lot but behind me you can see that the

scene again is still active I see ATF I

see Midland Police Department and the

fire department all there looks like

they are still conducting investigation

is taped off all the way to the synergy

movie theater I also have been told that

the shooters car was in there they are

looks like they are still holding

investigation you cannot get into that

movie theater it is locked down when it

comes here to the health and wellness

center it looks like there are not

allowing people in here either

they have that blocked off when it comes

to 191 it does look like it is clear and

good to go however I'm going to

encourage everyone to go ahead and still

stay inside doors I have not been told

the way we're cleared earlier when I

spoke with the Odessa police chief he

said that there possibly could be a

second shooter but they do not know and

as you guys know at home I am from here

in Midland and I do have some friends

that were we're shot today and it is a

very scary situation and I hope that we

can all come together and pray together

I have been told with that said that if

you do have a loved one that is inside

the hospital there identifies not to be

on their phones they're only allowed to

text so do keep that in consideration

but if you do want to kind of check in

on a loved one at the Odessa Medical

Center around the cafeteria area that is

where they're gonna have kind of an area

for loved ones that go to speak with

someone now we are again told that 21

people were shot and there is five

confirmed confirmed dead now stay with

us right here on newsWest nine we're

gonna have all that updated information

we also have an app that you can

download we can find notifications and

of course our website newsWest nine com

I'm here in Midland being so Conner back

like the sandwich is anybody hungry

[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

a little bit cooler out here this time

we'll go in two minutes

that gives you enough time two minutes

everybody okay yeah

all right y'all ready okay

7:45 we just want to give another update

again we've some things are starting to

come into focus a little more like I

started off with earlier it's it's very

important to me to y'all to know that

first and foremost that the start this

healing process starts within and that

this community it needs to love each

other and pray for each other and pray

for the victims and their families

that's most important is is to remember

those people and to grab on to your

loved ones tonight I want to update you

on what's happening right here at

Medical Center of what we have going and

I've got some updated numbers and I'll

try to to go through those quickly but

accurately amend ago earlier when I came

out I reported 14 here that number is 13

one of the people we had was caught in

the action it was not related to this

incident so the number is 13 okay so I

want to correct that that the number is

13 out of those 13 we have had two that

have been treated and released we have

seven that are critical when I say

critical most of those have been in

surgery and are out of surgery seven of

those okay those are critical to serious

one deceased and we have one transferred

a pediatric patient under the age of two

years old that was transferred out of

here okay so I'll go over those one more

time seventy critical to serious one

deceased one transferred under the age

of two years old okay a to the eight

we've had eight people total in surgery

and most of those are out and have gone

very well

let me just talk about our but blood

supply we're getting a lot of calls

about blood supply our blood supply

currently is good we're okay right now

we appreciate all the calls and all the

outpouring has been nationwide we're

getting calls all over the nation about

what's going on and first and foremost

we want to say thank you for that

because that's really shows the support

that every that that we have for each

other our supplies are good the blood is

good let me just comment brief

on the on the families I know there is a

family gathering center that's been set

up here in Odessa and I've got I'll get

that in just a second but I'll get that

out but there is a family center that

has been set up for people to to gather

if they have any questions okay y'all

may know that already but I just wanted

to bring that out but we're still on

lockdown

I still think for the safety of our

patients and victims and the victims

families that we need to stay on

lockdown just to keep it under control

we hope to have that lifted before too

long but right now I think it's in the

best interest to keep it locked down

where it is okay our staff has been

amazing but that's not the point here

the point right now is that that these

victims are being taken care of and so

we're just we're just trying to do right

by them okay let me introduce just a few

people that will take just a few

questions okay

this is Matt and he's our chief

operations officer Matt's here this is

dr. Bose one of our trauma doctors and

I'm going to turn it over to dr. Bose

just for a second just to talk about

gunshot victims and what things like

that are and I'll let him speak to it in

just a minute we'll come back to me then

to Matt for any follow-up questions okay

I'll hand it over to dr. Bose was here

for this second

so first of all our thoughts are with

the families and when a situation like

this happens its actions that come

together from preparation years in

advance so over the last several years

we've formed committees where we've

coordinated the many elements that will

be necessary here police sheriff school

departments Odessa Fire & Rescue and the

medical director the emergency room and

other parties that are involved here

when everyone arrived it was well

orchestrated we received 13 patients and

because of this preparation you know we

were able to call in our backups

anesthesiologist operating room staffs

tax nurses this was a great team effort

for everybody when the patients arrived

after they arrived we were able to do

the initial stabilizing maneuvers on

everyone and the emphasis I would give

here and I think a take-home point

especially for the national viewers is I

encourage everyone in every community no

matter what size if you're in the middle

of the desert you're in an urban area to

prepare in advance unfortunately it may

not be a matter of if it may be a matter

of when and for us this preparation

really helped us today I thought - with

the family and another thing I'd mention

is whenever there is something on the

national scale like this it starts as a

local response it starts right there at

the community it starts with knowing how

to stop bleeding it and it starts with

how to do BLS and chest compressions and

this is something that we as Americans

can do and we're incurring encouraging

this in the Midland Odessa community and

we really encourage this at Medical

Center Hospital and you guys out there

wherever you're watching nationwide you

can make a huge difference for people

because when they arrive here the

response can stay local because if

you've practiced this you don't need to

call in the state you don't need to call

the governor you don't need to activate

FEMA and national you know resources so

we can do this we can come together and

I think our community here has shown how

we can do that and I think our families

are going to come together and we're

going to become stronger from this thank

you

let's turn it over to Matt

hi my name is Matt Collins I was the

incident commander for this incident

first of all of course our hearts and

prayers go out to all of the victims and

and their families and our hospital

staff as well this has been a very very

difficult situation we really have three

phases of operations inside the hospital

when this happens we have an activation

phase and then we have operational

periods we've just completed operational

period one and two and at 7:00 at 7:30

we went into the final phase which is a

recovery phase and that's where we start

putting everything back together getting

back to normal operations and taking

care of our staff and to continue to

take care of those patients that have

just gone through this horrific

situation so with that said I'd be able

be happy to answer any questions that I

can of course we're not able to release

names or any information regarding the

victims I am NOT certain but they were

life-flighted to Lubbock or Children's

in Dallas

my understanding all I can tell you is

we know that that person was involved in

this incident and had a fatal gunshot

wound

[Music]

you know honestly it's not a time for us

to think a lot we've done a lot of

preparation for this day and we work

through these things in simulated

situations several times a year so

everybody has a role that they fall into

and everybody fell into that role in the

hospital and all of the staff performed

Admiral

admirably but ultimately we're here to

serve those victims and the family so

it's not really about us today

we do of course you know this happens

when all of the media is released and

social media reports people come to the

hospital seeking reports on their loved

ones so we have a location inside the

hospital where we congregated all of

those families and we had a senior

nursing official work to reunify them

and get as much information information

as we could to each and every family

member it's my understanding that that

room is down to just a couple of

families now and that we've communicated

with everybody that we can we're gonna

keep the hospital into a lockdown

situation until approximately 10:00 p.m.

just for staff comfort and safety but

the hospital is back to normal

operations at this time it did make the

difference I can't tell you because we

are prepared but I think if we were not

we may not have had the same rapid

response to the situation and the great

outcomes that we had I mean we saved 12

people today we're using our own

internal communication systems to make

sure that we're adequately staffed for

the unit for the evening and yes we are

actually above normal staffing levels

for this evening going into the weekend

in the hospital is back to normal

operations right now it's being reported

to us that we're fully staffed we

activate what's called call trees where

managers start them then they call one

person after another after another and

we had the exact response that we would

have ever hoped for in the situation not

only for nurses but for doctors and all

of the other support staff and police

officers security everybody that we need

to manage an incident like this

and for people who are watching at home

right now I know your blood supply's you

know as our CEO said a few minutes ago

the community needs your prayers the

victims need your prayers families need

your prayers the hospital staff needs

your prayers we what we call cash

emergency supplies so when there is a

situation like this where we consume

lots of supplies while giving the care

were able to replenish them quickly

enough to maintain operations patience

there's eight are seven critical and two

that are serious so I'm I can't give you

an update on their exact status but they

are receiving the appropriate care at

the level of care they're there

first I would emphasize that this is not

about the doctor it's not about us

it's about the family but myself

personally I'm an Iraq war veteran I

served 12 years in the military and

served in the Second Battle of Fallujah

and Baghdad and this is something that

unfortunately I'm very experienced at

mass casualty situations and this is

what led us to form the preparation

process with hundreds and hundreds of

people that you are not seeing here that

are very intricately involved in a

situation like this

so as far as for the public out there

the message for them I think what they

can do to help you know we always say

thoughts and prayers that's great but go

out there take a BLS class go out there

learn about how to stop bleeding go out

there and practice safety don't text and

drive don't do things where you put

yourself in others in danger and this is

something that we can do as a nation to

help here

so typically I can reliably comment on

what's happening in the walls of the

emergency room

so it'd be speculation about what is

going on on the streets and what streets

are closed and what weapons were used

I'm I don't want to say the wrong

information so I don't want to say the

wrong information but from my

understanding of the situation

the vast majority came to Medical Center

Hospital we are the highest level trauma

center for over thirty thousand square

miles in this region so over thirty

thousand square miles so the majority

came here there were fuse that went to

some outlying trauma centers as well so

who was an officer and who wasn't and

who was where it would be speculation on

my end our end we were just trying to do

the basic stop bleeding resuscitate and

use our well-trained Tech's nurses staff

physicians everyone to get the job done

these things don't just happen you have

to prepare so everything from who comes

in to where family members go to how to

keep ourselves safe

how to prevent wrong messages going out

to the media how to keep the calm and do

this in a calm situation this doesn't

happen by accident this takes years of

preparation and I encourage every

community to do this this is not an

urban community here but this happened

here and this can happen anywhere across

America and I think what I personally

took from this is a team here in West

Texas in the deserts of West Texas was

maximally prepared at this trauma center

to take care of everyone and I don't

think this is beyond us anybody can do

this please be prepared I do that the

information on the family center is

located at a set up at Ector County

annex building on 1010 East 8th Street

1010 each East 8th Street and that's for

the Family Center the reunification

center there ok any other questions

before we wrap this up so we had our

basic emergency department crew and then

on top of that we have backup emergency

department crew but often you have to

figure out the bottlenecks in your

system and this is this came from our

preparation the bottleneck may not be

the emergency room it may be the

operating room the anesthesiologist so

we prepared this in advance

everybody was called in from extra

nurses extra tax extra you know

custodians they may save more lives than

anybody by preventing infection so this

is a team effort and we were prepared

for this and the whole team was called

in just the last thing we're gonna we're

going to say a lockdown until 10 o'clock

at 10 o'clock we'll reassess the

situation make sure we're safe I don't

plan on having another one of these

unless something drastically changes

okay

but if we do we'll get the notification

out to everybody but thank y'all for for

being here and and one final word just

to everybody listening to our voice

today and tonight is when you when you

go when you go to bed tonight with your

families you need to grab them hold on

time because nobody's guaranteed the

next the next day and grab onto your

families and love them and pray for our

staff our doctors in these victims and

these victims families and hold on to

your loved ones tonight and all we can

say is God bless Texas god bless

Odessa and Medical Center United States

and and and love on your family tonight

and thank y'all very much that's all
