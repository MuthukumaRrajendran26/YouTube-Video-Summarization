first of all mr. Gradle from your

vantage point any update on the two

fugitives that we think are in northern

Manitoba what is the latest there there

is no change in the situation that new

fax or new new developments just in the

last few hours the the RCMP will

obviously make the appropriate public

comments when they can to keep the

public properly informed Public Safety

here is issue number one as you know

they have real reallocated resources to

bring in extra personnel new technology

in in the form of drones and otherwise

that are helping with the with the

surveillance and and the search this is

an active live operation and the the

RCMP in collaboration with other police

agencies are putting in all the

necessary resources to make sure this is

resolved as quickly as possible

the best advice to the general public is

to be alert to be vigilant if you see

anything or suspect anything that's

unusual or potentially dangerous do not

intervene yourself call 911 or contact

your police of local jurisdiction that

is the safest and wisest thing to do our

local officials asking for more help is

there more that the RCMP can do more

that you can offer than is being offered

so far the the RCMP have a system within

their their national organization to

reallocate resources to major active

investigations and operations they will

reassign personnel from wherever is

necessary to make sure that on the

ground at the at the closest site of the

incident that all the personnel that are

required the tools and equipment the

technology that all of that is made

available if they need something extra

or extraordinary in addition to that

they will they will certainly ask for it

no such request has been made to this

point but they are clearly reallocating

own resources

internal

to make sure that everything that needs

to be done is in fact being done at

these at the scene of the search
