good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and

thanks for coming here the health ax

fire department this afternoon will be

giving an update on the tragic fire

which happened in health facts in the

community describe field on February

19th to Oakland I'd like to first

acknowledge and pass on our continuing

and sincere condolences to the bar whole

family as a result of this tragedy and

to the entire community who have been so

affected here today we have our Fire

Chief Ken Stubing our deputy chief of

operations peter andrews and we also

have our division chief for fire

prevention Matt Coby what we will do

this afternoon first of all our chief

Stubing will give a statement and then

chiefs tubing and a senior management

team including myself will be here and

we'll take questions we are also in the

municipality planning the possible

eventuality or arrival of hurricane

durian so we will stay here as long as

it reasonably can to take questions but

the fire chief and some senior staff may

be called elsewhere so I'd like at this

time to ask Chiefs doing please

Thank You chief

thank you for joining us here today at

12:40 3:00 a.m. on Tuesday February 19th

our firefighters responded to a call

they will never forget more than 50

firefighters and support members from

several fire stations and divisions

responded where somehow were involved

with the fire speeds at 33 quartz Drive

dozens of our team members did

everything in their power to fight the

fire or figure out what caused it fire

investigations by their nature are

challenging to solve because often that

evidence is destroyed by fire in this

case we investigated every piece of

evidence available and tested every

possible theory just to learn what we

could about this fire despite our best

efforts we are unable to say what causes

tragic event we can say that the fire

originated in the back of the house in

the main floor living room near a couch

however at this time the cause will be

classified as undetermined if new

information becomes available we will

reopen the investigation besides having

two of our own investigators we

consulted on this vial with the fire

marshal's office and the investigator

the property owners insurance company

and various experts all of us came up

with the same conclusions while a cause

can't be identified at this time

investigators determine nothing that

found at the scene would lead them to

believe the fire was suspicious more

than an accelerant was used we also

didn't find anything at the scene that

would suggest that the cause was

careless disposal

smoking materials well we can't find

what caused the fire we can say what

didn't cause it

based on evidence collected and various

tests we can confidently say that the

fire was not caused by kitchen cooking

or other activities in the kitchen and

we are also confident there was no

electrical fault or defect investigators

determined that the circuit breakers to

the electric baseboard heaters were in

the off position before the fire meaning

there was no power directed to the

heating sources in the house despite not

knowing the cause nothing led our

investigators to believe that there is a

public safety concern one of these

things that one of the things that makes

our municipalities so great is our

diversity if you look in our schools and

our libraries or in community centers

you will see people from all over the

world who have now chosen to make Aleph

ax their home we see diversity as an

opportunity an opportunity for us to

share valuable fire safety education

that will help our new citizens help

keep their home safe whether it's

correctly installing a smoke alarm or

carbon monoxide alarm practicing safe

alternative scape rugs out of your home

or even who to call at the first sign of

an emergency these are fire safety

messages we have an obligation to

deliver with that in mind we are

continuing to work with I sans the

Immigration Services Association of Nova

Scotia to provide education materials

and training sessions for those

interested in learning how to make their

new Canadian homes safer but teaching

citizens to be safer in their own homes

is

they knew in fact in December 2018

before the courts fire Regional Council

approved an addition of two

responsibilities to our administrative

order that governs our fire service

these two responsibilities are public

education and fire prevention which are

the first two lines of defense for the

fire service people often picture

firefighters fighting fires and making a

rescue and that certainly is an

important part of our job but here in

Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency our

fires our firefighters don't just

respond to an emergency as the last line

of defense

they assist with our community Risk

Reduction team with public education and

fire prevention activities as well and

certainly this and other tragic events

commits us to do even more

there has been some public discussion

about residential sprinklers in new

homes sprinklers are a valuable addition

to a fire safety strategy and along with

other tools such as smoke alarms carbon

monoxide alarms fire extinguishers and

home escape plans it's important for

homeowners to take all reasonable steps

to ensure their home is as safe as

possible the discussion surrounding the

issue of mandatory residential

sprinklers is happening amongst many

stakeholders across this nation

ultimately decisions rests with those

agencies that have authority to be clear

Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency does

not have jurisdiction over building code

regulations this topic is part of a much

broader policy discussion with many

stakeholders that we encourage finally I

want to point out the incredible efforts

of dozen firefighters who respond

to that call in the early morning hours

on January the 19th it was through their

excellent training skills and experience

that they were able to prevent this fire

from spreading to nearby homes this call

was certainly a tragedy and our hearts

and thoughts remain with the Baro family

and our community but I know our crews

did everything they could on that cold

night I want to personally thank them

for their ongoing professionalism

community first actions which say

exhibit day in and day out I also want

to recognize the efforts of our fire

investigators who spent hundreds of

hours trying to piece together what

happened that night

I can tell you they are beyond

disappointed that they were not able to

determine how this fire happened

unfortunately that is sometimes the

reality of fires of this magnitude thank

you for coming here today

deputy chief Meldrum will now open the

floor to questions thank you thank you

sue be take questions please be patient

with us as we try to get everyone what

was difficult well sorry here please

[Music]

no mr. Barrow has been unavailable to us

this certainly is one of the reasons

that we've taken time to try to gather

all evidence that we could what is

particular about this investigation was

difficult

so I can tell you that since January

2015 major fires in our municipality

those are fires of significant damage

approximately 25 percent of those

fighters ends up being caused by this

undetermined the volume of fire and the

extent of damage to evidence is a

serious obstacle to fire investigators

indeed in a fire of this magnitude is

common for materials to be totally

destroyed by fire or needle moved or

washed away by necessary firefighting

activities so this is also true here our

fire investigators simply lack the

physical evidence to make a conclusive

determination of cause

absolutely Anaya I'll invite division

chief Kobe to talk about that as well

but you can see the board to my left

where investigators with evidence were

able to rule out several things such as

the electrical heating we know that this

fire we ruled out cooking in the kitchen

for example

so maybe Chico

thank you for the question it's any

investigation such as this is very

complex in this particular instance it

was two of our lead investigators with

help Xfire in addition to represented

from the office of the fire marshal with

the province and the insurance is his

investigators all collectively looked at

several avenues and speculated on any

different number of causes I also want

to point out that at any point in this

investigation had we come to a

conclusion that there was a public

safety risk and imminent public safety

risk we would have communicated that

immediately and that was not the case

here haven't found any design of the

home or any objects in the home that we

would consider to be a public safety

risk when it comes to the investigation

we follow several leads

we took this doe over part to make sure

that that wasn't a cause the baseboard

heater was something we looked at that

was taken away and tested along with the

thermostat that served the baseboard

heater and all the associated wiring all

those things were taken back to the lab

fantastic the breaker that served the

baseboard if all the baseboards in the

building baseboard heaters in the

building that the breakers were in the

amount position not the trip position

the opposition those breakers were all

tested to make sure they were actually

functioning properly and they all were

so we chase several leads but it which

involved a lot of investigation the

materials in the building but none of

them came to a conclusive

we say that

no I mean he chases the thought they

speculate on what different causes but

there was not one that was worth rising

above the rest they are all easy it's

not easy to determine that they weren't

the cause but they if they fell off that

we took did the testing we don't have

any evidence of another source of heat

in the building it was the baseboard

heaters and they were in the opposition

that's correct that's correct

cult

the space here

there was no no space heater found in

the house keeping in mind that this was

a very hot fire and so most of the

objects in the main floor

for example

the other kind of

time's other things using communal

sources are common even if there was a

physical evidence I thought was a really

suggestion that that that probably would

be repeating the home which is

as it then matter of our our policy and

past practice will won't comment on

particular witness statements so I won't

go into detail except for to say that

the the base where heater is the sole

source of heat that we found in the

house they were not functioning at the

time five

[Music]

we work closely with Health Action Group

Elise when it comes to Arison our

investigators know what to look for for

say an accelerant or an intentional

intentionally lit fire in this case

because of the charring and burning

patterns of the area of origin we know

that it started inside and there were no

traces of accelerants in the fire the

burning patterns didn't indicate in any

kind of accelerant was used there have

been reports of an explosion that

explosion

for commuters

certainly I'll comment on the the

barbecue element so that we looked at

the barbecue certainly it was outside we

know the fire started inside we also the

propane tank wasn't connected at the

time of the virus we know they that the

barbecue was not the source of this fire

was not the cause in terms of the

explosion I think all too chief Andrews

to speak about the dynamics of the fire

thank you very much for that question I

think specifically to the propane tank

it is common that protank propane tanks

have pressure release valve so as that

fire and the heat began to extend near

that propane tank is our belief that the

pressure relief valve released causing

propane to be released causing a

momentary intensification of the fire to

answer your question neighbors there was

another explosion of the propane tank

but there could have been an

intensification of the fire based on the

pressure relief valve releasing on that

propane division is nearby

that's correct overs on the day they add

it's very common in structural fires or

fire behavior to be quite violent and

forceful so if you have a fire in a home

any home in a room as fresh air is

introduced to that compartment space and

the windows Heat and the windows failed

that sudden onrush of oxygen-rich air

into this space can make a very very

powerful expansion of fire which it can

be visible for some distance away from

the building

and can often be accompanied by sounds

of broken windows

we're aware in the community that there

was some talk of that sort of behavior

which would not be on typical than a

house fire how quickly the fire spread

when

but we don't know how quickly the fire

spread what we do know is when our

firefighters arrived they encountered a

building with heavy fire and moment on

two levels the fire was well advanced

when they got there and it's a

significant challenge in dealing into

law in the fire based on your response

time and when we found we got there

I certainly can't say what may or may

not have happened before our

firefighters arrived we know that our

response time for our first unit was six

minutes and five seconds again on

arrival they found a lot of fire at the

property on two levels

he mentioned that mr. Carville was

unavailable to you he vomited all on his

condition

I cannot for reasons of respect to the

family

protection of privacy we won't be

discussing mr. Burrowes condition but he

has been unavailable to you to discover

an entire message that is correct it's

certainly true that we have been hopeful

to interview mr. Marco Marco and we've

been unable to do that

what's the static so that this

investigation will be reported as closed

with the finding of undetermined if we

get new information that allows us to do

more work will reopen the fun

no that's been rolled up so as the chief

and chief Kobe both indicated we know

that the electrical power for that

baseboard heater was shot off before the

fire certainly their origin is

immediately adjacent to that piece of

furniture but the baseboard heater has

as possible breakers hiptripz or were

they in an off position prior to the

fire we know that they were in the off

position prior to the fire electrical

engineers were contracted to assess

those components and they delivered a

finding that they were definitely off

before the fire

in the middle of February with all the

baseboard here's the house off the

family's entry

I certainly can't speak to that we can

speak

you can comment on this or something it

seems unlikely that our family

so the interview content that is useful

to us is anything that indicates the

area of origin and the ignition source

thing there was no information in

interview that gave us an ignition

source indication other than that we

really can't speculate on what the

occupants of the home may or may not

have been doing

[Music]

chief Kobe may correct me on this but we

have to understand both aerial origin

and the ignition source before we

continue a finding of accidental

that's correct I'd also point out that

when it comes to use carelessly just use

and disposal smoking materials or an

attention lit fire we haven't ruled that

out we have no evidence to support those

as causes so we can't say accidental

accidental would mean we knew exactly

what caused it and so those two items

are still unknown to us rule that would

be kitchen cooking the electrical system

including the baseboard heater and the

thermostat the breakers and the barbecue

of those are in absolutely ruled out but

there are some items in store

did you just reiterate who always

investigated the parties again and just

have a sense of what

certainly a hundreds of hours were put

into this to lead investigators working

for health acts fire were dedicated to

this file in addition to a

representative from the office of the

fire marshal it's the province and the

insurance companies hire a party

investigator who we worked in concert

with during the course of the

investigation let's say that part of the

investigation we're we're looking for

cause was concluded earlier the delay

really was waiting in hopes that we

could interview our last key witness mr.

VAR ho and it's we're at the point now

where we're going to release the binding

is undetermined pending a change

you give us an idea of how it was in

terms of having witnesses who were able

to talk

I don't have a number of many many

witnesses were involved with it whether

it be the fire crews other individual

staff neighbors witnesses that were just

there on scene family members

representatives with I sands and all

those individuals

results too

[Music]

certainly

yes then for the question so this

morning the fire chief and I and some of

them chief Coby and some of the fire

investigation team did go to the

hospital speak to mrs. Marko and let her

know about these findings and again to

pass on to her our sincere condolences

when the outcome of this class

and the Department of Energy

during the course of this investigation

we've been aware many online theories

and areas of speculation into your

question that's very very harmful

speculation can create false assumptions

about what may or may not have happened

that can be so terribly damaging

people involved in the fire so terribly

damaging to members of the community it

can cause fear and unrest in the

community

may have fears of fire risk in their

home when there's no basis in fact for

that it's also damaging to our

firefighters as well so we absolutely

appreciate the question in the need for

everyone to appreciate that we work only

from the basis of hard evidence

can you comment on

absolutely I can stress injury is not

new for firefighters and first

responders generally face very traumatic

situations we regularly throughout their

careers but there's no doubt this fire

was special this fire in scope was

almost unique not unique in our

community but certainly almost unique

the loss of life the age of the children

the entire tragedy has deeply affected

our fire investigators and our

firefighters we met with our

firefighters this morning to talk to

them about what we're talking to you now

immediately following the event we make

critical incident stress management

teams available to

firefighters to help them remember as

they've been trained with the warning

signs of stress in three are and how to

reach it well we also provided a

psychological services for anything

wanted a and we continue to do so every

firefighter is in a different place are

some firefighters were away from our

workplace for a while or very pleased

that everyone's back to work but still

people are suffering some folks are

receiving treatment others report to us

that they're okay and you do like to

indicate you know it's okay to feel okay

but there's no guarantee that there

won't be harmful effects or symptoms

later during their careers so yes this

fires had a lasting

folks your experience and they found

that homes built in the last 20 years

might burn quicker faster the homes

built say 15 60 years ago

absolutely so homes built 50 or 60 years

ago we refer to them as legacy

construction and they use mass they use

large structural members to hold up the

weight of the home modern construction

is lightweight in design and uses

engineering the methods and lightweight

construction has a lot of great

advantages to homeowners it uses less

material and therefore can be less

costly lightweight construction can be

insulated very very well to reduce

heating and cooling costs lightweight

construction also allows home designers

to use our contextual methods that

weren't possible before and lightweight

construction is designed for occupant

escape in mind so interior partitions

are made of fire resistant materials

like gyprock or drywall and alarm

systems are required so smoke alarms are

required in new home construction to

alert occupants to get out and stay on

the sound of alarm

having said that as firefighters we know

that the lighter weight of the

structural members that will be building

up once they're subjected to fire they

can fail more

we're aware that we know that if the

drywall is reached or the fires are in

attics and homes in our communities

lightweight construction gives us less

time to do that work

absolutely and as chief Steuben reminds

me and quite right it's not just

construction that matters the things

that are in our homes today are built

very differently in made of synthetic

materials more and more than they ever

were 20 years ago

so the furniture in my house is largely

based on quality carbons and plastics

those materials that were in very very

hot can lead to flashover conditions

very very quickly and produce volumes of

toxic smoke there are very dangerous

documents that are much more of a risk

than they were perhaps in the 1950s and

60s

sorry apologize human

smoke detectors where there's no

detective sorry I just realized

certainly so smoke alarms are so forth

smoke alarms are absolutely if there's

one thing that we can do today we can

make sure that everyone has worked in

smoke alarms in all levels of their home

and that we all have an exit plan for

windows smoke alarms sound to your

question yes smoke alarms were in the

building investigators found the

basement level smoke alarm tested it and

found it to be in working condition

smoke alarm was found on the main floor

where the fire originated that smoke

alarm was no longer on the ceiling that

was found on the floor that's not

uncommon in fires for fire damage to do

that and sometimes for necessary

firefighting activities to actually move

that smoke alarm from where it landed

upstairs the smoke alarms we're not

found due to the extent of the fire

damage but we do understand that they

were part of the building construction

do you know if they were wiring or

patterning character pose

in this particular home the year of

construction they would have been just

based on our investigation they were all

learning so the basement the main floor

and the upper floor are all

interconnected we would say the upper

floor would have had smoke alarms in the

hallway leading to the bedrooms in

addition to inside the bedrooms all

being interconnected in addition for

cases like a power outage

they have battery backups in them as

well so there's nothing that's right

there was of course on the on the upper

floor there was there's nothing to test

this smoke alarm that was found on the

main floor was who was beyond testing it

was fire damage and water damage as well

they will take one more question and

then once that's done if you wish some

members of staff will remain for

one-on-ones is there sort of a key fire

safety takeaway for people I think the

community is generally pretty scared

nervous

is there one key thing

for any fire and not specific to this

fire because we have no cause in this

case we have nothing to to point to to

educate on our number one recommendation

is smoke alarms but I would go through

our our standard messaging which is

prevention detection and escape

prevention any activity involving act

the electricity is charging your phone

or plugging in a power bar any activity

using heat like cooking or or fire open

fire there's a safe way to do all of

those things and even on our website you

can educate yourself on the safe way to

cook the safe way to charge your phone

those kinds of things so we've stressed

everyone to educate themselves on the

right way to do those activities

detection is smoke alarms and Co arms I

would recommend that you have one in

every floor of your house I recommend

that you have them interconnected in

your bedrooms and outside your sleeping

rooms and I further recommend that you

sleep with your doors closed that

prevents the the smoke from getting into

the bedroom and if you've got

interconnected smoke alarms then you'll

be warned of the smoke and have lots of

time to deploy your the third Avenue

which is escape you should have an

escape plan you should know two ways out

of every room you should know where

you're meeting when you go outside

everyone in the house should know what

the escape plan is and you should

practice it frequently but also

mentioned in civic numbering if we can't

see your civic number we can't find you

this is very important that you have

your civic number display and it's

visible so that crews can reach you when

those seconds absolutely matter

so as we are coming close to a close I'd

like to add you know without any

reference to the tragic fire reports

drive we see this also as an opportunity

to remind everyone to take every

precaution to protect their family in

their homes from the tragedy of fire so

as chief Comey has said there's numerous

steps now for residents of HRM I just

want to remind everyone of two important

programs that they can access our fire

service offers an alarmed and ready

program for residents who don't have a

smoke alarm and perhaps cannot afford

one or perhaps do not have a battery and

can't afford one or maybe don't have the

physical ability to install those

devices also we have a push program

practice using safety and home where our

fire companies are out in the street our

frontline firefighters visiting homes

throughout the communities to review

these safety tips with residents to help

them test their smoke alarms and to make

sure that all their questions are

answered so we encourage any resident

with questions but who would like access

to those important services to doubt

3-1-1 here in Halifax to get a ticket in

as we call it so that the firefighters

can come and help you practice fire

safety I want to thank everyone for

coming in your interest in this file

once again our condolences to the bar

whole family

the community and Spri field who were

affected by this terrible terrible trend

thank you very much chief Han groups

would speak to that German good morning

good afternoon everybody once again just

to reiterate where we started here so

we're currently tracking hurricane

durian which is making its way tracking

northeast up the eastern seaboard Sea

coast as well there is hurricane Gabriel

which is also started and is beginning

to progress in my Great Northwest which

has the possibility converge on the

health acts area in the wee hours of

Saturday and early Sunday morning at

this point we have begin our initial

planning to prepare and communicate to

the public of what they can do to help

prepare for this emergency in this

potential storm in the next 24 to 48

hours but we'll have much more

understanding on the intensity and the

impacts be they wind or rain or both and

what that convergence of those terms

might mean to the municipality early

days but we'll know more and then coming

48 hours

okay so thank you very much I hope

everyone has a pleasant remainder of the

day and say senior staff will be here we

are seeking one-on-ones please process

individually thank you

first make sure all this is
