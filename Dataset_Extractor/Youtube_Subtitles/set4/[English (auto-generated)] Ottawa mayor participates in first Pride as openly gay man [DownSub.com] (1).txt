as mayor of Canada's capital Jim Watson

has participated in lots of capital

pride parades but this one is special

I'm getting a lot more hugs today than I

did in years gone by and that feels

great last week in a column in the paper

Watson

opened the closet door and told the

world he's gay I've been thinking and

tossing and turning about it for the

last year or so and I just thought I had

a week's holiday and PEI and had some

time to reflect and sat down and wrote

the piece and I thought it would be

difficult to write but it just came

flowing out I met a few little editorial

changes and then sent it to the

newspaper the column a national in

international headlines and brought good

wishes from around the country and

around the world it's been really

overwhelming I'd say about 95 percent

very kind thoughtful comments and

there's always five percent that are not

so not so warm and fuzzy but it's been

quite an experience for me I think it's

really important that such a strong

important person and can come out of the

closet whenever they feel comfortable 40

years sure for a huge figure like the

mayor of the capital city of our country

to be able to do that that was an

amazing thing for some their opinion of

their mayor changed actually it does it

changes my opinion and that he felt

strongly enough to reveal a private part

of himself that he kept so privately and

it yes my opinion of him has gone up

immeasurably because of it

pride parades another events like it had

been around Canada for about 40 years

and they played an important role over

those years in changing society's views

about the LGBTQ to community making it

easier for people like Watson to come

out you really feel the sense of warmth

and love here at the Pride Parade

it took Watson 40 years to make the

decision to tell the world he's gay and

he has some advice for those thinking

about coming out what I said in the

column was that you know don't feel

pressure to come out do it on your own

terms but at the same time don't wait

for 40 years like I did David I can
