all day long we had bands of very heavy

rain big waves lashing the coast and of

course the wind has been a big factor

here as well the peak gusts recorded in

this area was a hundred and 25 km/h on

top of that of course there's been fears

all day long about the storm surge

coinciding with high tide that doesn't

seem to have materialized as bad as

people thought but still Donna beach

erosion has been a major problem as well

in Jackson the hurricane is now moving

north along the coast who is at risk

next yeahit's people in Georgia and the

Carolinas who really need to watch this

carefully already people in Charleston

South Carolina being urged to pay

attention to evacuation zones and leave

now before it's too late because that

city is especially prone to flooding and

storm surge even with a hurricane that's

supposed to stay offshore

further up the coast of North Carolina

they're also deeply concerned about the

impacts of durian they could see the

closest US landfall in that area and

Donna that's an area that was hit

directly by Hurricane Florence just one

year ago that's the last thing they need

and Jackson Florida didn't take a direct

hit as was first feared that of course

is a relief including for so many

Canadians who visit there when will

things likely return to normal well

they're trying their best to get things

back to normal as quickly as possible

Orlando's Airport which of course is a

hot spot for tourists has now reopened

after a 24-hour closure they're starting

to receive incoming flights getting the

flight schedules fully back to normal

though will take some time and remember

there are thousands of Power workers

utility workers who have staged here

they're in place to help the 150,000 or

so people who found themselves in the

dark over the past few days
