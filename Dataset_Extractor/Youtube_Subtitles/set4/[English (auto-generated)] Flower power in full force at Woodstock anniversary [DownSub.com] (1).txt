I thought that it was gonna be like way

way different but this is about how it

is it's always this exciting and this

nice and there's a little bit more

people right right other than that yeah

this is all it's always like this

but like that first one I think the

media the fact that it was big they got

bigger bigger and better it was like the

more they kept saying it was big more

people jumped in their cars he kept

coming you know and I was he really

expected maybe she made you trafficking

this time I really had to vote but like

today and tomorrow is gonna be any the

looky-loos we're gonna come and see what

they missed no but it's all good I'm

glad to be here

the whole place though it is great even

sitting here in the woods at your

campsite you can hear the music from the

stage you know you get to see and

interact with a lot of people that you

just don't see in their day-to-day life

you know we've been seeing the same

people year after year and you got we've

got a nice little crew here it's a

reunion every time it's great
