yes we don't comb Special Counsel

anymore mr. Robert Muller we can go more

into that if you wish but on one focus

one focus I want to make is in his

testimony he said that the Russians are

attacking our elections in a sweeping

and systemic fashion and that they are

doing it as we sit here a disruption of

our election that happened in 2016 and

now they are doing it again that was

Wednesday when mr. Muller testified him

person on that yesterday the Senate

Intelligence Committee released a

bipartisan report showing that the

elected election system in all 50 states

were targeted by Russia and yet the

president calls us a hoax and Senator

McConnell refuses to act just as the

other day in the Senate there were

something there were a number of bills

one of ours the SAFE Act that would save

our Federal Elections Act that the

Republicans objected to bringing to the

floor the pub this is a this is about

patriotism for our country our electoral

system is the heart of the matter of our

democracy and yet the Republicans still

continue to say no need to protect that

the path that we have is a one that

respects that the states could manage

our elections but when it comes to

federal elections we want them to have

the resources to do their job well

so we will continue to legislate on that

score legislate investigate and litigate

on that on other issues that mr. Muller

testified to as well

no I'm not trying to run out of pot

let's get sophisticated about this okay

okay would that be

we won't proceed when we have what we

need to proceed not one day similar and

everybody has the liberty and the luxury

to espouse their own position and to

criticize me for trying to go down the

path in the most determined positive way

again their advocacy for impeachment

only gives me leverage I have no

complaint with what they are doing but I

know the mother what president would

keep calling him special counsel mother

mr. Muller said the other day confirmed

confirmed in the public mind that the

president has obstructed justice you

know what he said it could have

exonerated own people whatever didn't

but he was not able to investigate the

president's finances personal business

or otherwise and that is what we are

doing in the courts so I'm willing to

take whatever heat there is there to say

when we run the decision will be made in

a timely fashion this is an endless and

when we have the best strongest possible

case and that's not endless either I

mean it may be endless in terms of the

violations of the law that the president

is engaged in but that's what I say to

you I don't think there was any hatchet

well that's that's that's we're in that

political arena let me just say this

because I have some level of confidence

and actually joy and seeing diversity in

our caucus we are the Democratic Party

ever since I came here we have been

engaged in differences in a pen of

opinion

in our caucus and that is a good thing

we are not a lockstep rubber-stamp

representation of anything except

representatives of our district and what

that means

so in our caucus we have our differences

respect that instead of making a big

issue of it respect that those are our

differences and how we express ourselves

as representatives of our districts is

our responsibility I've never seen

actually like yesterday we had 219 votes

for the bill if anybody asked any

questions about that

219 a very unified very unified caucus

in doing what we needed to do for the

American people even though it was a

compromise even though it was a

compromise I certainly wanted more but

it was a compromise when we win the

White House and we win the United States

Senate and we continue to win the House

of Representatives and we'll have more

leverage in that conversation but I

don't think they're ever I would never

even say that it was a hatchet but I do

think that we we sat down today we had a

good meeting and the congresswoman is a

very gracious member of Congress so

we've had a very positive conversation

about our districts and how we represent

them our country and how we need to meet

the needs the diversity of America and

the challenges we face in terms of

issues and how immigration and people

are respected I again referenced Ronald

Reagan as opposed to the current

occupant of the White House so I feel

I've always felt I again it's like your

and a family and a family you have your

differences but you're still family is

that your family your family always

agree on everything you do have meetings

in your family oh my god oh my goodness

well you may be a model for us and we

just had a meeting to clear the air
