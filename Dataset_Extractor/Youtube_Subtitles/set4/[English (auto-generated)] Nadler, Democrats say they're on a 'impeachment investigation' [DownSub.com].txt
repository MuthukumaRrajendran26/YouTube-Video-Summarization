you're examining and investigating the

various malfeasance 'iz and crimes and

so forth of the of the president we will

reach Lee or going into court and asking

for more information and for subpoenas

we are telling the court that we are

doing this not just this part of normal

oversight but also because it's part of

our article 1 authority and

responsibility to consider all remedies

including possibility of articles of

impeachment and that's what we're going

to do now whether you call that an

inquiry or whatever you want to call

that it's what we've been doing and we

are doing and we'll continue to do well

first of all it's not this decision a

lot of different decisions and now I

don't is possible case is to tell the

court what we're telling the court which

you'll see in the court you'll I think

we're gonna give you copies of the court

filings and I quoted part of the

relevant paragraph and that is that we

are I'll read it again the house must

have access to all relevant facts

consider whether Texas and consider

whether to exercise its full article 1

powers including a constitutional power

of the utmost gravity recommendation of

articles of impeachment that falls in

the first instance to the House

Committee on the judiciary what we are

telling the court and this is and one of

the purposes of telling the court is to

say we are exercising a highest

authority is that we are considering the

the malfeasance is of the president we

are considering what remedies we can do

including the possibility of articles of

impeachment

Jamie but I was just gonna say there

there's no formal constitutional or

statutory or even house rule for how an

impeachment inquiry is to begin and so

it means different things to different

people a lot of people believe we've

been in an impeachment inquiry ever

since we started looking into potential

high crimes and misdemeanors and the

misconduct of the executive branch other

people thinking impeachment Cory doesn't

begin until you actually have articles

of impeachment I would say we are an

impeachment investigation and as to the

results of the investigation it could

lead to articles of impeachment or it

could lead to something else but for

from my personal standpoint I think we

are in an impeachment investigation when

you look at different congress's in the

way they've addressed it they've done it

in different ways Nixon was done

different than with President Clinton

and what we are suggesting here is this

court filing is the first time that

you're seeing us Telegraph to the court

that one of the remedies we have is

impeachment and to consider whether that

should be used so that opens up and

should activate that grand jury material

so I support what mr. Raskin just said

which is this is an impeachment

investigation whether we should

recommend articles of impeachment to our

colleagues in fact what I'm saying is

that we are well I suppose there is one

difference which you could draw I mean

if you if you said that an impeachment

inquiry is when you're considering only

impeachment that's not what we're doing

we are investigating all of this and we

are going to see what remedies we could

recommend including the possibility of

otoscope impeach we're not limited to

that but that's very much the

possibility as a result of what we're

doing

well they're all for example the even

the special prosecutor special counsel

referred to to to mana to man afford to

man afford giving internal polling data

and other information about the from the

Trump campaign to someone who has

identified as an agent of the Russian

government doing that for months now

that wasn't followed up on by the report

but when raises the obvious question of

what use would be detailed polling

reports about Wisconsin and Michigan and

so forth to the Russians except to help

direct their interference they're

trolling their media operation their

social media operations that would be

very very serious obviously but there we

know they were giving the this internal

polling documentation which is normally

very held closely held secret in any

campaign to the Russians for what

purpose why do the Russians want it why

were they giving it that was not

followed up and by the by the and and

what conceivable purpose other than to

help them interfere in the election that

was not followed up also you look at

some of the financial things also you

look at the whole violation of the

emoluments Clause of the Constitution

which seems to be systemic and ongoing

there are a lot of different things that

weren't investigated by the by the by by

the Muller investigation which had which

conceived of its purview as very

restricted purview and we have to look

at we'll see where we want to go in all

this
