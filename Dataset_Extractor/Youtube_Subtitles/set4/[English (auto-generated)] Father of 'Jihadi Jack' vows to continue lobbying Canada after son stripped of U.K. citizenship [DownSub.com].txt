but when when they first told us I mean

he's just a choreo showed up and and

just said here and it was all quite a

shock on that day you know taking away a

British citizenship so that someone has

to be forced to go to Canada well as a

Canadian I think that's not such a bad

thing and and I'd like to see Jack there

and he was quite interested in going

there too but it's the injustice of it

all and the fact that you can't you know

he's he's obviously British as well and

he was born and raised here as much as

he spent lots of holidays and things in

Canada he mostly lived here I'm not

gonna try to change that I just think

it's so incredibly unfair I mean the the

papers we were given say that it's in

the public interest to strip him of his

produces and ship that it's not yeah

yeah that it's not conducive to his

presence in the UK or something but it's

also it says not in the public interest

for them to tell us or Jack why they've

taken away a citizenship which so and

and it says you have to send this notice

to him which is how we gonna do that

given he's in solitary confinement

pretty much and he can't talk to anyone

has no access to lawyers or anyone

medical treatment anything as far as we

know to be quite honest I don't even

know he's alive no then he has 28 days

to to appeal well we can't even

communicate with him I haven't spoken to

my son in over four years four and a

half years and we had it we had some app

messages through a messaging app two and

a half years ago when he first escaped

from from Isis territory and the Kurds

treated him really really well and he

was sending a lot of messages there but

I haven't actually directly spoken to

him in so long

so I know there's a whole pile of

feelings kind of going around but still

the massive feeling of frustration that

as a parent I still can't protect my

child and they won't let you and the

frustration that I still don't know of

any information of what

supposed to have done wrong if Jack

let's has done something wrong I will be

the first person to stand up and condemn

him publicly and asked for him to go on

trial and to be punished for what he did

because you know the horrible stories

you heard that Isis did the people to

use Edie's to all sorts of people you

know I utterly utterly condemn that and

I I agree with one of the lines in Ralph

Goodale statement that you know we have

to work together to stop terrorism and

these people should be punished they've

done something wrong but there's this

knee-jerk assumption always that Jack

was an Isis fighter where is this coming

from you know it was invented by a

journalist from The Sunday Times and

once you release that in the media it

just spins out of control and you know

you can't put the rabbit back in the Hat

and and it just gets more it's like a

snowball an avalanche it gets worse and

worse and worse ending up with him

having a citizenship stripped the only

evidence we have seen we've been on

trial well I'll try the trial lasted a

month but we've been prosecuted as you

probably know for about four and a half

years I had been see I've seen a lot of

information and if there was any

evidence that I felt that made Jack

guilty of anything

I really wouldn't be putting my face out

here in front of a television camera the

only evidence I know of is a photograph

of him with his finger in the air on a

rock outside Iraq now he went to Raqqa

because he'd been injured when they

dropped a bomb on his house and Raqqa

was the only functioning hospital that

could repair his arm and if you look

closely at that photo his head his arms

clearly been half blown off and that's

why he went to Raqqa it may have been

the capital of Isis but once you were

trapped inside Isis territory you

couldn't escape that was the big problem

he'd been living in Iraq with his wife

so you know jack was put on trial in

Mosul for standing up against against

Isis you know he opposed Isis he said

they were UNMIK I don't really care

where jack goes what I want him is not

to rot in a jail cell not to die where

he is he's got kidney disease there's

all sorts of things going on you know

I'm sure he's not emotionally in the

best State after four and a half years

and to now

years in in a jail cell he's never seen

his child he doesn't know his wife is

alive or dead he never speaks English I

just want him to be out everyone wants

to look really tough but you know being

tough might also be demonstrated that

you know can that that you can be beat

be tough on on crime but also respect

rights what makes us Canadian I keep

going back to it we have a right to be

considered innocent till proven guilty

you have a right to a fair trial isn't

that why we're different from those

people we were fighting against I think

of the rocky Cummings and I think of

Canada and I think Jack would have a

much better life there
