good afternoon we begin with breaking

news to Port Alberni teenagers thought

to be missing are now considered

suspects in the deaths of three people

in northern BC with more on this

shocking twist we are joined by Romina

daya Romina police just provided an

update what's the latest information

sonia is just moving at a stunning pace

at this point just incredible news this

morning that the missing teens are now

considered suspects in connection to

three bodies found in the course of a

week in northern BC last week cam

McCloud and Breyers Miguel ski 18 and 19

years old they're both quite tall six

for a hundred and sixty-nine pounds they

were last spotted in northern

Saskatchewan driving a grey 2011 rav4

the new pictures we're showing you are

actually taken from CCTV footage that is

not a file shot of the vehicle the

suspects are believed to be in that van

now RCMP are not saying where they were

spotted they're not pinpointing a

location because they're telling us that

that could jeopardize the investigation

but they're not giving any details as to

how that's a possibility at this point

the teens could be anywhere they may

have changed their appearance they may

have also changed their vehicle

yesterday I asked specifically about cam

McCloud and briars from the kelskiy

about whether or not they were suspects

in the homicide yesterday you looked at

this he told us that it was still a

missing-persons case

what has changed significantly

significantly since yesterday to make

these two men suspects in three murders

in one week I think that is a testament

of how dynamic and ever-changing the

information is thanks to the public

yesterday we had no information as to

cam and briers whereabouts and because

we made the appeal yesterday we now have

new information where we've confirmed

that they were seen in northern British

Columbia we've been able to confirm that

information within the last 24 hours

and I have been receiving new

information honestly before I just

stepped up on this stage new information

is still coming in now Sonia the police

are making a public appeal today not

just across this province but nationwide

for these teens they are saying that

they are considered dangerous

they're asking the public to exercise

extreme caution and vigilance and if you

see them do not approach you are asked

to call 911 Romina Police says staying

very tight-lipped about the cause of

deaths in these three homicides do we

know why as I mentioned earlier they're

saying that if they release any more

details it could possibly jeopardize the

investigation what we do know though is

that the double murder the tourists from

Australia and from the United States

that's Lucas Fowler and Chyna DS we know

that they were shot that's all police

will say as far as the other individual

the unidentified man that was found near

the teens camper van that was burned out

he was found about two kilometers away

we're all we're being told is that he

was found dead they're not saying

whether it's a homicide they're not

calling it a suspicious death they're

refusing to release any details about

that person's death Sonya

Romina dia joining us with that breaking

news thank you very much Romina
