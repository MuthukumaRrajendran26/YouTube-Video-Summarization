years that

emotions that have to be

the defense was

make motions having to do

I will say as to decline

content

what they allege

say that another time

but and none of them have any plans to

do any interviews at this

there are

a number of victims

who have not comfortable

cause they are in fear

I want to

share that any victim

who is not come forward

should come forward

this time

speak to private attorneys

no private attorney can disclose what an

accuser

says to her or him

and that's a court that they know they

can do

may not go to law enforcement but they

should know what their rights are

what the benefits and risks are

forward assimilate or

and I suggest that there's still time

for any

come forward and speak to a private

affair

some of the accusers that I represent

have come forward prior to the arrest

mr. Epstein

some have come forward since the arrest

mr.

it is not too late

to help in the process of sinking

at certain points it may be too late

it's not too late right now

and so I do urge any accusers

to another private attorney

we're new I'll just say coral

and they're still coming forward

as recently as this way

some are still coming this recently is

but as they say something

you've got their new coming

twelve idea of double jeopardy

the defense did raise the issue of

double

in late language which I shouldn't use

but I will

that I'll leave it to the defense

I'm sorry I can't hear you

[Music]

the double jeopardy issue is that a

smokescreen I think that the

we'll make its argument

that it's likely that the prosecution

will argue against it

I wouldn't I don't think it's here

characterize it

as it spoke Spanish

I'm sure they'll make every argument

that is possible

it's not frivolous

the census job to make that party

are you saying excuse me are you saying

about oh boy

I'm not

you should like me

it's an argument that the pencil

have you made your targets by me

not at sit not yet we

that's the question is

have I brought

users that I represent to the United

States Attorney's Office

their question is what's the basis of

the fear that some

have expressed

so

surprised too

any of the clients that I

that many persons who accuse

rich powerful famous

art and fear

that they could be calm

in some way

that would be here

economic harm reputation hotel

attacks

by people they don't know

I'm not going to say whether this year

is justified but definitely

have that beer

and sometimes there is a specific basis

for that here

being threatened you hear of him

and sometimes

a fear that they have because

they are not

individuals who

same way that

like hat

so it's just a generalized fear

and I'm not going to say whether or not

cific threats have been made

are you

I can't speak to whether miss Maxwell

should or should not be indicted whether

she

just have no information on that

such that I could draw any kind of

conclusion as to whether it is

I can't say

I can't disclose any info

what my clients a wedge

they're about the defendant

their potential

or person

might have any

man order to clients time

to say there's no incident

I'm sorry but I cannot

my

we're protecting that information

when I take their allegations very

I think that both sides should have an

opportunity

here

to try this case

although of course a defendant has a

morning felt that it needed more time to

compare the

there is quite a bit

by the government

through all that

it is really the defense this morning

the support said he

court defers

to the defense of the

mr. Epstein isn't

am i concerned about the defense trying

to drag this out

no because generally when

and is likely to remain

generally the defense wants

to have a trial as soon as possible

with the hope that after the trial their

client will be a

mr. would like to be free

unfortunately for him his veil motion

so

I would conclude from that that defense

really does one more time it's not an

argument that

delay it

mr. Epstein

the rest of his life in prison that's

possible

they want to make sure they're gonna be

here

and my sense of it is that it's likely

that the defense has asbestos with mr.

Epstein

the length of time they be

and that is agreed to that or

would not be seen

those extra months here

because

my educated guesses

mr. Epstein

so he would like that a trial she was

Bob

my education

ordinarily yes the defense wants the

defense

but that's generally

even though they're appealing from

the denial of the veil motion yes

I'm sorry but I can't

any names

that my clients have provided to me

so I can't affirm or deny if they have

had any kind

the drastic wait

the sir

I cannot disclose what I've reviewed

all right thank you so much
