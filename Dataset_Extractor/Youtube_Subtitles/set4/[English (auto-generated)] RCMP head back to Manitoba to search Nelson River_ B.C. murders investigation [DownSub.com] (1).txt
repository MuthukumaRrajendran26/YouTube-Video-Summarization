police are back on the Nelson River

members of the search and rescue team

hit the water at around noon local time

this boat launch is where the staging

area was set up on Wednesday when the

bodies were recovered we didn't have

this kind of access on that day so this

gives you an idea of how police had to

get the bodies they had to park at this

dock and then take about a 15 minute

boat ride to where the bodies were

located in a very tough to reach spot

load the bodies on the boat and then

drive them back to this loading dock

so now police are heading back there

today to see if any clues were left

behind if they missed any evidence

they're gonna they're gonna search the

area where the bodies were found and

areas the surrounding area about six

search-and-rescue members are are they

are gonna be searching the area I'm told

three they're gonna be split split up in

threes so three in one location and

another three will be dropped off at

another location to go over the area for

about four hours I'm told

and police say we should be getting an

update after the search is complete
