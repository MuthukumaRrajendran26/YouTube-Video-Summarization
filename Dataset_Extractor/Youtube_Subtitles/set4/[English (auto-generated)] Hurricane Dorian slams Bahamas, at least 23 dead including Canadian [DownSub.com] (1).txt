we are watching that massive hurricane

that devastated the Bahamas and killed

more than 20 people including a Canadian

right now the eye of Hurricane Dorian is

just off the Carolinas on the American

East Coast Dorian has regained some

strength and grown in size it's now a

category 2 hurricane and its outer bands

are thrashing South Carolina's coastal

communities tonight more than 200,000

homes and businesses are without power

and the pounding rain is triggered flash

flooding intense winds are packing gusts

close to 210 kilometers an hour and

there have been reports of tornadoes

people right along the coast are

preparing for the worst and for good

reason

this is what Dorian did to parts of the

Bahamas where it hovered for 40 hours on

the Abaco Islands there are only ruins

now rescue crews are only now getting to

remote areas and the death toll at 23 is

expected to rise we know a Canadian

woman is among the dead on the Abaco

Islands Alicia

Leo Lee was from Windsor Ontario

harrowing accounts are emerging from

survivors of the hurricane who are now

being reunited with family some say they

thought they'd never be rescued our Mike

Joe Leigh is in NASA the capital of the

Bahamas tonight

Donna Leo Lee lived in the Bahamas and

worked at a school for adults with

special needs

you can add her name to what is expected

to be a growing list of people who've

died as a result of this storm

from his hotel room a Reuters

photographer experienced the moment

hurricane durian first hit Abaco island

in the Bahamas that's pretty bad we're

now going into a common area hopefully

I'll be safer as we now know nothing was

safe about durian which is tied for the

second strongest Atlantic storm to ever

make landfall with winds as strong as

this neither Abaco nor Grand Bahamas

stood a chance

a monster hurricane durian battered the

Bahamas for over two days with winds

that topped out at a record matching 298

kilometers per hour

hgtv contractor in bahamas resort owner

brian Ballmer has set up a GoFundMe page

to help those hit hardest from what

we've seen some of our pilots have flown

into Abaco and it's I mean those two

islands have completely gone through a

blender and people that had you know

relatively little have absolutely

nothing left and the emergency crisis

center in NASA experts frantically

worked to put together a plan to get aid

to the islands and a vacuous off them

hampering their progress nobody here has

ever seen a storm like durian and while

they've evacuated hundreds of people at

a time before they now have to figure

out how to move tens of thousands we

bought our Akane's before many

hurricanes throughout the Bahamas in

different islands but this one is very

different this was a category 5 that

came and stayed the number of missing on

social media lists are in the thousands

there are stories of people seeing

bodies allowing among debris a scene

described as a horror movie never ever

seen anything like this this was just

just so far beyond anyone's imagination

[Music]

the hope is that over the next few days

the flood of supplies will increase from

the trickle we're seeing right now and

the Bahamas can finally start taking

back some of what Dorian took Donna and

Mike some of the worst damage on the

Abaco island seems to have been to a

shanty town where thousands of Haitian

migrant workers live they have little

before the hurricane and now they must

be completely destitute

well far too many people who had far too

little to begin with have even less

right now and we spoke with a pilot

today who flew over one of these air

strips that has yet to open he says

people who have nothing are now huddling

they're waiting for the evacuation

planes to start coming in to save them
