the cleanup effort begins the sun is

shining that's good news but also the

winds have died down and that is why

crews like the one behind me have been

working since dawn and they are going to

be added for quite some time it's just

incredible as we were driving around

this morning block after block after

block massive trees coming down covering

the roads and obviously falling on

powerlines and that is the biggest issue

when will electricity be restored many

are hoping it's sooner rather than later

but with over 350,000 still in the dark

in Nova Scotia alone it's gonna be quite

some time and Nova Scotia power saying

that this is the biggest cleanup effort

that they've ever had to deal with well

yesterday was rather incredible because

just after dinnertime the I the center

of durian it was a category to move

directly over over over Halifax and the

wind's calm down the birds were out and

then we got the backside and there was

wind from a different direction but it

was such a fast mover that today the

storms already in the Gulf of st.

Lawrence it's headed through

Newfoundland it's weakening some but all

of the Maritimes are dealing with nicer

conditions and that is some good news

that durian finally after those five

land falls and all of the destruction is

finally weakening moving out into the

Atlantic and that name durian you'll

never hear that again as far as future

Hurricanes go it will be retired coming

up in the next year well we were talking

to some people in the hotel we were

staying at thankfully we had power we

didn't actually lose it throughout the

storm because they were underground

wires but the people we had talked to

there's a tentative restoration time for

some of the bit main parts of Halifax of

eleven o'clock tonight and that may be

ambitious when you see the trees that

came down and the poles that were

completely snapped it's not just a

matter of removing the damage you may

have to rebuild parts of the grid and I

do think that's gonna take some time

even with the relief efforts coming in

and also I believe they're getting armed

services to help out as well over the

next couple of

days
