let's go back one more time to our chief

meteorologist Anthony Farnell who is

standing by live on the Halifax

waterfront soaking wet Anthony the

pictures we've been seeing throughout

the day of the damage caused by this

storm have really been incredible there

is more to come tonight there is and

it's a different storm going forward

right now relative calm we get the

occasional gust here in downtown Halifax

but it's not nearly as strong or as

persistent as it was say just an hour

ago the rain is also lightening up and

we're not gonna see much more than a

shower after say 8 o'clock tonight so

conditions are improving in that regard

the wind however has been just howling

coming in off the Atlantic Ocean from

the east that's also been piling water

up the boardwalk the waves crashing over

some flooding as well that wind is now

switching as the storm passes by it's

gonna switch to the northwest and then

west as we move through the night

tonight that's good and bad news it's

coming off of land so that's obviously

better it'll push the water right back

out into the Atlantic but it's also a

different direction so if there are tree

branches that are still stuck in trees

or maybe on power lines a complete

reversal in wind direction is going to

cause those to come down and we still

are expecting 100 to 120 kilometres per

hour gusts as this now post tropical

storm moves past and even though it has

lost its true hurricane characteristic

which is the strongest winds right near

the center Sarah it's still nothing to

laugh at because we're still going to

see that backside like you would in a

true hurricane with winds in this case

still quite strong for the region
