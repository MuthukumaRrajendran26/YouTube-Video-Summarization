police received a call for assistance

from the ambulance regarding assistance

for a boating collision on Lake Joseph

at approximately 11:30 on the

24th of August

it was was in a boating collision on

late Joseph in speakman concha Ontario

that's approximately two hours north of

Toronto at this time in the

investigation the OPP ate the OPP is

unable to comment on which via vessel

hit vessel and that'll be determined at

the end of the investigation ah there

again we're unable to comment on how

many people were involved on each vessel

unfortunately

to occupants have succumbed to injuries

and three others were transported to

hospital treated and released at this

point the police aren't going to confirm

any identity of any persons on any

vessel or the registered owners of any

vessel for the fleeting of the scene

both vessels had left the scene and when

they reached a location both vessels

were in touch with ambulance for

emergency services yes both vessels were

transported to the West parry sound

attachment for the collision marine

collision unit to inspect as well as

friends excited well I think if we take

a look at the time of day being that 11

o'clock at night knowing that it is dark

out usually on during the night the cup

the water is quite calm so it does make

it difficult to see any breaking water

at the base of any object that is in

front of you so of course the OPP would

want to make sure that boating safety is

recognized make sure you're not

traveling too fast especially at night

if you have navigational links you've

got to make sure that they are working

making sure that you have a cell phone

that is fully charged making sure of

course that you're always wearing a life

jacket and obviously don't operate any

vehicles or machinery if you're not

sober
