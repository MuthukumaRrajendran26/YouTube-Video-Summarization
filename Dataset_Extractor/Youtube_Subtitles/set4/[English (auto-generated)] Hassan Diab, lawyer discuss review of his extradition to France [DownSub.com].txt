the people at the Department of Justice

as if it did I did not exist

the public has difficulty to distinguish

an extradition process and trial I would

disagree with the report when he accused

somehow the public of being ignorant

I read the term ignorant the lack of

understanding of the procedures and

processes of the extradition law fuels

this public ignorant that's the term I

believe he used it's the people are not

ignorant the public is not ignorant

people know what the ethical things at

least if they don't know the law or the

legal procedures and the legal jorgens

it doesn't mean they don't understand

that sending letters to the French

prosecutor at the time or French judge

asking him to Bolden and enforce his

whatever reports and his dossier this is

I don't know under what ethical base

this we can you know look at and they

said oh it was very ethical it was

lawful and it was very professional but

people know the difference between you

know all these three I think we should

have an extradition treaty with France

do you think their criminal justice

system well this is a small one a minor

thing the acceleration act itself is a

problem when you solve the biggest you

know larger problem you can solve the

details of the problem the treaty is

part of this whole thing I know you

wanted Hassan's answer couldn't I just

add to what you asked because it's a

pertinent question the report among

other things in its

not-so-subtle endorsement of the

existing system tries to explain to

Canadians look it's so different from a

criminal trial you can't have these

rights you can't have those rights

you're allowed not to disclose you're

allowed to do this you're allowed to do

that without being aware it seems

there's no self-awareness that this

might be a problem

and one of the justifications is that

extradition relies on trust and comity

between nations comity is the mutual

recognition of the laws of the other

country France doesn't extradite its

citizens to Canada they would not do it

there is no trust or comity from France

about the Canadian system trying

Frenchmen yet Canadians keep using this

argument to justify the sending of this

man to France you first saw the

conclusion that essentially the system

worked properly in this case yeah maybe

I said it earlier Ben you know if the

conclusion if the system worked nicely

and properly in this case how come we

have this problem you know if you cook

something and then you burn the thing

and then you said nothing I did nothing

wrong but you can't eat the food what do

you do you said there was something

wrong maybe you left there you know the

stove for so long you left it on and so

there is something wrong but could you

find in the hundred twelve pages

anything wrong they they report pointed

out to I couldn't find I was waiting

from and then the last conclusion which

was on page 112 its it says conclusion

four hundred twelve pages you have half

a page conclusion you don't understand

what

what you know when students write the

paper like three four pages they write

half a page conclusion 111 pages and

then you come to the conclusion half a

page to say nothing 14 recommendations

in there to change the system including

a recommendation to share exculpatory

evidence even if there isn't an

obligation to do so is there anything in

the recommendations that mr. Siegel

offers that you see as progress I didn't

see any substantial one except some

recommendations to shield more those

people in power in the Justice

Department and one of them was like a

reminiscent of George Orwell's idea of

Ministry of propaganda we need to

educate people we need to let them know

how this system works it's like calling

for an in you know an establishment of

some new ministry ministry of propaganda

can I add to that question that by and

large the recommendations are cosmetic

and serve to further streamline the

expedition of the system rather than the

protection of Canadians it would be

unfair not to say that there is a useful

recommendation that whenever expert

reports are involved the whole of the

report and the material on which it

relies should be disclosed the one the

example that you gave about a suggestion

that there should be a discretion as

opposed to a duty to disclose

exculpatory evidence that shows that the

person isn't the culprit that he's

claimed to be or that undermines the

reliability of the evidence in the

record of the case quite frankly it's a

surprising recommendation it suggests

well just give them a discretion to do

this they already have that discretion

that it's called ethics

it's called doing the right thing but

mr. Siegel in his report says these

lawyers for the IAG doing these

extradition cases aren't officers of the

Attorney General in the conventional

sense bound by the Bouchet rules of

being a minister of justice serving all

Canadians in a case their partial

adversary advocates serving a foreign

state

apart from that proposition which should

be publicly debated it's not the view of

the Supreme Court of Canada who write

the Attorney General is not an ordinary

party miss the report says they are and

they don't have these obligations this

special character manifests itself in

the role of crown attorneys who has

agents of the Attorney General and the

IAG and DOJ our agents and represent the

Attorney General in each one of these X

traditions they have broader

responsibilities to the court and to be

accused as local ministers of justice so

even the view that is taken of their

role is troubling it was mentioned one

and one of the decisions of the Court of

Appeals a Court of Appeals decision they

you know talked about this point

Oh at the time he wasn't this citizen so

you can't conclude anything you want in

1980 I wasn't certain alien citizen so

to justify you know the second hand kind

of treatment they did

you had a different kind of treatment

from the whole Canadian justice system

when you read it and the you know the

Court of Appeals decision it's not even

if you feel it but when you read it you

say well it's here they said and of

course there are you know many

categories of citizens here

I hope they you know Prime Minister was

right all people are Canadians but here

we see you know some Canadian some

people are Canadians others are quasi

Canadians maybe deep in the weeds on

extradition law here but where do you

think the problem is with the

extradition law as it's written now that

allowed this to happen and can you

compare our extradition law with other

jurisdictions that have a higher

standard of evidentiary closed

disclosure the preventive so it would be

getting into the weeds my letters to the

prime minister and justice minister were

at least five type pages of what is

wrong an example it's just an example

there's no sworn evidence required in an

extradition to deprive a Canadian of her

or his liberty there is in Canadian

domestic proceedings so Liberty is

gravely at stake all that's required is

what is called a record of the case a

document not sworn simply certified by

some foreign official and that document

is presumed to be reliable even sworn

evidence in Canada is not presumed to be

reliable it has to demonstrate its

reliability so the record of the case in

dr. Deb's case was presumed to be

reliable when it claimed that the key

Hotel card that the bomber handled

signing into the hotel bore no usable

fingerprints that was not only not

reliable it was a lie

in 2007 the French with enhanced

investigative techniques found a usable

fingerprint on the Bombers hotel card

they examined it it was not hassan d ab

they knew that two years before they

started this process and claimed there

was no usable fingerprint canadiens

during his extradition hearing secretly

contacted France without telling the

court or the defense and asked France to

send the bomber was also detained by the

police and a number of fingerprints were

found on the Bombers statement and

secretly the Department of Justice got

that statement sent to Canada and the

RCMP conducted a fingerprint analysis

and all the identifiable prints on it

excluded dr. dia mr. Siegel and his

report calls this inconclusive equivocal

it's perfectly conclusive even in the

letter that the Department of Justice

wrote to the French it identifies the

evidence that will come from this

fingerprint examination as powerful if

not conclusive

it was perfectly conclusive and just to

show you how little factual factually

correct information is in this report in

fact the French found 20 identifiable

prints

eight of them were the police officer

who was interrogating him the other 12

all excluded dr. D AB the report calls

this equivocal it's not equivocal the

Department of Justice themselves called

it powerful if not conclusive and yet it

was suppressed and the report says

justified in doing that was your view

had the extradition judge and aware of

that well don't you think he would have

had a very different view of this

marginal reliability of this handwriting

opinion versus scientific fingerprint

evidence of course it was relevant

so greater disclosure there shouldn't be

a presumption of reliability we've got

proof that one of our most trusted

allies misrepresented here now to their

credit the French investigative judges

did what Canadian courts didn't do they

gave this man justice they did what the

Canadian Court said they weren't going

to do conduct a three year investigation

while he languished I don't know how the

Court of Appeal seemed to know in

advance that wouldn't happen when we put

before them evidence that they were not

ready to put him on trial

that's what extradition is for it's to

send the person for trial not for

investigation there are so many areas of

potential reform to make this properly

protective of Canadians and compliant

with the Charter it's a backwater of

Canadian law that has survived this way

because so few Canadians so few lawyers

so few judges ever see it and the IAG

that little department in department of

justice has created the law

this and it serves them well the case of

the Alawi executive I was wondering how

you think dr. Diaz case affects the

Canadian government's ability to defend

its extradition law in such a delicate

international situation well very senior

American officials have made public

statements that in the past in Canadian

law have been held to be abusive of the

process so there may be some unusual

wrinkles in that case including that

Canada has no sanctions like Iran does

like the u.s. does I'm sorry in trading

with Iran and so there's a real issue

about double criminality in the main

case there are different issues in that

case and unique ones
