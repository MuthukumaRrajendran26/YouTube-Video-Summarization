it's another uncertain evening up and

down the coast of Florida with Dorian's

path and timing still questionable at

this point it seems like Tuesday is the

most likely point of arrival but the

system continues to slow where exactly

it might land remains an open question

and so the entire East Coast of Florida

is on edge we've seen a run on supplies

at stores here many of the shelves for

essentials like bread and water are

completely empty at this point most gas

stations have already run dry and again

we're several days away from the arrival

of this storm we've heard that the

airport in Orlando will be shutting down

its operations at 2:00 a.m. on Monday

the governor has also announced that

fuel tankers will be moving out under

police escort to try and reinforce

supplies before the storms arrival but

the bottom line is it's still a waiting

game and a guessing game people don't

know whether or not to stay put or

whether they should leave their homes

they don't know what exactly to stock up

on at this point because so much of

Dorian is uncertain the only thing that

is known is that it is a monster of a

storm churning offshore and getting ever

closer by the day Jackson prosecco
