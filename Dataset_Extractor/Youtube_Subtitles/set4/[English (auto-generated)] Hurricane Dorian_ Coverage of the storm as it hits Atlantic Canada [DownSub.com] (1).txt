you're watching global Maritimes

this is Global News at 6:00 good evening

thank you for joining us for this

special edition of Global Maritimes we

have coverage of the impacts of

hurricane durian from the Halifax area

where the storm is making landfall to

New Brunswick but we are going to begin

tonight with our chief meteorologist

Anthony final who is standing by live in

Halifax with details on what we can

expect to see in the next several hours

Anthony sera it has been a crazy day so

far with this front end of Hurricane

Dorian now a category 2 hurricane and

that is because of some winds that were

found on the backside a little bit

earlier this afternoon 160 kilometers

per hour winds officially we have had

gusts in 140 150 range within the

Halifax area and that has caused

obviously some trees to come down power

outages are widespread as you'll talk

more about but this radar says it all

all of that green and yellow and red

that's out there well that is all the

front half of the storm the back half

there's barely any rain there is however

quite a bit of wind so as far as the

flooding concern goes river levels are

going to continue to go up even as the

rain tapers off but what we're seeing as

far as storm surge is a different story

and earlier we were right down by the

boardwalk here in Halifax the waves

crashing up during high tide in fact

they were crashing right through

underneath the boardwalk and that caused

some damage up and down and of course

beach erosion is a big concern once you

get out into the open Atlantic in those

shores and we have now some of the boys

that are reporting waves in the 8 to 12

meter range and that is incredible stuff

the backside that's what we have left to

get through already the winds are a lot

lighter here sera than they were just a

couple of hours ago so what's left of

the eye well that's what's moving

through Halifax now that's going to

allow some emergency crews to get out

there but don't do too much outside

because I am telling you that we're

gonna see some hundred plus kilometer

per hour gusts on the back

this time though the wind coming in from

the west and northwest and that's gonna

bring more trees down and unfortunately

it's gonna be a long night so still a

lot to get through but the glimmer of

hope is that right now we're seeing dory

in a post-tropical hurricane if that

makes any sense it's basically losing

its tropical characteristics but we are

going to see as it comes to shore

finally conditions improving later

tonight Sarah all right thank you so

much for this anthony anthony Farnell

will be back with us later in the show

with more and meteorologist ross hall

will have your full forecast coming up

in a few minutes

well as this storm continues to

intensify the federal government is

already pledging health with the

recovery

Minister of Public Safety and emergency

preparedness Ralph Goodale says Nova

Scotia has asked for help and the

military is being mobilized to deploy to

the province but as Jesse Thomas tells

us it's likely the cleanup won't begin

in earnest until tomorrow heavy wind

gusts and torrential rain hammered

halifax early Saturday afternoon as the

storm intensified

uprooted and broken trees littered

streets across the peninsula damaging

parked cars and blocking streets another

reason to stay indoors loose items from

construction sites police closed this

street after four by six sheets of

plywood were sent sailing down the

street emergency management officials

say those airborne items pose a great

danger to the public and we're asking

contractors to clean up any loose

materials we've been getting complaints

today and notifications about lumber

material left unattended construction

sites unsecured so those are a big

concern right now we've been working

with our policing partners all morning

trying to identify companies and

reaching out to them

late in the afternoon a construction

crane collapse onto an unfinished

building downtown a clear example of the

danger with this kind of wind heavy wind

gust even tore a large chunk of roof off

a 50 unit apartment building Halifax

fire was on scene to help evacuate the

tenants while city transit were taking

those stranded to an evacuation center

being run by the Red Cross volunteers

across Nova Scotia and the rest of

Atlantic Canada are on standby to

respond and we will support communities

that are impacted by this disaster by

mid-afternoon high tide saw strong storm

surges pounding the Halifax Harbour and

rocking ships at the dock the damage is

building up even before the hurricane

makes landfall

Sara the winds continue to get stronger

and stronger and the damage reports they

continue to climb

Halifax fire they're everywhere

responding to calls of downed power

lines and trees that have been broken or

uprooted that are blocking streets now

as it continues to get darker we likely

won't get an idea the full extent of the

damage until the Sun comes up tomorrow

morning yeah and Jessie you you

mentioned in that package the situation

downtown as you were seeing debris

flying off of Fenwick towers just talk

to me about how dangerous that situation

be Sara that's that's been a big concern

especially well we got a major gust

coming through right now but flying

debris was one of the major concerns and

we saw roof get torn off a building on

Tobin Street and probably landed 70

yards down on Queen Street now they did

have to evacuate 50 people as you

mentioned that item they are heading to

one of those emergency evacuation

centers for the night Red Cross has set

up different locations across the city

but winds are getting strong here we've

got flying debris even coming down gajin

Street here out front of the global news

studios absolutely be safe out there

Jessie thank you so much that is Jesse

Thomas live tonight in Halifax and he'll

be continuing our coverage tomorrow as

well

as expected today's high winds have

caused issues with the power grid since

early in the day Nova Scotia power has

said it has crews on standby but of

course those crews will not be fixing

lines until it is safe for them to be

out there as of the latest update there

are more than 300 11,000 customers

without power across Nova Scotia the

largest outages are in the Halifax area

where more than 150 thousand are in the

dark the utility is listing restoration

times into Monday evening in New

Brunswick power outages have been

reported since early in the afternoon

particularly in the southeastern part of

the province right now there are more

than 14,000 customers without power most

in communities along the Bay of Fundy

and the utility is saying it cannot

provide restoration times until crews

can get out to safely assess the damage

as Jesse was mentioning there are three

evacuation centers open for those in

need of shelter in the Halifax area

those are at the

Miss East Community Center the Canada

Game Center and the st. Margaret Center

the shelters are being run by the

Canadian Red Cross and are offering

overnight accommodations if needed storm

surge and the damage that comes with it

is a huge concern with this storm and

that includes areas of the Eastern Shore

which are expected to be among the

hardest hit by the wind and the waves

our Alexa MacLean joins us now live from

Dartmouth she spent the day on the

Eastern Shore Alexa what is the latest

whoo-hoo Sarah will hello to everyone

from the safety of the Woodside ferry

terminal shelter Thank You Halifax

Transit for giving us a bit of a break

our journey

Andorian started on the Eastern Shore as

you mentioned we headed towards stony

Beach Lawrencetown Beach now these are

areas that are known for great waves on

moderately stormy days but Dorian showed

up with a vengeance and we're going to

show you some of the footage we gathered

here we had a lot of storm surge early

on about two hours ago things started

picking up and boy oh boy was it ever

fierce now the waves kept rolling in one

after another and as you can imagine

Lawrence Town Beach Road well it started

to flood very rapidly and we have since

learned that the road has been closed

and that is a positive thing folks

because safety is the main concern once

we wrapped up there we hurt we headed

back into the heart of the city

Dartmouth and of course you could see

the significant impact of these high

high winds the trees they were gusting

and some have fallen right onto the

middle of the road and in the heart of

Dartmouth on Pleasant Street there were

crews out clearing up what was a massive

tree trunk that fell down in the middle

of the street

a hardy residential area and of course

safety there is a huge concern so these

crews were doing what they could to

clear out the trees in between the gust

of wind making more of a risk with

further trees falling down the power

lines as you can see now of course the

eye of the storm was about 40 minutes

ago it was eerie it was beautiful and

Sarah let me tell you if I was out of

this shelter you and it be seeing me

the wind is picking back up folks and it

is fierce please stay inside please stay

safe hope those chips will keep you cozy

back to you thanks so much Alexa you

stay safe as well that is our Alexa

McClain reporting live tonight from

Dartmouth well New Brunswick is also

taking a hit from Dorian especially in

the southeastern part of the province as

we mentioned just moments ago heavy rain

and high winds have been intensifying

there throughout the day as Andrew

Cromwell reports some were still

battening down the hatches while others

were out to marvel at mother nature Jill

as year tries to protect his property

from the wind and rain of Dorian and he

has his work cut out for him with

conditions worsening as the day

progressed more people came out to check

on their boats in sheti act I just came

to check on the boats see I make sure

everything is okay others like Nadine

gallant were dropping by just to check

things out a couple of hours away in st.

John more rain and wind but no major

problems reported during the day still

some people weren't taking any chances

and closing up possible trouble spots

yeah when you hear hurricane yeah you

immediately think of strong winds and

especially when there's a lot of trees

around us you never know exactly what's

gonna happen

Kevin Clifford is st. John's Fire Chief

and heads of the city's emergency

measures organization he says people

need to remain vigilant well if they can

stay home stay home you know even even

driving in today to be part of this

operation I was thinking about things

that could fall on me because of the

high wind Clifford also encourages

people to think of others who may need

your help when a storm strikes you got

neighbors that aren't as you know as as

young as you may be and then folks who

may be you know they may have things

around their homes that that aren't

secure now keep an eye on your neighbors

and if you can help and keep yourself

safe at the same time be prepared to do

so good advice as you stare down a storm

that is all

taking lives and left widespread damage

in its path

Andrew Cromwell global news st. John

before durian hit our region as a strong

category one hurricane it lead of

beating on the Bahamas particularly the

eastern part of Grand Bahama today the

area is bearing the scars of this

ferocious system and what made it worse

durian parked itself over the island for

almost 40 hours with winds in excess of

240 kilometers per hour as you can see

there's not much left standing in the

little seaside enclave of High Rocks

reportedly only a church and a nearby

oil storage facility withstood this

storm however there are multiple reports

indicating the storage terminal was

damaged and is leaking oil of course

that is raising environmental concerns

but for the most part people the four

people the only the course of action is

to sift through the rubble searching for

any salvageable items meanwhile the

Canadian government says it's providing

emergency military support to areas in

the Bahamas Global Affairs Canada says a

Canadian Armed Forces Hercules hair

craft has been sent to provide air lifts

Ottawa previously sent a disaster

assistance team and $500,000 to the

region the death toll in the Bahamas is

now above 40 and is expected to climb

more than 70 thousand people have been

left homeless it is time now for a look

at your full forecast and for that we're

going to go to meteorologist Ross hull

Ross you and I drew the indoor

assignments for it today certainly been

a dangerous day we've seen incredible

pictures from right across the region

all day today and this is quite the

potent storm and we'll hear more I

believe from Anthony coming up let's

talk first about of course the here and

now the warnings continue hurricane

warnings in red for the Atlantic coast

of Nova Scotia stretching east indicate

Breton we've got tropical storm warnings

as well farther north into the province

and across Prince Edward Island and of

course that storm surge of concern on

the Atlantic coast the Gulf of st.

Lawrence - and not to mention the heavy

rainfall we have seen some heavy bands

of rain move through I'll show you what

to expect coming up let's take a look at

that radar satellite Anthony mentioning

what was left of the eye now starting to

move north and east the center of the

storm if you will it's now become extra

post-tropical it's a hurricane forest

post tropical storm still a potent storm

but the center of that storm about 80

kilometers southwest of Halifax moving

towards the Northeast at about 40 km/h

this is an enhanced satellite image yes

the center of the storm moving towards

Halifax but look at how widespread this

storm has become so it has expanded and

look at the latest track expects to

weaken as it moves north and east but

don't put your guard down just yet

because when the I the south side of

that eye moves through still some strong

wind gusts expected over 100 km/h in

certain cases I thought I'd show you

some of those winds that area in red

you're seeing is winds close to 100 in

kilometres per hour 80 to 100 notice by

well Sunday things do start certainly

start to ease by the overnight they will

but around Cape Breton still some strong

westerly winds and all areas start to

see a break by Monday there's the center

of the storm making landfall heavy rain

mainly to the north of Halifax still

some heavy bands though possible and you

can see the heaviest rain along the eye

or the center of that storm but the

worst is over as we head through

tomorrow morning still some breezy

conditions and there will be calmer

weather as we head into Monday - for the

anticipated cleanup looking at rainfall

amounts over the next 48 hours this is

on top of what's already fallen as we

look at your forecast now for tomorrow

and Moncton 16 degrees nice to see that

sunshine icon isn't it same situation in

Halifax much calmer weather conditions

expected as we take a look now at how

things are working over the next seven

days in Fredericton calm conditions on

Monday into Tuesday chance of showers

Wednesday and more showers into Thursday

well it looks like some sunshine into

Friday and Saturday of next weekend and

Halifax is a calmer day tomorrow high of

17 up to 20 on Monday with some sunshine

next chance of showers looks to be on

Wednesday Thursday things look to clear

up by the weekend on Friday and Saturday

but of course we're still keeping an eye

on this powerful storm Sara as it starts

to move onshore Anthony for now we'll

have the latest of course on social

media and of course on global news dot

CA all right thanks so much for this

Ross let's go back one more time to our

chief meteorologist Anthony Farnell who

is standing by live on the Halifax

waterfront soaking wet Anthony the

pictures we've been seeing throughout

the day of the damage caused by this

storm have really been incredible there

is more to come tonight there is and

it's a different storm going forward

right now relative calm we get the

occasional gust here in downtown Halifax

but it's not nearly as strong or as

persistent as it was say just an hour

ago the rain is also lightening up and

we're not gonna see much more than a

shower after say 8 o'clock tonight so

conditions are improving in that regard

the wind however has been just howling

coming in off the Atlantic Ocean from

the east that's also been piling water

up the boardwalk the waves crashing over

some flooding as well that wind is now

switching as the storm passes by it's

gonna switch to the northwest and then

west as we move through the night

tonight that's good and bad news it's

coming off of land so that's obviously

better it'll push the water right back

out into the Atlantic but it's also a

different direction so if there are tree

branches that are still stuck in trees

or maybe on power lines a complete

reversal in wind direction is going to

cause those to come down and we still

are expecting hundred to 120 kilometer

per hour gusts as this now post tropical

storm moves past and even though it has

lost its true hurricane characteristic

which is the strongest winds right near

the center Sara it's still nothing to

laugh at because we're still gonna see

that backside like you would in a true

hurricane with winds in this case still

quite strong for the region Sarah all

right thanks again Anthony Anthony

Farnell is going to be here all weekend

keeping you up-to-date so just before we

leave you tonight some important things

to keep in mind for the next couple of

days the city of Halifax has issued a
