when the death toll has been a

contentious issue here in the Bahamas

while the government has insisted on a

slow and methodical approach to removing

and counting the dead Bohemians are

getting impatient because they know

there are far more people who died than

has been reported

Patrick sent its grim work removing

bodies in the tropics a week after a

disaster emotionally it's even harder to

comprehend because those doing the job

are Bahamian and the government decided

this wasn't something they could ask

strangers to do but still they need

teams like the urban search and rescue

experts from the Burnaby Fire Department

13 men four dogs and the experience of

knowing how to find bodies in rubble

this is where they'll be for the next

few days Marsh Harbour on Abaco island

which was wiped out by a five meter high

wall of water their jobs will be to

locate in geotag the bodies but not

remove them from what I've heard because

there were people at the hotel from up

there they said that there is quite a

smell in the air and which would mean is

quite a few body

how many is still unknown the death toll

is expected to rise into the hundreds

possibly even the thousands and the

Bahamian government is still trying to

come up with a plan for those who

survived

every few hours a new plane lands with

more evacuees

were processed and then taken to

shelters how long will they stay where

will they ultimately go nobody really

knows the boodle family was fortunate

one of NASA's resorts opened its doors

but in truth they're not relaxing it's

paradise right now but what I went

through was a living hell

Emmitt butl and his family tried to flee

in a large bus as he saw people in need

he picked them up and soon 90 people

were crammed into a space meant for half

that like Noah's Ark but I mean they

have no way to go the horror for him was

having to drive around the bodies of

people he knew images he can't escape

but it always a fear come on my sleep I

see it you know I see it they're safe

now but unsure if they'll ever go back

on their phones the boodles all have

pictures of friends who lost their lives

they want to look to the future but the

past is still - wrong will you ever

forget the things you know I don't think

so no so what now for that family well

they've expressed interest in moving to

Canada and they've made enquiries

leaving their Island will be hard

because it's home but going back after

all they saw and experienced that could

be much harder
