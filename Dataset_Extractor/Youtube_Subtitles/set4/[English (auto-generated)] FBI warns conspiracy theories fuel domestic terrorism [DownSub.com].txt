look closely at the crowd and you'll see

it the letter Q on signs and on shirts

at president Trump's rallies the queue

is short for queuing on a far-right

online conspiracy theory whose followers

believe Trump is leading a covert effort

against dark forces inside the US

government it is a somewhat fragmentary

set of conspiracy theories that revolve

around notions that Donald Trump will

save the United States from various

existing conspiracies while queuing on

has become tied to the president it has

also caught the attention of the FBI

along with a growing number of other

fringe theories in an internal memo the

bureau warns some of those conspiracy

theories will likely motivate some

domestic extremists to commit criminal

sometimes violent activity and could

encourage the targeting of specific

people places and organizations it's

already happened last summer a qyn on

supporter barricaded himself inside an

armored vehicle on the Hoover Dam in

2016 a man shot up a Washington DC

restaurant after the pizza gate

conspiracy theory convinced him

Democrats were running a child sex ring

inside the gunman who killed 11 at a

Pittsburgh synagogue was allegedly

motivated by a conspiracy theory about

migrants a majority of the domestic

terrorism cases that we've investigated

are motivated by some version of what

you might call white supremacist

violence but it includes other things as

well experts say social media has

allowed for the rapid spread of

misinformation though people are not

necessarily becoming more conspiratorial

what's different now is that the

President himself has at times seemed to

support theories like queuing on

inviting believers to a White House

social media summit and promoting them

on Twitter and having the commander in

chief being maybe not conspiracy

theorist in chief but at least a fan of

and oftentimes amplifier of conspiracy

theories is definitely new in that memo

the FBI says many of today's conspiracy

theories are politically motivated and

fueled by the partisan divide in America

they warned those theories could take on

new life and new intensity ahead of the

2020 election Jackson prosecco Global
