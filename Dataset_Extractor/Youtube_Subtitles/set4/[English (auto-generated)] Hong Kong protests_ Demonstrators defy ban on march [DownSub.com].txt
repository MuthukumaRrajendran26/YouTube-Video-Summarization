pouring rain appropriate for protesters

with the motto be like water as in be

flexible

[Music]

as darkness fell clashes intensified

Saturday marks the fifth anniversary of

the decision by China to limit

democratic reforms in Hong Kong

protesters threw bricks and beer bottle

bombs and set fires in the street not

backing down from their current push for

democratic reform there were more

arrests and reports of injuries police

trying to head off the protesters taken

to the subway

officers fired tear gas and water dyed

blue to mark and identify people

referring to color of a different kind

on China Central Television this scholar

took the government line calling this a

color revolution claiming these

protesters are backed by evil Western

forces the protesters have Chinese faces

he says but British or Canadian

passports anti-communist and anti China

yes 300,000 Hong Kongers have Canadian

passports but for people who are living

and working and making their life in

Hong Kong they are seeing this as a

fight to keep what they see is their

distinct City distinct president of the

Rideau Potomac Strategy Group Eric

Miller says this isn't a foreign

influenced revolution but on all the

tension points with Beijing he says

Canada is stuck responding instead of

playing offense Canada doesn't have a

viable China strategy and so it's

playing whack-a-mole whether it's the

mangwon Jo case or whether it's the

detention of the two Michael's or the

bar on cote canola exports in this case

Canada has spoken out against the

violence in Hong Kong

earlier this month Foreign Affairs

Minister Christian Freeland said Canada

supports Hong Kong's high degree of

autonomy from China and peaceful right

to protest earning her a direct rebuke

from the Chinese embassy here in Ottawa
