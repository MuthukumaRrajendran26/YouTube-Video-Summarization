a dramatic twist indeed yet another one

in this investigation that has spent

four provinces this afternoon late this

afternoon the RCMP coming out and saying

they have not been able to substantiate

the sighting here in York Landing but it

has been a tense day for people in the

community as helicopters and planes fly

grid patterns overhead tactical officers

are dropped off on the road meters away

from homes it's an unimaginable scene

for families sitting and watching a

national manhunt unfold machine without

a vehicle on the road SWAT team with gun

that's scary

they told us on Mary get to close the

door and lock windows that's what it was

here Sunday night Travis biggity and two

other bear clan patrollers spotted two

men matching the description of cam

McCloud and Breyers Miguel ski near the

landfill we just happened to be doing

one last run near kind of like I guess

they considered their dump or something

and we've seen two individuals that fit

the descriptions of the VC suspects the

chief says he understands how worried

people are he was on the ferry coming

into town when he got word that his

community is now involved in a long and

complicated search for two fugitives

there's the longest 40 minutes of my

life that I had to endure this is

something you don't anticipate and never

really have be prepared for right and

the feeling is uneasy still so questions

still remain where are these two wanted

individuals a number of resources will

stay here in York landing and the

investigation continues into the

location of cama cloud and briars Miguel
