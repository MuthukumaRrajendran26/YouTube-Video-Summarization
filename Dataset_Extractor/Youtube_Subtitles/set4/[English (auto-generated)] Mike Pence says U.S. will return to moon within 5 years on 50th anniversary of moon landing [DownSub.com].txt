ladies and gentlemen please welcome the

president and CEO Lockheed Martin

Maryland you see the administrator the

National Aeronautics and Space

Administration in right

since Luke Armstrong

although commander Neelam's the Olin

near module pilot Buzz Aldrin

[Applause]

good afternoon Ronde Santas governor

florida that's an honor for me to be

here to commemorate what was really one

of the greatest achievements in the

history of our country when we put these

men on the moon and Buzz thank you for

all you've done you're a great hero

thank you

[Applause]

based on members of the Armstrong family

who have come and you know the sitting

up here that was taking one small step

for one man being on the moon

represented a giant leap for mankind and

I think that we have seen that over the

years one just the fact that we did it

after having sent an audacious goal less

than ten years earlier that we would put

somebody on the moon a lot of people

didn't think that could be done and it's

a testament to the hard work of people

like Buzz and Neil Armstrong but also

the United States being a pre Society

and being committed to do great things

was able to achieve that and I think

that was very very important but also

you look at what we now know since then

about the moon all the different

scientific discoveries just in the last

decade so many really neat things and so

I think it's fitting that we're here I'm

at Kennedy Space Center not only to

commemorate what happened 50 years ago

but also to recognize that that success

has spawned really significant

developments right now in private

industry we see it here with some of the

great companies and great entrepreneurs

in the world working hard to send more

rockets in space we see it through the

support of the Trump pence

administration which we in this

community very much appreciate it I want

to also thank my friend Jim bridenstine

for really having a great vision as

as the director of NASA so I am excited

to look back on that 50 years and what a

great achievement it is but I think the

story of that is still being written

because I think the things that are

going to happen and the hopefully

relatively near future are going to be

really ones for the record books and if

these guys had not succeeded you know we

may not be here being able to enjoy that

today and so it's my honor to introduce

the director of the Kennedy Space Center

here in NASA which has just been such an

iconic place for Space Robert Kabam

[Applause]

Thank You governor to send us and thank

you for your support whereas here at KSC

in the Space Coast it's a real pleasure

for me to have all of you here at

Kennedy Space Center during this

historic week as we celebrate man's

first steps on the moon and to continue

the conversation that next giant leap

it's going to originate right here at

KSC it's been 45 years since we last set

foot on the moon and now our president

has renewed the nation's focus on

expanding humanity's presence beyond our

home planet working with US companies

and international partners NASA will

push the boundaries of human exploration

forward to the moon in autumn to Mars

with the Artemis program NASA is

building the infrastructure for

expanding human exploration into the

solar system in the Space Launch System

rocket in Orion spacecraft are the

backbone of our exploration plans along

with the modernized spaceport here at

KSC SLS and Orion represent the next era

in space exploration with unmatched

capabilities the Orion spacecraft is

built to take humans further into space

and we've ever gone before

and with each milestone we get that much

closer to being flight ready Orion is

the safest most advanced spacecraft ever

built and it will be flexible and

capable enough to take us to a variety

of destinations our partnership with

Lockheed Martin is an integral part of

America's mood to Mars exploration

approach laid out by President Trump

today Lockheed Martin is

building and processing the Orion

spacecraft right here at KSC for

upcoming Artemus missions it's my

pleasure now dear deuce and welcome

Maryland Houston chairman president and

CEO of the Lockheed Martin corporation

Maryland join Lockheed Martin more than

35 years ago as an industrial engineer

earlier this year Time magazine

identified her as one of the 100 most

influential people in the world she has

served on several US government advisory

bodies including the current appointment

to the National Space Council user's

advisory group she's a fellow and loyal

aeronautical society and an associate

fellow in the American Institute of

Aeronautics and Astronautics

Maryland is a passionate leader with a

fervent commitment to innovation in

education please join me in welcoming

Maryland

[Applause]

mr. vice president governor descendants

members of Congress and other

distinguished guests is absolutely my

honor to represent Lockheed Martin today

as we commemorate 50-year anniversary of

Apollo 11 and I want to begin first by

thanking the vice president United

States because he has worked tirelessly

to help government and industry leaders

to be empowered to really focus on how

we can continue to lead in space as a

nation and to continue the legacy of the

Apollo program

you know the Apollo 11 mission was a

launching pad for decades of leadership

by our nation in a range of

opportunities that we brought in terms

of and allowing us to have scientific

discovery and through that many

scientific experiments and opportunities

that improved our our way of life but

beyond that it has inspired so many and

so many generations since that time that

has allowed them to see what it's

possible in this final frontier so we

are very proud of the opportunity

meet here today to commemorate that

legacy that was left by those who

participated in Apollo 11 but since that

historic achievement we are now as Bob

said very honored to be working with

NASA on many critical missions but most

importantly the next giant leap that

we're going to face and that is taking

humans again to the moon and we are very

proud to participate in that with the

Orion spacecraft that you can see over

here with us today one of those

spacecraft that will be in the next

uncrewed mission going forward and then

we'll produce those that are moving

forward today I actually had the

distinct privilege of introducing to you

the individual who's going to be

responsible for implementing the

administration's vision for the future

of America in our endeavours in space he

began his career in federal service with

US Navy he honorably served as a pilot

on the USS Abraham Lincoln and his

experience in the military and in the

civilian life as a leader have put him

right up front and center to understand

what we face in terms of the new space

race a race that is very important to

our national security a race that is

very important to continue to advance

scientific discovery so with that as I

look at him in the leadership and the

farsightedness that he has that are so

critical to American programs I'm very

pleased to welcome to the stage Jim

Wright ensign the administrator for NASA

[Applause]

well as you know this is a wonderful day

today of celebration not just for NASA

and the United States of America but in

fact for all of the world

I want to thank Marilyn for that great

introduction and for your leadership I

know this is a bigger day for Lockheed

Martin as this for all of us I also want

to thank my good friend governor Ron

DeSantis

we were freshmen together in the House

of Representatives now you're leaving

this great state and I will tell you Ron

de santis is the governor who cares

deeply about the Kennedy Space Center he

calls me to make sure I know that your

governor is doing great work on behalf

of the Kennedy Space Center

I also want to thank representative

Scalise

[Applause]

who is the representative ranking member

on the Science Space opening of the

Science Committee he's a Texan and I

will tell you he he looks at space from

an all of America approach and we're

grateful for his service

congressman and Congressman Walz these

are two individuals who are keen on the

national security aspect of space and

has been very helpful to us as an agency

as we think about the future and the

strategic of the United States in space

and of course the most important person

in the room

mrs. Karen pence thank you for

celebrating with us today

[Applause]

and of course there's somebody else that

I would be introducing later I also want

to thank Bob Cabana for helping

transform this facility into a

multi-user spaceport there was a day in

the United States of America when the

space shuttles were retiring the

constellation program was being canceled

Vaughn Cabana had a tough job to do here

at the Kennedy Space Center he is

transformed in the way that has

maintained the presence and now we have

great news but in fact the American

space program is coming back it's coming

back with a vengeance and I'll be

talking about that more than about

command he's done a great job here

most importantly it is in order to have

with us here one of the Peng who first

walked on the moon a half century ago

the legendary the one and only

[Applause]

it is also a pleasure to have Neil

Armstrong son Rick and grandson grace

with us here today Rick and grace thank

you for helping us share Neil's legacy

with the next generation of moon walkers

and most importantly thank you so much

for sharing your dad and your granddad

not just with the United States of

America but the entire world we are

grateful for your services

landing men on the moon was by far the

hardest thing ever accomplished in human

history if they calculated that for

every hour of astronauts in a blue space

[Music]

approximately 1 million work hours on

earth were needed knowing a collective

project not the pyramids nor the Bambang

canal even came close although when I

first started reading this I was from

over 20,000 businesses works ninth day

to fulfill president john f kennedy's

mission not just once but six times and

lest we forget what were we trying to do

in the 1960s this was a contest of great

powers the United States of America

against the Soviet Union and it was

about technological prowess for sure but

more importantly it was about

demonstrating our political

was superior to that of the Soviet Union

at the time and we Buzz Aldrin and Neil

Armstrong walked on the moon we were

able to demonstrate American greatness

despite the intensity of the space race

the electrons Buzz Aldrin and Michael

Collins designed the Apollo 11 hatch to

represent the intentions of America in

the hopes of NASA the patch depicts an

eagle landing on the moon with an olive

branch and talons

conveying a mission of peace rather than

a mission of conquest the Bible says

that one day the nations of the world

will learn war no more and quote beat

their swords into plowshares and their

spears into pruning hooks unquote in

fact soon after Apollo 11 the United

States partnered with the Soviet Union

on what became the apollo-soyuz program

decades later the diplomatic

capabilities of space continued to

improve the world as American astronauts

and Russian cosmonauts have been living

and working together aboard the

International Space

for almost 20 years crazy American

astronaut and cream working Italian

astronaut Luca parmitano

and Russian cosmonaut Alexander support

Scott launched just moments ago in

Kazakhstan to join their fellow

expedition 60 crew members aboard the

International Space Station another

monumental day for NASA perhaps the most

enduring legacy of the moon landings

with a countless young Americans they

inspired to join science technology

engineering and math fields of study the

Apollo program hastened groundbreaking

technological advancements they

continued to bestow benefits on modern

society even today however not all

administrations in the past have the

vision necessary to advance humanity

further into the solar system and I know

this region of the United

in particular Felton berry park space

shuttles were retired and the

constellation program was cancelled

however today similar to the 1960s we

too have an opportunity to take a giant

leap forward for all of humanity

president Trump and vice-president pence

that given us a bold direction as an

agency to return to the moon within five

years and go forward to Mars their

direction is not simply empty rhetoric

they have backed up their vision with

budget requests needed to accomplish

this objective

NASA is calling this program the Artemis

program we all lost Apollo but in the

Artemis program to go to the moon

sustainably and this time we have a very

diverse highly qualified astronaut corps

that includes women and in Greek

mythology Artemis happens to be twin

sister of Apollo and she's the concept

of them so this time we in fact go with

all America after the 1969 moon landing

Armstrong Aldrin and Collins signed a

silk screen at Florida

plum

this is an interesting story and I don't

think it's close enough it's an

interesting story they flew on Apollo

lay a silk screen hatch and presented it

to NASA for safekeeping for the future

the inscription on the package reads

quote carried to the moon aboard Apollo

11 presented to the Mars one crew

unquote looking forward into the future

it is only appropriate that a patch

which witnessed humanity's first giant

leap should be there for its second

giant leap and with the legacy of Apollo

and the leadership of President Trump

and vice president thanks NASA's future

nation to Mars is fast approaching it is

now that I have to introduce to you the

chairman of the National Space Council

and the vice president of the United

States Mike Pence

it's great to be back you John F Kennedy

with my wonderful wife Karen celebrate

[Applause]

to celebrate with all of you the 50th

anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon

landing a half a century ago that will

be remembered forever

[Applause]

I've been looking forward to this day

but the lab they bring greetings from

another great space enthusiasts great

champion of American leadership in space

I'd begin today by bringing greetings

from the 45th President of the United

States of America President Donald Trump

[Applause]

today our nation face from you to three

brave astronauts at the top of 360

lifted off from pad 39a 50 years ago

this two of them walked on the moon 50

years ago today we also gather to pay

tribute to the nearly 400,000 Americans

engineers technicians designers whose

sacrifices and dedication made it

possible for Apollo 11 to complete one

another president called the most

hazardous and dangerous and greatest

adventure upon which mankind has ever

embarked let's hear it for all those who

supported

[Applause]

when President Kennedy challenged the

nation in 1961 to put a man on the moon

and return him safely to the earth

before the decade was out it's important

to remember that our country was not yet

ready to meet that challenge we didn't

have the rockets or the launch pads or

the space suits or the land we hadn't

even invented many of the materials or

tools that we would need not only did we

not have what we needed we didn't even

know what we did

President Kennedy summarized that epic

endeavor in one simple sentence we

choose to go to the moon and make no

mistake about it the moon was a choice

an American choice

and like every time the American people

make up their mind once that decision

was made American ingenuity grit and

determination the achievement was in

evidence the only challenges that remain

were challenges of engineering in

science the moon didn't come easily and

it didn't come without cost and it did

not come without great danger or without

sacrifice to this day Americans read the

laws of three brave astronauts of Apollo

one who were lost in a fire on the

launch pad

January of 1967 and we think of them and

their families

today the risks for Apollo 11 were so

great the odds were so long that many

feared that even if our astronauts made

it to the moon they might not make it

back

in fact history records that President

Nixon prepared a speech in the event of

tragedy where he would explain to the

nation that the mission

failed but of course the mission didn't

fit after all with 400,000 men and women

behind the mission at NASA and with the

hearts and prayers of the American

people how could it fail

and that the controls the Apollo 11

lunar module known as eagle stood two

great Americans mission commander Neil

Armstrong and a man who is with us today

lunar module pilot Buzz

[Applause]

and circling overhead in lunar orbit was

command module pilot Michael Collins

[Applause]

miss fiction 50 years ago today and

almost exactly this summer

Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were

about halfway into their powered descent

on the final leg of their landing of the

moon

there they were standing beside one

another in a capsule not much bigger

than a couple of telephone booths just

minutes from touchdown they thought they

were ready for every contingency after

all as Buzz told me just a few days ago

they had spent two years intensively

training for this moment and they run

almost 600 simulated landings all

designed to be more difficult than the

real thing

Eagle had just finished its rule over to

position itself the final approach when

all the sudden Neil Armstrong called out

to Houston that Eagle had a 1202 alarm

the problem was nobody on board or in

Houston have any idea what a 1202 alarm

was Eagles flight computer was

overloaded not only could they not see

the moon out their windows they they

couldn't know for certain how far they

were from the surface not a good way to

fly

and yet

how calm they were working with team

back here on earth they quickly resolved

the problem without betraying the

slightest anxiety people all over the

world were watching with no idea that

anything had gone wrong that my friends

is what they used to call the right

stuff you know there's a reason Neil

Armstrong as well was called the ice

commandment in his day when the original

landing area turned out to be so full of

large boulders that landing there would

have doomed the mission and the crew

history records that Neil Armstrong

calmly took control of the lunar module

skimmed along the top of the surface of

the moon in search for a safe place to

touchdown by the time he found the safe

spot known to all of us his tranquility

base Armstrong and Aldrin had only 17

seconds of people were made like every

one of my generation I remember that 600

million people around the world watching

their TVs to their radios waiting with

admiration anxiety and Wonder

and I was one of a little boy sitting in

front of our black-and-white television

in the basement of our home in Indiana

when those first snowy images of Neil

Armstrong stepping off the bottom rung

of the ladder beamed down to earth at

10:56 p.m. on Sunday July 20th 1969 they

made an indelible mark not just on my

imagination but on the imagination of my

generation and every generation to come

it was a moment so rich in meaning that

upon hearing Neil Armstrong's first call

from tranquility base even the era's

greatest newsman Walter Cronkite could

only shake his head and other to words

oh boy

although once the nation held its breath

as through the crackling broadcast we

listened to we heard Neil Armstrong on

campus of those immortal words that's

one small step for man one giant leap

for mankind

in that moment the men of Apollo 11 did

more than help expand our understanding

of creation and they did more than win

the space race they brought together our

nation and for one brief moment all the

people in the world would truly now true

to their Creed astronauts have never

liked the idea of being called heroes if

for all they did for all the risks they

took if Neil Armstrong Buzz Aldrin and

Mike Collins are not heroes then there

are no heroes we honor these men today

and America will always honor our Apollo

astronauts

[Applause]

we honor the men of apollo 11 by

remembering their epic voyage and

telling their short but we also honor

them by continuing the work they so

nobly and courageously advance in

American space exploration Apollo 11 was

followed by five more successful moon

missions culminating in the final

historic journey of Apollo 17 america's

last trip as we honor our Apollo 11

astronauts we are also honored today to

be joined by Apollo 17 astronaut

Harrison Schmitt

[Applause]

as Harrison and I have discussed about

his mission well the last words spoken

on the moon might not be as well-known

as the first words this fellow astronaut

Gene Cernan said more perhaps than

anyone could have known at the time it's

a challenge to our time as he stepped

off the moon on December 17th 1972 he

said these words and I quote if I take

Man's last steps on the moon for some

time to come

history will record that America's

challenge of today has forged a man's

destiny and then he ended by saying we

leave the moon as we came and God

willing we shall soon return with peace

and hope for all mankind

[Applause]

as little words a challenge in 1972 and

in our time as president Trump said this

generation of Americans knows that it is

America's destiny to be leader among two

nations on our adventure into the great

unknown and standing before you today I

am proud to report at the direction of

the President of the United States of

America America will return to the moon

within the next five years and the next

man and the first woman on the moon will

be American astronauts

[Applause]

at 145 years where one administration

after another chose to limit America's

space program to low-earth orbit

President Donald Trump is changeful

early in this administration the

president revived the National Space

Council within the White House Accord

they all space related activities across

the government including matters related

to national security and we've been hard

work the space Council has helped bring

together skilled leaders in business and

industry to revive and the new America's

commitment to human space exploration

and I'm pleased that many members of our

user advisory group for the space

Council are with us today for this

historic occasion join me in welcoming

these dedicated and distinguished

Americans

president from Basel Science Space

policy directed one challenging NASA to

lead the return of Americans to the moon

send the first Americans to Mars and

enable humans to expand and deepen our

reach across the solar system it is our

mission and as I speak to you today

I'm proud to report we're investing in

new rockets new spaceships we're working

with private companies around this

country to develop the new technologies

of the future by unleashing the

burgeoning private space industry the

dots the landscape of this historic

Center in this nation and within the

next year we will once again send

American astronauts into space American

rockets from American soil

[Applause]

already we've given our human

exploration missions of newfound sense

of urgency not seen in more than a

generation

last year NASA and American innovators

began an accelerated design process for

both the lunar orbital gateway and the

lunar surface space all of which we will

need to support Americans on the moon

and to train and prepare to send

Americans to Mars and while we've made

great strides in advancing the

president's bold vision for space unlike

in years past we will have the budgets

to match it that's why I'm especially

grateful today to be joined by some of

the greatest champions of American

leadership in space in the Congress of

the United States House Minority Whip

Steve Scalise congressman Robert

aderholt congressman Brian Babbitt

congressman Bill Posey and other

distinguished members of Congress would

you please rise and allow us to express

our appreciation

[Applause]

with strong bipartisan support this

president's already signed into law of

the largest and that's a budget ever on

this historic occasion I'm told that

we've also achieved a critical milestone

in our effort to go to the moon and

beyond today thanks to the hard work of

the men of NASA men and women of NASA

and an American industry the Orion crew

vehicle for the Artemis one mission is

complete and ready to begin preparations

for its historic first flight

[Applause]

becoming years American astronauts will

return to the moon aboard the Orion and

they will return with new ambitions we

will spend weeks and months not days and

hours on the lunar surface

this time we're going to the moon to

stay and to explore and develop new

technologies we will extract water from

ice in a permanently shadowed craters of

the South Pole we will fly on a new

generation of spacecraft that will

enable us to reach Mars not in years but

in months

Americans are leading in space once

today we were money we reminded how

American leadership fifty years ago the

accomplishment of Apollo 11 inspired our

nation as the president said it ignited

our sense of adventure and steeled our

belief that no dream is impossible no

matter how lofty or challenging and it's

Buzz Aldrin said today in his words

looking back on landing on the moon

wasn't just our job it was a historic

opportunity to prove to the world

America's can-do spirit

I see leading human space exploration

will carry not all the American

ingenuity and pride but most importantly

will carry America's ideals into the

vast expanse of space that gives a free

and litter

Apollo 11 is the only event in the 20th

century that stands a chance of being

widely remembered in the 30th century a

thousand years from now July 20th 1969

will likely be a date that will live in

the minds and imaginations of men and

women as long as there are men and women

to remember across this world across

this solar system and beyond so today we

remember the heroes of Apollo 11 and all

the heroes that supported them in their

mission some 400,000 Americans but today

we also reaffirm our commitment to

unlock the mysteries of space and to

lead and as we continue on this American

Journey we go with the same result and

determination

before and we go with faith faith in the

courage of this new generation of

astronauts men and women of the

character and caliber of those who have

gone before their remarkable pioneers

who carry American leadership in space

faith in the ingenuity of the men and

women of NASA and all of those across

the American space and promise whose

creativity and tireless efforts in the

days ahead will match that of their

forebears who created and invented new

ways to explore and expand human

understanding with American leadership

and finally I believe as we go forward

its millions of Americans believe in

their hearts and hand throughout the

generations that will go forward with

faith that as those pioneers put on the

space students

climb aboard the Rockets that will

believe that even if they rise on the

wings of the dawn even if they go up to

the heavens but even there his hand will

guide his right hand the holding fast

and that'll be our prayer

today we marked the 50th anniversary of

Apollo 11 we celebrate the heroic

astronauts who accomplished that

extraordinary feat in human history and

all those who supported them and today

we resolve for the sake of all they

accomplish that America will lead in

space once again and this nation will

once again astonish the world with the

Heights we reach and the wonders we

achieve so may God bless the crew of

Apollo 11 and all who supported them on

their historic journey may God bless

this new generation of pioneers and all

who will support them and may God

continue to bless the United States
