in a nexus between organized crime

cybersecurity and an alleged RCMP leak

multiple sources tell global news that

the RCMP s sensitive and international

investigations unit first started

looking for an RCMP mole after evidence

in Vincent ramiz's possession suggested

someone had approached him and tried to

sell highly sensitive RCMP criminal

intelligence from a police investigation

targeting him in 2015

sources say Ramos never bought the

intelligence but it set off alarm bells

that triggered investigators to start

combing through the RCMP and everyone

who had contact with the Ramos file from

high-level officials to office staff the

investigation was made more difficult

because Ramos couldn't say exactly who

had approached him from the RCMP police

worked through a list of suspects until

they identified Cameron ortus who

allegedly had a wide array of highly

classified intelligence in his

possession at the time of his arrest

sources say at least one of the charges

ortus is facing dates back to a 2015

attempt to pass on information that

relates to the evidence from the Ramos

case Vinson Ramos is 41 years old and

from Richmond BC he was arrested in the

United States in 2018 and pled guilty to

serious charges involving facilitating

criminal syndicates who were evading

police detection using his company's

technology to communicate police say

that high-level crime bosses used

phantom secure technology to coordinate

drug trafficking money laundering and

even murders

Ramos himself admitted to an undercover

officer that the technology could be

used to locate and kill police

informants authorities were worried

about Ramos and phantom secured at least

as far back in 2015 when the RCMP began

using undercover officers posing as drug

traffickers to infiltrate criminal

networks and target Ramos sources

believe Cameron artists would have had

access to that 2015 phantom secure

investigation and the list of undercover

agents dealing with Vincent Ramos now

intelligence agencies and police

departments across the country and in

allied countries around the world

frantically trying to assess the damage

Global News has been told that an untold

number of highly sensitive domestic and

international investigations and

undercover officers could

have been compromised depending on what

ortus is alleged to have sold at this

point they are still trying to determine

whether he was working alone tomorrow

RCMP commissioner Brenda Lackey will

publicly hold a press conference on the

case for the first time Mercedes
