and what we have now is a clear picture

who Justin Trudeau truly is and it's not

who he promised he would be he promised

he would be accountable and ethical

instead time and time again he has used

the power of his office to enrich

himself reward his friends and punish

his critics as the ethics commissioner

notes in his report quote the authority

of the Prime Minister and his office was

used to circumvent undermine and

ultimately discredit Jodie Wilson rebel

he promised he would be open and honest

but let's remember on the day that this

story first broke Justin Trudeau denied

it completely he said that the story was

false

he then said that he never pressured

Jodie Wilson rabo we now know that is

false he also said that she never came

to him with her concerns again we now

know that was false and he said that he

would be happy to work and cooperate

with the ethics commissioner and now we

know that is false as well he promised

he would be different instead we now

know beyond a shadow of a doubt that

Justin Trudeau is not as advertised he

has stated so many false oaths that no

one can believe anything he says now

Trudeau may never face a court of law

for his role in the scandal but he will

have to face the Canadian people over

the next few weeks and on the eve of

this election the choice for Canadians

has never been more clear between a

prime minister who abuses his power

bends the law for his friends attempts

to silence his critics and destroys the

reputation and a Conservative government

led by a prime minister who will uphold

the rule

of respect our democratic institutions

and help all Canadians get ahead which

merci beaucoup thank you very much happy

take some questions now

compliment obstruction of justice

investigation I certainly believe that

there is enough evidence here to warrant

an RCP investigation Jessen trio has

attempted to distract this scandal from

Canadians he has used the power of his

office to shut down multiple

parliamentary investigations we now know

from the ethics commissioners report

that there are several key witnesses who

are unable to testify to the ethics

commissioner because Justin Trudeau

blocked that from happening so I

certainly do believe that there is

enough here to warrant a further

investigation by the Eris evening um I

just want to ask there was a finding

here that the lack of you know you know

action to waive cabinet confidences

impeded the investigation by the anthers

commissioner

what do you call on the PCO and the

government to do to resolve that

situation well we call from the very

beginning to progestin sure to waive

full to grant a full waiver of

confidentiality remember he tried to

convince people that he had lifted the

veil on this by having a very selective

waiver only allowing Jodie Wilson

Raybould and others to talk about a very

narrow part of this scandal we now know

today that there were other witnesses

who had relevant information who were

prevented from speaking because Trudeau

refused to grant that full and complete

waiver so I would renew my call today

for that to happen if Justin Trudeau

believes that he did nothing wrong if he

believes that he has nothing to hide he

should let the light of day shine upon

this entire scandal

earlier this week Trudeau said that he

would be he's committed to releasing the

report by an McCullen once this report

was out prove zooming that's going to

happen given Dion's

conclusion how much credence should

Canadians give that second report from

the former

well I was never prepared to give that

report any credence Justin Trudeau asked

a former liberal from a government that

was responsible for the sponsorship

scandal not to investigate his handling

of the SNC Lavin scandal so I don't

believe that Canadians are interested in

the findings of liberals who investigate

other liberals this report by an

independent officer of parliament

carries much more weight and and so

that's that and I made my statement

state drawing on the conclusions from

this investigation by this officer of

pearl at this point Justin Trudeau needs

to be defeated like Canadians will have

that opportunity on October 21st why did

you change your position though well he

clearly put his own partisan interests

ahead of the democratic institutions

that have served this country so well

for over 150 years he made the decision

to stay in office now the decision is in

the hands of Canadians on October 21st

and I believe that Canadians will make

the right choice to get rid of a

scandal-plagued prime minister who uses

the power of his office to silence his

critics and reward his friends and a

Conservative government led by a prime

minister who will uphold the rule of law

and respect our democratic institutions

if a prime minister is found to be in

violation of something like this what do

you think is the correct response well

at this point in our parliamentary cycle

the correct responses for Canadians to

vote out a corrupt Liberal government

led by a prime minister who still cannot

accept responsibility for his actions

Canadians will have that opportunity on

October 21st I'm certainly excited about

the prospect of putting forward our plan

to restore integrity to Canada's

government and to make sure that we are

government that's working for all

Canadians Justin Trudeau is using his

office to help a very select group of

his very rich and powerful friends

that's not who the government of Canada

be working for the conservative

government will help all Canadians get

ahead what do you think is the correct

response from their prime minister

though well you know he should begin by

accepting responsibility

he still has failed to do that but again

he refused to step down when these

findings were first put forward to

Parliament when we had sworn testimony

at the Justice Committee by Jody Wilson

dreible that proved that what Justin

Trudeau said was false and that he knew

it was false and he refused to take

responsibility for his actions then I

don't expect him to do that today but

Canadians can hold him responsible on

October 21st I think any time a prime

minister is found guilty of breaking

these types of rules but they need to

take responsibility I made the call

months ago when it was clear that Justin

Trudeau told things to Canadians that

were clearly not true when he was using

the power of his office to shut down

independent investigations I made the

call on him to step down then to do the

right thing because he had lost the rule

of moral authority to govern this report

proves that beyond a shadow of a doubt I

don't expect him to do the right thing

but I know that Canadians have the

opportunity to hold him responsible on

October 21st um you went as far as to

say today that you believe that he uses

office to you know personally enrich

himself I didn't see anything to that

effect in this report can you just

explain how you came to make those

allegations well first of all obviously

when he accepted the the illegal gift

that was a personal benefit to him this

is in his conversations with Jodi Wilson

revolt he talks about his own seat being

at risk putting his own personal

ambitions of his own personal interests

ahead of the independence of our rule of

law and again you know the the focus

there is being that he has interfered in

a criminal investigation to further his

own partisan interests his own personal

interests

and in his capacity and of course the

other accepting of illegal gifts preview

prior to this report a certainly show

that he has a he has a pattern of

breaking these types of laws if member

of your caucus were to break on ethics

commissioner rules would your course of

action get what they need spell from

caucus if they're found guilty obviously

we're gonna hold ourselves to a very

high account when it comes to integrity

and ethics I expect all members of my

team to follow those rules and I can

assure you that neither myself nor

anyone in our in our government will use

the power of their offers to interfere

in independent prosecutorial decisions

this is what this whole questions about

we have a company that's facing serious

corruption charges for defrauding some

of the world's poorest people and when

they are being held accountable in

Canadian courts they lean on Justin

Trudeau and their friends in the Prime

Minister's office to interfere to get a

special deal that's it to get the trial

stopped that is an unforgivable assault

on the independence of our rule of law

and the independence of our justice

system and that is why Justin Trudeau

needs to be held accountable accountable

and I'm confident the Canadians will do

exactly that

I mean obviously look this is a this is

a Liberal Party problem this is a

Liberal government a liberal party that

has never in its history been able to

tell the difference between when the

Liberal Party of Canada stops and the

Government of Canada that's meant to

govern for all Canadians starts that is

what we're talking about here of course

in in the future Parliament and our

Conservative government all members of

parliament will be expected to live up

to the very highest standards of ethics

and accountability I will certainly

ensure that that happens so absolutely

you know it just asked a question on

whether or not the RCMP should should

look into that I do believe that that is

appropriate we called on that for had to

happen at the time of these allegations

were first brought up we'll be looking

at what our options are in the coming

days and we'll have more to say on that

in the near future Mr Shearer do you

think that Canadians are invested enough

in this issue for this to be a key point

of the fall federal election I do I do

believe that Canadians care about their

justice system I do believe the Acadians

care when they see people in powerfull

offices abusing that power to further

their own narrow self-interest and and

to undermine one of the pillars of our

democratic institutions Canadians

understand that we have to be very

vigilant against those who want to abuse

the power of their office and engage in

this type of corrupt behavior and I and

I do believe that this will be top of

mind for Canadian voters this election

well we need to know the full details

Jodi Wilson Reybold has already said

multiple times if there's more that she

would like to say but can't because that

full waiver was not granted we need to

know what she would add to this we know

that there are multiple people who the

ethics commissioner attempted to contact

and they were prevented from testifying

we need to know what they would say the

fact that Justin Trudeau is going to

such great lengths to cover up to block

investigations to cancel increase into

this matter tells me and tells all

Canadians that there is more to this

story that they need to know mr. Xie if

you win the election will you separate

the attorney-general role from the

Justice Minister this is not a problem

of which other roles Jodi Wilson Reybold

had in order to prevent this from

happening the future we need to replace

this Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

bullied the Attorney General it doesn't

matter what other titles the Attorney

General had he was speaking to Jodi

wilson rabl in her capacity as the

Attorney General because she had the

power to intervene in this criminal

prosecution that is the essence of this

problem and I and and Justin Trudeau may

try to say later on today or in the in

the days that come that there this was

the result of some kind of structural

problem in the cabinet in the Prime

Minister's Office that's completely

false the structural problem was that

Justin Trudeau attempted to interfere in

a criminal prosecution that would have

happened no matter what type of dynamic

existed with who what other roles the

Attorney General had so again the focus

here is the way that Justin Trudeau

bullied attempted to interfere and then

denied so blatantly saying things that

were so blatantly untrue to Canadians

for weeks and months at a time and you

know knowing that the truth would

eventually come out it's it's so

disappointing to see a prime minister

desperately

cling to power by saying so many

falsehoods we just can't believe

anything this guy says anymore this is a

bunch of salvage work it's unprecedented

that yet this future now is down the

extreme crunch mention of the curvature

to your cart dimensions and this one

specifically the key concern is that

Trudeau Prime Minister is working to

benefit the interest of a multi

millionaire Corporation and was worth

the benefit zone something to see it

reelected

this is unacceptable

it is outrageous that our Prime Minister

the Prime Minister plan would reduce

movement it's also deeply concerning

because this is not the first time there

was a previous violation of the common

interests and he the the deeper calmer

here is that were seeing that documents

and auto whether it's liberal like the

current one or it's conservative are

working to be easier for multi million

they're making it harder to complain doc

that's deeply concerned mr. Trudeau

cannot be the Prime Minister of Canada

and I'm hoping people in the election

coming up make that decision realize

that if we want a government that works

for people not for the wealthiest the

most powerful the richest corporations

that work for people then there's a

choice to vote for a new democratic

government there's a choice to vote for

new democratic MPs

who will put people at the heart of

everything we do we know that

conservatives and liberals both have

consistently chosen to help out their

powerful friends we know that

conservatives have the duffy scandal

they help out their powerful friends

they help out those at the very very top

instead of helping out people and our

focus is very different sorry

well the question is whether he's

leading the party or not that this is

the same liberal party a liberal party

that for decades has been involved in

this type of scandalous behavior we got

the sponsorship scandal in the past

there's an ongoing kind of arrogance

that comes with the to status quo

parties both parties seem to believe

that there's their job to make it easier

for the powerful the wealthy not to make

it easier for people and whether we have

mr. Trudeau leading or not it's the same

party

[Music]

and that just makes it even more

egregious the fact it makes it even more

troubling the fact that there's already

something that was done wrong and then

on top of that when the Ethics

Commission was trying to investigate it

he was not willing to participate we

would expect

I think Canadians expect that all levels

of government should participate when

there's an investigation well that's why

we called for this investigation and

that's why we also called for a public

inquiry we should see governments that

are transparent and willing to work with

anyone that's investigating their

behavior the fact that mr. Trudeau and

the Liberal government weren't

participating fully or trying to put up

barriers again calls begs the question

who are the who what other interest

groups are they working for what other

industries have been made promises to

are they going to actually bring in

pharma care or are they beholden to the

farmer pharmaceutical industry are they

actually going to tackle the problems

that's facing climate crisis or are they

beholden to the oil and gas industry

much like the Conservatives are we're

deeply concerned about what this says

about the two status quo parties

I think that the public is certainly

going to make a decision about how they

feel in this and they should in the

upcoming election we're proposing a

solution though what we can do to make

sure that no government is in this

position in the future is to assure that

as soon as any corporation is facing a

criminal charge that they are no longer

allowed to lobby with the government

that would be a clear rule not citing an

engagement that's a commitment that I

put in my vision document that if a

corporation is faced with a criminal

charge they're no longer allowed to

lobby and meet with the government in

that manner that's just one step we can

take but really when it comes to this

matter whether we have the conservatives

or liberals in power both of them seem

to have this track record where they

they don't get that their job is to work

for people not for the people at the

very top and and they're not working for

the benefits of everyday families are

working to make it easier for the

multimillionaires and that's really what

I think is at the heart of this matter

well that's exactly it how do we know

he's not going to do this again how can

he be trusted

is the question I hope Canadians ask

themselves when they're voting in

October 21st how can we believe mr.

Oshiro if he makes any commitment on

pharmacare we believe in farming care

for all we're committed to that but if

mr. Trudeau makes that commitment how

can we believe him how can believe he's

not going to make a decision that

benefits a pharmaceutical industry if he

makes a decision or a commitment on the

environment how do we know he's not

going to cave in to the demands of the

fossil fuel sector we know right now

we've got proof we've got evidence that

he came to the demands of SNT Laughlin

to a powerful corporation to to change

the laws to effectively to get them off

the hook and how do we know he's not

gonna do that again we don't and that's

why I'm asking Canadians to make that

consideration when they when they choose

their there are nets elected officials I

think that it's best for people to make

a decision that is in their best

interest and not one that continues the

status quo which is favoring those at

the very top
