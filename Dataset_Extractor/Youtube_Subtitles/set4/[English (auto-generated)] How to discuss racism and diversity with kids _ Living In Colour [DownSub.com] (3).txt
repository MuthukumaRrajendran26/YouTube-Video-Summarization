welcome to living in color I'm your host

Farah Nasser and today we're talking

about ways to discuss racism and

diversity with children at what age

should you begin talking to them about

race why is it important to have these

conversations early on and more today

I'm joined by Yoshi Murphy who is a

writer and content creator for baby and

life calm as well as Brendan Hey who is

the founder of black daddies Club

welcome to yashi and Brendan thank you

thanks for having us let's get right

into this and start by talking about

when you think parents should approach

the discussion of race and racism

Brandon I'll start with you I think you

know I think as babies are coming into

that consciousness right like questions

are coming up but I think that's like

the perfect time to start having

conversations wonder if you have a boy

or girl and like you're playing with

Barbies for example and you're seeing

that like you know yet the dark can and

the white can it's like a good time to

have conversations around differences

and also one of the things I did with my

kids was like insert the names in baby

stories or create baby stories or

bedtime stories just so that they could

see themselves or hear themselves and

picture themselves in in a positive

light because commercials media it's

it's depicting especially black boys in

a very negative light so it's very it's

important oh we saw it was important

that we had conversation conversations

to kind of flip that and show a positive

side of their blackness we talked to

kids about colors from when they were

babies right what cool is this toy what

color's your shirt so the concept of

color came in pretty early and for us

the conversation took place I think she

was about three years old when my

daughter asked what color am I and we

used that opportunity to talk about race

colors culture diversity but she was

three right so it was really

light-hearted conversations and I think

the most important thing is to have

continuous conversations so that we can

involve with that mm-hmm

yeah it's funny my kid would ivis my

oldest of six and he would say you know

the brown looking kid over there but not

realizing he's also a round looking kid

over here you know like he and it didn't

mean a dinner

this way but just kids sort right so

they sort out so they like you say they

picked up color size shape whatever and

it's an innocent way I gave you one

example of how I brought it up what are

some of the ways you two have brought it

up to your kids in terms of explaining

to the explaining to them that people

still aren't treated equally when it

comes to me I mean for my sons my three

beautiful black boys 17 15 and 13 and

talking about race has been important

but also talking about gender right so

with with my son like using mediums like

the news so when Trayvon happened

trayvon martin like that for us that was

a really necessary conversation we had

to have so it wasn't just talking about

the birds and bees but was talking about

like situations that can definitely

affect any of my three black boys but

then also when my eldest son was turned

he was turning 14 i took him to go see

moonlight and then afterwards we had a

conversation about like we had some to

eat and we talked about what is asked

him like what is black masculinity black

masculinity to you and he was like it's

a performance and for me that was like

super rewarding for me it showed that he

was way more developed yeah it was way

more developed than i was at 14 or even

my priority 20s right but i think it's

having these honest dialogue and using

mediums what there's like film or

youtube to like break in like really

tough discussions for that that's

age-appropriate see our kids are both

younger so how would you explain it to

your to your young kids books is there

anything so yes definitely using books

and movies but more often than not I

like to use everyday situations that

they're familiar with and especially

when the topic of race is concerned we

live in downtown Toronto it's a very

diverse City

and what we do between our travels and

local living is that we try to attend

the festivals we try to take part in

culinary trails and visit museums and

then use those opportunities to bring up

topics that they can kind of understand

a little bit and so that later on in

life we can have more sophisticated

conversation

and lastly this next question you

answered how you want cuz your kids

eventually might watch this watch this

broadcast but tell us about any

situations that you've personally

experienced in terms of your kids facing

any discrimination and how you handled

it if you're comfortable with that my

kids are still young they are five and

seven so as far as I am aware we haven't

I would they haven't I should say but

it's something that we are conscious of

my husband and I so we ask them how was

school and what we realize is that dear

friends may say something that they

don't necessarily would consider to be

racism so we're focusing on how did that

make you feel right what did this make

you feel so so far we haven't so but I

think if they get older yeah tell us I

think it's interesting right I think

anti black racism is it's deep into

systemic stuff so like even in just like

preschool or in you know their day

experience like a lot of their teachers

are not from the community don't look

like them so they're there you know I

took had a conversation with my black

board some from early that listen when

you guys are young um they're gonna see

is cute and then as you sort of grow up

and that was the first that was what we

noticed early it was like when my sons

or any other black boys and black girls

as well would do anything that their

white counterparts were doing that was a

normal part of their development the the

response was a lot different quiet it

was you know there was this vigilance

around being sent out the classroom or

being escalated to go to to the

principal's office where there was more

leniency right so there is especially

with black boys there is this other ring

that happens and black girls let's be

quick very quickly right right

but even as my young my eldest early

this year he went to the North Hills in

my area which is in Malvern he won with

his friend and he was like he was being

surveilled and he went to check out he

bought he paid for this thing his items

and this lady who was checking him out

which is a white woman from the same

community that we live in said well it's

a part that we had to check your bags

and he said okay cool personal bag it's

personal bag because you're like this is

this is no frills policy and then when

he got outside one of the a black woman

who saw the whole things that make sure

you tell your parents what happened cuz

you just got racially profiled so you

told us and is you know the first thing

I seemed to do was to journal about it

but the reality is that you can't like

that's the challenges as a black father

you can't protect your kids against

racism so it's important that you have

these conversations and the journaling

piece was more more or less for him to

for him to sort of critically think

about what's happening around him right

so not just to take it and be like okay

this is what it is but critically think

and and and ask himself questions right

and really critically start thinking

about the world that surround him like

if it was his wife friend that that went

in with the same response have happened

we don't know right but I think the

question is does his blackness gives him

a different experience then then others

and it does and I guess you're also

having to make him aware of it more than

I think many of us would for our kids so

I'm specifically talking about you know

you you said to our producer Ally when

you're we were talking to about this

episode that just like you have to teach

you know your kids about the birds and

the bees you have to also add in police

brutality one of the things you teach

them about you tell me about that I

think like you talk to any black parent

whether it's a young boy or whatever a

daughter or a son or whatever they want

to identify is you have to have

conversations very real conversation

from early ages how you interact with

the police yeah she we were talking just

recently about right now about skin

color and you know your daughter at

three kind of witnesses witnessing

colors used something really interesting

in terms how you explained what color

she was originally you told her she was

peach and then so originally said she

was peach because I'm South Asian I'm

from Sri Lanka

her dad's Canadian white but then this

winter this past winter she was going to

school and she kind of mentioned that

you know my friends call me brown and

she didn't seem happy about it so I

questioned I'm like well you know we

just got

from Mexico your couple shades darker we

talked about you know I'm Sri Lankan so

you're Hofstra Lankan we probed a little

further and found out that what she was

unhappy with was the fact that her hair

is brown she fully agrees to that but

her skin color is somewhere in between

so it's neither white neither brown so I

came up with this idea about you know

again taking the real life situation and

putting her in there was we went paint

shopping paint chip shopping a few well

so we're in the Canadian Tire and she

saw this whole spectrum of colors of

like the range of peaches and the ranges

of brown and she picked the color that

suited her and we said okay well next

time someone says you can say oh I'm

coffee country that's really an

interesting and really smart way to

handle that and to show that there's all

different colors like look how many

colors there are out there right that's

so I'm even shades at the same color he

mentioned what would the two of you to

say say to parents out there who might

be kind of afraid to bring up race to

their kids and may think it would have a

negative effect right now because there

might be divisive what would you say to

that Brandon I think whether you're

black white or whatever I think you know

as you actually talked about and you

mentioned kids are gonna ask these

questions they're gonna be curious their

questions are relevant I think to like

be honest with them but also talk about

race and diversity not from a deficit

right and also for black parents I know

like for us it's it's it was really

having those conversations whether it

was around race or it's around gender

sexuality well my kid was my middle son

was seven he asked he asked us about oh

you asked me specifically cuz I was in a

car waiting for him or waiting with him

he talked about you know two guys

kissing and it was sort of having this

conversation around like you know it's

okay if they're in love they're having

this comments like it's okay and

different folks love differently but in

the moment I was terrified because you

recognize how important this responses

and there's no there's no blueprint you

know so you know it's really being

tentative and and and careful with the

response yeah my viewpoint is fair

we teach our kids about colors we teach

them to be kind we tell them they need

to share in the same vein we really need

to teach them to be respectfully curious

right so we whenever they ask questions

and they say the darndest things right

think that we wouldn't say as an adult

but what we need to remember is that

those questions aren't coming from a

place of judgment at this stage so we

should use that opportunity to teach

them that you know

yes we're all different but we're

created equal but also that life's

unfair and racism does exist so what I

want to do is actually arm them with the

right tools so that when they are

subjected to that they can step up and

either have a conversation and question

what's going around or actually call it

out if it is racism in their circles and

I need to ensure that we've laid that

foundation and not having the

conversations it's just doing more harm

yeah this has been really helpful for me

as a mother I hope it's been helpful to

other parents out there thank you both

open about what you've gone through with

your family so thank you thank you very
