Thank You mayor so I'm here to provide

an update for what you are well aware as

an active shooter that kurd in the

oregon district and the early morning

hours of today a little bit of a

timeline today at 1:05 a.m. officers

were patrolling the oregon district

during bar closing time and heard

gunfire they observed a large crowd

running away from this gunfire the

officers immediately advanced toward the

gunfire and within approximately 20

seconds they engaged a suspect it was

actively firing and attempting to enter

a crowded liquor establishment threat

was neutralized in approximately 30

seconds of the suspect firing his first

shots you will now hear a one of the

9-1-1 calls be received

[Music]

[Music]

now you will see a video that was taken

inside of one of the shops on Fifth

Street in the Oregon district

the suspect has been identified as a

Connor Steven Betts is a minimal

criminal history as an adult his traffic

violations speed founder control and

failure to yield he was wearing a mask

like bulletproof vest in hearing

protection he was armed with a point two

to three caliber like rifle with

100-round drum magazines he has a 24

overview of this scene of this entire

incident is now on your screen in the

lower left hand corner you see a square

that is the approximate location of the

suspects vehicle that was parked and in

the suspect left and then went on to

commit this assault the rectangular area

toward the the right side and more

center of the diagram is where the

suspect fires dispersed shots and killed

his first victim he then enters on to

5th Street and then there are eight

other victims killed by the suspect

before

or he is fatally struck at the entrance

to net peppers which is where the circle

designates this is just a suspect

initial route so you saw that square

block our box that was on the screen

saying where he fired his initial shots

this is that area lumen ated in the

daytime here and that red arrow is the

pathway he took to get the fifth Street

we're now going to show a couple of

videos of this event that will show

graphic content they will show police

officers engage this individual they

will show multiple shots being fired we

have done try to eliminate any video at

this time that shows any victims who are

shot so we'll start with the first video

these are outside of Ned peppers

the Dayton police officer running on the

top of the screen to engage the suspect

see the suspect entered his bottom

right-hand corner of the screen

that's him there entering or attempting

internet peppers when he has struck

multiple times and he stops there and

there's another video here a little bit

different angle you see a lot of

officers who were entering in from the

upper left-hand corner of this screen

and begin heading down the roadway there

to engage the suspect

here's one officer there

another officer coming patrol rifle

additional officers responding

an officer with a sergeant with a

shotgun

next is a photographs of the suspects

vehicle which is a 2007 great Toyota

more than 12 plus hours into this event

so much is unknown the Dade Police

Department homicide

Investigation administrative

investigation will be conducted by

professional standards Bureau and that

occurs anytime an austere discharge as a

firearm her Police Department the policy

for the five officers and one sergeant

we're gonna be placed on administrative

leave that is per protocol

we are still asking for assistance to

this investigation notwithstanding the

substantial local and federal and even

state resources dedicated to this

investigations if there's any

information garnets incident we were

regards requested to be relayed to

dayton police department like calling

the tip line at nine three seven two two

five six two one seven there's a Family

Assistance Center has been established

at the Dayton Convention Center where

you are at and can be contacted directly

at nine three seven three three three

eight four three zero and for additional

information please follow our xx Twitter

page at dayton police that is the

entirety of the presentation at this

time the status of this investigation

once again to reiterate we are very very

early into this investigation any

suggestion at this time a motive would

be irresponsible we do not have

sufficient information to answer the

question and everyone wants to know why

we do not have that answer at this time

we will clearly pursue this

investigation to try to understand

motivation in this crime to assuming

that there is a motivation that's

understandable

so that's still before us we have a lot

of evidence to process through from

digital evidence to physical evidence to

phone evidence so much much

investigation is before us so we're very

early on this is very basic preliminary

information I'm able to provide at this

time with that I will open up to any

questions you may have

we have no information to substantiate

that at all there was there was a

superior officer after the suspect was

down who removed the rifle from

underneath him or the weapon from

underneath him that happened but I have

no information to corroborate what you

were what you just mentioned we're gonna

have to do this in orderly fashion

no she was not the first victim but she

was one of the initial victims right as

the he came out of that alleyway she and

a another male who is was a companion of

the suspect was shot and wounded so they

were victims initially after the first

person was shot so very close proximity

I can't speak to the evidence is

recovered we clearly did recover

evidence there much of this we have to

examine so I can't really comment

further on that at this time well

there's more than one gun but they can

tell you that particular weapon that you

saw was ordered online from Texas but

transferred to the suspect at a local

firearms dealer here in this area

there's also a shotgun that was acquired

from a local firearms dealer here two

different dealers but the ridge that

weapon originated in Texas

[Music]

let me say there's nothing in this

individuals history or record that would

have precluded him from purchasing that

firearm there was no indication that

that is illegal at this time to mention

it I don't think I understand your

question it's a white male we have no

evidence to suggest that there's a bias

motive in this crime it is certainly

dozens were fired I don't think we have

a count at this point so I don't want to

put a number out there and it would not

be accurate but dozens of rounds were

fired we're hearing from

what would tell you that what was

crucial in their response was the

availability of both shotgun and patrol

rifle that was crucial that was a

commitment we made really well over a

decade ago and even added to that

inventory since my tenure is chief I'm

in my twelfth year now so recognizing

the potential threats that we could face

particularly people wearing ballistic

armor we know we have to have the kind

of equipment and weaponry to be able to

thwart that that was pretty crucial in

this case and I'm sorry you had probably

had a question yes yes they have the

information we have as they all came in

the same vehicle but they separated at

some point no information in that regard

well I think you can imagine this is a

nightmare for them and I think they are

struggling as you can understand we've

had a chance to have contact with them

yes we've had we have no information to

suggest that we had an opportunity to

talk to the individual who wrote in a

vehicle with them so with that his part

of her investigation that's ongoing yes

we do have the information but we're not

gonna release it at this time we're

hearing from classmates of his from

Bellbrook saying when he was in school

there he was suspended for a year

because he had a hit list can you

confirm any of that I know no criminal

charges were fine I can't confirm and

I'm gonna come because it's gonna speak

the potential motive right I mean that's

what people are trying to get to here

there is far too much information that

we have to review before we can even

begin a conversation about a possible

motive and I will not talk about any

potential slice of evidence is value or

not at this time is just way too early

yes

and I'll just reconfirm we have a the

shotgun wasn't yes so there are two

weapons but one of which was using the L

it let me just say that those weapons

eventually wound up at that location

they separated at some point later in

that evening so what he did during that

time that they were no longer together

is a question mark in our investigation

and something we're gonna have to

determine I think that question was

already asked and I said we're not going

to talk about any evidence you know I I

don't have a number for you right now we

were trying to confirm that we basically

do ballistics check so we look for shell

casings at the scene then we have to

match that against magazine capacity and

brown's missing and that's not always a

precise comparison so i don't have a

precise number for you at this we don't

have any reason to believe that any of

the persons deceased were shot by other

than the assailant at this time

they did at some point in time I don't

think we have a precise time for that

but clearly it was some point in the

evening that they did part ways I don't

have that bail between right now we

don't have that specific information I

don't think we have that known with

absolute certainty there was a vehicle's

shot early on in that exchange right but

right as our officers were either

engaging or about to engage so I can't

really speak to that

precisely that's really something we

can't tell at this point it's it's a

question it's a nagging question and I

just don't have the answer we're trying

to sort through that ourselves

know that I'm aware of

not that we're aware of so we really

don't know if there that was somehow

love importance we don't have I think

anything precise on the other

twenty-seven doing one critical once

critical well units interesting because

we already have a concentration present

or just because it's an entertainment

venue we realize a lot of people come to

Oregon district I've been there very

recently so certainly we know a lot of

folks are be there and we have police

officers present because of that reason

so well this causes to evaluate we will

evaluate everything that touches on this

incident just to determine whether we do

need to anything differently but there

were certainly plenty of officers

present that acted virtually

instantaneously and effectively ended

this in thirty seconds

it was crucial had this individual made

it through the doorway of net peppers

with that level of weaponry there have

been a catastrophic injury and loss of

life so stopping him before he could get

inside there where you saw the people

they were running in there for

protection was essential and minimizing

the degree we could casualties and

deaths from this incident I'm not aware

of that being the case they were

obtained legally yes none Mike

no he was he's one of the ones that was

injured transported the hospital that is

correct

yeah ballistic vest that's some sort of

a mass correct I don't have the

information available just to clarify

the companion that was the shooters

companion or the sister's companion well

I'd say was one in the same I'm all came

together I do want to pause for men

because I want like the FBI has a site

that we want to get out publicly Todd

have you come join us and introduce

yourself yeah I'm Todd wicker ham I'm

the FBI Special Agent in Charge for this

part of the state and www.fbi.gov

Dayton is shooting right so one more

Dayton shooting after WWI FBI gov

backslash dayton shooting and what we

can people can submit there if they have

videos if they have other social media

associated with this shooting that they

think would be a value to the

investigation this is where they can go

to upload this to get it in the right

hands as we're working gently with

dayton on this investigation Thank You

Ben do you want to mention anything

regarding Department of Justice

attention to this matter chief I just

wanted to say on behalf of the United

States that the Department of Justice as

you can see has working closely giving

our full support to Dayton in its

investigation the United States stands

with Dayton our condolences to the

victims and the families of the deceased

and obviously the United States is going

to provide all resources that it has

that it's disposable from any agencies

in order to further this investigation

to its completion working with the

Dayton police

you can we can get it to you but we'll

get the video we have to find a way to

do there cuz there's a lot of you here

and so we got to figure out how what

that looks like so maybe it's out there

in the public domain you can access I

don't know what the let's talk that

through that's a technological piece I

don't I don't have mastery over right

now so what to come back to that right

right we have six so a sergeant and five

officers fired at least one round yeah I

answered that previously he was wounded

but not so serious that we were not able

at least to have some initial

conversation with the ad I don't have a

great answer for I can tell you six of

them or they're that engaged that I can

tell you

I mean certainly there's there is

training I mean even looking at

someone's gate how they walk and be

suggestive of carrying a firearm certain

mannerisms can be suggesting them

carrying a firearm this firearm wasn't

hidden so this wasn't hard to probably

figure out once it emerged but for

weapons that are more concealable that's

a little bit more of a challenge but

there are some ways for people to for

police officers and particularly - a to

have some indication that person may be

armed and be able to take action

well it wasn't sold in that in that

final condition that has some level of

modification to it yeah so there had

been some modifications and I can't

speak it isn't specific but it wasn't

sold in that particular State

ar-15 like alike would be a properly

probably the right way to say that we

did we have digital evidence we have

phone evidence so I want to want to get

into greater detail there but clearly we

were looking for any kind of evidence we

can this day and age a lot of evidence

of digital yes not at all do we know

who's registered to to his father

not this particular type of event now

we've had some multiple casualty

shootings but they weren't what we would

describe as an active shooter certainly

my tenure

that's what's not known it's just not

known so we can't say that what

precision whether the weapons were there

all the time or after they separated

that's when the person wouldn't got

equipment and geared up we just don't

know at this time we're hoping to

determine that collectively

I don't know it's a question I want to

kind of speculate here we carry

sufficient and we do have the ability of

additional rounds should we need them

and we deploy those in a way to sense if

we think makes sense I'm not going to

say what that is we need to resolve

every piece of certainly evidence

evaluate every piece of evidence that we

have now and we'll receive until the

point we believe we have no more

evidence to review and that includes

interviewing over we need an interview

that may be able to shed light on this

individuals conduct in recent days as

well as any historical information we

think would be important to know that

could explain conduct ultimately so

until we have what we think is the known

universe of of evidence we're going to

keep pursuing this investigation I just

don't know when that's going to do

I don't have the information and folks

I've told you everything I really can

share today you'll probably ask a lot of

questions again I've already answered

that's going to conclude this interview

appreciate your attention this manner I

ask you to lift up the victims in this

event and give them the honor and

dignity they deserve in their lives and

for their tragic ultimately avoidable

death that's gonna conclude our press

release press conferences for the day

I'm sure we'll have more in the coming

days ahead I appreciate your patience I

appreciate you working really diligently

to confirm any information that you have

had today I ask you to continue to do

that if we're not giving you the

information there's a reason why because

the investigation is under way I want

you to I'm asking you since we've been

so forthright in these conversations to

respect that back to us as well and make

sure that before you put anything up

that you have it confirmed okay thank

you for being great today
