ladies and gentlemen the President of

the United States accompanied by the

vice president of the United States

Secretary Mark Esper and general J

Raymond

thank you very much it's a great honor

on a beautiful day in the Rose Garden

please sit thank you to ensure that all

resources of the federal government are

focused on the arriving stone I have

decided to send our Vice President Mike

Pence to Poland this weekend in my place

it's something very important for me to

be here the storm looks like it could be

a very very big one indeed and Mike will

be going I've just spoken to president

Duda of Poland and expressed him my

warmest wishes and the wishes of the

American people our highest priority is

the safety and security of the people in

the path of the hurricane and I will be

rescheduling my trip to Poland in the

near future

we're gathered here in the Rose Garden

to establish the United States Space

Command it's a big deal as the newest

combatant command space come we'll

defend America's vital interests in

space the next warfighting domain and I

think that's pretty obvious to everybody

it's all about space we're joined by

Vice President Mike Pence Secretary of

Defense dr. mark Esper Acting Director

of National Intelligence Joe McGuire

acting secretary of the army

Ryan McCarthy acting secretary of the

Air Force Matt Donovan chairman of the

Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph

Dunford and Congressman Mike Turner were

especially grateful to welcome the new

leader of space come general J Raymond

highly respected men within the military

joined this afternoon by his wife Molly

thank you

Thank You Molly congratulations Molly

it's great they're wonderful family and

several of their friends general Raymond

congratulations

so important I know he's going to do a

fantastic job the United States

combatant commands were developed to

join branches of our armed forces in

common cause of course diverse fields of

battle each of the United States and

military's combatant commands has an

area of responsibility from CENTCOM

which oversees our mission in the Middle

East to our most recent Cybercom which

we established just last year to protect

Americans from the most advanced cyber

threats and also to create very very

severe and powerful offensive threats

should we need them the dangers to our

country constantly evolve and so must we

now those who wish to harm the United

States to seek to challenge us in the

ultimate high ground of space it's going

to be a whole different ballgame our

adversaries are weaponizing Earth's

orbits with new technology targeting

American satellites that are critical to

both battlefield operations and our way

of life at home our freedom to operate

in space is also essential to detecting

and destroying any missile launched

against the United States so just as we

have recognized land air sea and cyber

as vital war fighting domains we will

now treat space as an independent region

overseen by a new unified geographic

combatant command the establishment of

the 11th combatant command is a landmark

moment this is a landmark day one that

recognizes the centrality of space to

America's national security and defense

under general Raymond's leadership space

comm will boldly deter aggression and

outpace America's rivals by far for 35

years general Raymond has led and

commanded space operations at every

level in the US Air Force Molly I hope

you're very proud of him I'll bet you

are

I am too he's a warrior who has

integrated space capabilities to make

our military even stronger and to pave

the way for a new era of national

defense he's respected by everybody

sitting in front of us everybody in the

military and everybody that knows him

space comm will soon be followed very

importantly by the establishment of the

United States space force as the sixth

branch of the United States Armed Forces

and that's really something when you

think about it the space Force will

organize train and equip warriors to

support space coms mission with today's

action we open another great chapter in

the extraordinary history of the United

States military space comm will ensure

that America's dominance in space is

never questioned and never threatened

because we know the best way to prevent

conflict is to prepare for victory from

our nation's first days America's

military blazed the trails and cross the

frontiers that secured our nation's

future no adversary on earth will ever

match the awesome courage skill and

might of American Armed Forces

today we salute the heroic men and women

who will serve in space come and keep

America's arises forever bright and

forever free we have budgets since we

came into the administration since the

election of 2016

since January 20th

of 2017 we have done things with the

military that few people would have

thought possible budgets of seven

hundred billion seven hundred and

sixteen billion and now seven hundred

and thirty eight billion dollars nobody

would have thought that that was

possible but we had them approved by

Republicans and Democrats and that money

is now building the most advanced

equipment anywhere on earth equipment

that nobody even could have conceived of

even two years ago it's very necessary

and hopefully we'll never have to use it

I would now like to ask Secretary espera

to sign documents formally establishing

the United States Space Command thank

you
