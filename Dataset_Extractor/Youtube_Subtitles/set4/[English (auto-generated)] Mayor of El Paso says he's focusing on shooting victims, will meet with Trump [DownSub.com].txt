just want your reaction the president

actually just a few moments ago boarded

marine one and said he thinks his

rhetoric is bringing people together

your response to that which rhetoric

what he said

what day before yesterday about anti

white supremacy and all that then I

think that's pretty positive incorrect

but I can't comment on I mean he's I'm

sitting here focused on twenty two folks

from our region who have perished and in

an evil act and we're gonna get through

those funerals I'm gonna meet with him

today as mayor of El Paso representing

all of El Paso and he's fulfilling in

the Office of the President of the

United States which he was elected to

and I think it's it would be my it's my

fiduciary obligation to meet with him

and I frankly think it was his

obligation to be done to come down here

no that's that's everyone's right

there's a lot of people that are that

feel very strongly about where they are

and and I support their ability to do

this but I'm not focusing on that I'm

focusing again 322 funerals and the

people who are pushing back against you

I know you're tired of that well I've

tried to respond to say that I'm trying

to fulfill my obligation as mayor of El

Paso and I represent in a non partisan

race I might add was elected as all of

Texas municipal elections are but I

represent all of El Paso so that's him

what would you like the president to

take away from his visit here today

understand the uniqueness of this

community the fact that we've been here

for 350 years we've actually been here

100 years before the United States was

ever formed we're by national by

cultural were one family covering both

sides commerce family you name it we're

totally unique there's no other place in

North America anywhere near reflective

of El Paso of wadis a region of two and

a half million people with an average

age of 32

we're very special we're totally unique
