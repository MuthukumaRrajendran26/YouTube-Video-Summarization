leave you without talking fashion best

at worst when it comes to fashion for me

there were two best zendaya crushed the

carpet in this emerald green satin

outfit with the boning she had red hair

she shot that carpet down on top of that

Emilia Clarke looked impeccably tailored

in her blue outfit and worse for me was

Zoe Kazan who is a lovely and talented

girl who for some reason wore a buncha

bows yeah I I don't all right yeah max

best I mean I like to diet as well I

actually loved Lilly Singh I loved the

entire cast of shits Creek I liked that

we saw some got a Constantine on Amy

Poehler and on Catherine O'Hara that's

Canadian designers on to be actors but

can we talk worse because it's more fun

so I think Gwyneth Paltrow had the

slowest dress yesterday because it took

her 45 minutes to cross the stage in a

kind of ill-fitting and not terrifically

tailored dress and you sort of wonder

with Gwyneth is did she intentionally

wear something that would slow down her

movement so she could have all that time

on camera it has the one that's the big

soiree and follow them on instagram at

sparks Mickey at max Valiquette Vicki at

max thank you both so much

we're right back after break here the

morning show
