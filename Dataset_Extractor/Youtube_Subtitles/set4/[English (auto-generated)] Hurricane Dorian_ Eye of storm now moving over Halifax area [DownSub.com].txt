Serah it has been a crazy day so far

with this front end of hurricane durian

now a category 2 hurricane and that is

because of some winds that were found on

the backside a little bit earlier this

afternoon 160 kilometres per hour winds

officially we have had gusts in 140 150

range within the Halifax area and that

has caused obviously some trees to come

down power outages are widespread as

you'll talk more about but this radar

says it all all of that green and yellow

and red that's out there well that is

all the front half of the storm the back

half there's barely any rain there is

however quite a bit of wind so as far as

the flooding concern goes river levels

are going to continue to go up even as

the rain tapers off but what we're

seeing as far as storm surge is a

different story and earlier we were

right down by the boardwalk here in

Halifax the waves crashing up during

high tide in fact they were crashing

right through underneath the boardwalk

and that caused some damage up and down

and of course beach erosion is a big

concern once you get out into the open

Atlantic and those shores and we have

now some of the boys that are reporting

waves in the 8 to 12 meter range and

that is incredible stuff the backside

that's what we have left to get through

already the winds are a lot lighter here

Sara than they were just a couple of

hours ago so what's left of the eye well

that's what's moving through Halifax now

that's going to allow some emergency

crews to get out there but don't do too

much outside because I am telling you

that we're gonna see some hundred plus

kilometres per hour gusts on the back

side this time though the wind coming in

from the west and northwest and that's

gonna bring more trees down and

unfortunately it's gonna be a long night

so still a lot to get through but the

glimmer of hope is that right now we're

seeing Dory and a post tropical

hurricane if that makes any sense it's

basically losing its tropical

characteristics but we are going to see

as it comes to shore

finally conditions improving later

tonight
