Trudeau and Trump talked trade off the

top of their meeting which lasted about

half an hour

the Canada us-mexico agreement which

replaces NAFTA still needs to be

ratified and Trump could use Trudeau's

help to convince the democrat-controlled

Congress to do that in the meeting Trump

said he believes the deal has quote

tremendous support from both the

Democrats and Republicans and he hopes

it comes to a vote soon so on this the

two leaders are on the same page but the

American president is certainly not on

the same page with other g7 leaders

there was confusion over just what

everyone agreed to about Iran Trump said

he never discussed the idea of French

mediation and the US would do its own

outreach that prompted French president

Emmanuel macron to clarify publicly

saying he had not been given a formal

mandate from the g7 to mediate but he

will be holding discussions with Tehran

in the coming weeks more tensions in

Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime

Minister Shinzo Abe a where they

disagreed on North Korea's short-range

missile launches Trump saying they

didn't violate UN resolutions all seven

leaders have a full slate of meetings

today Trudeau has a face-to-face with

German Chancellor Angela Merkel this
