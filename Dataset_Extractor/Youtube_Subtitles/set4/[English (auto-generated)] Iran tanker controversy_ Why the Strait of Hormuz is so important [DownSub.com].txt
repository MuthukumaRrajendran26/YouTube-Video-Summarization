this is the strait of hormuz it's one of

the most important waterways in the

world because one-fifth of the world's

oil supply passes through here and it's

where tensions between Iran and the West

have come to a head in the Middle East

tensions ramping up between the u.s. and

Iran tonight with attacks on two oil

tankers in the Gulf of Oman the Strait

of Hormuz lies between Oman and Iran

it's the main channel linking the

Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and

the Arabian Sea Persian Gulf countries

transport their oil to Asia and the west

through the Strait of Hormuz in 2018 an

average of 21 million barrels of oil

passed through the channel each day more

than any other street in the world

so when multiple oil tankers were

attacked in the waterway over the past

few months international alarm bells

went off we started the Middle East and

the growing alarm over what appears to

be new attacks on ships in the region

tensions between Iran and the West have

been skyrocketing since President Donald

Trump pulled out of the landmark 2015

nuclear deal the United States will

withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal the

Trump administration reimpose sanctions

in an effort to reduce Iran's oil

exports to zero and cripple their

economy obviously this angered Iran and

its president Hassan rouhani who was

elected on the promise that he'd get the

economy running again and at the time

rouhani hinted that Iran had the power

to disrupt global oil trade in

retaliation to Trump's sanctions

then in May 2019 for ships were attacked

in the Gulf just beyond the Strait of

Hormuz a month later two more oil

tankers were attacked the US blames Iran

for both attacks but Iran has repeatedly

denied any involvement

in response the u.s. announced that it

would send more troops to the Gulf in a

show of force and Iran shot down a US

drone in a major escalation of tensions

this is also around the same time that

Iran followed through on its longtime

threat to violate part of the 2015

nuclear deal by stockpiling more low

enriched uranium and then is allowed the

Europeans have failed to fulfill their

promises of protecting Iran's interests

under the deal then in July the UK sees

an Iranian oil tanker suspected of

transporting oil to Syria in violation

of EU sanctions manganese yo me llamo

always gotta know I'm neon state babble

yet have a artists role but i'm b'fer

Madrid arconi a week later

Iran's Revolutionary Guards seized a

British flag oil tanker in the Strait of

Hormuz all of this has caused only a

small surge in oil prices so far Iran

has threatened to close the waterway

entirely bottlenecking oil exports from

the Gulf including their own but it has

made that threat before and never follow

through to show you I was right about

Iran trouble nothing but trouble Trump's

hardline approach with Iran has led to a

geopolitical row that gets Messier by

the week and all eyes are on the Strait

of Hormuz
