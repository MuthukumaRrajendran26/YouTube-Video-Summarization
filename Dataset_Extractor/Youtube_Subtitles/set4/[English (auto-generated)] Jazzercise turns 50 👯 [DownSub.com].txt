now your favorite thing the ham sugar

come on when I shake that cute little

bunny of yours

nothing screams the 80s quite like

Jazzercise the perms the tights whatever

move this is but the workout craze

actually started long before the 80s by

this lady right here Judy Shepard miss

it while you might recognize her as the

lead instructor in all of the old

Jazzercise videos she's also the founder

and CEO of what has become one of the

biggest fitness franchises ever this is

a young Judy she took her first ever

dance class at two-and-a-half years old

fast forward to 1969 when she founded

Jazzercise in a Chicago dance studio

teaching her own aerobic dance class

based on classical jazz dance it didn't

take her long to find her groove and

soon other women were finding their by

the 80s miss it had trained more than

1,000 instructors her fitness franchise

got so big by 1984 it was the second

fastest growing franchise in the US the

first being Domino's Pizza Jazzercise is

a self-proclaimed dance party it might

look like your mom's workout but it's a

franchise that revolutionized the way

women exercise we have to thank

Jazzercise for really getting us to

rethink what exercise could be it really

was the first time that we saw group

based exercise being promoted on a

population level and specifically being

targeted to women

sound familiar that's because it helps

shape many of the Fitness fads of today

like Zumba and pole dancing all having

an instructor leading the class but

critics say the program that wanted you

to find your perfect body had its flaws

Jazzercise gendered aerobic exercise

meaning it was a type of exercise really

targeted towards women and I think a lot

of men looked at aerobic exercise as

something strictly feminine something

that only girls are women do I think we

still have a long way to go but it is

encouraging to see great

inclusiveness and greater representation

of people in some of the marketing I see

now for Jazzercise so what does the

brand look like today I decided to check

out a Jazzercise class myself although

Jazzercise seems a little bit more well

modern for my first ever class I decided

to kick it old-school

[Music]

we actually people have students who are

60s and in their 70s still taking this

program and they're fit people we just

involve everybody and anybody that loves

to dance I saw results really quickly in

about 12 weeks I'd lost 10 back 10

pounds and I just saw my body completely

changed really quickly and it's really

fun that seems to be the biggest reason

why so many people stick to Jazzercise

and you don't have to be a pro to master

the moves take it from me it's no wonder

why Jazzercise is still taking the

fitness world by storm it has thousands

of franchises in more than 30 countries

and the company rakes in roughly 100

million dollars per year the brand has

come a long way since its leotard and

leg warmer beginnings but what never

goes out of style is a great dance party

you got to get up and boogie at this

time a

[Music]

you
