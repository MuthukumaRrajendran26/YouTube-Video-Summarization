hours after Carrie Lam announced she'd

withdraw the extradition bill in a plea

for peace and calm protesters and police

clashed at this subway station she

thinks that she can use some garden hose

to put out a hill fire that's not too

going to be acceptable

the overwhelming feeling this move comes

too little too late this high profile

activist is calling for protests to

continue Beijing and Chinese authorities

just try to stop our protest by

announcing such withdraw withdrawal of

bill nobody sees a short-term fix to

this from Beijing's perspective there

they're playing a long game Hong Kong

watcher Jeffrey Reeves says pulling the

bill was an important step and while

it's too early to know whether this will

stop or bolster protests there is a

chance Lam's address could turn public

opinion against the protesters the fact

that Carrie Lam has come forward and

formally canceled this extradition bill

could actually bring some of the more

moderates in Hong Kong over to the

government side Carrie Lam has not shown

any sense of remorse and this she is

only addressed to one of the five

demands while the extradition bill was

the headline for protesters there other

demands carry a lot of weight universal

suffrage amnesty for the more than 1,100

people arrested and an independent

inquiry into alleged police brutality if

the other four demands have not been

addressed to the anger will still be

there and the people will go on

protesting activists are calling for the

protests to continue until at least

October first

that's the 70th anniversary of the

People's Republic of China abigail
