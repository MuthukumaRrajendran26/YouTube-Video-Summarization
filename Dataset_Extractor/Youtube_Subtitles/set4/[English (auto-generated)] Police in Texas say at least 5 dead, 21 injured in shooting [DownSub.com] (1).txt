well what a horrific day for Odessa

actor County Building Midland County

let's start at the beginning

situation started about 3:17 this

afternoon when a DPS trooper attempted

to stop a gold Honda when the DPS

troopers got the car stopped

he was then shot by the occupant of the

car the vehicle will continued westbound

into the city of Odessa and shot an

individual at I 20 in our West excuse me

Mary easily

apparently the subject then drove on our

east loop to 42nd Street where there are

multiple scenes and multiple victims at

some point the subject stole a mail

truck ditched his car and there were

other victims after that the victims in

went eastbound back on 42nd towards

synergy which is a local movie theater

and at that point was contacted by law

enforcement the officers from the old

that's the police department the Midland

Police Department the Texas Department

of Public Safety and then I'm sure

others again this is a very fluid

changing situation so please understand

what I'm telling you is is not written

in stone these these facts these this

knowledge can change okay at that point

this subject was contacted by law

enforcement and he an exchange of

gunfire happened and that subjected

deceased at that location we have law

enforcement injured we have the DPS

trooper in Midland County we have one

MPD officer and one OPD officer they

were struck as far as civilian

casualties we have at least 21 victims

21 shooting victims

at least five deceased at this point

I'll please understand that this is not

just a NOPD and in Midland Police

Department and the DPS thing both

Sheriff's Office Midland County

Sheriff's Office and Edgar County

Sheriff's Office was involved in the

hunt for this guy our local school

district Police Department our

University of the Texas of the Permian

Basin school excuse me police department

was involved this was a joint effort by

just a multitude of departments to find

this animal and bring him to justice

at this point I'll take questions right

now I'll tell you that he is a white

male in his mid 30s I don't have a

positive identification on him

yet I have an idea who he is so I won't

release that information until we're

absolutely positive we have we've had

calls which is to be expected because

obviously our citizens are a little

jumpy after this which is also to be

expected but at once this individual was

taken out of the picture there have been

no more victims there have been reports

that that's possible but again there

have been new no confirmations of that I

[Music]

can't I can't tell you that right now

and in you know the big thing is it's so

chaotic still at the local hospitals

that it's very difficult to get that

information

well again once we are able to compile a

list of victims names we can absolutely

put that out

the hospital has set up area for

patients families Medical Center

hospital has another area for patients

daily in the cafeteria and maybe

chocolates on set so we got reports of

two vehicles earlier today wait I guess

is that not confirmed I think what the

issue with that was that you had the the

original vehicle and then you had the

mail truck at one point we didn't know

that that was the same person but that

is confirmed now same person anything

else obviously it was a gun at this

point I'm really not sure

again if they'd started with this

traffic stop the attempted traffic stop

by GPS you know I would I would tell

people to still be cautious still trying

to stay in their residences if at all

possible we do believe that we have the

threat contained but I can't be 1000%

positive if that's the case at this

point no no absolutely I can't tell you

of a motive at this point I do not at

this point I don't know I would assume

that he's part of the victim list but

I'm not sure of his status not to mine

out

thank you guys I'm gonna go back to work

and we'll we will update you

periodically okay this is police Turkey

in Turkey if ger ke is Gerke yes

John Alvarez testing 1 2 3

[Music]

mmm sorry chief John al Burris Jo HN al

var easy fire chief will justify risky

well so far we've got 21 victims that

were transported to either medical

center or or MC we've also had some that

were transported to Midland Memorial

Hospital

so that that's the count at this point

as our our Pia public information

officer said that once we get that

information once we get the list then

we'll be able to put that information

out to the public to be able to reach

out to the loved ones somewhere yes for

the most part that we're going to shot

victims on portage unfortunately we did

have the count right now has five

deceased according to the the reports

that I have received so that's what we

have at this point that is my

understanding I mean I'm not not law

enforcement but that's that's the

understanding that I have is that it did

move from Midland Odessa and

unfortunately we did have some

casualties here well it's too early to

say right now at this point but I can

tell you that right now is just you know

just shelter in place right now I'm sure

the the police department has sent out

that message to the community to make

sure that everybody's aware of what's

going on at this point that that count

we're just trying to figure that out at

this point but I can tell you that we've

notified Medical Center Hospital we've

also notified or that's a Regional

Medical Center and middle of Memorial

Hospital so we've also notify our

outlying communities such as Andrews

crane for any assistance we do have

Midland Fire Department here that is

Assistant

they've had got several units that are

assistant that are provided to us to

assist assist us with any any thing that

comes up at this point where is it that

all 21 people were shot with a shot at

this energy ma'am I do not know I do not

know that as I'm not law enforcement but

all I can tell you is that we've had

several casualties that we transported

we have several of our units we to the

point to where we had a call for men the

fire department to assist us with some

of our EMS runs out here
