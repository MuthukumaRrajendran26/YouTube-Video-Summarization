so they're using cemetery material of

the bill about universal background

checks for firearms the US Congress

passed it but neither the Pennsylvania

House nor Senate will pass that

legislation and finally 7f Francine in

Allegheny County representing the city

of Pittsburgh which was the last mass

shooting in Pennsylvania where people

were shot and killed in a synagogue

introduced legislation requiring an

assault weapons ban in the Commonwealth

of Pennsylvania and we can't get in

either so it kind of we haven't even

come close I am a father of five

children

my oldest daughter had a boyfriend I was

murdered within the last three years my

son ch√©rif jr. was a student at Gitmo

Tech and all of us saw the career of his

former teammate which the kid was gunned

down he had a full scholarship to Penn

State he was murdered last year my son

lady enhances his stepfather his best

friend stepfather was murdered within

the last two years and my daughter was

with shaylen goes to central and she and

a student was shot out outside of

central and that's supposed to be the

best high school in the Commonwealth of

Pennsylvania and she even she wasn't

safe from this from from her teammates

getting in our classmates being

so no way the Commonwealth of

Pennsylvania have not done everything

we're supposed to do we are derelict in

our duties and this is because the

majority caucus is afraid of the NRA it

refused to call the vote on this

legislation

they are derelict in their duties they

turn their backs of the Commonwealth of

Pennsylvania they turn their backs were

the people that were murdered and square

as though they turn their back one of

the people that are shot not communities

every day they turn their backs with

people that are killed in Allentown and

ready and York and Erie and guess they

turn their backs to the people of North

Philadelphia including as a police

department who should not have to go up

against people who have firearms that

could shoot at a distance fire weapons

and fire weapons and rapid fire so we

have to come close we have work to do

and we've members in this town members

of Athena up here in pulse we're special

session but we don't have time for a

special session we could debate it argue

every kind of thing there's legislation

management Oxley we have not felt public

hearings for that legislation we have

not held folks in that legislation we're

not even come close to doing what we're

supposed to do so the next time one of

my colleagues ostlers their thoughts and

prayers and pretend somehow that there

are people of faith I say touch over

some works their faith is dead

it was a General Assembly and obviously

not the people in this room was very

clearly pushing the envelope but those

other individuals both from the state

and federal government need to step to

the plate and here's a few and proud of

this citizen of this country and move

some good sense of reasonable

legislation to get these assault-style

weapons off the street is it not Afghans

and this is not our breath right this is

the United States of America so this had

no place in our country we have prepared

my colleagues and counsel are prepared

and continuous to be compared to do

whatever we need to do to be in lobbying

being able to pass legislation

once we unable by the state to do what

we need to do to make sure that our

streets continue to stay safe so so all

of us into those family members only

thank you I know we have some work to do

in the neighborhood back I'd like to

introduce
