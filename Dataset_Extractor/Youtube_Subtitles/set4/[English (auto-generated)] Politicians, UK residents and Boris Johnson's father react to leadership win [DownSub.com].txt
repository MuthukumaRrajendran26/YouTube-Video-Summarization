well obviously I'm very disappointed for

me and my team but I'm also incredibly

proud of the campaign that we ran I

think we did ourselves proud and this

was always going to be uphill for us

because I was someone who voted remain

we have a prime minister who voted

remain and I think lots of conservative

party members felt that this was a

moment when you just had to have someone

who voted for brexit in the referendum

and that was in retrospect that was a

hurdle we were never able to overcome

but I think that being said there was a

lot of progress and you know I am

delighted for the country that Boris has

become Prime Minister I think he will be

a great Prime Minister you know I think

Boris fought a very very good campaign

was very clear campaign his messages

were absolutely clear and you know I

think as I say he will now be a great

Prime Minister it's a challenging moment

for our country this is perhaps the most

difficult legacy that a Prime Minister

is inherited in peacetime it's a it's

going to be very challenging but he has

got the confidence and the optimism and

the energy to get us through this and

you know that's why I think whatever our

differences on brexit the biggest risk

to this country is Jeremy Corbyn and

that unites every single Conservative MP

whichever part of a brexit debate

they're on and they know that if we

don't now unite as a party behind the

new Prime Minister then we are going to

hand the keys at number 10 to someone

who certainly won't deliver brexit we

will do an enormous amount of damage in

many many other ways I don't think we

are necessarily looking at an OD or

brexit I think that the European Union

do want to find a deal and if we

approach this in the right way as I'm

sure Boris will then I think there's

every chance that we could do a deal but

they have to know that what is not up

for negotiation is the fact a brexit I

was actually leaving the European Union

yeah and I'm looking forward to you know

obviously gotta get breakfast out

but you know you're not a primary table

is not just for Christmas and this Prime

Minister's present you know listen look

ahead let's look ahead no survivors the

pyro Prime Minister one of the first

places I would go to would be Brazil

look what happened to the Brazilian

rainforests of the Amazon rainforest you

know he needs to sit down with president

box and say look come on

the whole world's future is being

affected by why what's happening the

Amazon so that's that's one of the items

on the agenda and yes how will the

family celebrates a very good question

we must have a little family meeting to

say how should we celebrate we will

celebrate that's for sure I think at

this particular weekend you know

there'll be a lot else happening but

we'll find the time you choose them have

chosen boys Johnson's people burger and

I think in retrospect it was officially

the trees are made to be part of the

mandate when she became Prime Minister I

think it made I'm not this part and I

think this is a very propitious stop

boys he will unite the party and the

country

once we've left the European Union

almost nobody will ever want to rejoin

such a failing organization so it's a

terrific opportunity for unity and

positivity for this great nation that's

very good news for us has done so well

but I've been supporting Boris for a

long time he has my complete support if

he wants me to do anything for him I'll

of course do it but the key is that we

deliver brexit and deliver what the

country needs not about me we recognize

that this is one of the biggest

challenges that we faced online being a

very deep relationship with yoga we

continue to have European values we

continue to be the heart

to have a close relationship with your

bu

but it is also essential we deliver on

the biggest motive of history and

deliver brexit

which is what 7.4 million people voted

for so Boris absolutely gets that and

that's what is permitted to do will you

be the Houston it's always for the new

prime minister is for the boys because I

think he's the right person to take the

country forward but it's always with a

new family

I think it's just a next Trump to be

honest so you know it's not going well

I was kind of rooting for Teresa meadow

and that was unfortunate but you know

just probably for another election maybe

horrified

to be honest I just think like do you

think two huge powers run by these sort

of white men with blonde probably hair

who don't really care what they say as

long as it's pop their opinion yeah I

mean it's around us I do you think he

probably is a smart person but I don't

think he has anyone's best interest at

heart of his own I don't think he's got

any more charts and trees and mayor I

think he's if he's a good politician

he's very good at spinning his own story

I think it's quite sad for our country

to be honest with you I think the people

deserve the truth
