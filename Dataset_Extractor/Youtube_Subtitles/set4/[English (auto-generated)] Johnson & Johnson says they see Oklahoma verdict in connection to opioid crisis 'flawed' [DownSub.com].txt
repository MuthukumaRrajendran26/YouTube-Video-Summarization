like to start out by saying we are

disappointed and disagree with the

judge's decision we believe that it is

flawed

we have sympathy for all who suffer from

substance abuse but Johnson and Johnson

did not cause the opioid abuse crisis

here in Oklahoma or anywhere in this

country we do not believe that the facts

or the law supports the decision today

we have many strong grounds for appeal

and we intend to pursue those vigorously

the facts are that the company

manufactured two fda-approved medicines

that are essential for treating patients

who suffer from chronic long-term

debilitating pain and the evidence at

trial showed that the company

manufactured and marketed those

medicines in compliance with strict

regulations by the FDA and the DEA the

evidence at trial also showed that the

company's medicines were rarely diverted

rarely abused and they amounted to less

than 1% of all opioid prescriptions

prescribed to patients in Oklahoma

that's true throughout the country as

well and at trial you will remember

there was not a single Oklahoma patient

or family member who testified about

abuse or misuse of any

Johnson & Johnson medicine and you'll

remember that the state never called a

single doctor a single Oklahoma doctor

to testify that they were misled by

anything that the company said or did

today's decision reflects a radical

departure from more than a century of

case law in this state for over a

hundred years public nuisance law has

been limited to property disputes where

one misuses their property and cares'

harm to another that is not what this

case is about no Oklahoma Oklahoma Court

has ever done what this Court has done

today in applying public nuisance law to

any commercial activity let alone the

highly regulated area of prescription

medicines the decision violates

well-established

constitutional principles including due

process of law and at bottom the

decision is fundamentally unfair in that

it finds Johnson and Johnson

responsible for the entirety of the

opioid abuse crisis and the greater drug

problems in this state while there was

no evidence at trial to support that

finding we will be preparing our

appellate papers promptly and we look

forward to presenting these issues to

the Oklahoma Supreme Court
