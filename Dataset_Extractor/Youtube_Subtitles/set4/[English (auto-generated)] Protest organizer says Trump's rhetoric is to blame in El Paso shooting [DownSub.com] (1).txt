you know first I need to tell you the

word transition in between morning I

mean we still that this various is a

very slow process into reflection in

action in our community our families are

asking this question why this happening

in Y El Paso and I think the answer to

ask what what question is what is

motivating today's action today's event

because we realize that there's a strong

connection between the shooter's

language motives and president Trump's

rhetoric he consistently in the last two

three years he has been attacking our

communities in many ways he's been

calling us rate criminals rapists that

immigrants represent a national security

threat just few days ago I mean so few

months ago we had some of the white

national nationalistic militias white

supremacist militias that came down to

El Paso and I engaged them in a public

debate in one thing they mentioned they

were coming to the border responded to

Trump's call to action to protect the

water from the invasion white

supremacists are malicious at that time

so it happens that that is the wars that

this shooter using the manifester

manifesto and that is what the president

has been saying all of this time so

there is responsibility in the president

that is the feeling of our community

that these victims are dead because of

the president's war so we cannot welcome

the president he is not welcome in El

Paso

and we're gonna show that in members

were bringing a lot of people from

different sectors elected officials

community members families working

together and send that specific message

but also we're reaffirming that the path

will continue to hear an open community

a community that welcomes immigrants and

refugees so you felt like your community

was targeted long before they're

shooting simply because the president

president's rhetoric you know we had

seen family separation children

separated from their mothers here no

possible due to the policies of the

president what's in children dying in

detention centers in border patrol

stations building walls rejecting

refugees

that is under the president's watch in

using this bitch'll in this hateful

language so yes we mean we said it

before even before this terrorist that

that there was a war there's a war

against immigrants fueled by president's

rhetoric so yes I mean we felt that the

President had actually attacked the

symbol of what a possible presents the

president issued this call for unity

earlier this week but he seemed to undo

that I mean he's already tweeting you

know criticism of better or work for

example you know is cynical at least the

president is saying that uh that because

children are playing Nintendo's and

because there are mental health issues

he refused to accept responsibility

instead of changing what he's doing that

is causing too much harm in our

communities he continues to do exactly

the same dividing our communities

blaming and others by not taking

responsibility that is not acceptable

acceptable for us do you think the do

you think the president message but I

think I hope that he's gonna listen

thousands of people that sign a letter

in less than 24 hours 17,000 sign a

letter an open letter from a password

saying that he's not welcome until he

repents until he asks for forgiveness

until he change his policies in his

rhetoric I think I hope that the numbers

of people rejecting him not welcomed him

I think that is that should be the

message excellent thank you for your

time sir preciate
