this just in to CNN Russian hacker is

managed to infiltrate the computer

network at the Democratic National

Committee and where ever since Russia

was accused of hacking and meddling in

the 2016 US presidential vote more than

30 other countries have had their

elections targeted by similar online

disinformation campaigns the tactics

include fake online posts doctored

images and audio recordings even deep

fake videos it's very easy now for

people to manipulate public opinion

using free and very simple technologies

and Russia is no longer the game's only

player potentially places like Iran or

Saudi Arabia and China anybody who wants

to have an influence can and can do it

and pretty easily but a group of

Canadians is now fighting back academics

and data scientists from across Canada

have launched the digital democracy

project a first-of-its-kind initiative

to monitor the information Canadians are

consuming online by analyzing hundreds

of thousands of posts on social media

each week we're interested in for

instance identifying one particular

rumor and then figuring out where that

rumor entered the social media ecosystem

or really get one one hashtag who is the

first user the project will also be

conducting regular national surveys to

see how social media is influencing

public opinion and we think this is the

first time at this scale these two tools

have been brought together to really

understand how the media environment is

shaping the election Jeff sample Global
