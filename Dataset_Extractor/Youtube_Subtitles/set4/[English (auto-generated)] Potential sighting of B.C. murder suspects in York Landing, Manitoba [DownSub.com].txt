okay fantastic teams walk me through

what's happened this afternoon at 4:15

we had a group patrolling near the list

the I guess the garbage dumped in the

sewer treatment plant in New York

Landing and they saw two men that

matched the description of those that

that are being searched for currently

made possibly scavenging food out of the

dump um they kind of weren't they didn't

think it was them immediately so they

kind of went about their business and

then they realize that there was no

truck associated with activities at the

sewage treatment plant and that's when

they realized that those two men were

probably the ones they were looking for

so they immediately called 911 or I

guess their RCMP and let them know that

they've made a sighting of them so now

the towns in lockdown RCMP are are on

the ground they're choose New York

constant just made it back to the

community just off the ferry just now

and you have to your search is well

underway oh my goodness amazing work I'm

just gonna break it down a little bit if

you don't mind so when they saw these

two individuals if you can expand a

little bit on what they were doing and

how they appeared well I don't have that

much information other than my group was

there patrolling around the garbage dump

recently they always put the garbage

dump kind of separate from the community

often often away and when they came

across the the the garbage dump area

there's I guess there's some problems of

the sewage treatment plant so there's

been workers going coming and going from

the sewage treatment plant when they saw

the two men they thought maybe it was

workers from the sewage treatment plant

but then they didn't see that would be

associated with that kind of activity so

then they refocused their their

attention on those guys by the garbage

dump when the guys of the garbage dump

recognized that they were spotted they

bolted across the road towards the

lagoon then into a tree line and

disappeared so now they've gone and

called RCMP RCMP is there they've taken

them to where they saw them last

I guess maybe they can pick up a scent

or something like that and and and the

search is begun so they're in the Deb

dobkins there already there's post

hoppers in the air yeah oh my goodness

what major team go to that area to begin

with

well I guess they've invited a vehicle

to do some mobile patrols out there and

so that was just part of the their

routine they're just doing they were

doing circuits around the community like

the whole the whole community is

basically everybody's holed up in their

house so it's very desolate so they were

just driving down the roads and checking

everything out and they just happen to

be in that area at the right time are

you there right now no I'm in Winnipeg

okay okay

anything else you can say about the

situation well again I think the RCMP

have a well in hand and the military's

there to back them up you know again we

weren't part of the search we were just

there to secure the village the fact

that we happen to spot them is just

coincidence how many of your members

were out there on this Patrol but we

have three members that were in New York

landing and four that were in Fox Lake

the Fox Lake team left to Gilliam

earlier this afternoon and we're waiting

there for the plane to come and take

them back to Winnipeg since this is all

happened our team and Gilliam don't want

to leave they want to quit your clowning

in the team if you are planning they

were supposed to get on the plane to

come home they're not doing that now

they want to stay with us until it's

done were they supposed to fly home

tonight they were supposed to find home

tonight guys wow that is so fortunate

and were the three three three people

together when they spotted these two

guys or were they was it one for you

yeah no I believe they were all together

in the truck oh well if it turns out to

be them you're the you're the country's

heroes I think that's probably fair to

say
