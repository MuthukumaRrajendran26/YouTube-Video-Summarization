hi my name is Lilly Singh and I've shot

over 2,000 sketches but today I'm so

nervous

I up a woman oh my that is a

great question and the answer is I will

do everything in my power to ensure that

he is on the show I've been already kind

of working with him on it we do a little

like a little bit I would love it yeah I

mean it's a half-hour late night show

it's going to be sketch comedy we're

gonna do a take of the monologue I'm

gonna have guests

probably some musical sketch comedy as

well it's not so much of the things I've

done on YouTube but we're gonna change

up a little bit positive uplifting

comedic good back

[Music]

that's how fuels I know it feels great

obviously it's a huge honor for me

what's really special is just the fact

that if this is like proof that

everything we do is put in the past you

know I've always felt in my career if I

could just do something that makes

someone else's life easier if I come

back through that's what I want to do

and the fact that I'm in the solution

shows that all the way for me I've done

just that one movie so it's been really

humbling and

once again uh you know I was in a little

bit of state of shock where I didn't

completely believe the caliber and the

extent to which this was gonna happen

but it was very excited about the other

side I'm very nervous I'm both

he's last I mean of course I'm scared

I'm scared I'm nervous I'm excited but

anyone I care yes I love Jimmy Fallon

I love joy every time I've asked Jimmy

show he's been so sweet very well first

time ever went on Jimmy show actually he

took me into the audience during the

commercials and he did hakuna with the

audience tonight you just like what like

this is my friend Lily she's gonna do

great

sing one that new is just so sweet and

supportive I've just been texting you

like advice or advice non-stop with some

tire

[Music]

no I didn't think I would create a

second YouTube video so this is a long

way from that - absolutely not I think

it's important for everyone regardless

of which industry you work in I think

menthols is so important I think it's

something we should talk about more and

I think something that schools should

teach to be honest because something

I've really struggled with is like you

know in school I taught how to be

organized how to be efficient with my

time I learned facts and figures but I

never really learned how to take care of

my mind how to love myself how to be

confident how to deal with some of my

internal problems and so I could have

some points

besides Scarborough I am so excited from

viewers to just see you know a point of

views and some of they're not going away

next week a woman of color is gonna have

obviously a strong point of view and I

can't wait for you all to see it
