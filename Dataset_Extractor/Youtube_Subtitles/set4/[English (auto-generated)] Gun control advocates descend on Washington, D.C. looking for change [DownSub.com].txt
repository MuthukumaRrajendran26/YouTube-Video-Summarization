yes this protest came together with the

folks who are together we're gonna show

them

[Music]

it just really highlighted

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Applause]

[Applause]

[Applause]

are you feel like with an organization

or you just came in so just ignore him

you can look at me I'll hold the

microphones you don't have to worry

about it okay

awesome so if you could do me a favor

insane smuggling and why did you set for

not here today I decided to come out

here today to condemn the white

supremacy not just coming from the White

House but really the ride

and specifically the Cardinal epidemic

when we're not invading this country we

come here to make America stronger and I

guess do you think that this is more of

a reaction do you think that was

something that seems to have been

targeted

[Applause]

[Music]

quite moment by an administration

and I think that strong gun laws in

place there's no reason why is there

anything specifically you're hoping that

will come from from this you hoping

something's listening I hope the White

House listening but I also hope our

assurance and in the state houses like

they have a responsibility they can take

action

The Killers shooter did not buy done in

California he bought it and brought it

across state lines and it's time for us

thank you very much appreciate it

let's shoot a little bit more wide shot

and that way you can get like from

behind the speakers oh I think goes that

far No do you think that might work yeah

even if we went around yeah like on the

streets I know yeah yeah

Americans when will he reject racism

bigotry it's not surprising right this

is a president who ran on a campaign of

demonizing Muslims Latinos and other

immigrants in his inaugural address to

our nation he painted a dark dark future

for our country even holding American

carnage and he has called African

Americans and where they live disgusting

rat and rodent infested mess he says

that Congress women of color hate

America and should go back to where they

come from the President must stop you

must stop with this racist and

dehumanizing rhetoric but we also need

others to do more the Justice Department

and the FBI need to step up and meet the

urgency of today this is a time for them

to lead by prioritizing the white

nationalist threat and giving it the

resources it needs

we all know the reality especially for

American Muslims the reality is that if

this was an Isis or al-qaeda threat and

there was somebody who killed three

people in Gilroy and then six days later

22 in El Paso Texas we would have

already seen decisive action by the DOJ

and by the FBI for 10 and eight-channel

would have been shut down long ago and

the FBI and the Justice Department

instead shamefully sit on their hands

how many more people must die before

they finally act and protect us but

there's another group of actors who have

a role and have a responsibility to lead

it's tech companies Facebook YouTube

Twitter they must act with the moral

clarity and leadership that this crisis

demands white nationalist rhetoric

thrives on their platforms it is

accelerated by the very sophisticated

algorithms that these very companies

have created beating hate into the minds

of people who thrive on this rhetoric

again we know that if it was Isis or

al-qaeda messages that were on these

platforms tech companies would have

acted long ago right true instead these

companies have profited from hate it's

not just the Trump campaign pumping

millions of dollars into companies like

Facebook but even Amazon is helping

8chan profit to be able to fundraise off

of their platforms so it's a national

disgrace that we have the president the

Republican Party right-wing media and

even tech companies moving courage or

tolerated white nationalists threatens

for too long I want to lead you with

this you've heard a lot of action items

from us so far I want to lead you with

one more Muslim advocates is proud to

stand with a many of our colleagues and

those who are here today in calling on

tech companies can act against hate and

I want to invite you to go to our

website where we have an active campaign

calling on tech companies to do better

to stand up and to use this moment to

use their moral leadership to stop hate

on their planet please go to awesome

advocates or together we will win this

fight but we each have to stand up and

act together thank you and I want to say

very clearly that what the president

tries to disparage a minority and when

he signs it basically sits on idly by as

people say send them back sent her back

he is talking about a hundred and 332

million of us right he is talking about

our families our neighbors our loved

ones our friends look around this is

America yeah when he targeted Latinos by

going down to El Paso the white

supremacist he was very clear what his

call to action was that was to cause

maximum harm because a help house that

was the safest city with 85% Latinos it

was clear what he was trying to do we've

heard the dog whistle turn into action

and we will not tolerate this but when

people say well my vote doesn't count

you know what I say that's crap

because all of a sudden in the halls of

Congress we have the was the single most

I first Congress in this nation's

history and with that not only heavies

in the past background checks but we've

passed the DREAM Act

he's demonstrated where that values are

and it's through the leadership of these

young brave individuals when people say

democracy doesn't matter these are the

ones that cannot vote they are hiding in

the shadows and they came front and

center and said this is my country

yeah and I've learned how to navigate

the systems of power to make sure that

we not only have their back but that we

let them lead so on thank you so much

for joining us right now from United Way

jury

[Applause]

good afternoon everyone my name is Sunna

Brora and I represent United we dreamed

the nation's largest immigrant youth

black network but I want to be clear I

don't only represent unitedly dreams

I represent the little girl who in

seventh grade was told to go back to her

country

I represent the sisters in Congress who

have been shamed who have been attacked

who have been racially profiled who have

been sent death threats time and time

again because they are brave enough to

open their mouths and speak the truth

right and I represent the many

generations in this country who are

committed to fighting for freedom and

making America better

I represent immigrant youth and their

families from all across the country and

the times that we are living in our

absolutely terrified they're terrifying

by design

after the El Paso massacre there were

undocumented immigrants who were too

afraid to get medical attention for fear

of having ice called on them we have

seen and lived and witnessed the cases

of individuals being attacked and

dragged out of hospitals by ice and

Border Patrol agents shut down ours

there were individuals who are too

afraid to go out and find their loved

ones individuals who may have been

attacked just because they don't have

papers and they're considered less than

in this country this is their

heartbreaking reality and we send our

love and support to these families who

are living unbearable seen right now not

only in El Paso but across the country

in cities and rural communities all

across that have been targeted by raids

by attacks and the disappearances of our

community and of our community members

this whole reality is by design our

government has emboldened and empowered

ice and Border Patrol to detain to

deport and to kill you're warned our

government has also emboldened a man who

drove nine hours with a mission to kill

Medina with an immigrant

our government is amplifying

centuries-old white supremacist ideology

they're using language that demonizes

immigrants and people of color and

people are becoming radicalized but the

government is refusing to stop it and

take action who is paying the price our

communities we're paying the price for

the government's inaction to end gun

violence and address deep racial

inequality immigrants black brown

indigenous Jewish Muslim Sikh queer

students and low-income communities

everywhere are suffering the

consequences we cannot allow this to

continue no more thoughts and prayers we

need change plan and every member of

Congress whether Republican or Democrat

must commit to consider legislation that

confronts the epidemic of gun violence

this moment of pain and fear we demand

bold leadership no more status quo we're

about going forward we're about taking

1020 billions of steps forward rather

than returning to any kind of status quo

on any issue whether that is gun

violence prevention or immigration in

this moment of pain and fear we demand

bold leadership in all levels of

government that brings justice for our

communities that find themselves at the

deadly crosshairs of white nationalism

and gun violence immigrant youth of

United We Dream will continue to

unapologetically organize and mobilize

our communities we know that the power

to resist is inside each of us and the

power to win is in our solidarity the

kind of solidarity that used the ear

today right in front of that house

commit ourselves to one another and we

recommit to dream beyond this moment

because we know that the only way that

our communities can live and thrive is

to live unafraid of deportation and

unafraid of gun violence yeah we will

all fight together collectively as a

community with love and determination to

realize that future thank you so much

for those powerful words I think we must

remember that a park on our house is up

on everyone and what we need to make

sure that we're standing firm and strong

and when people tell me that our vote

doesn't matter not only have we passed

gun legislation in Congress not only we

have we passed danke

not only we have we passed TPS but we've

also passed fair wages and it is through

the long hard work of everyone here and

the millions of Americans who know that

when they participate the government is

ours that white house is the people's

house is a people's house Oh our house

November is coming what the Latino there

Babs Berto Powell we developed it

because we recognize that some people

are registered but we have 15 million

Latinos or unregistered we have 12

million young people who are

unregistered and with you when you

download voter power you can register

all of us yeah so don't let it now but I

want to thank in solidarity SEIU has

helped us we've got a balance so much

more because it is a fight that SEIU

took to the streets to the state houses

that now we have a piece of legislation

that Mitch McConnell refuses to pass for

fair wages with that please our

chewiness from SEIU

[Applause]

it's hot out here right but I'm hot and

all of us are hot by what's going on in

this country oh yeah that's we're gonna

take this heat and we're gonna put it

into action yeah on behalf of the

Service Employees International unions

two million members we join in

solidarity I'm humbled and proud to be

with this esteemed group of leaders and

most importantly with all of you yeah

you will change the time that this

country is going down in Gilroy

California and SEIU five to one member

was injured and her six year old son was

killed her mother

a retired SEIU and five to one member

was also injured in El Paso Texas our

members in Texas work at Del Sol Medical

Center in University Medical Center and

are doing everything they can to care

for their community our members in 1199

Ohio throughout the state including

Dayton are suffering with the trauma

that these attacks cause this is more

than just an analytical or philosophical

debate people are in pain and we

shouldn't have to be getting grief

counselors to go with the local union

offices or into communities we should be

about stopping Batman and his hateful

allies from doing the things they're

doing to this country they are fearing

the vision president WebSphere division

are spreading hateful talk and policies

of fuel violence plain and simple that's

where it stops what stops here and it

stops now not one more

[Applause]

my mom once again Senator McConnell

refuses to govern blocking Senate action

even in the midst of this national

crisis the House already took bipartisan

action let's give credit where credit is

due

yeah we have a long way to go but Mitch

McConnell is blocking the legislation

that but that he should be moving he

needs to get out of the way you know I'm

a bitch this is a moment of moral crisis

for this country this legislation is

just the beginning of tackling gun

violence and white supremacist violence

but we need to stand together and demand

the changes necessary if we don't we

will have like a friend's home and be

continuing instances a friend was saying

that they wanted to take their

seven-year-old to get school clothes

this seven-year-old said I'm afraid to

go full shopping can we just order it

online that's the country we want it's

not the country I'll go for my

grandchildren that's not the country we

deserve and that's not the country that

our ancestors fought for let's go into

action no retreat

no backing down enough is enough thank

you

Thank You Valerie the next person I want

to introduce is one of my wonder women

who whenever I call for counsel or

direction or ideas not only did she come

through but she hasn't been an

incredible fighter across the country

for every possible issue you have such

strength Michele but the fact that she

represents teachers that when you have a

parkland killing their solution is to

arm them that's not okay

teachers need to teach they need to make

sure they feel safe and they name each

year that they are perfect or prepare

the next generation of excellence so

Michele we get thank you so much for

joining us sir man thank you thank you

everyone I am Michelle ringette I am

with the American Federation of Teachers

and I am here on behalf of Randi

Weingarten and our 1.7 million members

who are teachers we are guidance

counselors we are the school personnel

your kids go to when they need comfort

but we are also nurses we are health

care professionals and we are also

public servants and all of us from

throughout our union their families in

their communities have had enough of

what's going on thank you we have

bandaged kids we have comforted them in

their terror we have treated families

and tried to comfort them when they've

lost loved ones in our Hospital there is

too much happening we've been shot at

we've tried to protect children and we

have lost too many children too many

family members too many human beings in

this country because of our

unwillingness to address our lacks gun

laws and to recognize the hate that's

fueling it I have a different message

here today because I think we stand with

locked arms with all our sisters and

brothers here I'm from the labor

movement you are all my sisters and

brothers and we'll be aren't now dealing

with the facts that the fish rots at the

head and you know what fish I'm talking

about

right mr. K is trickling down into our

schools to the youngest among us and we

have seen an uptick in bullying we have

seen racism unleashed in our schools we

have seen children chanting build the

wall or send them back and this is a

culture we cannot tolerate and we must

unite and move against right now we need

to fight for our democracy we need to

fight for the values that this country

was founded upon and make them realize

to the extent they never have been for

too many people before

so I say on behalf of aft and everyone

here like we are down to win this yes we

will win this so thank you all for

turning out in this heat and I encourage

all of you to make this a starting point

of renewed commitment so that we own and

move this democracy forward so that

everyone feels that they have a place

within it thank you that we run away I

believe that we will win

I can tell you why cowardly leadership

looks like it is paging innocent

children yeah it is blaming the most

vulnerable through the immigrant

community and it is trying to obfuscate

and try to create real solutions of loud

yawn of rat legislation against guns

when they try to deplane it on the arms

and the shoulders of the mental health

community that is unacceptable that is

cowardly that is weak and that deflects

the real terror in this country which it

is a white supremacy but this every

single person in danger if you think

that it is not again the fact that they

went to the safest kind of sent leave

the city in the nation and massacred

Latinos they were sending a message that

none of us is safe and what during this

time it is important that we talk about

the real issues that this president is

causing he's causing his pain he's

causing us to Pigeon but he's also

causing his incredible unity because we

are speaking truth to power we're

elevating what needs to be addressed and

we're talking and calling out a space of

speed this is not about video games

this is not about mental health this

this is about a government and a

president who is inciting hate to divide

us so that he can basically wreak fear

and we're not gonna let him win

reelection with that and with that I

wanted I want to welcome Jennifer Mathis

the director of policy and legal

advocacy Bazelon Center for mental

health law thank you so much I'm at the

Bible on center for mental health law we

represent people with mental health

disabilities all around the country and

I am here to tell you from a disability

rights perspective that it is time to

move away from the usual efforts to

deflect attention away from the real

issues we face from racism bigotry and

hatred and away from real gun violence

prevention by falsely blaming people

with mental health disabilities for all

gun violence we heard from the president

that it was mental illness that pulled

the trigger not the guns we heard him

talk about mentally ill monsters none of

our minds involuntarily confining people

with mental illness but these shootings

were not about mental illness

hate is not a mental illness

scapegoating and demonizing people with

psychiatric disabilities not only

distracts from serious efforts to

address gun violence and hatred it also

inflict serious harm on people with

mental health disabilities

the relentless repetition of the false

idea that if something someone has done

something so terrible that it's hard to

conceive of that they must be mentally

ill that has become so common that it is

infected our societal and our political

consciousness but it is wrong it is

unfounded less than 5% of gun violence

is committed by people with mental

illness and in fact people with mental

illness are far more likely to be the

victims of violence than to be the

perpetrator

the false association of mental health

disabilities and violence conveys to the

public that they should fear and hate

people with such disabilities that they

should reject them as their neighbors as

their tenants as their friends as their

co-workers and as their employees that

is not the kind of society that we want

to live in no and it does nothing to

address gun violence and nothing to

address hatred and bigotry in fact it

promotes more hatred it is time to stop

reflexively blaming people with mental

health disabilities and address the real

problems we face we can do better thank

you and again I remind folks when people

say my vote doesn't matter not only did

we elect the most diverse Congress in

November and yes I am an open record I'm

very clear what we have to do November

was a dress rehearsal and in less than

six months when we passed back the

comprehensive background checks daca PPS

a fair wage and the parity Act

this is bad America looks like and the

gun violence time tragically killed in

slaughters individuals a pulse nightclub

there were ever made it not only through

the Latino community and do the

transgender community but through every

single American one of the most tragic

pieces of that was a mother and

supporting her son we just come out to

her died in the club alongside him

violence is deadly hate is deadly and we

have no space for it here and thank you

so much joining us today from HRC the

Human Rights Campaign Bendita director

of civic initiatives hello I'm then

Needham from the Human Rights Campaign

and on behalf of the Human Rights

Campaign I president dick Alfonso David

and our three million members and

supporters join our partners demanding

action now on common sense gun reform

yeah the mass shootings and gun violence

we thought this past weekend in Dayton

Ohio in El Paso

have a direct correlation to the hate

and hate speech which see in here every

day from white supremacy night and now

let's not be mistaken Donald Trump races

attacks online Nets votes immigrants

communities of color incite violence his

racist attacks all empower those who

wish to do us harm

while we mourn the lives lost in danger

in El Paso this isn't just about mass

shootings this is about the 40,000

people who lost their lives to gun

violence in 2017 and the 100 people who

died today in the 100 people who would

out tomorrow and the 100 people who died

the day after tomorrow you'll learn

about 100 people who will die every

single day to gun violence if we do not

act now

got lost here

the flip of gun violence we experienced

in America it is not normal and it's

especially destructive to marginalized

communities including people of color

LGBTQ people women persons with

disabilities and religious minority we

think leader Speaker Pelosi in the house

for moving HRT a bipartisan background

check still and we need this White House

Mitch McConnell and the Senate to

address this epidemic of violence with

passing HR 8 and signing it into law

along with other common sense gun reform

for stand aside and let lawmakers in can

we stand with our corporate collision

partners today we are calling for common

sense gun reform we're calling on the

Senate to do their job they're calling

on the President to do his job and if

they do not do their job we will vote

them out if they do not do their jobs

what will we do

[Applause]

and now if I'd rather have this dried by

rabbi Moline he is a rabbi that will

lead us into a moment of silence because

sometimes we need a little bit of sip

resetting thank you so much for being

with us I know that you've been jumping

around but more importantly this moment

to give us peace but also in solidarity

for those individuals I've been killed

because of mass shootings and in

particular to the El Paso massacre

victims thank you I am happy to be here

with you even in a suit we want to take

a moment of silence now and I'm gonna

ask you to focus on something very

specific

doesn't matter if you have a particular

faith or you don't profess a faith if

you have a particular philosophy or your

finding your way I don't want you to

think about numbers I don't want you to

think about cities I don't want you to

think about communities I want you

[Music]

[Applause]

[Applause]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

from our safety net programs like

Medicare for all to ensure that all of

us have affordable health care you page

a year defeating all of the GOP attempts

to repeal the essential protections in

the Affordable Care and we are still

suffering under some skyrocketing

particular innovations to build our

version of America where everyone can

cry we need to embrace our values of F

de niro's back to and ensure that no one

is above the law to an opiate consistent

of our shared vision

[Music]

[Laughter]

no I know what I think I'll probably do

and threats of mass ice rates and when

he hires a white supremacist like

Stephen Miller in his administration the

groundwork for violence

guns inflates hateful violence all over

our country and both parties have failed

to curb gun violence both parties have

been in power over the last twenty years

after mass shootings from Columbine to

Virginia Tech to Sandy Hook - pulse

nightclub to El Paso too deep and yet

Congress has failed to enact

common-sense reforms like mandatory

background checks and banning assault

rifles enough is enough when he attacks

on immigrants enough with gun violence

enough with white supremacy in the halls

of power enough with a Senate that

refuses to act and a White House that

fans the flames of hate and violence

together we can reject a disarmed hate

and now I've got six ways you can do

this

all of em are listed at moveon.org slash

enough again that's moveon.org and slash

suggestive questions to ask show

solidarity with the Latino community

they are reeling after this attack and

it is on all of us to stand with them

don't find a list of local organizations

that move on.org splash enough they need

volunteers to accompany people to ice

check-ins to urge Congress to defund it

from deportation machine to donate to

things like United redream stock of

renewal funds there's a place for

everyone in this movement and lastly
