hello good afternoon so my name is

corporal Julie Kragh Shane I'm the media

relations officer here for the Manitoba

RCMP so I'm gonna read a statement in

English followed by the French and then

I'll take some questions so as a search

for can McLeod and Breyers Miguel ski

continues we are able to provide the

following update officers have conducted

and continued to search high probability

areas of interest in gilliam in the

gilliam area investigators continue to

follow up on tips review the physical

and digital evidence collected and share

information with police forces across

Canada over the next 72 hours

investigators will conduct door-to-door

canvasses in the town of Gilliam and Fox

Lake Cree Nation in hopes of generating

new tips and information residents in

these areas can be assured that we are

activating all necessary resources to

protect the public and officer safety

our investigators are also exploring the

possibility that the suspects may have

inadvertently received assistance in

leaving the area to restate there have

been no confirmed sightings outside of

the Gilliam area however we remain open

to the possibility ken MacLeod and Brian

briars schmegle ski may have changed

their appearance it is possible that

someone may not have been aware of who

they were providing assistance to and

may now be hesitant to come forward I

want to reiterate the importance of

contacting police immediately it is

critical that all Canadians remain

vigilant for cam McLeod and briers

Miguel ski if they are spotted do not

approach call 911 or your local police

immediately I also want to stress the

importance of not creating and sharing

online

the spreading of false information in

communities across Manitoba has created

fear and panic be assured that this is

our bet that is it is in our best

interest to share confirmed facts as

soon as possible both in advancing our

investigation and with respect to public

safety

public alright so I can take some

questions however the changes in weather

impacted the way you guys are searching

I think obviously we're going to take

all that into consideration and we have

a lot of resources up there and the

teams that are up there are obviously

you know doing things depending on on

what can be done what could the

significant weather changes like we've

seen up there like almost 15 degrees

what could that mean for the suspects

could have mean anything I can't really

speculate on that I mean we're up there

and we're searching and were you know

conducting everything in regards to say

the investigation how was all this

stretching for these resources

we do have lots of resources not just

from Manitoba

but outside from other provinces so I

mean obviously it's tough terrain up

there I mean our officers are searching

in you know kilometers into dense

forests muskeg and all that so so it is

tough could we could I ask the same

question but in French please the the

the same question about the conditions

over there oui

littering is difícil no policia guava

no silva paseo pain pain the kilometer

father it'll be a Nordic dance met you

see free AV daily bottom are a bar Donny

sorry for the delay

no not as far as I know what our plea

today is that if anyone in and around

those communities may have inadvertently

helped them get out of the community and

we're just saying if someone did - just

please come forward I mean they may have

different appearances maybe these people

didn't realize that they were helping

them so we're just asking them to come

forward so they could be long gone

in theory we don't really know but how

are you sure this

that's why we're here right our last

confirmed sighting is in gilliam area so

that's where our resources are now but

we are still exploring all possibilities

of that yeah yes we are we have received

I think four tips over 120 tips in the

last few days so still and we're going

through all those as well

I just noticed identified very few of

them are credible like how does that

hard

well I think our investigative team is

going through them and as soon as we can

confirm that one of them are is accurate

or something that we need to tell you we

are gonna going to tell you because it's

in our best interest we need the

public's help so in regards to the

folder that was circulating today yes we

have we have we have spoken to them it

does appear to be an instance where a

photo was taken and then ended up being

unintentionally circulated on social

media but we have confirmed that that is

not the suspect if you find this

and user like this in the middle of the

night or set up some other sort of

communication or is it something you're

gonna keep close to the chest for hours

and let us know I think it all depends

on the circumstances in the situation

and how things unfold so I can't say

exactly what that might look like how

much time do you think someone can

survive in that those conditions if we

don't know if they're they have water

food but is there like a time line you

say well in a week it would be really

really hard for them in two weeks it

would be impossible do you have an idea

about that I don't think I'm gonna

speculate on that because there could be

a lot of things that play however like I

said we're in there we're in that

community and we're we're searching from

different provinces probably training in

different environments like I think so

we have a long officers from here as

well as outside of Manitoba and I think

we all want the same thing we want to

find these suspects so we are working

hard to try and do that as quick as we

can

the misinformation

so in regards to to rumors and things

spreading that that we have seen over

social media we want people to maybe be

aware where are you getting your

information if you have some information

send it to us so we can confirm it right

don't start spreading things that aren't

verified you know we are going to

confirm details as much as we can

throughout the investigation so let us

be the trusted source where you get that

information and if for the people out

there that are seeing things are or

what-have-you

send it to us call us and we can verify

all that

I think we've seen some misinformation

and some stuff come in I mean obviously

with this photo of the suspect

like they look similar right so and we

want people to call us call us and say

hey this is out there and at least we're

on it and we can determine the validity

of that

and

how many else are we talking about here

and it's going to involve certain

garages sheds

I don't have numbers on the houses

obviously they're smaller communities

however yeah we're gonna you know go

door-to-door try and generate some you

know tips possibly possibly someone

maybe there's something that seemed

insignificant to them and maybe it's

something that will really help us in

our investigation so that's why we're

doing it and what we're trying to

achieve and we will be you know in the

areas doing that so we want the the

people in those communities to know that

yes so we have been all around those

areas and searching some of those

abandoned and vacant out buildings that

do belong to hydro

any thought given to bringing in the

military from state 1717 you in Chicago

so right now I'm not going to talk to

specific numbers of officers and the

reason is just for the safety of our

officers and like tactics and stuff like

that

there but there are a number of

resources and we're always looking at

what else we can do what about the

military question is that something that

has been entertained I think you know

what right now we'll have to see where

we go I don't have all the information

on exactly the plan from here

I think like I said before our last

confirmed sighting was July 22nd in the

gilliam area but obviously like as I'm

here today to say hey did anyone maybe

inadvertently assist them could be the

same thing right we're not we're

exploring all possibilities and keeping

that open and reminding all Canadians to

be vigilant

fear of going around is there besides

we're just waiting for an update is

there a way for people to contact the

RCP just to kind of get some information

use anyone Spears

so I don't I don't understand the

question can you just wait

yeah I think will confer like we're

getting a lot of people contacting us

and so once we have something that we

can confirm we will let you know

so in regards to the weekend and press

conferences I think it will depend on

what is what happens within the

investigation and if there is something

that we can update you with

I was going to desertion I clearly

so that the Clear Lake incident is not

really like it's been unfounded so it's

it's nothing to do with with our

suspects so thank you very much and as

soon as we have more information we will

be back to share that with you
