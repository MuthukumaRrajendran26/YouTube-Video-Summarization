we are joined by one of the key people

leading that team Raptors assistant

coach and director of sports science

alex McKechnie he has a Larry Orion NBA

championship trophy with us and he is

joining us in studio thank you so much

for being here today good morning and

thank you for having me how does it feel

okay I just have to say we've had a

steady stream of people coming in from

our newsroom trying to take photos with

the trophy how does it feel for you to

be looking at this today knowing that

you were part of this accomplishments I

think it's really it's really special

for me to bring it back to Vancouver

knowing that it's never been here before

and that winning it winning it and

winning it in Canada was just amazing

for the Canadian team is it fabulous the

moment was really truly it was kind of

overwhelming it really was it was it was

special very very special and you had

such a pivotal role with the team in

helping Kawhi Leonard with his injury

over the last season what was that

relationship like with him that you

built well it was pretty special guy I

mean he's an incredible athlete

everything he does was with you know

with perfection you know we met in a

daily basis and worked out a process of

protocols what are we doing so the

relationship was built and built you

know over a period of time not just with

me both all of my stuff I mean I have I

have six people on my staff they're

exceptional at their work and we would

collectively you know group together and

discuss how we approach this on a daily

basis so yeah he's pretty special we

build that trust within it Ness that's

how it works

and you've worked with you know the top

of the top athletes Paul Kariya

Shaquille O'Neal are these people that

you still keep in touch with that you

built relations very much so yeah yeah

in fact just with doing that during the

course of the playoffs I had dinner with

Shaq in Toronto and we had a wonderful

night just myself and him and one of the

ends in his trusted partner Jerome who

was his bodyguard for many many years

the three of us have dinner it's

terrific relationship Paul I keep in

touch with constantly yeah in fact he

texts me the night we won you know again

a wonderful young man terrific and he

was actually one of the real pivotal

springboards of this whole might jump

into the NBA quite frankly yeah I mean

you've had quite the career as a

physiotherapist did you ever think that

it would bring you to

this moment no I don't think anybody

ever does I mean I started my career

right here in Burnaby that Simon Fraser

moved to Hastings Street then from

Hastings Street again further up

Hastings Street and to Gilmore and then

from there don't eight rinks and then

from there to Los Angeles then Ellie to

Toronto it's been an incredible right it

really has but you know like I said I

cut my teeth right here in Burnaby so

especially for me to come back to

Burnaby well we are so happy that you

are here and that you chose to celebrate

with us today and I think it's so

important for founds of the Raptors or

really any team to see that there is yes

the team that's on the court or on the

ice but there's an entire team of people

behind the scenes what do you want

people to know about all that effort

that goes on I think people only see it

when the lights come on you know that's

the real thing is it's it's glamorous

etc but the bottom line is they don't

see it two o'clock in the morning when

we were arriving back from the road trip

you know and and where does snow in

Toronto and it's pretty cold and there's

equipment guys dragging luggage off of

planes and it's an incredible amount of

work that goes into so many different

people you know from our own staff

standpoint once the season starts there

are no days off you know we work 24/7 we

rotate our days off through the staff

but the fact is there's always somebody

injured there's always somebody needing

work there's always we're always doing

extra work with different people there's

so many people involved you know that

really that worked together to put the

team on the floor people don't realize

that like I say they only see it when

the lights come on yeah because it's

more than just being a physiotherapist

in your situation you're also building a

level of trust and you know giving

emotional support to those team members

is what we do I mean we have in my staff

I have you know I have a mind of physio

Scott sir head trainer

Sheila's trainer we have massage

Johnnie's leaders of strength core is a

massage therapist plus we have ancillary

staff

nutritionists sports psychologists we

all work together we work as a group and

you know so coming out of our meetings

it's one message it's a collective voice

but one message constantly and that's

important to sustain that that

continuous message that we have that's

really what what makes it work for us I

think it's really identifying we take

each player we try to identify their

their individual breakdown their

individual potential you know pitfalls

and then build a

programs out from that it's it's yeah

and we and I must say but let me say

I've total autonomy

you know from Messiah gives me total

autonomy to do this under coach Nick

nurse we collectively work together so

we know we have a system and we'll come

out with with a plan mm-hmm and you'll

support us yes and that's what it takes

really you know leadership standpoint

now I have to ask you you know we were

all hoping crossing our fingers that

Kawhi Leonard was gonna stay on this

side of the border what was your

reaction when you found out that he was

going to the Clippers I think it office

Lee there's some disappointment but this

damn baby we just move on you know it's

we're pretty good team we were pretty

good team even you know when he didn't

play so of course yes a great team how

are you feeling heading into the next

season we feel very confident you know

we've got terrific players you get

leadership with Kyle Lowry with Marc

Gasol we have we have Pascal siakam is

emerging talent isn't Talent yeah we're

very confident well I hope to see this

trophy back here next year I'd like to

be but thank you so much thank you very

much for having me
