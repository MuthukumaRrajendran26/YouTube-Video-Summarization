what happened yesterday shocked

Mississippi and the entire country and

the world we've been getting calls from

press from from other countries now the

raid yesterday is not fixing America's

broken immigration system what it is

doing is tearing apart a long time

Mississippi residents and their families

this is yet again a family separation

event we in Mississippi say to mr. Trump

no we are not for your anti-immigration

mass deportation agenda hundreds of

families separated and just so that the

public knows there are those attorneys

there are churches there are individuals

and there are other families that are

working together to try to help those

affected by yesterday's raid and as we

were Justin - to do we will be here not

just today but in the weeks and years to

come as we help to rebuild families and

rebuild a little bit of what was lost

yesterday for our state and humanity but

I want to say this to all of you we're

here for a purpose this is 2019 not 1919

100 years ago when women was fighting

for suffrage

this is 100 years later and we are here

because we tolerate too much of this we

just let it be yes I would senior

citizen this morning I reminded them all

of them that that was a time we went in

stores and drive drive goods and

clothing and they wouldn't let us try

them on and then wouldn't fit they

wouldn't others bring us back but we

tolerated it too long I almost want to

say is that great but Roberto Duran said

but no - no more will we tolerate this

and we are here today to thank you for

standing with us in this quest majesta

knowing full well that justin will

prevail but for those young children

what evidence solution is this terrible

because God's going to continue these

rage should be appalling and

reprehensible

nobody's safer in Mississippi nobody's

better off what happened with these

rates devastated hard-working families

that are trying to do their best and now

we have 680 families with no income and

no way to get income and there's their

stranded with nothing what are their

children going to eat what recourse do

they have for anything better the United

States of America and the state of

Mississippi has perpetrated a great

injustice and for this immoral and

inhumane behavior I pray for our soul

leave these people alone help them

instead of hurt them treat them the way

that you would want to be treated if you

were a foreigner in a strange land
