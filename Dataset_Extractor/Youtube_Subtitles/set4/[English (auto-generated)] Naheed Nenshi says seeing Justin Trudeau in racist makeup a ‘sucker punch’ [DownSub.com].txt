when I saw that picture last night

certainly it was a sucker punch I think

for me and for a lot of people for

minority communities it really makes you

start to think when is this ever going

to end you work so hard you go to school

you know you have to be just a little

bit better than the next person because

you have to prove just a little bit more

you succeed you go on in your career

maybe even become the mayor and then

you're reminded in the worst possible

way that people you respect people you

admire people who are allies in the

battle with you still need a little bit

of education and to me what is deeply

troubling here is not the hot takes on

the election and the politics like this

will have I think very little impact

people have made up their minds on

issues like this and from a very base

political level what bothers me is that

we have not made the space in this

country to have a real conversation

about what is happening in terms of our

diverse pluralistic ideal in this nation

so yeah I happen to think the Prime

Minister and I are the same age so I

happen to think that when I was 29 in

2001 in a world that was Awakening and

its racial consciousness in a work world

where Islamophobia was on the rise even

before the events later that year then I

probably would have stopped and thought

well this is not an appropriate thing to

do

do I think that the Prime Minister was

acknowledging or actively being a racist

do I think that he looked at himself in

the mirror on the way to the party and

said wow this is super racist and I'm

gonna do it anyway of course not

of course not but I think we have to ask

ourselves why enough people in 2001

thought that was okay
