good evening day six of one of Canada's

most intense manhunt the search for two

suspected killers for the last six days

the focus of effort has been in this

community Gilliam but all that changed

earlier this evening when police got a

tip in the community of York Landing

that's a remote community of more than

200 kilometres from here it's an island

community and it all came about as a

result of a tip the people who made the

tip from a group called the bear clan

that's a group of indigenous volunteers

who've been up in northern Manitoba

supporting the efforts through this

search james fable of the bear clan says

it was one of his members who spotted

the suspects they saw two guys near the

dump and at first it didn't strike him

as odd because they thought it was

associated with the work going on at

this water treatment plant when they

noticed the truck that was associated

with those activities wasn't present

then they kind of went oh this might be

something else and so they were careful

to you know get an idea of a description

of the gentleman that they saw their

exact location and the direction of

travel after that and it seems to have

helped this search throughout the

evening there had been wild speculation

about what was going on at York Landing

speculation on social media that shots

have been fired that the men had been

captured but all of that being cleared

up this evening by Manitoba RCMP who say

that no one is in custody that they are

still on the island still looking for

suspects that nothing so far has changed
