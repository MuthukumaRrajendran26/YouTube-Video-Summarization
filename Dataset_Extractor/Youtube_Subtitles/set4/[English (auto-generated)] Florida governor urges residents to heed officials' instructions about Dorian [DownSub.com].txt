well we're concerned about local folks

particularly Palm Beach County and North

up the up the east coast of Florida

heating the instructions of their local

officials on evacuations this is a storm

right now that's clocking in at a

hundred and eighty five miles an hour

it's absolutely obliterating the Bahamas

to put that in perspective Hurricane

Andrew which was probably the most

significant storm most of us remember in

Florida was 165 mile an hour so this is

a monster storm the track is that it's

bringing it close to Florida then

perhaps turning north before it gets to

the coast however it is slowing down but

not slowing down quite as much as

anticipated and so we've got to prepare

that this is a storm that could directly

impact Florida and not just be a storm

that's riding off the coast on these

forecasts you're talking about a little

wobble here a little wobble there can

make the difference between 30 40 miles

well from where that forecast is right

now you go 40 miles west all of a sudden

you're taking that over a lot of our

coastal communities so people need to be

vigilant and they need to take

preparations and listen to the

instructions that are being handed down

we want people to be listening their

local officials and heeding the calls to

evacuate and listening to the

instructions and preparing themselves

you know this storm it's been it's been

frustrating as it's been uncertain we

had a track change that took it off

Florida's coast 24 hours ago the problem

with that and although we hope it

continues in that direction is a wobble

here there could impact Florida greatly

and I just don't want people to think

that somehow because most of the cone

has it being in the Atlantic that

somehow they're not at risk this is a

category 5 185 mile an hour wind

hurricane and to put that in perspective

that's 20 miles an hour more than

Hurricane Andrew was in 1992 so this is

a massive storm is absolutely

obliterating the Bahamas and so I'm

hoping for the best in terms of the

track but at the state level and I think

people in Florida they need to prepare

for this to impact floor

and and be prepared taking listen to

instructions and do what you need to do

to protect yourself and your family well

I think the biggest challenge was the

whole state was in the zone the cone

three or four days ago and so in terms

of preparations obviously we were

telling everyone to remain vigilant now

that we know the the threat is probably

more focused on the East Coast you know

we're in a position to assist with the

evacuations we've suspended tolls on all

the roads who would be used for folks on

the east coast of Florida we'll be

expanding the lanes if need be to the

shoulder although right now we don't

necessarily see any abnormal traffic and

then we have assets pre-positioned

around the state that we'll use to

assist people once the storm passes and

one of our priorities obviously is going

to be rescuing anybody who's in peril

but then also trying to make sure we can

get power reestablish there's gonna be

people that lose power in this I mean

that's just the reality but there's a

lot of assets that have been

pre-positioned and so we're working with

the utilities on that so I think the

challenge is just it's a big long state

we don't know exactly the track of the

storm and so we've done our best to to

be versatile and be able to respond to

those needs as they arise I evacuated I

think both of them I was on the coast

there in Northeast Florida and so you

know and we personally suffered some

damage in both of those and I think that

you know one of the problems was the

people that suffered damage in Matthew a

lot of those same folks got whacked

again in irma the next year so here we

are two years later than Irma and you

have another really serious storm

bearing down and I think Matthew is

instructive in the sense that it did

stay just off the coast it hugged the

coastline but still did a lot of damage

and so these things when they're this

strong even if the eye wall doesn't get

over land that can still have life

threatening storm surge you can see

major flooding particularly in places

like Northeast Florida and obviously you

can see a lot of wind damage as well so

all of that is in the in the realm of

possibility

and if we watch we're gonna obviously

watch the storm if we see see a turn in

a positive direction will obviously be

very very thankful for that that is not

something that we can assume at this

point
