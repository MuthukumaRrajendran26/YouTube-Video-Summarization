Canadians will be keeping a close eye on

how parties plan to spend tax dollars we

know members of parliament are given

expense allowances to cover housing food

and travel costs but what about their

families Global News has crunched the

numbers for the last four years looking

at the costs of designated travelers and

it turns out it's costing millions our

Abigail Beeman has been breaking down

the data what does it work out to have a

Gayle Robin the bill to shuttle MPs

spouses and partners across the country

for the past four years cost four point

five million of your tax dollars and

that doesn't include their children's

travel either these five MPs are the

biggest spenders of your tax dollars for

their spouses for our Conservatives from

Western Canada

Todd Doherty tops the list based in

northern British Columbia he claimed a

hundred and forty two thousand dollars

over four years for his wife Kelly to

join him in Ottawa Prince George Halifax

Charlottetown and elsewhere his office

ignored our requests for comment in

third place the only non conservative

former Liberal cabinet minister Jody

Wilson Raybould now running as an

independent since 2015 she billed

taxpayers 126 thousand dollars to fly

her husband Tim between Ottawa and her

Vancouver riding 138 times if you add up

all spousal travel for the 35 member

cabinet over four years wilson Raybould

alone accounts for more than a fifth of

spending in a statement she tells global

news my husband and I have worked hard

to maintain a semblance of work/life

balance that includes being able to be

together in the same city as much as

possible his support has been

particularly important to me during the

events of the past eight months and I am

grateful that Tim's schedule has allowed

him the flexibility to travel to Ottawa

the best disinfectant is sunlight so the

more we publish this information if

someone is an outlier like in this case

miss Wilson Raybould that allows the

media that allows the public to see that

there might be a problem and gives

people an attempt to correct it after

Wilson Raybould the top three cabinet

spenders were Veterans Affairs Minister

Lawrence McCauley procurement Minister

Carla cuatro and Indigenous Services

Minister Seamus O'Regan all three sent a

statement saying

they followed the rules Walter's office

noted two of her children were just two

and five when she was elected and she

spends at least half the year away from

her BC home but while Oregon's riding is

in Newfoundland for part of the mandate

his husband worked as general manager at

a popular Ottawa restaurant steps from

Parliament Hill important to note

everyone is playing by the rules

each MP gets a number of travel points

for the year they can choose to share

them with their designated traveller

another perk MP's get to ride Via Rail

for free and if their spouses and

children booked within one day of their

travel they too can ride for free even

if the MP isn't with them and nine

cabinet ministers claimed no designated

traveler expenses whatsoever including

Foreign Affairs Minister Krista Freeland

and Transport Minister Marc Garneau
