you are looking at the cover of they

call us enemy it is a graphic memoir by

George Takei detailing his haunting

childhood and internment camps in the US

and we are so happy to have George Takei

joining us in studio today so great to

have you back good to be here with you

fantastic and I've been flipping through

your graphic memoir here the images in

here are harrowing take us through the

reason why you wanted to put this out

and why you want people to pick up this

book and read it well I chose the

graphic memoir essentially a comic strip

because I grew up on comic books and I

remember the information that I got then

were absorb into my body and I grew up

with it and stayed with me for the rest

of my life the internment of innocent

American citizens of Japanese ancestry

during the Second World War and it

happened in here in Canada as well

Canadians of Japanese ancestry were put

into internment and I think that that

chapter of our histories are vitally

important for an understanding of the

vulnerability of our democracy my father

told us it's a people's democracy and a

people's democracy is existentially

dependent on people who cherish the

ideals of that democracy and actively

participate in the process and when it

doesn't

people are also fallible human beings

and people make mistakes and in when

Pearl Harbor was bombed war hysteria and

racism swept across the country your

country and mine and people who looked

like the people that bombed Pearl Harbor

was seen as the enemy and with no due

process which is a central pillar of our

justice system we were put into these

barbed wire prison camps my parents

lost everything his business their life

savings the bank account was taken away

our home was taken away their freedom

and their dignity was taken and put into

barbed wire prison camps this is an

important story and yet to this to this

day I talked to people who I consider

well-informed people and I tell him

about my childhood imprisonment and

they're shocked that something like this

actually happened so I call this my book

of hope for the future of America

targeting the young reader the preteens

of teens and the young adults and it

when they absorb in this information and

grow up with it they're gonna be the

voters of tomorrow they're gonna be the

movers and shakers and hopefully they

will define a better America than what

we have today going on on the southern

border of the United States and that's

what I wanted to ask you about I mean

this happened 70 years ago but there are

situations like this still happening in

the US so what parallels do you draw

from your situation and what's happening

with detention facilities right now in

the US we were imprisoned with the

statement that we are all potential

spies saboteurs v colonists with no

evidence with no facts no trial and in

prison what we hear now are these people

who are the Latino is coming to our

southern the United States southern

border people coming from dysfunctional

governments taraf chaotic governments

they've seen violence incredible

violence some women have seen their

husbands killed right in front of them

and and and an abject poverty they grab

their children and flee to the to the

United States asylum is a human right it

is not illegal

that orangutan in the US in the White

House claims it is not illegal and yet

they're being they're all being

characterized as spies or the Latinos

now are being characterized as drug

dealers murderers v and and what's the

third criminal several criminals and

rapists which is not true and yet

they're brutalized in a way that we have

not been their children are torn away

from them and put in filthy disgusting

cages with human waste and and crowded

which what should hold a dozen people

are holding like 60 people is difficult

to think about it really four people and

I know that that's why you've put your

book of hope as you said together

detailing some of your most personal

accounts of you know what happened

you were only five years old at the time

how much do you remember of that day

when the soldiers first came to your

door that memory is still vivid in my

mind my parents got here got us up very

early one morning to I I was five my

brother was for my baby sister was an

infant they dressed us hurriedly and my

brother and I were told to wait in the

living room while our parents did some

last minute packing back in the bedroom

and so the two of us were just gazing

out the front window when suddenly we

saw two soldiers marching up our

driveway carrying rifles with shiny

bayonets on them I remember the

California Sun just shining off those

bayonets they stopped at the front porch

with their fists began pounding on the

front door that sound is still very real

in my brain I thought the whole house

tremble

my father came out of the bedroom and

answered the door and literally at

gunpoint we were ordered out of our home

my father gave my brother in Maine in

little packages to carry and he hefted

to heavy suitcases and we followed him

out and stood on the driveway waiting

for our mother to come out and when she

came out she had by our baby sister in

one arm a heavy duffel bag in the other

and tears were streaming down both her

cheeks it was a terrifying morning and

that was just the beginning and then you

spent years from moving from Camp to

camp basically before eventually being

freed after the war I imagine this is

obviously had a huge impact on who you

are as a person memories like that don't

go away and I guess that's the reason

why you wanted to put it down on paper

and share it with everyone else that

internment defined Who I am

and made me the activist that I am today

had it not been for that I don't know

what kind of person I would have been

but certainly not Who I am today and you

know you at home could have a chance to

meet George he is here tomorrow night at

the Indigo on Robson Street at 7:00 p.m.

for a book signing and I know that

you're really looking forward to meet

some of the people who are going to be

reading your book I spent five months

here in Vancouver and I made a lot of

friends and I hope you all come

fantastic George thank you so much so

great to see you again

thank you very much
