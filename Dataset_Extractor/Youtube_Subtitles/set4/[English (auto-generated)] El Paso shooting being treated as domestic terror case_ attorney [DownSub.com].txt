thank you my name is John Bosch I'm the

United States Attorney for the Western

District of Texas which covers El Paso

my grandmother has lived here for 50

years she's 91 since it was a much

smaller community I don't think she's

ever seen anything like this in this

community my mom grew up here my dad

went to college here I looked here I was

very young it's been devastating for the

community

I've been unbelievably impressed by our

first responders by the DA's office fire

police FBI in the work they've conducted

we had a very long night last night

work in this case I've been in close

consultation with attorney general barb

we are conducting a methodical

investigation with our partners a

careful investigation but with a view

towards bringing federal hate crimes

charges under 18 USC 249 and federal

firearms charges which carry a penalty

of death we are seriously considering

those charges we're going to conduct a

methodical and careful investigation

with a few towards those charges

we are also treating this as a domestic

terrorist case there's a statutory

definition of domestic terrorism at 18

USC 2 3 3 1 this meets it it appears to

be designed to intimidate a civilian

population to say the least we are

treating it as a domestic terrorism case

and we're going to do what we do to

terrorists in this country which is

deliver Swift and certain justice
