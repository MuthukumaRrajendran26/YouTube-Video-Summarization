good morning everyone

on Sunday morning Fran I joined mayor

nan Whaley her husband Sam lieutenant

Matt Dickey the dayton police department

to tour the Oregon district before the

shooting took place it's the morning

that I will never forget crime scene

tape bullet markings blood and probably

the most poignant thing was a vendors

cart with food still on it where he had

been shot down nine people went out on

that beautiful Saturday evening early

Sunday morning nine people who did not

come home they left their families they

left their friends grieving a loss that

is really impossible to comprehend

that night Sunday night friend I went

back to the Oregon district in Dayton to

attend a prayer vigil it was a beautiful

peaceful night justice it had been the

night before the great Ohio summer night

as friend I climbed up to the platform

and we looked out it was amazing the

number of people who were there as far

as we could see there were people

literally down the street a testament to

the resiliency of Dayton and the great

Miami Valley

some of the crowd were angry in fact I'm

sure everybody was angry because I tell

you Fran and I were angry then we are

angry and they should be mangry I

understand that anger for it's

impossible to make sense out of what is

senseless

some chanted do something and they were

absolutely right we must do something

and that is exactly what we are going to

do today I'm announcing the following

initiatives the following actions number

one safety protection orders we have to

empower people to get help for family or

loved ones who may be a danger to

themselves or a danger to others people

who have mental health challenges

alcohol or drug problems that violent

tendencies and and have access to

firearms deadly combination

police and sheriff's deputies also need

to be able to activate the criminal

justice system when they find an

individual in that situation when they

find someone who is in danger who is a

danger to themselves or who is a danger

to others and has access to a gun that's

why today I'm asking the legislature to

pass a law to allow courts to issue

safety protection orders now I'm gonna

explain this in detail because details

are important these orders which would

be grand upon clear and convincing

evidence would allow the removal of

firearms from potentially dangerous

individuals and get them the mental

health treatment that they need

get them whatever help that they need

individuals could be subject to a safety

protection order if they present an

imminent risk of injury to themselves

suicide for example or they present that

risk to another person because of mental

health issues because of drug dependency

chronic alcoholism or other serious

conditions these concerns of course must

our Constitution demands it be balanced

against the individuals right to keep

and bear arms and their due process

rights my proposal will allow the state

of Ohio to file for temporary orders a

hearing it under my proposal this

ultimately will be up to the General

Assembly a hearing would under this

proposal be held within three days of

the filing or sooner the individual

would have all the traditional due

process rights the temporary order could

be granted a temporary order could be

granted if the state shows by probable

cause that person is a danger to

themselves or others and has access to

firearms if the temporary order is

granted it would require the person to

surrender all firearms to law

enforcement if granted a hearing would

then be held a second hearing within 14

days do you term if an extended safety

protection order should be granted in

this hearing all the same traditional

due process rights would apply if the

court was then find by clear and

convincing evidence that the person is a

danger to themselves or to others the

extended order would be issued under an

extended safety protection order as we

envision it the court would order a

mental health assessment the individual

would be required to undergo any

recommended treatment the individual

were him

purchasing or possessing firearms in any

firearm from the temporary order would

continue to be withheld from that

individual in lieu in law enforcement in

lieu of law enforcement keeping the

firearms and individual could could have

them sold on their behalf to a federally

licensed firearm dealer extended orders

would last for a period of six months

and could be extended with another

petition in another unit an individual

could apply to the court any time after

three months for return of his firearms

only if the person could prove by clear

and convincing evidence that they were

no longer a danger to themselves or

others as during that period of time

initiative number two we must have

increased access to the citizens of the

state of Ohio for the citizens of the

state of Ohio to our state psychiatric

hospital we have a problem in this state

we have a problem with people who are

not violent who have been sent there by

a court who could be sent someplace else

and these individuals are occupying

space that we urgently need today now

I'm calling on the General Assembly to

take action in this area inpatient

psychiatric care is limited in Ohio

making it difficult for individuals and

families to access the level of care

when it is needed

over the past several years Ohio's state

psychiatric hospital capacity has become

predominantly used by patients who are

court-ordered to the hospital for

restoration to competency to stand trial

this week for example 79 percent of the

adults in our state psychiatric

hospitals are court-ordered there many

of these patients are nonviolent

offenders

many are misdemeanors but they are

they're simply in the hospital pursuant

to a court order to learn how the court

process works it's the only reason to

they are surely together we can find

another place for these individuals to

obtain that help and that help being

understanding how the court system works

so they can proceed with trial this

education certainly can be done outside

of these hospitals freeing up critical

beds for people who in fact do need

hospitalization

the people I'm talking about coming out

of the hospital or people who don't need

impatient psyched you're at your care

well there are other people in Ohio who

clearly do to accomplish this the

General Assembly will need to pass

changes to the Revised Code to create a

community-based misdemeanour competency

restoration process I'm calling on the

legislature today to do that actually

number three

early intervention schools

we have a serious mental health crisis

among many of our children in the state

of Ohio today it is growing worse so

many of our children have been

negatively impacted by trauma the trauma

can take many forms can be living an

addicted parent it can be seeing

violence on the streets seen violence in

the home it can be all the problems that

come from Horrible poverty the result is

that the suicide rate among our young

people today breaks your heart

it just breaks your heart all the facts

of the Dayton tragedy are not yet known

and they will be coming out in the days

and weeks ahead but it is clear that the

assailant while in high school

clearly exhibited antisocial behaviors

antisocial behaviors that should have

alerted anyone who knew about them that

there was a problem a serious problem

with this high school student

and told by the specialists that half of

mental health conditions problems start

by the age of 14 half and 75% are

identified by age 24 providing early

intervention helps young people recover

more quickly and have better outcomes

with their education it helps them build

positive relationships with family and

friends and it helps them have healthier

lives throughout adulthood as part of

the budget that has been approved by the

General Assembly and I know Senate

President Lee Ralph HOF was was here I

was told a moment ago Thank You senator

for joining us appreciate it very much I

talked to the speaker yesterday as well

and the two minority leaders about what

I was going to present I want to thank

the General Assembly under this budget

we are investing 675 million dollars for

what we are calling wraparound services

these clearly can be used and it's our

intent for many of them much of them to

be used for mental health services for

children these are for addressing social

emotional challenges their kids are

facing from suicide prevention to the

effects of substance use crisis and all

these things all these things teachers

tell me impact their ability to teach

the child in the classroom by providing

funds to every school district these

schools can design tailored programs

working with their local mental health

providers or other social service

agencies to help these kids earlier in

life the earlier that we can intervene

in children's lives and make a positive

difference clearly the better it is

action item number four

we're also increasing access under this

budget now again I thank the General

Assembly to behavioral health

professionals in our schools with 15

million dollars in Medicaid funding to

provide telehealth and mental health

services to students so that no matter

where a child lives in the state of Ohio

no matter how remote it is they have

access to high-quality mental health

care this coupled with the wraparound

services will make a huge huge

difference let me move to action item

number five communities know their kids

the best the Ohio Department mental

health and addiction services will will

be working in a more concentrated effort

will be working with communities to

increase knowledge of risk factors to

help parents identify when their child

is showing signs of a mental illness the

Ohio Department of Mental Health and

Addiction Services will also share

screen tools with clinicians help

connect to community-based services and

link parents families and schools with

proven supports and strategies to manage

wellness over the child's lifetime item

number six background checks I'm asking

the General Assembly to pass a law that

requires background checks for all

firearm sales in the state of Ohio with

the exception for guess between family

members and certain other and limited

uses

number seven an unbelievably high number

of Ohio citizens are being killed as a

result of chronic gun violence in the

streets and in neighborhoods of our

cities mayor thank you for being here

for most Americans there who talked

about last night why we mourn those who

were killed in Dayton we should not

forget the other Ohio citizens our

citizens are brothers and sisters that

includes many times children who are

innocent victims of random violence and

not so random violence we cannot forget

those individuals who are dying every

day in our cities and across our state

you have to deal with those individuals

who are inflicting that violence law

enforcement officers have told me for

years that the majority of violence in a

community is being perpetuated by a

relatively small number of individuals

we just study a few years ago which

absolutely confirmed that going back to

1977 the vast majority of criminals in

this state are not do not commit violent

crime we must target those who commit

the violent crime we must go after them

we must take them out of our communities

far too often criminals who have

absolutely no right under Ohio law to

possess a gun are using guns nonetheless

that's who we have to go after the

criminals

this must stop so I'm asking the General

Assembly to increase penalties on

violent felons who continue to illegally

possess or use guns the rate the legal

possession of a firearm by a violent

felon we must increase penalties for

violent felons and other people who are

found with a gun that they do not have

the legal right to possess the crime of

having weapons while under a disability

which is what it's called is currently a

third degree felony punishable by

maximum of three years in prison I

believe that this is a crime that for a

first offense should be second-degree

felony second-degree felony punishable

by two to eight years in prison and for

a subsequent offense should be a

first-degree felony which is 3 to 5 3 to

11 years excuse me item number 9

possession of firearm while committing a

felony we should increase penalties for

people who commit felonies with a

firearm or whose that's a firearm while

committing a felony current law allows

for an additional penalty of 1 year when

a person possesses a firearm while

committing a felony this should be

increased to a mandatory additional 1 to

3 years I'm 10 using or brandishing a

firearm while committing a felony we

must increase penalties for using or

brandishing a weapon when committing

felony current law allows for an

additional penalty of 3 years if a

person uses a brandishes that firearm

while committing a felony

this should be increased at a minimum to

in mandatory 3 to 5 years in prison

again these are my recommendations to

the General Assembly the General

Assembly will I hope act upon all of

them and exercise their judgment on

these I am number 11 the problem of

straw purchasers we must increase

penalties for those who buy guns

illegally for other people a practice

known as straw purchasing

now straw purchasing is illegal under

both Ohio and federal law today however

these well the Ohio law must be

toughened and I intend to do that

all too often firearms obtained through

these straw purchases are used in

serious violent offenses I am asking the

General Assembly to increase the

penalties for those who purchase a gun

illegally for another person today the

illegal purchaser of a firearm the straw

purchaser this is the person who

actually purchase it for the other

person through a straw purchase that

penalty is a third degree felony

punishable up to three years in prison

we must increase the penalty for a straw

purchaser to at least a second degree

felony punishable by two to eight years

in prison

number 12 I'm also asking the General

Assembly to increase increase the

penalty for a person who possesses a

firearm this is the person through the

straw purchase who got the firearm and

when they get that farm that they know

that they know was obtained through an

illegal or fraudulent purchase when a

person possesses a firearm they know was

fraudulently obtained that person should

be punished in the same manner as the

person who bought the firearm an f-22

the eight years number thirteen we

should increase penalties for people who

illegally illegally furnished firearms

to minors the Ohio law provides very

well for father and give that gun to the

son this is done all the time we have

hunters but that's not what we're

talking about we find too many of our

kids are carrying guns on the streets

often with tragic consequences so adults

through the illegally furnished firearms

to Myers must be held accountable today

and properly furnishing and firearm to a

Meijer only a fifth degree felony up to

12 months in prison

[Music]

I'm asking the General Assembly to make

the crime at least a third degree felony

punishable by up to three years in

prison action item 14 school tip line we

are expanding our school safety tip line

where kids and adults can call or text

anonymously with tips about potential

school violence I'm calling on Ohio ones

today to utilize that tip line the

number is eight four four seven two

three three seven six four eight four

four seven two three three seven six

four we will have that on our website

Tom it'll be on the public safety

website I believe as well is and again

we're asking for people to step up you

see something when you hear something do

something we want to make sure people

understand that they have the ability to

make that call they can certainly always

call their local police they can call

their local sheriff call somebody so

we're expanding that school safety tip

line let me talk about the world of

social media while each one of the mass

shooting tragedies in this country is

the same and but it's also different and

the lessons that we learn from one

should be applied and it should be

cumulative for the lessons we learn from

all

but one things that we have seen is that

time after time the assailant when you

go back you see on social media the

signs were there they were there we

should have caught up in the 24/7 world

social media threats can do arise at any

time our hub is what's called at the

Ohio Department Public Safety is

expanding I told them to expand their

ability to monitor and track potential

threats on social media and to share

that information with local law

enforcement and with schools we now have

the ability the software to target

specific phrases specific words this is

not that we're modern everybody social

mirror but we're looking for that sign

from that violent offender that might

save a life or ten lives we will be in

touch when we find things with the local

schools and local law enforcement

partners

I am Sept 16 the budget that was

approved by this General Assembly also

includes nearly nine million dollars to

help harden soft targets like nonprofits

and religious organizations to make

their facilities more secure

we have seen too much hate and we're

seeing hate targeted at religious groups

and that is wrong

this action General Assembly took is to

help them help them prepare help them

avoid tragedy item 17 working closely

with Sandy Hook promise Ohio schools are

now implementing know the signs safety

assessment intervention program across

the state to know the signs safety

assessment intervention program this

program equipped school staff with

knowledge and skills to identify

potential threats of violent action and

to take steps to intervene currently

there are 23 training dates already

scheduled again I would appeal to our

schools not had that training go out

take advantage of that take advantage of

that training I know also that the

Attorney General has additional training

in other areas that could be helpful for

schools

our state is heartbroken the fabric of

our society has been torn we are

shrouded in deep sadness the needless

loss of lives that occur in Dayton

as Freya and I were there once Sunday I

thought about the parents who had lost

children children who had lost parents

friends who had lost friends now more

than ever we need to come together we

must come together as the much larger

Ohio family because when one family

grieves all of us grief we have an

obligation to each other we have an

obligation to include not exclude people

we have an obligation to help others we

have an obligation to look out for each

other someone is showing signs of

struggle problem we must help and we

must not turn away

there is a saying that and I quote

tragedy should be utilized as a source

of strength and quote no matter what

sort of difficulties or how painful the

experiences experience is if we lose

hope

that's a real disaster end of quote

so now is our time to be strong now is

our time as a state to come together

Democrats Republicans liberals

conservatives everybody to come together

and I'm calling on everyone to do that

look we might have some differences

we should never forget that what holds

us together as Americans as Ohioans is

so much greater than any differences

look we can do this we can do the things

that I outlined today we will do them we

can do meaningful things to protect

lives it won't be easy and although it

is dark now the Sun will shine again as

we find the grace in the glory and each

new sunrise and the hope of each new day

I believe in this state I believe in its

people we can come together we can come

together to do these things to save

lives

let me just add there's no magic about

these proposals

there's no guarantees in life

if we do these they're gonna be violent

someplace in the country well we know

there's going to be some violence it's

the world we live in we understand but I

can tell you this if we do these things

it will matter if we do these things it

will make us safer each one of these by

themselves is not going to solve all the

problems but I believe in my heart that

each and every one of them will help

each and every one of them will lessen

the chance of violence each and every

one of them will make this a better

state and make this a stronger state

the work that we have ahead of us though

it's not just in these proposals and if

you look at these proposals quite

frankly particularly in the area of

mental health where we have a crisis

it's going to be the day-to-day slog the

day-to-day work that is going to make

the difference

it's the blocking and the tackling I'm

not the football player John is but it's

it's you've got do it every single day

but I can tell you if we're committed to

do this we can do it if we're committed

to making sure young kids have more

access to mental health if we're

committed to reducing the trauma that

they experienced we can make a big big

difference

let me say something to my home the

Miami Valley and to the specifically to

the people in Dayton we will spend the

next few days burying the dead we will

spend the next few days hoping and

helping that those who have been injured

helping them recover praying for them

but the people of Dayton and the people

of Miami value are resilient if anybody

has a doubt about that they should have

been there Sunday night where as far as

you could see your people people holding

up handles people going to the scene of

the crime and saying we will not be

intimidated Dayton is a great city

it's a city as we all know the great

history it's a city with a great future

so many great things going on the mayor

and I have talked about this a lot she I

are both are very optimistic about the

future updating as people are resilient

because we've already seen so for the

people of Dayton who are better days

ahead from the people in Miami Valley

there are better days and ahead Sun will

come up there will be opportunities in

the future we will always remember those

who died we will always be scarred by

that but we will do what Ohioans have

always done and that is pushed forward

more happy to respond any questions from

the media

[Music]

well the things that I've just outlined

they were all in some process but look

we're all human the tragedy focuses you

and you know it was time to get him out

the first item that I mentioned as an

item that we've been working on for

months we were that close to getting it

done back close last two days John drove

it home and we got it done

so a you know it's what I hope you know

what you hope comes out of this is a

renewed energy and renewed sense that we

need to tackle these problems some of

them we were already tackling this gives

us a harder push all of us I think all

of us know how to to do these things

I I can't tell you exactly what was in

the governor's proposal Governor Kasich

proposal I will tell you that I'm will

let Johnny answer this in a moment but

we were very careful to try to do

something that wouldn't matter and that

would work but at the same time

something that clearly protected due

process and guaranteed those individuals

due process let me just add one more

thing before I turn to John one things

in answer to the previous question that

I hope comes out of this is once this is

passed by the General Assembly people

know about it and use it each one of us

I think

certainly anybody who's been as close as

I have to law enforcement can come up

with examples of where we had someone

who everybody in the town knew had a

problem I think of one guy who had long

I won't say where it was but he had long

term mental health problems everybody

knew about he was an alcoholic and he

had an arsenal of guns and everybody

sort of knew the day was coming but

nothing but whatever different reasons

nothing got done so what I hope comes

out of this not only we passed the law

but that people understand that it can

be activated now due process is there

and John Johnny one thank you trying to

address the specific question what was

different is that we sat down with the

Second Amendment community they are here

today we invited them to be here and to

be part of that process their major

concern was is their due process under

the law and this provision we provide

due process under the law the if

somebody is an immediate threat the

police can remove them that exists in

our current law but then there will be a

due process through the court system

that will then give the ability for any

weapons that the Avenger individual has

to be taken by police but it won't just

happen at the police's discretion it

will happen at the order of a judge that

was the primary difference and the

sticking point on these issues and

instead and said so we brought people to

the table to have the discussion to work

it through there will certainly be

discussion about as it goes through the

process but that's the primary

difference between what was what was

referred to as a red flag law and what

we are referring to which is different

than that as a safety protection order

which provides for that due process it's

also emphasized excuse me but let me

just also emphasize when we say safety

protection order we kind of wrestled

with what to call it the idea is that

you're you know you're going to

eliminate some suicides by doing this I

mean you're gonna help so it's the

public and it's also the individual

sometimes these people are their own

worst enemy and it's just the way it is

so you're going to save some lives there

you can save some lives out in the

community who else okay this is in our

prepared statement is what I read that

is that that is the exact process it is

a two-step process but every stage there

is protection no I think it's literally

we can get you my statement it is there

I mean it is a is a process that is

activated it's a process that is

activated initially by a family member

or by the police and I think that's what

so if you have somebody else out in the

community who is seeing this they can go

to the place and report that then you

start through the process and there is

basically what I would call a temporary

order that hearing is from three days

and then

you flip right over into a more

permanent order but in both of those new

process hasit has to take place all the

due process right across exam so you got

yeah you gotta get service on the person

in other words you have to know if I am

they have to have the opportunity to

come to court so it's all the procedures

that we are so used to in a criminal

justice system and that we you know so

well we hope that judges will put this

on a rocket docket and we'll deal with

it and get the people in and serve them

and I'm served make sure they have their

due process and get them in there what

we are saying it we hope it happens much

sooner what we're saying is the judge

would have three days to do this that

first hearing we would then say after

that order and there's a different

standard of proof there then then you

would flip over into the permit hearing

which would have to be within 14 days

practical issue so that you understand

because I spoke with law enforcement

about this I spoke with people from the

secondary manemma community we tried to

thread the needle on everybody's

concerns but if somebody is an immediate

threat taking their guns does not remove

that threat you need to remove the

person from the situation and then go

through the due process to take the

weapons away if the judge so orders

because you there are many other ways to

commit violence other than with guns and

so if a person is an immediate threat we

need to remove them and either pink slip

them and put them in a mental health

facility or put them in jail so that

this process can take place it's not

seizing somebody's property without due

process that was the the stick that was

the issue that couldn't get resolved in

the past we've worked with voices across

the the broad array of concern we

believe we have those sorted out and

this is heavy JAMA took very good

this is this what we present this

General Assembly is heavy on helping

that person so it's not pure we won't

protect them from themselves will

protect them from hurting somebody else

but if you if you look at that proposal

you know it calls for a help going

directly to that individual and that's

that's what it's very heavy on that and

we believe unlike in the past when it

failed that we brought people together

and this can pass and become law and and

begin to be implemented sooner rather

than having the old fights that ended up

in inaction there are a lot of issues

that we could talk about there are a lot

of issues that quite candidly if you're

serious about getting results

I'm Congress ult's oriented guy some of

these things have to be done at the

federal level John you want to add

anything to that no I think that's

sufficient

and the paper legislator look as I

indicated there are a lot of this was in

the works in fact all of it I think

there may not be some exceptions but I'm

not aware of anything that was not

already in the works you know part of

this is I have made this very clear

throughout this crisis that we're going

to do things that matter we're gonna do

things that are constitutional and we're

gonna do things that can get passed so

making sure something can get passed is

a key you'll find after four years or

eight years with me I'm bottom line

results oriented I don't do a whole lot

of things just to be doing them so our

job is to get results our job is to get

something passed and so getting it in

the proper form for example our item

number one which you're just talking

about we needed to make sure that we had

the buy-in that we had the assistance

from the Second Amendment community

because if we presented that bill to

this General Assembly without that the

bill would go nowhere

so what I owe the people the state is

results I don't know um rhetoric

rhetoric fine sometimes an occasion for

it but what they want and what I've

heard year after year from the people of

aisle is fix the problems

help us make things better that's what

this proposal does but as far as the

timing of all those that's why we're

trying to get these things in a you know

you know in a way that we can get them

passed by the General Assembly

IIIi have talked then with all four

legislative leaders I had those

conversations yesterday I have said to

them we will get you copies of it I

tried to outline in broad brush strokes

what we were going to do I also said to

them I fully understand that the General

Assembly will do what the General

Assembly does which is hold hearings and

and look at look at these things but you

know these are all things that I believe

can pass these are all things that we

can get done these are all things that

can will make a difference these are all

things that are constitutional and it

was great it was great that Larry Hoff

was a great sign that's the I know he

had to go but he was here and that's a

big sign I talked to all all four of the

leaders

we started this Tom you want can you

come up tom stick records I want to get

the chronology correct this is this is

not brand new but it's it's going up

like that so you talk about my general

we start talking about it yeah we did

thank you Tom stare at Director of

Public Safety and we did start talking

about this with Attorney General at the

one and working on some of these things

at the Bureau of Criminal Investigation

I would say the difference is we're now

being proactive rather than reactive

we've probably historically been

reacting with social media after an

event we you know go back and take a

look at what what we can find out what

we're trying to do now is be more on the

front end of the prevention side of it

again not not the NSA looking at every

every social media but but looking at

those key words and phrases using

software and technologies and trained

staff to be on the front end of these

situations there could be yes this is

anybody can do this so you know well we

worry about correctly worrying about the

government state doing it but when

someone puts that out and what we're

what we're seeing time after time after

time

is there a warrant with this you know

you see social with almost every case

you're seeing warnings on the internet

something they're putting up posting you

when you drill down at you see him go

back to this young manager who's a young

man you see what he was saying in high

school you see social alienation you see

writing things I mean there's one case a

few years ago tragic case were you know

person in high school I believe was high

school had written someone must die on

the top of their page well you know

teacher said well that's not good

but look these are signs and this is you

need we need to look at this as a

package we need to look at all the

different things because part of this as

I pointed out we had already started

down this path

there's 675 million dollars when we

asked this legislature to give us

wraparound services it was a direct

result to of what we have been seen time

and time again that we're having

children traumatized and they're having

mental health problems and we've got to

deal with those mental health problems

so so a lot of this was moving forward

but you have to look at it I think

holistically in how we help kids every

every single day in some cases we're

going to be able to identify a kid who's

suicidal in other cases we may identify

a young person who is exhibiting all

kinds of bad signs that in you know a

few years or not but not a few years

they'll they'll turn into a killer so it

all comes together each one is important

each one should be passed I see no

reason that all these cannot be passed I

expect the General Assembly to do his

constitutional duty to look at these

issues to hold hearings to bring in

interested parties but we have tried to

put together these proposals that are

constitutional that make a difference

and that we think we can get past now

I'm not saying it's gonna be easy I'm

not gonna say it's going to be easy

but to get back to a question that was

asked a moment ago in reference to folks

that folks in Toledo the momentum that

that has been created by this horrible

horrible tragedy you know I think is

putting a spotlight on this you're

reporting it more more talk about it

everybody's looking at it more now as

now as it is a window of opportunity for

us to change things to do what we need

to do

the connor bad situation making of one

I'm sorry

halfway would blink much wild like that

when he was in high school to the

mid-level services your funding was it

the parents the students on the school

bus was that the teachers the law

enforcement because they're all look

first of all we don't know all the facts

about him more facts keep coming out as

the news media does the good work it

does but the answer is all of the above

if you look at the combination of all

the different things either that we have

already said in place in motion in this

budget that was for those of you from

Ohio was passed in July in that budget

and in the additional proposals here

there's ample we hope there's ample

opportunity to for someone to speak up

to identify and the key to

identification is you have to be able to

do something with it and so one of the

things we heard from teachers is well we

don't have anything we don't know what

to do with it or you know we need to be

tied into the social services so if you

look at where our thoughts are and again

I've gotten some questions from

superintendents about where is this 675

million dollars over two years

supposed to be spent what can we spend

it on in regard to the wraparound

services the the answer is this is

something you can spend it on and what

we envision you doing is not you know

creating out a whole cloth use those

resources to tap into the local

community resources so the resources

they're already in the community

with the animates reward or other ways

to get that so the answer is all all of

the above every every school district

under this budget will get money we did

what we have done and this legislature

is done and tried to make sure every

school had the resources to do that and

and when you look at it from that

perspective what you do is you allow the

poorest school districts with more poor

kids to have more resources because they

don't have other resources so yes I am I

am hopeful and confident that every

school has the ability to do this we

also have money in there we didn't talk

about this but which is related we also

have money in there in regard to a

social-emotional learning which is we

have put under the under the broad

category of how we help young people

avoid going down the pathway of

addiction so when you talk about that in

there but that's that's a part of this

as well

I do not know much about to visit my

understanding is the president is coming

tomorrow and you know I was invited to

be there I've talked to the mayor about

the visit but I don't know that I don't

at this point know the final details

what their what they're going to do was

there a second question look I think

it's always appropriate for a governor

the president to go where there is

sorrow to go for people are hurting my

understanding of the visit is that's

what it's focused on being here saying

I'm sorry it happened I agree for you

that's part of what life is about and I

think that when a president can do that

it's a good thing and I think it's part

of the responsibility of the governor

the governor says when I go I said look

I represent the people Ohio people are

grieving all over Ohio for you when the

president comes he can say that about

about the country in it in both cases it

happens to be true

they capture everyone's attention what

makes this time well you're gonna have

to be the judge of that I don't have a

crystal ball but these are doable

proposals these are things that really

will matter these are things that we can

get done not say it's easy to get it

done but you know we look at results and

what matters is results and then we do

things that will make a difference that

will make our children safer our

communities safer or friends safer or

family safer we look at that every day I

mean that's a you know that's the the

job of the governor as I said many of

these all of these proposals were in

some different phase and we knew that in

some cases we could do it ourselves

through through executive order or

through or agencies and we down that

pathway but we also knew others we

through our system need to go to the

General Assembly and to get the General

Assembly to it to pass them and so this

is a window of opportunity and let's not

mess it up let's not miss this

opportunity this is our opportunity to

do to do do these things

look well thank you for the question

since this tragedy started on Sunday

morning I I've made clear that every one

of these shootings is different

everyone's the same and some respects

most of them involve a person who is

marginalized for whatever reason usually

it is a male usually someone in that

range of age but they're different and

if we after a tragedy only confine

ourselves to doing those things that

would have prevented this tragedy we're

missing a real opportunity so we need to

look at all these tragedies together and

quite candidly we also use this

opportunity to look at other problems

that we have that might be somewhat

related for example you'll see in here

proposals that I've thought about a long

time and I tried to get past when I was

the Attorney General and we didn't

really get much past and you know we've

been preparing to take to the General

Assembly having to do with violent

people out in on the streets and in

targeting repeat and violent offenders

so we have an obligation to use this as

an opportunity to pass things and get

things done that are going to save lives

what all these have in common is I am

convinced their implementation will save

lives no magic about any of this I can't

guarantee we won't have other tragedies

but what we have to do is is to continue

to chip away at this and we have to

continue to do things that that make a

difference in that matter so we look at

this not confined if we only confine

ourselves to the facts of this case we

will come up with a very limited answer

to our bigger problems on the on the

whole package as it relates to guns the

difference is that we focused on

keeping guns away from people who

shouldn't have them either for mental

health reasons or because they've broken

the law and can't legally possess

firearms and we did all that without

infringing on the rights of law-abiding

citizens that's why we worked with the

Second Amendment community that's why

they there we've asked them to be here

today because it's going to take all of

us to get this done and we can't finger

point and we can't draw lines and this

ain't we have to bring everybody

together to do it we have to listen to

the details and we have to work together

to get this accomplished and I believe

we can and what the governor outlined

today is that he's not just focused

we're not just focused on one issue

we're broadening the conversation about

a lot of the brokenness that's out there

in our world today on the mental health

front on the opioid front and the

addiction front that it is that he has

been such a great champion of you know

suicides all of these things will as a

package do a part play a part of helping

to save lives for people all across the

landscape of Ohio now let me just add

one other thing there's a PS my friends

in the mental health community I think

would want me to point out the obvious

which is that the vast vast vast

majority in fact way over 90% of the

people who have a mental health problem

or not viola at all and so you know we

need to understand that even people with

severe mental health problems well over

90% of them or not violently at all so

you know we have to have a lot of

different things coming together for

example for issue before our item number

one comes together but we part of part

of our challenges is is is stigmatizing

those with a mental health illness we've

got to start treating people with the

mental health illness like they had

cancer they had some other problem

medical problem that we

is a medical problem and we got a better

something we've got to get over and

we're making progress but we got to do

it we got to do a better job and that's

part of what some of these programs are

trying to do
