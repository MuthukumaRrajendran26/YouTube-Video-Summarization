this definitely wasn't about race this

wasn't about religion this wasn't him

trying to hurt a specific group or make

any sort of statement he was not a big

statement person if he was doing this it

was probably in the moment and it was

personal he talked to me about how

people needed to take more action and

maybe start a little ruckus he never

mentioned anything to the scale or

wanting to like do anything extreme just

that like quiet protests weren't enough

there needs to be more direct action and

at that core I believe to his extreme

not at all feels like I'm in an

alternate universe like what a weird

sentence my ex-boyfriend was a mass

murderer what

so yeah I'm still in shock I'm gonna be

dealing with these emotions for probably

months if not longer and whether or not

I was shocked I'm not shocked he did

something horrific because he had

untreated problems and there are so many

things and there are so many things that

people aren't going to know he talked

about current events in world tragedies

like people talk about world war ii and

history it was just something he was

fascinated by and he talked about it a

lot it was like his main focus as a

psychology person he was interested in

what makes terrible people do terrible

things

yeah and he he he knew that they were

bad he knew that they were horrific and

he wanted to know what what a person to

do those things oh yeah he showed me the

one video of the mass shooting on our

first date

I'm not sure which shooting it was he's

not a monster he did a monstrous act and

if we just look at that if we just label

him as a monster we're not gonna solve

anything we're not gonna figure anything

out I didn't think he would go shoot

strangers especially his sister I didn't

see that one coming um so he didn't talk

about his family a whole lot he told me

that he liked his sister sometimes she

was like that annoying little sister but

their siblings that happens they weren't

best friends but he thought that she was

a good person this is a much more

complicated issue than it is just mental

illness or it is just gun control it is

all parts put together every system

failing him and every system failing

those victims through him
