Stephen Fowler remembered his son as

someone who squeezed every last drop of

fun out of life speaking at Lucas's

funeral Fowler said he envied his sons

drive to pursue his passion for

traveling

he didn't just dream of traveling he

worked and saved and made it happen he

lived off the smell of an oily rag to

get to places we've never heard of and

along the way forged many friendships

the 23 year old Fowler seems to wear a

smile in every picture you find even at

36 below zero but it's especially true

of the ones alongside his girlfriend

Chyna Dees the 24 year old American was

killed alongside Fowler when tragedy

struck his father says Fowler was deeply

in love and in fact at his happiest

we're so happy that Lucas and Chyna

found each other we so look forward to

having Chyna in our family her mother

tells us that Chyna wanted their kids to

have an Aussie accent this surveillance

video of the couple was released by

police it was taken just two days before

their bodies would be found next to the

van on the side of a BC Highway they'd

been shot to death

DC's family held a private memorial

service last weekend in North Carolina

her mother says she's watched the

surveillance video over and over to

rewatch this hug the couple met in a

hostel in Croatia they've both been to

numerous countries DC's mother says the

travel always made her nervous

except for when her daughter went to

Canada while both families are focused

not on the horrors of how their loved

ones were killed but instead on the way

they lived with time there will be fewer

teas and more laughter Aldi China we can

no longer hug a boy

please hold him tight you are in our

hearts for it Mike Armstrong Global News
