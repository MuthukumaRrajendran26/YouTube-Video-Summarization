this picture was taken at the White

House on September 13th 1993 President

Bill Clinton was hosting Israeli Prime

Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLoS Yasser

Arafat to sign the Oslo accord an

agreement that would begin what is now

known as the peace process we have been

granted the great privilege of

witnessing this victory for peace

despite what it looks like Bill Clinton

actually had very little to do with the

Oslo accord it wouldn't be until the mid

to late 90s that Clinton would get more

involved just as the peace process was

beginning to unravel since then every US

president has tried to bring peace to

the Middle East and Trump is no

different but how he plans to go about

it might make a bad situation worse

I am very pro-israel I've always been

pro-israel there's nobody more

pro-israel than I am the first sign that

Trump might mishandle the Middle East

file was who he put in charge of it

Jared Kushner his son-in-law turned

senior advisor who doesn't appear to

have much experience in the area and

he's not exactly a neutral player either

Kushner was running his parents

foundation at a time when it funded

illegal Israeli settlements here in the

West Bank and the two people tasked with

helping him are Trump's former lawyers

with few credentials

other than being Orthodox Jews with

connections in Israel it's a perfectly

qualified team so how is no no no I was

joking and when you look at the Trump

administration's policies towards

Israel's occupation of Palestine it's

not hard to see what side officials are

on at the end of 2017 Trump officially

recognized Jerusalem as the capital of

Israel and announced that he would move

the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to

Jerusalem what a glorious day

remember this moment this was a big deal

because both Palestinians and Israelis

claimed Jerusalem as their capital the

city is divided with mainly Israelis in

the West and Palestinians in the East he

also recognized another occupied

territory the Golan Heights it is a

shift that could both have a major

impact on America's relationship with

the Arab world and potentially boost the

political fortunes of mr. Trump's close

ally Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin

Netanyahu was so thrilled that he even

named a settlement there after Trump and

at the same time Trump has cut aid to

Palestinians pulled funding from the

main UN agency that provides social

services to Palestinian refugees and

worked to strip them of their refugee

status all in a bid to force the

Palestinians to make a deal with Israel

but Trump's all-or-nothing approach

hasn't worked so far we have taken the

decision that there will be no official

communication between any Palestinian

official and any American official

you know in lockstep with Prime Minister

Netanyahu and others on the Israeli

right so now they believe that they can

do what they want with us support that

Stars Waxman he recently wrote a book on

the israeli-palestinian conflict you

know too many years the thing that has

kind of held the right back to some

extent was the caution of some of those

people like Netanyahu who argued that if

we if we go too far

we'll lose US support well now they

didn't have that concern any longer and

over the course of the past few years

there has been a boom in illegal

settlements being built in the

Palestinian territories you're seeing

the the physical landscape changing as a

result of Israeli settlement expansion

what's happening in Jerusalem

particularly in East Jerusalem and the

evictions and demolition is taking place

recently there and also it's ultimately

undermining the prospects for a

resolution of the conflict

discontent on the ground has led to

deadly street protests and some of the

worst fighting since 2014 this is not a

trump made problem though things were

bad under Obama to his Secretary of

State John Kerry tried hard to get a new

peace deal signed but failed and the

two-state solution which envisions an

independent state of Palestine alongside

Israel was already dying a slow death

prior to trump even taking office and

that's because of the reality on the

ground the Palestinian leadership is

divided the PLO which is the main group

representing Palestinian people controls

the West Bank but is suffering from a

legitimacy crisis and Hamas a political

organization and militant group that

doesn't even recognize Israel's

existence controls the Gaza Strip

then there's Israeli politics to

consider peace with Palestinians used to

be a big election issue but now it's

hardly even mentioned over the years

support for annexing the West Bank has

increased and people's appetite for the

two-state solution has waned in the last

few years I think one of the real shift

is gave this sense of despair and

hopelessness I complete a breakdown of

trust and a belief on both sides of the

other was really not interested in

living peacefully or expecting the other

significant leader but despite that in

June Jared Kushner finally revealed the

first part of his Middle East peace plan

the priest to prosperity vision is a

modern framework for a brighter and more

prosperous future the plan which

proposes billions of dollars and

investment in the Palestinian economy

over the next decade but offers no

political solutions was boycotted by the

Palestinians barely acknowledged by

Israelis and laughed at by analysts

partly because a lot of it was recycled

from previous failed peace plans and

partly because of its very lofty goals

in the most generous view it's either

completely naive and ill-informed or the

more less generous interpretation of it

that it is deeply cynical and it sees a

candidacy like a Machiavellian scheme to

essentially force the Palestinians into

surrender apparently a political

solution will be proposed sometime in

the future but few people are holding

their breaths by blindly supporting

Israel experts agree that the Trump

administration has basically forfeited

its ability to act as a meaningful

mediator so I'm looking at two state and

one state and I like the one that both

parties like I'm very happy with the one

that both parties like and really it's

not up to the United States Israelis and

Palestinians pull the keys to whatever a

future peace might look like there are

still many things that can happen that

can be done by both sides especially as

well to reduce the conflict instead of

just focusing on you know will there be

a peace agreement we should also contain

more attention to the kind of the

smaller but very important things that

can be done this right now
