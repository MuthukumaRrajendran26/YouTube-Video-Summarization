it wasn't

you

you

well good morning

hurricane durian has shown what it's

capable of it's absolutely battered the

Bahamas the latest track on durian has

it a little more than a hundred and

hundred miles east of West Palm Beach it

has done what the model suggested it

would do and it is essentially stalled

out it's moving about one mile per hour

and that was predicted to happen for

most of today and then the forecasts are

that it will then begin a descent north

obviously when and how that done is

happens is going to be critical for

impacts I'm in the state of Florida but

we are East Coast certainly is within

the cone still and people need to remain

vigilant if you're ordered to evacuate

you need to do that from Palm Beach

County all the way up to Nassau the

Florida Georgia border all those coastal

counties have issued evacuation orders

and and it's important that residents

heed those calls you know get out now

while you have time while there's fuel

available and you'll be safe on the

roads and of course you can go to

Florida disaster org slash info for all

evacuation updates I just spoke this

morning with President Trump he's fully

engaged in this and you know just

reiterated that he's gonna provide

whatever resources we need to be able to

weather Dorian FEMA is fully engaged

obviously this is a storm that can

impact multiple states at this point but

but FEMA's fully engaged here in Florida

and we appreciate that we're of course

concerned about power restoration once

the storm passes Florida Power and Light

has most of these counties in terms of

the power and they've assembled

approximately 17,000 personnel that are

pre staged and and ready to respond and

as soon as the first bands of severe

weather head they will come in after

that to restore power around the clock

because we I think they understand how

important that is we will obviously be

assisting with our assets whether it's

clearing roads vegetation whatever we

can do to help help that happen

there have been 72 nursing homes and

assisted living facilities along the

coast that have been evacuated some

Florida hospitals have begun evacuating

or making plans to evacuate these

include Advent health and noosa Myrna

Beach in Volusia County Cape Canaveral

and Brevard Cleveland Clinic south in

Martin County port st. Lucie Hospital

Good Samaritan Medical Center in Palm

Beach steward Sebastian River Medical

Center in Indian River and Halifax

Psychiatric Center north and Volusia

Cleveland Clinic North Martin is a

partial evacuation if you're involved

with the health care facility continue

in putting your emergency updates into

our emergency status system it includes

generator utility information evacuation

status emergency contact if there is a

need for something and you're updating

us you know we have people monitoring

that all the time we have people in a

variety of agencies that could then

respond accordingly and obviously we

want to do that we have the gas stations

along the evacuation routes we've

confirmed are going to remain open some

of the gas stations and the evacuation

zones you may see some of those start to

close soon but the ones on the routes

are going to remain open I've expanded

the suspension of tolls to include

routes in and around Jacksonville like

the First Coast Expressway and the i-295

express lane and of course we suspended

tolls on a number of roads in Florida

yesterday also the Central Florida

Expressway Authority has suspended tolls

on a number of roads in and around

Central Florida now the following five

ports have been closed Miami Everglades

Fort Pierce Palm Beach and Port

Canaveral Jacksonville and Fernandina

are in condition Yankee obviously as the

storm moves north you know their status

could change but as the storm moves

north we anticipate some of the southern

ports reopening

we're still monitoring traffic and have

not seen anything out of the ordinary in

terms of evacuations in terms of

evacuation traffic pretty much what we

expected so this is I've been

frustrating I know for a lot of people

because this seems like we've been

talking about this for a lot long time

but we are in a situation where the

storm is stalling very close to our

coast it is gonna make a movement and

the movement that it makes is gonna have

a lot of impact on Floridians and so

please listen to the instructions he the

instructions do what you need to do to

keep you and your family safe take some

questions all of the nursing rooms that

you didn't know whether they had updated

with with generators one of those those

facilities are now safe as and we've

gotten the patients out I mean are they

the positions the best decision that can

be to weather the storm well we have so

in as I said yesterday in the coastal

counties the facilities either have

confirmed generator availability or that

they plan to evacuate now since that has

happened you know not every one of them

has continued to give us updates and so

you know if you have a generator and

something's wrong with the generator you

need to tell us that you need to put

those updates in but you know they've

all either indicated a generator or a

plan to evacuate but this is something

that's constantly being monitored by

akka and some of our other state

officials another thing that that akka

is going to be doing is you know we have

a number of hospitals obviously on this

east coast of Florida we're obviously

concerned about all of them because it's

a sensitive thing but some of the bigger

corporate hospitals probably have more

resources to handle this and so akka has

been focusing on getting updates from

offering assistance some of the

independent hospitals which may not have

as many resources and so they've been

very proactive on that and I appreciate

what Mary Mayhew is doing hospitals are

evacuating

they are completely evacuating and do

they send their patients then went to

the interior counties I think it's a mix

I mean jera to probably know more do you

want to speak on that girl Thank You

governor so it's a mix each hospital is

doing different things depending upon

where they're located the type of

building and what what sort of level

surge they they might be expecting so

some are obviously moving out their most

critical patients a lot of times they

have obviously sister facilities or they

have mo use in place with other

facilities it's too soon to know exact

numbers but I mean obviously if I think

we started to see possibilities of this

earlier in the week last week I remember

initially we're like well it's probably

gonna run over the mountains of

Hispaniola break up and then everyone

will go and didn't happen so so I think

you're obviously gonna see some effect

of that but at the same time I think the

fact that it's taken an eastward track

people that had planned on being

someplace in Northwest Florida or

whatever probably you know we're in

affected it also so we'll figure all

that out but look at the end of the day

I want as robust tourism as possible but

my most important priority is that

Floridians are safe and that and that

we're doing what we need to do to be

able to assist after the fact and this

is a storm that is record in terms of

the 185 mile per hour impact of the

Bahamas and it's very very close to our

shores I appreciate the tracks that keep

it off the shore but but we're gonna

have we're gonna have some impacts one

way or another and and that's really I

think the main concern will be able to

people are gonna want to come to Florida

is gonna be all time to do all that

stuff and we've got a lot of great

things going on with the economy but but

safety really is number one so we are

obviously gonna be monitoring this there

the rest of the day you know we have a

lot of resources ready to go the feds or

have been great they have a lot of

resources ready to go and and hopefully

by tonight you know we'll have a sense

of the movement

and you know the weather experts have

said once we see the definitive movement

north on which path that's on you know

that's gonna allow us to kind of even

more concisely a concretely identify the

places along Florida's coast though that

are most at risk so so stay tuned for

that thank you
