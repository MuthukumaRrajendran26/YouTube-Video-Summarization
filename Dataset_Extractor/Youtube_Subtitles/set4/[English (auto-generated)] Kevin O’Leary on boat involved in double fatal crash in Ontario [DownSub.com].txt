Canadian celebrity kevin O'Leary says he

is fully cooperating with a police

investigation into the deaths of two

people after a boat crash in Muskoka

over the weekend a Florida man and a

woman from Oxbridge did not survive two

boats collided at about 11:30 Saturday

night they were on Lake Joseph 30

kilometers southeast of Perry sound near

Emerald Island let's get the very latest

from Global's Jamie maracas who is live

in Muskoka Jamie

good evening Alan local experts in

boating and safety say that speed

weather or perhaps even darkness played

a factor in the crash

adding that when you boat at night it's

a whole different ballgame yeah when

you're boating you want to make sure you

keep about 360 degree awareness Muskoka

marina owner Geordie Newlands has spent

his whole life on these waters and still

he cautions people from voting at night

voting at night adds a whole bunch of

other hazards a risk that proved deadly

Saturday we're on the Jo River here

coming on to Lake Joseph according to

police it was about 30 minutes from here

two vessels collided around 11:30

sources close to the family say a boat

owned by celebrity and businessman kevin

O'Leary smashed into a pontoon type

vessel leaving 64 year-old Gary Paul

Tosh from Florida dead and sending four

more people to hospital it was there 48

year old Oxford resident Susanne Brito

also passed away in a statement O'Leary

wrote on Saturday night I was a

passenger in a boat that was involved in

a tragic collision with another

watercraft that had no navigation lights

on and then fled the scene

I am fully cooperating with law

enforcement in their investigation OPP

say in fact both boats were gone when

they reached the scene both vessels were

in touch with ambulance for emergency

services but investigators would not

reveal if O'Leary was driving at the

time confirming a breathalyzer was

administered I heard it was a little

foggy on

Saturday night on the lake Newland says

well weather and a lack of light can

make a trip out on the water a difficult

one he also warns there's no speed limit

on the lake we've been cut off already

and we're just cruising so people are in

a rush to get places and cut corners

asking boaters out any time of day to

slow down and make sure they have all of

their equipment in working order that's

a sentiment that OPP are sharing as well

asking anybody with information on the

crash to please come forward so far no

criminal charges have been laid
