The search continues here in Gillam Manitoba. At this point, it remains the focal point of the RCMP investigation, because this is the last place with a confirmed sighting of the pair we're talking about gamma cloud and briar Chmerkovskiy. Now in the community, they will be using the hercules aircraft that the military provided it landed in the community yesterday and it was up in the air doing searches right until dark. It is going back up today. It will be looking at a number of areas, including waterways. Now the Hercules has some equipment that is very useful number one. It can stay in the area for a long time, but also has high-powered cameras. I can also tell you that the RCMP will continue to scan the wooded area around this community, using, of course, ATVs and officers will be on foot with k9 units. They did earlier search a train that came into town from Churchill Manitoba. Plainclothes officers continue to talk with community members here on the ground. Of course, they have been searching this community since Tuesday, and it appears they will continue to do so until evidence points them in another direction.
