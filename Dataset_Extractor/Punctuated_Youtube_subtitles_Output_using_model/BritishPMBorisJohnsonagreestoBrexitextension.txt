He's not kind of a brexit and the people know that the Prime Minister has failed in his own words. Mr. speaker, it is time for the Prime Minister to look for the nearest ditch. Our Edmund Shannon is on perpetual brexit duty Redmond. We know for sure now. Brexit won't happen, October 31st, but do we know what happens next? Yes, Donna. Well, the UK gained an extra hour this past weekend with the end of daylight saving for 2019, and the UK government gained an extra 92 days today with the EU approving that latest Brexton extension until January 31st now Boris Johnson is, of course, blaming the opposition for this latest delay to brexit and well. He might. It was his number one campaign promise when he became leader that brexit would happen on October 31st, but it's not going to now. So this latest extension has been called a so called a flex tension, and that's because the UK could potentially leave the EU anytime before January 31st. If and when Boris Johnson can push that brexit deal through Parliament and tonight, Johnson tried and failed to trigger an election on December 12th, but Redman I guess that election could still happen. Yes, indeed, we could have an election, a rare election just before Christmas now Boris Johnson. Ideally Donna wants one on December 12th. The ideal scenario for him is to have brexit Don and then go to the country, but some opposition parties, of course, would like to have brakes. It's still hanging around as an issue so expect the parties tomorrow, when they reconvene to haggle over that date and maybe come to an agreement on an election date. We have a great new deal and it's time for the voters have a chance to pronounce on that deal, replace this dysfunctional Parliament with a new Parliament that can get brakes it done so the country can move on. The big challenge for Boris Johnson will be if brexit doesn't happen by the time an election comes around will be the threat of Nigel Farage's new brexit party. Of course, the polls are saying that Johnson's conservatives have a healthy lead, but a month is a long time in politics and Donna. It is a lifetime. When it comes to brexit, it sure is feels like a lifetime. Redman Shannon. We expect to hear from you again tomorrow, Thanks.
