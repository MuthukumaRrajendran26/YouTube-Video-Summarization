Few politicians command an audience like this in life or in death, but congressman Elijah Cummings towered over Washington. On this day he received a remarkable tribute for his remarkable service to country. Well, we get the story, we don't know. If we can believe anymore. We should hear him come on we're better than that. In every sense, Cummings was a powerful voice, a Civil Rights icon and a remarkable orator, a man who could reach across the partisan divide to make friends on all sides. He pushed back against the abuse of power. He was unwavering in his defense of our democracy. He had little tolerance for those who put party ahead of country or partisanship. Above truth, even as his own health failed Cummings continued, leading the investigations into President Trump when the attacks turned nasty and when Trump took aim at Cummings hometown of Baltimore, the congressman refused to relent and invited the President to visit the city. He continued his work until his death last week, but congressman chairman Cummings did was not easy and it got infinitely more difficult in the last months of his life when he sustained personal attacks and attacks on his beloved city. Perhaps that's what made Cummings uniquely suited to this era? He conveyed a seriousness and a gravity that rose beyond the usual bickering traits that former President Barack Obama noted set him apart from the other, powerful men and women who walked the halls of power, we're supposed to introduce them as honorable, but Elijah Cummings was honorable before he was elected office. There's a difference. His remarkable life set a high bar inspiring those who would follow him to do better for their country. Jackson, Prost, Co, Global, News, Washington,.
