The challenges for this operation have been immense. We have not seen anything like a debris field like this. There are multiple areas that are impassable. We have a difficult time because of course, we have to find make sure that our dogs are okay. There are multiple hazards here, like nails, corrugated, steel glass. You know things like that. We also have other animals that are running around and we're trying to actually help them out to if we can. But there is certainly some challenges. There's been some areas that we just haven't been able to actually get into, but all of the buildings that we can get to we've been searching, and then we mark them so that it doesn't get repeated by a future team. Yeah, it's pretty difficult, you know, but it's something that we do so you know yeah. These are. This is our job. You know we've been tasked to do this, so you know we're prepared for it, and you know, but just the magnitude of the damage has been you know, certainly very challenging for the teams and the heat as well has been quite difficult to so. But our guys are doing good and we'll continue to to do well and- and hopefully we'll be back here tomorrow- on on a further side and and we'll just continue to clear buildings.
