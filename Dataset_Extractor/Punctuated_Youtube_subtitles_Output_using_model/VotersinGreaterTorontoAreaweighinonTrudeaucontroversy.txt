That show at least two pictures and a video of him wearing brown and black face. Many people are willing to sort of shrug this off as ghosts of his youth, but others say this is an example of what he's really like deep down. Inside now, we spoke to marketing expert Tony Chapman on global news morning, he's the CEO of Tony Chapman impressions about what Trudeau might have to do to regain any trust that he might have lost after last. Night's revelations today is about resetting the election. He's got to get in front of a lot of special interest groups. He's got to get in front of a lot of minorities. He's got to take a lot of punches and he's got to come out of it with since real humility and grace and say you know, I I haven't been consistent, I haven't been honest on this stuff, and I can do better. Now you might have noticed we're in the middle of celebrations square in Mississauga and that's essentially what we've been doing all day. Global news has been going around the 905 getting reaction from 905 voters, because this is a battleground region or a collection of regions in the upcoming election. These votes are really going to matter in determining who the next Prime Minister will be.
