There's an extra spring in jugni teasing, step Bend for good reason. Vp leader has had very few stumbles out of the blocks and he's seemingly connecting with voters. You may not know him just yet. We believe in investing in people, expectations were low for his first ever federal leaders, debate and it forced him to sometimes take wild swings at his rivals. Andrew Shearer and Elizabeth May, whose Green Party is neck-and-neck with the NDP. In some polls we have a solid position, unlike the greens on a woman's right to choose. We have a solid position when it comes down to MA, wasn't given the chance to refute the claims, but later said, they're absolutely false. It's attacked some aren't used to from the NDP which likes to preach love and courage, and the more aggressive tone is reflected in a new attack ad released. Today. Mr. Trudeau's liberals cut deals with the big drug companies, the ad, which only mentions the NDP and very small writing at the very end claims Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau is in bed with big business. Now, that's not a new line, but Singh is bringing the party back to its roots by being unapologetic about raising taxes, especially on the most wealthy. A tax is really just a contribution. It's an investment, and if you want to invest in and contribute to this beautiful country, it means that those who are able to contribute a bit more ie pay more taxes should do so. A promising you're going to raise taxes is risky, but some party stall words believe it's a risk worth taking. You cannot be a progressive and be honest with voters without admitting that social justice will require spending. It's a stark contrast from the 2015 campaign when the NDP promised balanced budgets and then got out lefted by the Liberals and went from the second-place party so now distant third.
