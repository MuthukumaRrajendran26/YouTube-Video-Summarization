After the big hurricane thought to find some nice stuff, he likes I've, been doing for over 20 years. I found some junk, maybe some mini balls, a few pieces of metal nice young couple, five minutes before us walks across a cannonball I wanted to get like a metal detector and specially after the hurricane come out here and see if there's anything any history or artifacts that kind of washed up on the shore. First time we just thought it was a rock the more we got to look and we realized it was something more than a rock. We actually just got got lucky with no equipment just spending a day at the beach. Isn't this all a story? Cool see is historia KH, ugly son, Passaic, icon, tabla, head wound up with kissing Cointreau.
