Municipal leaders are the ones to see and hear and feel it first when the hundred-year-old water main crumbles, the bridge fails the storm sewers, overflow, a major transformer blows, or the public transit system well fails and with the changing climate of new challenges, flooding, droughts, wildfires extreme key, that's impacted citizens, especially our new song. Remote infrastructure must respond to and be more resilient to. Climate change, but also be part of the solution. Now see you Canada fund. We brought up new buses and light rail and we built new community and recreation centers. So let me just be clear about my priorities. This is very nervous when it comes to infrastructure funding so that we all understand one another one. My first priority is getting things built quickly: fit matters the lives of Canadians, but there's another priority. Equal importance ensure you better jobs and economic outcomes for Canadians wherever they live. That goes through faster, more efficient transportation like the Gordie Howe International, Bridge underway in Windsor Ontario. It comes through indispensable, 21st century infrastructure such as high-speed Internet. What is it the farm of Colin McRae, just north of Winnipeg last year, where I saw and heard about the importance of broadband access to precision agriculture, the third public priority, a challenge and an opportunity we will be putting in our pudding at climate lens on everything we do. An infrastructure has to be at the top of that list.
