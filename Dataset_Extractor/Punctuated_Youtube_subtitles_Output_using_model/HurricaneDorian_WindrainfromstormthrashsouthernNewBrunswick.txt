Jilla chair tries to protect his property from the wind and rain of durian and he has his work cut out for him go over there with conditions worsening as the day progressed, more people came out to check on their boats in Shetty, AK I, just came to check on the boats, see I, make sure everything's. Okay, others, like nadine gallant, were dropping by just to check things out a couple of hours away in st. john, more rain and wind, but no major problems reported during the day. Still some people weren't taking any chances and closing up possible trouble spots yeah. When you hear hurricane yeah, you immediately think of strong winds and especially when there's a lot of trees around us. You never know exactly what's gonna happen. Kevin Clifford is st. John's, fire chief and heads of the city's emergency measures organization. He says people need to remain vigilant. Well if they can stay home stay home, you know even even driving in today to be part of this operation. I was thinking about things that could fall on me because of the high wind. Clifford also encourages people to think of others who may need your help when a storm strikes. You got neighbors that aren't, as you know, as as young as you may be, and then the folks who may be you know they may have things around their homes that that aren't secure, now keep an eye on your neighbors and if you can help and keep yourself safe at the same time, be prepared to do so. Good advice as you stare down a storm that has already taken lives and left widespread damage in its path. Andrew Cromwell, Global, News, st. John.
