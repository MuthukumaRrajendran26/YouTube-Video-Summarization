The the conservatives will continue to to ask questions, as is important for an official opposition. We will continue to stand up and defend jobs and make the kinds of investments and announcements that we're making today. It is something to highlight that a number of weeks ago, when Andrew Shearer was asked about the tramway he said he opposes this tramway project, I'm, not quite sure what that means, I'm, guaranteeing that this government has allocated the funds and is moving forward on this project. I think there are questions for mr. Scheer about his continued commitment to the city of Quebec and to the excellent project that has been put forward by our partners here. The Minister of Public Safety had addressed these questions yesterday, when I will reinforce, is that it is a crime to travel internationally with the goal of supporting terrorism or engaging in terrorism, and that is a crime that we will continue to make all attempts to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law. That is the message we have for for Canadians and for anyone involved, so you're not open to him coming to Canada. We continue to recognize that it is a crime to travel, for the purpose of engaging in terrorist activities are very aware of the difficult situation in Hong Kong right now. We repeat our calls for peace for de-escalation, for listening by local authorities and by the Chinese government to the preoccupations expressed by the citizens of Hong Kong. There are 300,000 Canadian citizens in Hong Kong, it's the largest group of citizens of any country in Hong Kong right now, so we are very concerned about them. But we also are very concerned about human rights and freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and we are going to continue to a call upon the Chinese government to respect the one country, two systems' agreement, that they have long abided by.
