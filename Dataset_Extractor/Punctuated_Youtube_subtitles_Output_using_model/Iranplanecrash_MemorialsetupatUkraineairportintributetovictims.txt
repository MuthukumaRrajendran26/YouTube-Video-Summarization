The sweet smell of flowers walks through camps, International Airport. As soon as you walk in the front door, come from the departures zone. It hits you it is so beautiful, but then it turns in your gut in your head when you realize what this mountain really means: there's tributes and flowers and a lot of cards all in honor of the 176 people who were killed on board a flight that was supposed to land here, flight 752 was supposed to arrive on Wednesday, but instead people are coming here and laying flowers. Yesterday, Ukraine's president stopped by to add his bouquet of condolence. It was also a National Day of Mourning in this country. Instead of families embracing each other and gathering together, they are instead trying to figure out exactly what happened. People in Canada, Ukraine and many other countries are just reeling now. Once again, Iranian officials have said they did not fire any missiles. That goes against what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said, as well as other political officials. It has looked like that plane was shot down. Now. Our Ukrainian officials are on the way on the ground in Tehran, trying to figure out what happened. Canadian officials are also on their way, they've been invited, but what they'll find it's unclear because of the amount of time that has passed for now as people passed by and stopped to pay their respects. There is no doubting the amount of sorrow and pain being felt here. Crystal Manson, Global, News, Jeff.
