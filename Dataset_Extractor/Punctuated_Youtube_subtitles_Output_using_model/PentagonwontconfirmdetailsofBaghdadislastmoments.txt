Start with the second part, snow I can't tell you anything about what we took off the site. You'll appreciate that we're gonna exploit that, and we expect it to help us as we go forward so now about Baghdadi's last moments. I can tell you this. He crawled into a hole with two small children and blew himself up. I was while his people stayed on the grounds you can deduce what kind of person it is based on that activity. So that would be just my empirical observation of what he did I'm, not able to confirm anything else about his last second, so I just can't confirm that one way or another when capture at the hands of US forces was imminent, Baghdady detonated, a bomb he wore killing himself and two young children that were with him. The number two is a change. We originally thought there were three children with him, and this is the number we originally reported up the chain of command. We now know the number to be two based on subsequent debriefing. A total of six Isis members died on the objective. Four were women and there were two men, including Baghdady. This is in additional in addition to the two children killed by Baghdady, as he blew himself up. Let me emphasize again that 11 children were protected by the assault force and two men on the objective were detained by the assault force and they were extracted with the force.
