So the search for Ken, MacLeod and Breyers Miguel ski continues, and we can now confirm that there have been two established and corroborated sightings of the suspects in the Gilliam area. These sightings were prior to the discovery of the burnt-out vehicle. There have also been no reported stolen vehicles that could be attributed to the suspects at this point. In the investigation we believe they are still in the area.
