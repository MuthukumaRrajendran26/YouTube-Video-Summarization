Are you doing nice to see you see - so tell me why? No pun intended pun intended. Tell me why Backstreet Boys fans keep coming back for more I mean personally. I was 7 years old when I came to a first Backstreet Boys concert lost my mind and when I come, when I go to a show again as a 29 year, old I feel exactly the same. What is that? What is that power that you guys have over your fans? You know and I just hopefully say it's a testament to the great music that we've been able to be with some amazing writers, Max Martin, that's helped us create some of our biggest hits throughout the year and throughout the years, and also I think you know it's that I think, hopefully, that we bring these in our fans back to that moment, when they first heard that song and the memories that they created with us, whether it was their first kiss or their first love or whatever they were going through at that time and then, most importantly, maybe it's because there was a one guy in the group called Howie D. The Latin one in the group that makes it makes them really want to come playing games, and so nostalgia, of course, is what you're talking about you guys play a huge role in bringing back all those memories. Does it feel like the 90s or some like all of a sudden everywhere now, including with like the DNA, has done so well and I mean it hit number one and then the last time that happened was with black and blue in 2000. So do you feel that part of that success is because of this 90s nostalgia? That's coming back and targeting Millennials, absolutely after you have credit to this whole resurgence of 90s, music and and all the other artists that are out there doing very well as well. It's it's! It's awesome that our fans are now at that point where I don't know what they're, whether they're at the points in their lives, where they're just older now having kids wanted to get a you know a little mommy time away from the kids, and you know relive their teen years or whatever that was back in the 90s, but we're embracing it. We love it like I, say it's like you said it's it's. It's really helped us almost to a point. Have you know lightning strike in a bottle twice, which is amazing because a lot of artists, especially when they have success, that we were blessed with that magnitude trying to get that again twice is very hard and you know I think it's just we were able to even the highs and the lows of everything going on. We just carry that torch, hoping that one day we would get back up to where it is now and we were very blessed with a great song called, don't go breaking my heart, the first thing off the album and it's just a true testament to our fans. Just wanted to you know continue here in our music, and so when you look out into the crowd- and you see these people- you know maybe in their in their late 20s or their early 30s, even 40s and they're all there screaming your names. Those are the same people who were there as tweens and teens yeah. How do you feel when you see that it's amazing, it's very overwhelming, it's very flattering: I coined a phrase many years ago, keeping the Backstreet pride alive and our fans do that they come out and they are in that moment, even nowadays, they're they're, going back to their their teen years again, they're there, somehow in other their pitch of their voice, gets back up to that frequency. So how another, but they just are loving it and they just you know they give us the energy every night to perform these songs. We performed oMG thousands a times and it's through them that you know even when I'm out there, I'm, not I, don't have the energy to get on stage and really feel like I'm gonna, put on a great show, I just look out in the audience and I see their faces and they're glowing and they're just smiling and singing and dancing along. That's just an infectious energy that nobody can deny to want to put on a great show with absolutely well. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you great, seeing you as you're, seeing in Montana I love the shirt. Thank you.
