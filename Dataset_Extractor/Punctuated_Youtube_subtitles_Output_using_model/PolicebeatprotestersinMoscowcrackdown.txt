Protesters were beaten on the streets of Moscow on Saturday as police crackdown on an unauthorised protest. More than 600 were detained, an independent monitor said, as they called for free elections among the arrested prominent activists, liubov Sobel pulled from a taxi moments before the demonstration was due to start and bundled into a van she'd called on people to attend. The protest which authorities had warned was illegal. They say the timing and location of the demonstration had not been agreed in advance opposition activists say. Protests are repeatedly refused, leaving them no choice but to go ahead anyway. At a similar protest a week earlier, more than a thousand people were detained sometimes violently and to widespread international condemnation. The focus of the protesters anger is a ban on a number of opposition candidates from taking part in a September election. In Moscow, though, that vote is local. It's seen as a dry run for a national parliamentary poll in 2021. A number of the banned candidates are allies of jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny on Saturday Russian investigators, said they'd opened a criminal investigation into the alleged laundering of 1 billion, rubles or 15 point three million dollars by an anti-corruption foundation. He set up Navalny and his allies say. The foundation is transparently financed from public donations.
