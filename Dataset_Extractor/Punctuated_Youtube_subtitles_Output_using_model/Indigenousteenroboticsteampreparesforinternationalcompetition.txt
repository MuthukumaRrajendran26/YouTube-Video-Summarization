So the moving pieces- Quentin Norris, has found his passion. Two years ago. He had an opportunity to go to a special kind of science camp for indigenous kids around Alberta, it's basically taking indigenous kids from all across Alberta and bringing them all together for a week to teach them new stuff about science, technology, engineering and digis team is an Alberta nonprofit that works to help young indigenous people explore opportunities in science and technology. It didn't take long before Quintin was hooked, I just loved the way that you can just put a couple things onto a screen and cause something to move the 12 year old is the main coder for this in digits teams, Team Canada, a group that is now preparing for the biggest Robotics Competition of their life first global is an amazing program. It's really a program: that's the Olympics of stem the Calgary based tech company, Baker Hughes is helping the team, get ready, providing work, space and mentors, and a bit of sponsorship as well, but raising enough money to get every member to Dubai hasn't been easy and with a week to go, the team is short by a lot. I know we're looking at probably about $6,000 short of the entire team going. It means right now only about four of the team's members will be able to travel. Tristan Norris is one of the lucky four hoping to show other indigenous teens, but they can overcome any obstacle and do anything I think it's really special and I want all the kids to know that take take part of something as for Quintin he's, not sure. Yet, if he'll get to go trip or not, though, he's focused on bigger dreams to turn his newfound passion into a lifelong career. Heather, your ex West Global, News Calgary,.
