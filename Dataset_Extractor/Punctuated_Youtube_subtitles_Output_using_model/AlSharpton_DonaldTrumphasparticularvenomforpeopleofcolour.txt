Little did I know that mr. Trump was going to on the eve of this attack the congressman from this city and not only the congressman, but the people of this city in the most bigoted and racist way he attacks, everybody I, know Donald Trump he's not mature enough to take criticism. We can't help it he's like a child. Somebody say something: he reacts he's thin-skinned and not really mature that well, but he has a particular venom for blacks and people of color. He doesn't refer to any of his other opponents or critics as infested. He does not attack their districts. He attacks Nancy Pelosi attacks, Chuck Schumer, he attacks other whites, but he never said that their districts of their states are places that no human being wants to live. The fact of the matter is Elijah. Cummings district is the most well-educated and middle class aspiring district of blacks in this country, and he doesn't even know what he's talking about. Elijah Cummings is a respected and well regarded member of Congress and for him to be angry at mr. Cummings, because mr. Cummings has the moral standing to question how migrant children are being treated at the border is an abomination. To me.
