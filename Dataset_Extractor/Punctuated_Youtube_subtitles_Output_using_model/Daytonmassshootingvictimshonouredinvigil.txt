I brought ten white doves, one representing all the people that survived the other nine represents all the people. We lost I'm, going to release the first one now and if you want to film, get your camera's ready. This one represents all the people that survived and this kind of watch ourselves cuz they might get wild, but these nine represent the people we lost and I want you to cheer for them. I am so sorry that we are all gathered here tonight, but I am so grateful for the outpouring of support for the victims and their families. The Oregon district is usually a site of celebration. Not one of mourning I know that many of us are hurting right now and are uncertain of where we go from here. We have lots of challenging days ahead, but you know Dayton is fearless fearless I thought about that. As I watched, the video of our Dayton police officers running toward the gunman who was carrying it was carrying a weapon bigger and more powerful than their own I know. It may not feel like it right now, but I have seen so much fearlessness from our community in the last 20 hours and in the last several months we have confronted some of the toughest challenges any city could imagine and we stood tall in the face of all of them. So what we do tonight by this amazing crowd is to say to them that we love you. We care very, very deeply about you, everything that we can everything that we can. No you that we care, like Brandeis 26 years ago today lost our daughter. We understand about sudden yeah. We understand sad. That is so. Our heart goes out to the victims. Our heart goes out to the victims, families, we pray for you, and this great crowd represents this great community, letting them know how much we deeply care about them. Thank you very much.
