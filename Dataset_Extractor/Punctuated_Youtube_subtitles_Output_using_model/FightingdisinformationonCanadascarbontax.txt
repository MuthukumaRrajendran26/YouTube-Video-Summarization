There is no cheaper way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions other than carbon pricing. It relies on markets. It's flexible, carbon pricing is used in more than 50 countries around the world, but Canada's carbon tax imposed on several provinces last spring has proved a tough sell. This time go to your local gas station. First, the Conservatives just released this attack ad here, you'll pay 31 cents a litre more. It relies on misleading numbers based on a hypothetical scenario where a government relied solely on a carbon tax to reach Canada's emissions targets, something none of the parties is proposing Justin Trudeau. He costs you more. We also know that the overwhelming majority of Canadians are going to be worse off with this carbon tax, but in reality, around 80% of Canadians actually stand to make money from the tax. An average household in Manitoba, for example, can save around $100 through a government rebate. The important thing about this program is all the money gets rebated back to households and businesses. Several provinces are also fighting the carbon tax in court, Ontario's premier forcing gas stations to post these stickers on their pumps. The risk of a carbon tax recession is real, but economists say that's also untrue. A government report found the current carbon tax will have almost no impact on Canada's GDP growth by 2022. It's going to depress activity in industries that generate more carbon and it's going to help grow other sectors of the economy.
