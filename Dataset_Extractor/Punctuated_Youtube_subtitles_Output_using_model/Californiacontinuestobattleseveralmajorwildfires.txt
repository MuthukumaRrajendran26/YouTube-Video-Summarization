The fire exploded in Los Angeles, while most people were sleeping. It was really scary, because um I thought what, if the fire could catch on, our house and I could literally see the flames up in the sky, 10,000 homes and buildings, including the famous Getty Museum, are part of the initial evacuation zone in Southern California. The only thing you cannot replace is you and your family so get your loved ones your pets and get out already about a dozen homes have been destroyed or damaged. Interstate 405, the busiest Highway in the United States, was closed in one direction at one point, because flames were jumping the road classes at UCLA, canceled schools in Malibu and Santa Monica closed every resource is being thrown at these thirsty flames, but firefighters are getting whipped by hurricane-force winds. It's a dangerous season right now. The Santa Ana winds pick up historically in September and last through April. We have not had any significant rainfall for a period of time in Sonoma, County California's wine region. The erratic fire is getting the upper hand over the 4,000 firefighters involved in this fire fight. Any progress has gone backwards. In 24 hours, containment efforts went from 10% to just 5 to say that conditions are a tinderbox is probably an understatement, because when you put an offshore wind on it, it literally only takes one spark close to 200,000. People in this part of Northern California were told to get out driving through blowing embers. That can spark new fires. Let's get out of here, but some won't budge. I didn't want to take a chance on losing everything you know one guy came in. He was telling me to leave it's just hard. It's hard to leave. You know the state is calling the situation a red flag event. The wind may be dying down for now, but it'll pick up again this week, making it the enemy, Robin, Gill, Global, News,.
