I'm just wondering what you're going to be doing to support the youth that are suffering in the mental health epidemic. More of my friends than not through my entire life have been depressed, self-harming, severely, anxious, including myself and and suicidal, and I just want to know how the mental health system that you're talking about implementing will support the youth specifically. Thank you for thank you for raising that I'm. So sorry and please get the help that you need and don't be afraid to ask for that. That's exactly that's we're talking about 200 hours a week and how expensive it is. I'm, just yeah, just thinking about diamonds, makes me so sad to think about that young people here they care about you. No, no! It's! Okay! It's okay! We're here! For you, we care about you, these people care about you! Thank you. We, okay with it. We all care much in this room. Right I mean if there's any other reason I mean for our young people. We owe it to them. They you shouldn't be worried about this, like you should have to worry about it right. We're gonna make sure that is covered like so. We want to fund it as a part of our health care system, and that means with all the checks and balances you should get the care you need. Whenever you need it, you shouldn't have to worry about the cost. That's what we want to do, I want to bring it in I, want it to be funded, I, don't care what the cost is. I want to get. It done, I believe.
