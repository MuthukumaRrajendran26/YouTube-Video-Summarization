I have just spoken with Prime Minister Trudeau to congratulate him on winning the most seats. It hardly sounded like a concession speech. The day after Andrew Shearer doubled down putting Justin Trudeau on notice. We will be ready when the time comes and his government Falls to take the fight back to Justin Trudeau and give Canadians the government they deserve. The party did win the popular vote and the Conservatives did increase their seat total in the House of Commons. But how was sheared unable to unseat a prime minister who was facing the SNC lavell, a scandal, - violations of the ethics laws and the blackface brownface story? He dodged that question and promptly left. This is just the first step and the work starts immediately. The work starts today we're flying back to Ottawa with our team. We're gonna be going through what happened this campaign, we're gonna, be preparing the groundwork so that next time we're even stronger and we're ready to replace this Trudeau government. So is it very much everyone, but not even a quick follow-up, sir? Really a quick exit from the news conference as he starts the fight of his political life, the Conservative Party Constitution states. There is an automatic leadership review following an election loss. There will be a lot of discussion about Andrew, sheers future and see the person to carry the Conservatives through that's natural, but I think it's a discussion he wants to get ahead of. So after failing to convince Canadians that he would be the best person to lead this country. Shearer will now spend the next six months trying to convince conservative party members that he is still the best person to defeat Justin Trudeau.
