President Trump may have more pressing concerns. The timeline of the impeachment inquiry has speeded up. It could be over now by Christmas. Democrats are moving ahead at a rapid pace. Public hearings will start next week and so will a battle for public opinion. Our Washington bureau chief Jackson prosecco, joins me Jackson today. Testimony from another witness was revealed tell us about that. Yet, on a short time ago, the transcripts of the closed-door testimony of a top State Department official were released. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, told the inquiry he documented his concerns about Trump's pressure on Ukraine, noting he felt there was quote an effort to initiate politically motivated prosecutions that were injurious to the rule of law. This came after President trumps. Requests that Ukraine open investigations into Joe, Biden Kent's. Testimony corroborates that of nearly a dozen other witnesses and the original whistleblower complaint and Donna. It really goes to the heart of the whole impeachment inquiry, so that was a closed-door transcript. The public hearings start next week and then the whole country can watch all this unfold and tonight we're learning Jackson more about how the President himself tried to clear his own name. Yeah. That's right. The Washington Post reports that Trump pressured his own Attorney General William bar to hold a press conference and announced that the president had done nothing criminal in his dealings with Ukraine, Barr apparently refused, which is unusual because he's been so loyal to Trump so far. But the request also suggests the President may not fully understand the gravity of the impeachment process. Remember that articles of impeachment are actually decided upon by Congress and the president can still be impeached for acts that do not rise to the level of criminality, but are simply a breach of his or her duties in office.
