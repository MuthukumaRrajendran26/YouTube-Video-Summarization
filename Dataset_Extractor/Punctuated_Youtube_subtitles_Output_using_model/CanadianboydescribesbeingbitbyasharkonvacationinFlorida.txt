I didn't really know what's happening, I knew something bitten. You got the pleasure. It was really scary because it was I knew something bit me, but just the fear of not knowing what bitch you and what's give. What what's gonna happen to your foot after that is the scariest feeling that I think I've ever experienced I'm feeling fine now, but of course, when the shirt hit me, it wasn't fine I mean now I feel sis still feels numb, but other than that. There's nothing really going on I feel more lucky than unlucky. I know it it's a very low chance to get bit by a shirt, but to be in the condition. I am right now that is also very lucky.
