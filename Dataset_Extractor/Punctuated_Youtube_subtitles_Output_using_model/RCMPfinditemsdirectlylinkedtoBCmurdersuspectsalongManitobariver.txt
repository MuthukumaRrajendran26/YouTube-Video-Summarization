Not only was a boat found on the Nelson River police now say the suspects left behind even more clues. Several items were found on the shoreline and police believe they are directly linked to sir Miguel ski and McCloud that prompted an in-depth look from the RCMP s underwater recovery team on Sunday, but no more items linked to the suspects were uncovered since that search police had set up a roadblock close to where schmegle ski McLeod's, torched rav4 was found a couple of weeks ago and unlike check stops, roadblocks have been rare in this manhunt speaking to reporters in Ottawa Public, Safety, Minister, Ralph Goodale.
