It is with regret and surprise that I received the news that President Trump has cancelled. His state visit to Denmark on the 2nd and 3rd September I had been looking forward to the visit. Our preparations were well underway. It was an opportunity, I think, to celebrate Denmark's close relationship to to us and who remains one of Denmark's closest allies. I was looking forward to having a dialogue on the many shared interests the mukesh has with the u.s.. Furthermore, the developments in the Arctic region called for further cooperation between the u.s. and Greenland Faroe, Islands and Denmark, and therefore I would like to underline our invitation for stronger cooperation on Arctic Affairs skilled stance. A discussion has, however, been very reached about a potential sale of Greenland. This has clearly been rejected by Kim keelson, a position that I share. Of course, this does not change the character of our good relations, and we will, of course, from Denmark continue our ongoing dialogue with the US on how we can develop our cooperation and deal with the many common challenges we are facing.
