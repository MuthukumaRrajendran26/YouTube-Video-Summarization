President says he wants to help: does that come in the form of money, a visit? What would a visit look like if he, he, the president, is welcome in our district to go through the seventh congressional district and he will see strong people who are who get up and they go out to work on the early bus when I leave here home, usually at five o'clock in the morning, they're standing on the bus? Stop then sometimes that's him. At night, when I get back, you'll see people, you see, organizations that have come to the inner city of Baltimore like neighborhoods like this and did not ask the question did not go around criticizing, but they said how can we help and they have help and and so welcome to president I'd love to see it.
