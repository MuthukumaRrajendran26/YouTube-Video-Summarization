247 a day the fire department was dispatched. We reported fire in the church to see behind me after a short three minute response time. Our first arriving companies found a heavy fire showing from the rear of the church, and they immediately went to what we call a defensive operation or an exterior attack again heavy fire through the church. They did an incredible job, the first driving Battalion Chief and all the companies getting here and circling the church being able to get some heavy caliber water streams in place. You can see we have a lot of aerial master streams in place and that really is what's kept. Us has, let us hold this fire. It right now we're at two alarms and a little bit more than that two alarms what we call special calls. So two alarms- plus that's roughly you- know, 75 to 100, firefighters and 30 to 40 pieces of apparatus. We had reports immediately that all the occupants were out of the church. We did have I know one person in an adjacent occupancy who was transported but again this is still an active firefight and we'll be here. Certainly, all night we'll have firefighters here all night, but again just an incredible job by you, our Philadelphia Fire, Department, firefighters, paramedics and all the support partners out here. You.
