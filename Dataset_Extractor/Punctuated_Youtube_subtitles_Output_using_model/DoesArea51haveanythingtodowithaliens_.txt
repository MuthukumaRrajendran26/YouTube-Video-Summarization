Having an air force base in the middle of nowhere just adds to the mythology, you need a place of great secrecy area 51. There is an Air Force Base there. So you know it's really the best of all possible worlds. As far as you or follow G mythology is concerned, we love to think about things that we just don't know the answers to, but just because we don't know the answers to them does not mean that it has to be of an extraterrestrial origin. I, just am NOT of the view that we're harboring aliens, fugitives or otherwise at area 51, and neither do I think we are back Engineering, yeah, reverse engineering, alien technology. When was the last time you had an alien come to dinner, and that was anywhere on the plane. The answer is yeah, it hasn't happened. Finding an alien on this planet I think is highly highly unlikely.
