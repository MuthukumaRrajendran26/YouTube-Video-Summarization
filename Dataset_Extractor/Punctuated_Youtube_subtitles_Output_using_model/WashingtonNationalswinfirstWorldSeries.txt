The best moment is the moment of realization. It was a long time coming. There isn't a baseball fan around who didn't write off Washington's team last night last spring or any time. Over the last 95 years, the team's owner was born one year after Washington won its last World Series in 1924. What followed the old, Washington, Senators, World Series win, was almost a century of futility and disappointment, a team so bad a hit. Broadway musical and movie told the tale of a ball fan. Who would sell his soul to help Washington win when young luck is batting? Zero get Chuck chin up off the floor for Washington. It seems there were outs at every base in its history. The team left Washington for Minnesota in 1960. The new team still hapless lasted 11 years and moved to Texas. Washington would then go 33 years without a team until the Nationals in 2005 and even their home plate was out of reach for a team now forever linked to Washington's baseball history. The Montreal Expos Montreal too, had a long struggle to keep its team, and this fate would have it. The Expos moved to Washington for some the Nationals win is at best bittersweet Expos nation proclaimed indifference Congrats to them, but they're, not our team. Still. A comeback in sports is an uplifting story, a team that couldn't win a home game in the World Series, still won it all, and fans back in DC could celebrate at long last. Maybe Montreal will make a baseball comeback as improbable as Washington's one former Expo Dave Martinez eventually became the manager of the now World Series champs just to be a man who gets an opportunity to even play in the World Series and all now to win it. What an unbelievable feeling, a sport steeped in the memory of its past and a team that came to understand what it really takes to win and Broadway, knew it all along Eric, Sorensen, Global, News.
