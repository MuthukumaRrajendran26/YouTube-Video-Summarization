Hong Kong has just seen its darkest weekend in his contemporary history. We saw Kwai Fong station being turned into a gas chamber and protestors being pushed down a moving escalator by the police at iku, where they had also fired at the protesters within a meatus range of an airgun. The protesters are repeatedly being cold and treated like cockroaches by the police. Such dehumanization is a psychological manipulation that was once used by Hitler's regime to sanction and justify the genocide of the Jews, who were surely dehumanized by the Nazi. The police must put must be put under the investigation of Independence Committee immediately. The police are also suspected to have incited and committed violence and framing the protesters for these acts. It has been documented in life, videos that some policemen dressed up s-- protesters by putting on black tops and gas masks, have infiltrated the crowd. These Undercovers were also seen wearing earphones with which they might have communicated with their colleagues. I know, you're gonna fall digging, you know, I was in shock, so - so I see Ghana. So it's in danger, I'm motivated. What's he doing more data time, I killed? It can I see good yeah. We, like my God, we're gonna die tonight.
