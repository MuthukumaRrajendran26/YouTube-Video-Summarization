I can tell you that in the 2018-2019 school year our team assessed about three hundred and twenty-two thousand think about that. That's a really huge number three hundred and twenty-two thousand student immunization records and based on this assessment, I, can tell you that ninety-four percent of our seven to seventeen year olds in our school systems here in Toronto, were up-to-date for measles, mumps and rubella vaccinations and that about 1.7 percent. So just under two percent of the students in our system indicated that they had a philosophical or religious exemption and applied as such. In Toronto we've seen a slow but steady increase in student vaccine non-medical exemptions from 0.8% in 2016 to 1.7 percent this year. This trend is not unique to Toronto it's something that in fact has been seen throughout the province as a whole. So, to my mind, what does this mean? It means that we need to start having an evidence-informed conversation on this important issue. At what point at what point? Will this increasing rate of exemptions lead to an increasing number of onion eyes people and therefore lead to outbreaks? And at what point would we as a system both as public health providers and in concert with our health care system? At what point would we together need to act? We need to start with this conversation now, so that we don't find ourselves in a situation with several outbreaks that cause severe illness and children and contribute to added strain and ultimately cost to our healthcare system as a whole.
