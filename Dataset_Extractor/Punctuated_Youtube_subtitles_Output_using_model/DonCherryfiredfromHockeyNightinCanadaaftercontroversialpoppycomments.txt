You people love you, you they come here whatever it is. You love our way of life. You love our milk and honey. At least you could pay a couple of bucks for poppies or something like that. But I wanted to address what happened last night on Hockey Night in Canada, John Kerry made remarks which were hurtful discriminatory, which were flat-out wrong. We at Sports Net have apologized, it certainly doesn't stand for what Sports, Net or Rodgers represents. We know diversity as the strength of the country. We see it in the travels with our show and with Aki night in Canada. So I owe you an apology too. That's the big thing that I want to emphasize. I sat there. I did not catch, it did not respond. You.
