Our public health system was understaffed and under resourced and without intervention it could soon become overwhelmed, even as even as the market shifts from day to day, the coronavirus is slowing our economy to a near standstill and we're almost certainly anticipating a recession. I have never sensed a greater sense of under uncertainty, a greater fear of the future of the unknown. We don't know how long this crisis will. Last you don't even know if you've contract contracted the virus right away or maybe your spouse, maybe your child. Maybe your parent, the administration didn't pay attention to tests and now we're paying the price, even though many of us were hollering for weeks about the emerging issues with testing. Well the same problems about to happen with ventilators. We know that in two weeks the number of ventilators might become a massive problem. We must get ahead of it and get ahead of it. Now I'm calling on President Trump to use his existing authority to help address the widespread shortages of medical equipment, particularly ventilators. As a result of the kovat 19 outbreak, I joined 27 of my colleagues in a letter to President Trump, urging Tim to invoke the defensive defense production Act of 1950, which authorizes the President to strengthen domestic manufacturing capacity and supply in extraordinary circumstances. It's used in times of war. Well, we must mobilize as if it were a time of war when it comes to hospitals, beds, supplies equipment.
