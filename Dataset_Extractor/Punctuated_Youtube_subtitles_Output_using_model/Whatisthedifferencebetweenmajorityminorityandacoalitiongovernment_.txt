In Canada, the party which wins the most seeds forms the government pretty straightforward, and if a party ends up with more than half of the seats in the House of Commons, it's known as a majority government and has control over the house. But if the party which wins the most seats still has fewer than half of the total seats, it is likely to form a minority government. This can be tough because it means the combined seats held by opposition parties is more than the party which won and can block bills from passing and becoming law. In order to stop that, you can sometimes have the government join forces with another party in the house to obtain an absolute majority. That's known as a coalition under this type of alliance, two or more political parties enter into a formal agreement to form the government together.
