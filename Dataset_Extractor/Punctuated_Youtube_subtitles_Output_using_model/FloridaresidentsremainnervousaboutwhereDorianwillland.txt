Well, Florida residents are still incredibly nervous about where durian might land if it makes landfall at all overnight, the model suggested it may stay out to see or buzz along the entire coast. It's also gaining strength with winds now over 230 kilometres per hour. What that means for vacationers is that many of them cancelled their plans on the busy holiday weekend, a few surfers out enjoying the bigger than usual waves this morning. But for the most part the beaches are empty. Many people simply stayed home or they're now eating the evacuation orders, which have come into effect for places here like Cocoa Beach, where the hurricane storm shutters are also now going up along many of the hotels here along the beach, as I mentioned. There are evacuation orders in place for some of these outlying islands, specifically where we are people have been told they have to be out by Sunday, especially if they're in a mobile home or if they have a disability. Other areas taking much more of a wait-and-see attitude, though at this point, because Dorian's path is so uncertain. At the same time, we're seeing shortages of food and fuel, approximately 50% of the gas stations along the East Coast, have now run dry for Florida's governor says that police escorts will be guiding fuel tankers to some of those stations to try and resupply them, but the bottom line is this: storm is slowing down as its path changes. That means we're talking about days and days of uncertainty and days and days where residents will continue to make preparations and continue to make a run on supplies.
