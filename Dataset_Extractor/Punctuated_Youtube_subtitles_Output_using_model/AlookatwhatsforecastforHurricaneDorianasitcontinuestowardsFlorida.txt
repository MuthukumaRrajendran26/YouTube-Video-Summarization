Hurricane durian remains an incredibly powerful category. Five storm winds, close to 300 km/h when it made landfall in the northern Bahamas, making it the second strongest Atlantic hurricane to make landfall, and that's going back several decades. So this is a formidable storm. The big question is: where do we go from here? Florida well, getting awfully close to the center of these strongest winds, and we are expecting this storm to crawl over the next couple of days and eventually make a right turn to the north when that occurs. Well, the difference between 10 to 20 kilometers could be the difference between tropical storm force, winds or perhaps much more on that populated Florida coastline. A lot of lightning you're, not gonna, see a better developed storm, a better cloud presentation from space. These are the strongest winds. The highest cloud tops right around the eye and places like Marsh Harbor, complete destruction from the videos we've seen so far. Now the back edge is moving through of this category 5, it is going to weaken, it'll be slow because the water is warm, but as it weakens, the wind field expands, so Georgia, South, Carolina and North Carolina could feel effects by early next week and then perhaps Atlantic Canada. The big steering current so far has been this Bermuda high. It has helped this system go west, as the high weakens we start to see. This trough set up, there's also another high back towards the western US, but this is what we care most about this weakness in the big ridge and that's going to basically collapse the steering current, so the system crawls and then it starts to move north as it gains latitude. It gets picked up by the Jetstream and I am expecting a close call with the Carolinas and perhaps direct effects on Atlantic Canada, but not until next weekend. That's the latest on Hurricane Dorian.
