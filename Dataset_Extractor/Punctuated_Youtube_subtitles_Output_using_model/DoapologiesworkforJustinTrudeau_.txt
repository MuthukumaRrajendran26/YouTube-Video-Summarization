When it comes to apologies, Trudeau is the king I apologize saying that we are sorry today is not enough. Most recently, he apologized for his makeup in this footage that surfaced during his campaign and his reaction was well. You guessed it. I am deeply sorry and I apologize, but can apologizing actually help dig someone out of a political hole. 100% of the time every apology is deemed to have been mishandled. That is what we're dealing with with Twitter culture that no matter what you do. There is no way anybody will be satisfied with it, like the Twitterverse usually does. It has already turned Trudeau's apology on its head, like this guy saying he dressed up like 2001, Trudeau and I. Now apologize for the footage of Trudeau, he apologized, not just during this presser but the day before now, I recognize it was something racist to do and I am deeply. Sorry, there's no question that he needed to apologize. The question is whether or not there is any benefit to apologizing 72 times versus 68 times, no matter how you say it a sorry can only go so far.
