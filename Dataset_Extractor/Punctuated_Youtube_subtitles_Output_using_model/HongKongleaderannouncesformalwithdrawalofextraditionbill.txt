This high profile activist is calling for protests to continue Beijing and Chinese authorities just try to stop our protest by announcing such withdraw withdrawal of bill. Nobody sees a short-term fix to this from Beijing's perspective. There they're playing a long game, Hong Kong, watcher, Jeffrey Reeves, says pulling. The bill was an important step, and while it's too early to know whether this will stop or bolster protests, there is a chance. Lam's address could turn public opinion against the protesters. The fact that Carrie Lam has come forward and formally canceled this extradition bill could actually bring some of the more moderates in Hong Kong over to the government side.

While the extradition bill was the headline for protesters there, other demands carry a lot of weight: universal suffrage, amnesty for the more than 1,100 people arrested and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality. If the other four demands have not been addressed to the anger will still be there and the people will go on protesting. Activists are calling for the protests to continue until at least October.
