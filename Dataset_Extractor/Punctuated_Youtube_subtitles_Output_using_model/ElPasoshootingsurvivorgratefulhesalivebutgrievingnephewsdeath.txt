Mobility can't be realized until doctor or gets his work done so I'm very proud of the team that took care of Octavio everybody that was involved in his care. Well, I took him to the room. I want to take him to the or my manager was a child pulled on to where I was. He said what I mean I'm only here. He said where I pulled him back with me. He came. The shooter came as he heard us. He shot him when I looked up when he was there. He looked at him as well and he didn't turn to look at me and I heard the gunshots when we aim and if we're in line to open a bank account, we saw people running and I grabbed him by the handle, because I, okay, so I grabbed him and shots were fired. So I took him to the back room, the bed and well, everything happened. Then fu and while I was trying to like crawl back to where it was hiding, he shot running foot and like I, say he should easily shot me, but he did. I did lose my nephew right in front of me. I'll put the details, but it was horrible image and I hope. Nobody ever goes to three people and I just hope that my family and I get better emotionally. This is this pig would only can I one end. Is the emotional I just feel grateful that I'm alive? He had the chance to kill me, but he didn't.
