The eyes to the right 322 the nose to the left 306. Thank you, the eyes to the right, 322, the nose to the left 306. So the eyes have it the eyes have it unlocked. But the question is colleagues that the motion as amended be agreed to us. When is other abilities, a I love the country now I think the eyes of it. The eyes have it, but we now come to motion number two: our man, the house, that I'm selecting the manuscript amendment to the name of Peter, Carlisle, others, Minister or whip on duty to milk, normally not moved. Thank you order order. The Prime Minister speak um. Thank you. I'm very grateful to you I'm, very grateful to every between the House of Commons staff. Everybody who's put themselves out. Everybody who's come to give up their time in this debate. Today it's been a very important debate and exceptional moment for our country, except a moment for our Parliament. Alas, the opportunity to have a meaningful vote has effectively been passed up because the meaningful vote has been voided of meaning, but I wish the house to know that I'm, not daunted or dismayed by this particular result. It probably became likely once it was obvious that the amendment for me, my right, honourable friend, the member of West Dorset, was going to remain on the order paper. I continued in the very strong belief that the best thing for the UK and for the whole of Europe is for us to leave with this new deal on October to anticipate the questions that are coming from their benches of it. I will not negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so. I will tell our friends and colleagues in the EU exactly what I have told everyone in the last 88 days that I've served as Prime Minister, but further than they would be bad for this country, bad for democracy. So next week the government will introduce the legislation needed for us to leave the EU with our new deal on October. The 30-person I hope I hope that our European Union colleagues and friends will not be attracted as benches opposite are, or rather I should say. The front bench is by delay. I, don't think that they will be attracted by the way and I hope that then honourable members, faced with a choice of our new deal, our new deal for the UK and the European Union will change their minds because it was pretty close today. I hope that they will change. I hope that they will change their minds and support this deal in overwhelming numbers. Since I became Prime, Minister I've said we must get on and get brexit done on, October the 31st, so that this country can move on mr. speaker that policy. That policy remains unchanged. No delays and I will continue to do all I can to get brexit done on October. The 31st and I continue to commend this excellent deal. Mr. speaker to the house.
