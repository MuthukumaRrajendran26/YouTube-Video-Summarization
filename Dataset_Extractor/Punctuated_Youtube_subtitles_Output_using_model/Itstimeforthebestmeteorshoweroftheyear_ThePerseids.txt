It's time for the best meteor shower of the year, the Perseids- you may not realize this, but we get meteor showers as a result of comments. Comments like planets orbit the Sun as they do. This gas and dust are lost from the comet escaping into space, giving it its tail as Earth orbits the Sun. It intersects the path of a comet. In the case of the Perseids we pass through 109 P Swift Tuttle's orbit. This comet has an orbital period of a hundred and thirty three years, but the debris hangs around space for a long time now, because earth is orbiting, the Sun at a speed, 180,000 km/h it plows into the debris which in turn, burns up in our atmosphere producing the lovely meteors. We see.
