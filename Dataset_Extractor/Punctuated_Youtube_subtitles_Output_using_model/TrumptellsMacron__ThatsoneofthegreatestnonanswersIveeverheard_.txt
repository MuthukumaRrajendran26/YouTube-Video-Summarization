Well, I haven't asked that to the president. Today we have a tremendous amount of captured fighters, isis fighters over in syria and they're all under lock and key, but many of them friends many are from Germany many of them UK they're, mostly from Europe and some of the countries are agreeing I have not spoken to the president about that very large number of Fighters. You have underground fighters coming from Syria from Iraq, and originally you have foreign fighters coming from Europe, but this is a tiny minority of the audible or where we have in the region and I think number-one priority, because it's not yet finished. If you get rid of Isis and sisters. This is our number one priority and it's not yet done I'm. Sorry to say that, yes, you still have fighters in this region in Syria and now in Iraq, and more and more, every nation of the region makes the situation more difficult to face the situation against Isis. Secondly, some of these foreign fighters are being killed in Iraq because of the deeds. Precisely we have American approach for children or any of the models, and we would have a case-by-case approach. But for me it's a very first objective is a regimen is to finish war against Isis and and don't make any mistake. You're number one of them are not the foreign fighters. This is the Isis fighters and you'll have more more despite us due to the secretion today. This is why he's a great politician, because that was one of the greatest non-answers I've ever heard, and that's okay.
