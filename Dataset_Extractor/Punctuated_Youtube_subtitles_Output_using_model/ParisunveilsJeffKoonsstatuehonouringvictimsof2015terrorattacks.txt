Oh yeah I did as a citizen in New, York experience, 9/11 and the depression that hung over the city. It. It really took years for the city to be able to come to life again, and we do have to find a way into the future. We have to be able to have a life for our children and the terrible loss that the victims and their families have to find a way forward, and so to show this solidarity that we are there for them and, let's find a way together for.
