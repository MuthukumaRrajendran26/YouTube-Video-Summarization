A turret once man by armed guards is now only filled with tourists. There are 50 residents in one pub in mid Laroy Germany, yet the tiny town was once split down the middle by the Berlin Wall. It still remains as a tourist destination, but also a reminder of what was and what could be again in Berlin. The ceremonies to mark the 30th anniversary of the fall of the wall were somber, avoiding talking Oh, November 9th, it said German, Chancellor, Angela Merkel is a day of fate in German history growing up on the east side of the wall. She remembers it well, but November 9th also marks crystal nach the Nazi fueled anti-jewish riots of 1938, Ottawa resident friedrich, dem key lived, 500 meters from the wall in East Germany. He remembers the day it came down and how he was able to walk past the fearsome guards that protected it and they were like standing there completely undecide disturbed silent, weird that that that these faces of yes, they all of a sudden. They were history, and- and that was clear to me at the moment that once you open that thing, you'll never be able to close it again, but the fear of societal walls going up is still very real. In Europe, migrants continue to stream into the EU, and while many countries have closed their borders, Germany has been a leader in finding solutions. In Washington, a large piece of the original Berlin wall was delivered to the White House. It wasn't accepted, but it didn't need to be for the point to be made. So this wall is not a statement against any specific wall. It's more like a general statements against walls and our society's physical walls like this piece of Berlin wall, but also like walls in the people's minds. Walls that divide societies. This anniversary is one for Germans to reflect and for the rest of the world to take notice might relate Global, News, Toronto.
