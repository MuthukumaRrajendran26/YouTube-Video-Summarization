Boris Johnson arrived back from the UN in New York early to face a resumed, Parliament seething with anger, but first up was the Attorney General who faced angry questions and accusations like this hundred coming here with these barristers bluster a party like this and a leader like this, this prime minister to talk about. Then the prime minister arrived to the baying benches. He again said he disagreed with the Supreme Court decision to nullify his prorogation before challenging the opposition to trigger an election. They have until the house rises today to table a motion of no confidence in the government. Opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, says he won't do so until Johnson strikes a deal with the EU or delays breakfast. The latter is something the Prime Minister says he will never do. He says he wants a general election get an extension. Korban is hugely divisive - even within his own party. So one extraordinary outcome to all of this could be the opposition taking control of governments with a more neutral prime minister in charge temporarily and then an election before the end of the year. And tonight, when Bryan Minister Boris Johnson was asked if he would prorogue for a second time he refused to answer.
