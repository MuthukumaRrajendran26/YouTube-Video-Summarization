We are seeking monetary damages for the wrongful death of Brian and we are seeking a court order requiring sheriff dueling to immediately make changes to make sure this type of thing never happens again. We have alleged that the Hartman County Jail engaged in unconstitutional practices in July of 2018 and we're concerned that they have continued to engage in those practices to this very day. Brian Lawler's death should never have happened and would not have happened, but for these constitutional violations we went there, basically with the intention of bailing Brian out and after meeting with sheriff Doolin and bringing Brian in to the meeting with us. He convinced us that that Brian had a problem and that they would help him deal with it, and if we left him there I'll never forget his exact words. He looked me right in the eyes and said: I can promise you this I'll keep personally keep an eye out on Brian will take care of Brian, and the last thing he said was here: Brian will be safe, I'm, just I was in shock and I'm. Just staring at Brian's body and I took a picture of Brian and I I texted it to chef, Doolin and I said. Remember when you told me that Brian would be safe, I believed you and I said him that did he ever respond to that he sent he sent Becca forward response. He said I'm, sorry for your loss, we're a grieving family and we're sticking together trying to help each one get through each day and if we can prevent another family from going through what we have culture for the past year. That's what we would like to see happen. This shouldn't have happened.
