It's not easy getting to the Abaco Islands or a grand Bahamas to see the full devastation of Hurricane durian. We found a flight. That's why we're leaving here 7:00 a.m. on the ground. It's not a very pretty picture. Everything is flat and the storm surge came right through here in Marsh, Harbor 15 to 20 feet high over here is the liquor store, there's a boat on top of it. The building is flattened and to rebuild is going to be a problem, because this here is the hardware store. This is where they would gotten all of their supplies. This was the waterway, where a lot of people with a lot of money brought their catamarans and million-dollar boats for safe keeping during the storm. As you can tell they're, not there anymore, there's one and there is a lot more catamarans as far as the eye can see, they're in the woods, they're cross the highway and they're flipped over it's unbelievable. This is the last stop of the line, the airport, where they've gathered for days, some of them hoping to get off. Finally, almost a week after this storm a hit, there is some organization planes are leaving and the hope the belief is that at least all of these people we're just about to get hot meals. For the first time in days, we'll get to Nassau the Bahamas, where you'll have to try to figure out the next stage in their lives.
