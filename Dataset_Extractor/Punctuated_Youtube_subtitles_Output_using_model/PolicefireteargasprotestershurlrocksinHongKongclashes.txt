Tear gas on the streets of Hong Kong Saturday as thousands of activists defied a policeman and demonstrated against last weekend's mob attack on protesters and commuters at a train station in yunnan police had refused to allow the march on safety grounds, but protesters pushed ahead. Having criticised the police for failing to protect the public from the attack by suspected members of the city's shadowy criminal network, known as the Triads, the cooperation between them and that games- and you know local games- they are using parlance to attack locals in Hong. Kong is definitely frighten. Our own safety and I'm excited a local. You know residents here so like we don't know, sir. We know except the cooperation between them. What began as a peaceful protest, soon grew increasingly tense, rocks and bottles were thrown at police by protesters and riot police stormed a pedestrian bridge. Last Sunday around 100 club wielding men burst into the Nong Station hours after protesters had marched through Central Hong Kong and to face china's liaison office. The suspected gang members attacked protesters passes by journalists and lawmakers, leaving 45 people injured. One critically protesters accused the police of being slow to respond to the attack. They became a focus for this March. The eun-jung attack and the vandalism at the liaison office marked new fronts in a protest movement that is intensified over the last two months. What started out as a call to scrap a controversial extradition bill has morphed into demands for independent inquiries into the use of police force, the resignation of Hong Kong leader, Carrie, Lam, and full democratic reform.
