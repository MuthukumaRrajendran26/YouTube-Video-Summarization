Residents in Florida are now watching Dorian very nervously with that storm stalled over the Bahamas they're waiting to see when it makes the turn north a turn. That's going to determine what kind of impacts they see here along the coast here in Daytona, Beach, there's already a mandatory evacuation order in effect, and it's underway right now and as you look out the water, you can see why you can see those waves getting bigger and the wind's getting stronger, but the main impacts of the storm on this part of the Florida coast will likely not be felt until late Tuesday or early Wednesday they're still forecasting, though wind gusts that could have seed 150 kilometres per hour. Even if the storm stays offshore utility crews from across the US are already moving into the area getting in place early to respond to potential power outages. The last major hurricane here, herma left seven and a half million people in the dark. Nobody wants to see a repeat of that right. Now, it's a game of inches. Any slight deviation in the storm's path will have a major impact on how it impacts. Florida Jackson Cross Co, Global, News, Daytona Beach.
