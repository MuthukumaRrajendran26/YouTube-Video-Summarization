They're both incompetent, both Justin Trudeau and Doug, Ford, a comparison, that's music to the Liberals ears, the Trudeau isn't running against Ontario Premier Doug Ford, at least not on the ballot and Russia I've heard his name before I. Just don't really know who he is. The federal Conservative leader may lack name recognition, while his provincial counterpart is well-known and increasingly disliked I think that Court is doing a lot of damage. Although his party won a large number of seats in the 905 area, since that victory is popularity has plummeted. Ah, just a lot of the like educational cards and the fact that he doesn't support it like safe injection, sighs. The suburban areas that surround Toronto, known as the 905 are critical for both liberals and conservatives and Hershiser is on his third day in the GTA, with no sign of Ford at a single event in Ontario is your bigger barrier to success, Justin, Trudeau or Doug Ford. The barrier to the success of the people of Ontario is Justin Trudeau, so avoiding the question but political scientist, Nelson Weisman, says voters will know the difference on Election. Day people will get a clear idea that the choice is between Trudeau and Shearer. It's not between Trudeau and Doug Ford. Behind the scenes, a conservative campaign source acknowledges, the Ford factor is definitely real and a real concern saying they plan to counter it by focusing on their own message and the Conservatives are confident. The federal election campaign will block out all the noise of whatever's happening on the provincial stage. Abigail Beeman Global, News, Etobicoke Ontario.
