Next week we will formally stand up the new, unified combatant command, be known as the United States Space Command, for the sake of our security, both here on earth and in the heavens above at president Trump's direction. We are working with Congress as we speak to stand up a new branch of our armed forces and soon Congress will approve, and the president will sign the sixth branch of the Armed Forces of the United States, the United States space force. As the president has said, we all recognize it's been frankly true for decades. In his word, space is a war fighting domain. The United States space force will ensure our nation is prepared to defend our people, to defend our interests and defend our values. Earlier this year, President Trump made it the policy of this administration to return to the moon by 2024 and ensure that the next man and the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts. Using what we learn on the moon will bring us closer to the day, as the president said, that American astronauts will plant the Stars and Stripes on the surface of Mars.
