Wrong to be putting pressure on the NBA, sir well, the NBA is a different thing. I mean I watch this guy Steve Kerr and he was like a little boy. He was so scared to be even answering the question. He couldn't answer the question he was shaking. Oh, oh I, don't know, I, don't know he didn't know how to answer the question and he'll talk about the United States very badly. I watched, Popovich sort of the same thing, but he didn't look quite as scared actually, but they talked badly about the United States. But when it talks about China, they don't want to say anything. Bad I thought it was pretty sad. Actually it'll be it'll, be very it'll. Be very interesting. Excuse me, are you okay, then, with the Chinese government, pressuring the NBA over Hong Kong, they have to work out their own situation. Mb is they know what they're doing but I watch the way that, like Kerr Popovich and some of the others were pandering to China and yet to our own country? They don't it's like. They don't respect it. It's like they don't respect. It. I said what a difference? Isn't it sad? It's very sad to me. It's very sad.
