I know acting secretary Kevin Magdalenian was on a network saying that they don't have the resources to fight white supremacy, but this you know they need more, but this president is calling out all forms of who who did that about an hour or so ago. You were all there or covered it. Certainly he's calling up white supremacist. He did two days ago and Tifa anti-semitism, racism, bigotry, evil hatred, he's speaking to a nation about all this and trying to unify and Heil taking concrete steps, and his political opponents are talking about him. So the president is the one. Two days ago in his address to the nation, he talked about the red flag walls. We already have 17 states in DC that have them in place, so there is a public appetite they work in certain states. We know that chairman Graham and senator Blumenthal in a bipartisan fashion are looking at that or preparing that the president is open to that. It's pretty rough stuff, people being threatened online, private citizens who are exercising their First Amendment right to free speech by donating to the candidate of their choice and then being doxed by a member of Congress who is making them is basically putting out a target list. So all of this needs to stop my boss and our president is trying to turn down the temperature and do that, but he's not being met by the crazies. On the other side.
