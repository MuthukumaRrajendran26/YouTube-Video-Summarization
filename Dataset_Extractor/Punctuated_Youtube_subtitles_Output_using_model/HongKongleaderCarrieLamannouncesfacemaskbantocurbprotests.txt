As the current situation has clearly given rise to a state of serious public danger, the chief executive in council decided at a special meeting this morning to invoke the power under the emergency regulations ordinance and make a new regulation in the name of prohibition or face covering regulation, which is essentially an anti mask law. It is essential for us to stop violence and restore calmness in society as soon as possible. We hope that the new legislation can help us to achieve this objective. This regulation targets riotous or those resort to violence. That's why the regulation contains defense and exemptions to cater for legitimate needs to wear a mask and belief. We believe that by so doing, we have struck the necessary balance.
