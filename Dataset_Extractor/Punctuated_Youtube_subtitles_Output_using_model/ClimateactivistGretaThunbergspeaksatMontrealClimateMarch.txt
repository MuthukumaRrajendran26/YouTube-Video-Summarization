Hi everyone I'm looking very much forward to today so today there's another global climate strike and it is very exciting to see the pictures and videos from all around the world and to hear from everyone who has been organizing the local strikes that it has been. The strikes have been very successful today and I. Think. Is it too early yet to have any official numbers but I guess we will have to see how many turned out so so yeah I, don't have anything prepared, just I'm very excited to be here, and it is going to be very much fun today and to once again stand together, people from all around the world for one common, because that is very empowering and it is very moving to see everyone. Everyone who is so passionate to to march and strike people of all ages, all generations, so yeah, it is very, is a very good day. I would say. Thank you very much. Brenner.
