Newlyweds yeah: congratulations! When when did you get married last night yesterday around noon, it did you know that there was a hurricane. Oh, we didn't meet year and a half ago when we started planning it, but as the week went on, we were watching it and we were supposed to get married at 5:30. Then it got bumped up to three and then noon two hours and did did your guests show up? How did it go? Awesome, yeah I'm surprised how well it went actually yeah everybody. Everybody showed up, yeah, okay, another question: what are you doing here right now, so not to say it ruined our day, but it definitely dampened a few things so we're just taking some memorable pictures durian. Does that name going to be maybe a kid's name in the future? No, we don't want to hear that name after today,.
