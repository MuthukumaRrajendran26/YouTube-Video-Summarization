Leave you without talking fashion best at worst when it comes to fashion. For me, there were two best zendaya crushed the carpet in this emerald: green satin outfit with the boning she had red hair. She shot that carpet down. On top of that Emilia Clarke looked impeccably tailored in her blue outfit and worse for me, was Zoe Kazan, who is a lovely and talented girl who, for some reason wore a buncha bows, yeah I I. Don't all right! Yeah max best I mean I like to diet as well: I, actually loved Lilly, Singh I loved the entire cast of shits Creek I, liked that we saw some got a Constantine on Amy Poehler and on Catherine O'hara. That's Canadian designers on to be actors. But can we talk worse because it's more fun so I think Gwyneth Paltrow had the slowest dress yesterday, because it took her 45 minutes to cross the stage in a kind of ill-fitting and not terrifically tailored dress, and you sort of wonder with Gwyneth is: did she intentionally wear something that would slow down her movement? So she could have all that time on camera. It has the one that's the big soiree and follow them on instagram at sparks Mickey at max Valiquette Vicki at max. Thank you both. So much we're right back after break here. The morning show.
