This is probably the most sudden and worst day of my life to address the beam in people and I just want to say that as a physician, I've been trained to withstand many things, but never anything like this. We're facing a hurricane hurricane durian that one that we've never seen in the history of Bahamas many had remained behind and still there are individuals within the western area who had who still refused to leave. I can only say to them that I hope this is not the last time they will hear my voice and may God be with them. I can say that the mash harbor our mash, our area of Abaco parts of it is already under water and some areas. You cannot tell the difference as to the beginning of the street versus where the ocean begins and they have not yet been hit by the brunt of the storm.
