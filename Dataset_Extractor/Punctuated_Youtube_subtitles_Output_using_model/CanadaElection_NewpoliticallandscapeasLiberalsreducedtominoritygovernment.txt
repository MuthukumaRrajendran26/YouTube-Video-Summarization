And Canadians didn't completely give up on Justin Trudeau the Liberals lost their 177 seat majority dipping to a 157 seat minority and even though they won more seats than the Conservatives, they lost the popular vote, but you wouldn't know it from Trudeau's victory speech back to Ottawa with a clear mandate. Parliament goes back more politically fractured and parties will need to work together to get anything done to the leaders of the other parties and their families. Thank you for being a part of this essential exercise and democracy, but Trudeau not only didn't mention those other leaders by name but we're all mystified here, because Justin Trudeau has walked up on the stage and begun to speak at the same time as Andrew Shearer, leaving all of us wondering who we should listen to and we started his speech when Conservative leader, Andrew Shearer, was still speaking. Breaking with convention, the Liberals had a few star candidate wins environmentalist Stephen kilvo in Quebec, an Olympic kayaker, adam vancouver dan, in a huge upset in ontario, defeating conservative Lisa Raitt. Well. The main reason that I got involved with Liberal Party is to make sure the Liberal Party got elected the Liberals lost seats in Atlantic, Canada, Quebec NBC and were wiped out in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Most shocking was the loss of Regina cabinet minister Ralph Goodale, a liberal whose weathered at all Liberal leader, Ralph Goodale, was the only group to win a seat first elected in 1974, and so the democratic process moves forward and pages are turned things. Change and people go forward. The democratic process works and the people are always right. How Trudeau actually moves forward with this mandate is the biggest question of all. Unlike Andrew Shearer and jug mate Singh. He did not hold a news conference today to outline his plans. Trudeau speaks in Ottawa tomorrow afternoon.
