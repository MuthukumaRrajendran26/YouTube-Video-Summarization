Let us keep silent and remember the Mayor of London. Thank you. We come together this morning as Londoners to remember, to honor and to mourn the innocent lives lost as a result of the horrific terrorist attack. This Friday, our thoughts and prayers, are with the families of Jack, Merritt and Saskia Jones, and all those injured or affected by the attack on Friday the best way to defeat this hatred, it's not by turning on one another, but it's by focusing on the values that bind us to take hope from the heroism of ordinary Londoners and emergency services who ran towards danger, risking their lives to help people. They didn't even know, and it's also by drawing inspiration from the lives of Jack and Saskia, who, from an early age, chose to dedicate themselves to helping others. So, yes, we come together this morning in condolences, but also in a spirit of defiance to say that London will never be cowered or intimidated by terrorism and also to commit to honour, in the memory of Saskia and Jack, by dedicating that future to one not defined by hatred. But one defined by hope by unity and by love.
