A mixture of elegance and ferocity, that's how Jacqueline du prais playing of the cello was once categorized. The story of her multiple sclerosis diagnosis at 26 share through dance will be familiar to many with the disease. It began with numbness and unexplained sensations. So I started to dream up this story, which is about her it's to some extent a biographical work, but it's very much focused on the love affair that she had with music and I liked. The idea of personifying music and the cello by using a male dancer in that role. There's a neck of the cello there's a body of the cello Kathy Marston got the idea for the cellist from her sister, a music teacher Duprey was a young English musical icon. I really wanted to take care. That I was portraying the illness with as much sensitivity and poetry as poses as I, possibly could la explores the height that she flew to, and then it sort of the loss of her voice. Ms often strikes people early in life. Women are diagnosed more than men, there's no cure, and for some it can take a devastating toll. There's no telling what what the future holds. Some people will lose mobility. Some people won't that the path is very different. So it's a it's a really interesting way to tell the story through movement, I think a very powerful one. Duprey had relapsing remitting, ms, it crept her her fingers and eventually she was confined to a wheelchair. She died at 42. The Royal Opera House in London has partnered with cinemas around the world to broadcast the cellist. So far, only two small Canadian theatres are slated to run it one NBC, the other in Ontario I, think it is an emotional work and it's it's heartbreaking, but it's not tragic. We should be celebrating the life force of Jackie as much as the loss of her talent. Marsten's mum also has MS. She hopes the ballet will raise awareness while bringing people a little joy.
