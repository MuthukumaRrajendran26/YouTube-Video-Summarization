I think before accusing protesters for anything try to look at the real problem and how the government turning how they turn my nine students and to our demons. This is a real problem, the source of the problem. We are trying to solve the problem that they are trying to solve, they're trying to attack us or trying to just turn a blind eye to us, and it doesn't help we are just trying to fight for what we already have. What hong kong is. We just want someone to stay Hong Kong. We are not demanding for something else or something extra yeah. That's it if all our ways always put our peaceful way. It's not answer that by the doctor. Man I've been there most of our fourth. Also a Podesta may go of more foreign voices of all the ways to to let the first government to answer our first. Our request.
