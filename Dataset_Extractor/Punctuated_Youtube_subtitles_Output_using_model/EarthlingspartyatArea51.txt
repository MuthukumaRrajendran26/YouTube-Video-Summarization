We came out to see kind of the dumb people make a run for it, I, like my freedom inside six months in federal prison and that doesn't sound like a good time. Why would you ever miss this? A bunch of random people in weird costumes, standing outside of a government base? Why would you want to miss that? That's that's! A one lifetime experience! It's like it's hot Halloween, but we're just annoying people. It's been fun everything so welcoming and nice we got to meet new people, law enforcement. You know they're here to do their job and they're. Really nice and friendly, come on Pete I, don't know how else to explain it to you but I. Think if you witnesses you, you will believe, there's stuff out there, that's incredible that you wouldn't believe it unless you saw it for yourself and I'm a believer. There are aliens I, don't know what you're talking.
