You've got a lively reception here from the Luxembourgers and then cancelled your press conference. Well, I. Don't think it would have been fair to the prime minister of Luxembourg to I think there was clearly gonna be a lot of noise and I think we might have been drowned I over the last couple of weeks. There's been a lot of work papers have been shared, but we are now in the stage where we have to start really accelerating the work, and that was the agreement today and I. Look I don't want to get people's. You know. We've got to manage this cavity. Yes, there is a good chance of a deal. Yes, I can see the shape of it. Everybody can see roughly what could be done, but it will require movement and it will require the system by which the EU can control the UK after we leave the so-called backstop to go from that treaty, and that needs to happen. So that's a big change that we need to get done, but if we can get that done so I've said before them, we're at the races and I think we've got actually just the right amount of time to do a deal we now in the 17th 18th of October, but as I, never tire of telling you if we can't do a deal by them and obviously we want to we're very hard to do then we'll make sure that we can come out on the 31st of October deal already that there are. As you know, Europeans would say that the backstop is sacred. It's too late to not really go. She ate it and that this these talks are a sham that you just may want to do. Well, that's all I didn't who you've been talking to you, but that's that's not what our interlocutors Ertz EU heads of government, that all think at all. They know that we're all working very hard to get a deal, and that goes for our friends in in Berlin or Paris or Dublin, and so a lot of work is going on. I don't want to. You know this is a difficult moment because clearly well were very, very keen to to do it, but I don't want to be able to think that it's necessarily in the bag, it isn't necessarily in the bag, will be hard work to be done.
