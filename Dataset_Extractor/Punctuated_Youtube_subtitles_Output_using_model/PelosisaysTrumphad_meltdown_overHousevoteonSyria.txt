What's really sad about, it is I prayed for the president. All the time and I tell him that I pray for his safety and about his family I. Think now we have to pray for his health, but, as this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president, I was expressing my appreciation for where our troops have done in Syria and by all accounts from the generals. They have just really done the job very well. That he's now pulling out the explanation, for that is what we asked for all members of the House to hear, and that was supposed to be tomorrow. But now then they somehow comes boned it today. My concern that I expressed to the president is that Russia has for a long time, always wanted to have a foothold in the Middle East, and now he has enabled that to happen and I have concerns about all roads, leading whether it's a foothold in the Middle East, whether it's placing and doubt, and a military assistance to Ukraine, which is to the benefit of Putin. Whether is placing in doubt our commitment to NATO article 5, which again our own roads, lead to Putin. The list goes on and on.
