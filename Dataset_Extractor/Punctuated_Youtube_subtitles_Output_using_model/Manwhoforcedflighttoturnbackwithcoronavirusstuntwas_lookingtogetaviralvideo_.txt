So you're dreaming, yes, I James po tuck front from the flight from the flight I go by Potok Philippe I'm, an artist you're, an artist, yes, okay! So can I just ask you generally what your interpretation of what happened. I fly to Jamaica five times a year. One time couple trips ago, I did a similar thing. I pulled my phone out. I made a viral video I got up, I said, can have your attention? Can I have your attention, everyone stopped and looked and I said: Lil Wayne's new, album just dropped, everybody go get it no problem. With that sat back down landed, everybody got off. No issue seemed to me like this was in poor taste. In retrospect, what I did I stood up? I said: can I have everybody's attention? I just came back from Hunan Province how's it. Why did you? Why would you say that well, I had my camera with me, I was looking to to get a viral. Video I was looking to get it up on all the social media platforms. I figured. It would invoke some type of reaction, not on the plane, more people. Seeing on social media going wow, this kid's got some balls or this kid is crazy, whatever it is, so you were looking for some sort of promotion or viral video I was looking to to create a video. Yes, that was that would go viral yeah for what purpose no to go violin artists, any publicity for myself as good publicity. And what do you think now about what happened? What I did was wrong: I ruined the flights for two hundred and some-odd people I ruined their flight, and it is there any repercussions from this that you know they just showed up and knocked yeah. Your dad, yes, can I, ask you: what are the repercussions or what do you think they've charged me criminally and yeah I of court to go to there's all types of positions, people that people that are happy people that are upset, but in the end, I've ruined the people on the planes trip so I'm, extremely apologetic.
