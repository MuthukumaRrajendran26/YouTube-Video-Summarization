A friendly first meeting between Justin Trudeau and the new British Prime Minister, both Boris Johnson and Trudeau, want to talk free trade and make sure that there are great opportunity to Canadians, but Johnson's brexit plans have many at the summit nervous, there's a lot of unknown unknowns that known unknowns and until we know that it's very hard for Canada to actually negotiate at any kind of agreement with Britain, especially given that we've already gone a long way to coming up with something what it might look like. But we're not exactly sure where the British are coming from and I still hope that Prime Minister Johnson will not like to go down in history as mr. No Deal, the head of the European Council was blunt. Trade Wars lead to recession. Donald tooth called this summit the last moment to restore the political community and a test of unity in the free world that this confrontation can be really risky for the whole world, including the EU. This is why we need g7 that comment aimed squarely at US president Donald Trump, who, just before he left for France lobbed new tariffs at China and threatened his host country with attacks on wine. If France moves forward with attacks on big US tech companies will be taxing their wine like they've, never seen before, but when face-to-face with his host a much different story and trade talks can be challenging even with like-minded allies in Canada, we are wearing much more comfortable with doing trade for our companies to do trade international and vice versa. There's there's a steep curve in France around trade issues, while most of the Canada EU trade deal has come into force. France has yet to ratify. Sida and Trudeau is using this summit to talk trade all over the world. He talked about the Pacific Rim deal with the Japanese Prime Minister and he'll tackle the canada-us Mexico agreement that replaces NAFTA when he meets with Trump Sunday.
