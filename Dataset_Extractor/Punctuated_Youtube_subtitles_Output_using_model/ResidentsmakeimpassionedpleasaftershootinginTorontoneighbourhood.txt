In color, I can't tell you, make her model I heard at least three shots. This has to end. We put I gave housing and moratorium, they have no longer Smith deep. They don't pull their safety meeting and get their together. We've had enough, I am sick of attending funerals. They are not gonna, be happy until people start taking it into their own hands. We are tired. This is second housing doesn't giving him this place, needs help. They better step up their game and they better start cleaning housing up, because we are sick, sick and tired of burying bodies. It is not young innocent people that didn't desert. Okay, I'm, not good the rivers cameras. This is broad daylight. They should all you know who did it need to know the call they should know the lace license plate, they should know we deserve justice. This is this needs to have justice to this. We need way too much. Justice visit me justice. It's not right! It's not right to nothing. It's not right to no one, and whoever did this. You have a sick mind. Nearly you're sticking, your stomach and I thought. I. Hope, I I pray that you have guilt and you just turn yourself and have that guilt and give that person the give the families the justice and everything they need to cope with this. That's my last part. We have a lot of drug issues in this complex. We have a lot of drug addicts. Bible Sunday is up hell on earth. I wouldn't put my worst enemies dog in that building. It is disgusting, the dirty needles, the the drugs, the extras, the people who think that they own this place. I've lived here 20 years, I started in the townhouses I moved over there to the one bedrooms. This has got to end and I told them a month ago when we had their shooting up here. Unfortunately, nobody was hit, I told them. The next one will be bodies sure Christ a month later. Here we are bodies we're sick of it. We are sick of it. It's not just here if every housing complex and they do not give a damn.
