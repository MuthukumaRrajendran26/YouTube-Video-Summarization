Moreover, we obviously saw the announcement by the United States of a travel ban on Europe and we have issued a joint statement with the presidency of the Council to which the Croatian president, sorry with the presidency of the European Council, to which the presidency of the Council, the Croatian presidency of the Council, is associated. If you don't mind, I will read this statement out to you the coronavirus crisis. The coronavirus is a global crisis, not limited to any continent, and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action. The European Union disapproves of the fact that the u.s. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation. The European Union is taking strong action to limit the spread of the virus. Obviously there will be further steps taken and in the coming the coming days, you know that tomorrow, in particular, the Commission will be coming forward with its guidance and as agreed during the European Council and on economic steps. It can be taken, in particular, flexibility, visibly the within the framework of the stability and growth pact, and also flexibility within the framework of the of the state aid rules. Someone sneezed everything is okay, right.
