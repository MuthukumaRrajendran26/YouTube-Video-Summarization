Creamy sweet smooth, gelato versus ice cream. What's the difference, we ask the important questions in life. This is gelato and this is ice. Cream gelato am I right, or am I right? They really taste the same to me. Yeah ice cream, gelato, I'm, good I, said yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Am I correct. Yeah I failed I failed with a blindfold. The difference between gelato and ice cream isn't always so easy to understand. Gelato first of all, gelato means frozen. It's a very simple word: boo Chanti is from Rome he's been making gelato for 25 years. The fact that there's a lot of fat it makes it more hard the ice cream. You can scoop the ice cream, the same, whether you will scoop the gelato, because the gelada is a little more a noble way of making the dessert. You know in general, gelato has less fat than most ice cream ice cream is made of milk, cream sugar and egg yolks. It is churned at a high speed to ensure air traps and increases in volume. Gelato, on the other hand, uses more milk than ice cream and typically uses fewer egg. Yolks, if any the difference is gelato is turned at a much slower pace, keeping it dense and is served at a slightly warmer temperature than ice cream ice cream is best served at about minus 12 degrees Celsius. If gelato were served at that temperature, it would be way too hard. It is believed that modern gelato, as we know it today, was invented by Fernando Montiel NT, an architect from Florence. He was asked by the Medici family in the late 1500s to prepare an awe-inspiring feast for the visiting king of Spain, his creation, a sweet treat made with milk cream and eggs. The cold cream flavor with Bergamo and orange became known as gelato buon appetito.
