Of course, I don't know, I, don't I, don't understand why grown-ups would would choose to mock children, teenagers Pro for just communicating and acting on the science one day they could do something good instead, but I guess they. They must feel like they're their worldview or their interests or whatever it is, is threatened by us, and that is that we should take as a compliment that we are having so much impact that that people want to silence us we've become too loud for people to handle, so they try to silence us I mean my message to to all the politicians around the world is it's the same, just listen and act on the best available, United science and I: try not to focus so much on individuals and rather focus on on the whole picture, because so because it's easier to focus I mean, of course it's easier to just blame someone and of course he has a lot of responsibility which he has not and he's, of course, obviously not doing enough, but we need to because this is such a huge problem. This is a system that is wrong. So my message to all the politicians is the same: to just listen to to the science and act on the science in Canada. I expect I always already seen today that the strikes have been very big and that and I I think and I hope they. The rest of the strikes in Canada will be very big as well and I know you have election now, so so it's and that is always a very busy time when I want to really understand what going on so, but I expected that you, as well as other countries, take your your responsibility and do your part from a global perspective.
