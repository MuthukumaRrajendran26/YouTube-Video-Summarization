He died like a dog. He died like a coward. He was whimpering screaming and crying and frankly, I think it's something that should be brought out so that his followers and all of these young kids that want to leave various countries, including the United States. They should see how he died. He didn't die a hero. He died a coward crying whimpering screaming and bringing three kids with him to die certain death and he knew the tunnel had no end. I mean it was a. It was. A closed. Closed, ended a quarter closed to end tunnel, not a good place to be for him. For three years, I've been looking for him. I started getting some very positive feedback about a month ago and we had some incredible intelligence officials that did a great job. That's what they should be focused on.
