This historic moment, first time that two women have done a space walk together, floating out of the airlock and into the pages of history, astronauts, Jessica, Muir and Christina cook carried out a space first on the outside of the International Space Station. It's just normal. We're part of the team we're doing this work as an efficient team working together with everybody else. Their mission replace a faulty battery charger, a two-person job that had never been done by two women before in the past, women haven't always been at the table and it's wonderful to be contributing to the human spaceflight program at a time when all contributions are being accepted. Women have been in space since the 1960s and part of spacewalks since the 80s, but the first attempt at an all-female spacewalk last March was sidelined because the ISS didn't carry two space suits in the right size. What we're doing now shows all the work that went in for the decades prior all of the women that worked to get us where we are today in the future. Nasa plans to use spacesuits adaptable to all shapes and sizes, they'll be worn by the first woman to land on the moon sometime in the next decade: seven hours and 17 minutes after they stepped into the vacuum of space. You can see that hatch, open, mirror and cook returned safely to the space station. After a successful mission, their small steps making a giant leap forward, Jackson, Proust, Co, global news.
