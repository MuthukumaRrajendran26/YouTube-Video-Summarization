The NDP is making its last pitch to Quebec in the hometown of Jack Layton, resurrecting the memory of the former leader. The legacy of Jack Layton is being carried out by a wonderful, courageous, compassionate leader. The NDP is up four points since the start of the election when it faced the prospect of being wiped out in Quebec we're not in any fear of that happening. We've got an incredible team and a strong base. In 2011 the orange wave took Quebec by storm with Layton at the helm. Then in 2015 the Liberals managed to steal their momentum, but in 2019 Justin Trudeau can't count on the same support. In just one day. He's made stops in six Quebec ridings, five of them held by the NDP. The Liberal leader omits the possibility of an Andrew Shearer government, and we know there's lots more to do and that's what we're focused on. But every election is a choice and I'm not taking any of Canadians voices. Votes for granted. The bloc québécois has regained some strength since the last federal election. With a Francois Blanc che at the helm, the BQ could take 30 seats and potentially be a force in a minority situation. Most leaders have decided to be somewhat more aggressive against the bloc québécois. It might mean that we have become again a significant player in politics, and this political scientist believes the bloc's energy comes as the NDP and liberals are experiencing some misfortune in Quebec in Quebec. The rise of the bloc since the beginning of a campaign has changed everything that forced the Liberals to shake a lot of hands. The desperate situation that the other Progressive Party can commiserate with. Quebec is Canada's second largest province, and seventy eight seats are up for grabs with such a close race. The vote here counts more than ever, Donna all right, Robin Gil in Montreal thanks.
