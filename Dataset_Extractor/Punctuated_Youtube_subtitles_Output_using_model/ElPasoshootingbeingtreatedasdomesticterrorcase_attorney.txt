Thank you. My name is John Bosch I'm, the United States Attorney for the Western District of Texas, which covers El Paso. My grandmother has lived here for 50 years, she's 91, since it was a much smaller community. I. Don't think she's ever seen anything like this in this community. My mom grew up here. My dad went to college here. I looked here, I was very young. It's been devastating for the community. I've been unbelievably impressed by our first responders by the DA's office, fire police FBI. In the work they've conducted. We had a very long night last night work in this case I've been in close consultation with attorney general barb. We are conducting a methodical investigation with our partners, a careful investigation, but with a view towards bringing federal hate crimes, charges under 18, USC, 249 and federal firearms charges which carry a penalty of death. We are seriously considering those charges we're going to conduct a methodical and careful investigation with a few towards those charges. We are also treating this as a domestic terrorist case. There's a statutory definition of domestic terrorism at 18, USC, 2, 3, 3 1. This meets it, it appears to be designed to intimidate a civilian population, to say the least. We are treating it as a domestic terrorism case and we're going to do what we do to terrorists in this country, which is deliver Swift and certain justice.
