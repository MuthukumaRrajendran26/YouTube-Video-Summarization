But everywhere you go Bohemians refer to this place as the family islands. What they mean is they look out for each other? If you're from here your family, who NASA's McIntosh didn't have to be here arranging for the first hot food, his fellow Abaco nians had seen in a week, he could have evacuated the devastated island. The thought he said never crossed his mind like most living on Abaco island. He expected government aid to show up immediately after the storm when it didn't. He took matters into his own hands on Friday Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert minus-- visited Greater Abaco, getting an earful from residents, desperate to leave votes of, becoming n on aircrafts to his credit. Plane showed up the next day, but those same government-owned Bahamas airplanes were here days ago, evacuating residents, but only those that paid $75 for their seat. The rest left with only the shirts on their backs, sat on the hot tarmac, with no food or water for days. I have personal friends that paid for 14 tickets. That was the last straw for Krystal Williams, who took this video of people looting when the government said that it wasn't happening and was shocked to see how meager the few rations were that the government did manage to deliver. She went online and complained loudly, adding to a growing chorus of Bohemians who feel like the government abandoned them. I'm not relying on the government. I, don't feel like we can rely on the government. We couldn't rely on the government to come and get us out. The distrust of the government is extreme right now to the point where many are hoping that donations go to international agencies and not the Bahamian government, because they believe, when it's time to rebuild the money, won't be there.
