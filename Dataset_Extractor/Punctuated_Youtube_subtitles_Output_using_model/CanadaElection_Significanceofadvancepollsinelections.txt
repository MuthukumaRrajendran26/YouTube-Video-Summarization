In 2015, 3.7 million Canadians voted in an advance poll that amounted to about 1/5 of all votes cast and one thing's for sure pulling. Your vote in the advance polls is critical for any party case in point in the Alberta Riding of Edmonton mill, woods in 2015, Liberal candidate, amar Jeet, so he's team out hustled a conservative incumbent, Tim Uppal to win the advance polls by 95 votes. Now, uppal won when it came to votes cast only on Election Day by 3 votes, so so he's advanced poll work would give him an overall victory of 92 votes this in a riding where 49,000 people voted. In other words, so he won the election by winning the advance poll weekend across the country. There were more than 30 ridings like this, where the advance poll result was different from the result of votes cast only on election day and as a result, became the difference between winning and losing when all the votes were tallied up. In fact consider this. The numbers on the left in this chart are the actual seat results from the 2015 election. It was a liberal majority of a hundred and eighty four seats, but if you counted just the votes cast in advance polls, it would have been a liberal minority of 163 seats with a much stronger conservative and NDP showing now 2015 was a so-called change election with a wave of support moving towards the Liberals in the week after the advance polls and before Election Day. That's not the case this time. This is a grinded out, every vote counts type of election and that makes winning the weekend of advance polls even more critical.
