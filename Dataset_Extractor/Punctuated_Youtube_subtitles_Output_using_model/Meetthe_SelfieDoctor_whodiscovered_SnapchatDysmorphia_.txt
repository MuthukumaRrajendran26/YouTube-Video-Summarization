Many people know me for coining the phrase snapchat dysmorphia or selfie dysmorphia, and it was a phenomenon I described which I noticed first in my clinic, but when I started speaking to more and more of my colleagues, they were noticing the same thing within their practices, and this wasn't just within the UK. This end up being worldwide. What I was noticing was usually before way back. Patients would bring in pictures of celebrities in you know we're talking about ten years ago of what they wanted to look like and really this was to help them articulate what they liked. So it may be Angelina Jolie's jawline or someone else's nose, and it helped him give him a way of describing what he needed to the physician, which was okay. What then I started noticing where people were using altered and filtered versions of themselves, which again in a way, if it's just to give a starting point or way to articulate what they could have? Then that's? Okay, because it acts as a reference point, but for a small percentage of patients I sign noticing they wanted to look exactly like that image, and that image is an unrealistic image to be attainable and was good concern and, in many ways had ideals with many mental health disorders that you do see within the NHS and the private sector. When looking at someone, if they do or do not have selfie dysmorphia. The key characteristic I think is that they do prefer one how they look on social platforms rather than in real life too. They are obtaining treatments to make them look like they do and appear in their filtered or altered images that they do when they use these platforms and free that they're not aware that this is an unrealistic expectation and they're continually going to get these treatments often disappointed, because no doctor, no physician, will be able to produce that image. That they're trying to obtain when I see a patient that comes in and I'm very concerned, or they have red flags that look like to me like snapchat, dysmorphia or selfie dysmorphia. One of the key things is to try and counsel that patient one to explain why by these images or what they want to achieve is unrealistic and also to delve further in their past medical history of any previous problems of any mental health problems or histories that are related to that. The key part from that is, hopefully an agreement which leads on to counseling, because for that type of patient, what they want is not gonna be found at the end of a needle, a laser or scalpel. It's gonna be found by the right counsel, and so it's gonna be found by the right counseling by the right arm of the practitioner. Some of the requests that relate to people wanting to look like this snapchat filters or altered images, sometimes within the realms of normal, so I want really great skin or I want bigger lips. But one of the strangest I had was a patient really wanted bigger eyes like the actual filter had given, it was impossible to give her bigger eyes and I tried to explain many times why surgically and non surgically? This could not happen and that outpatient. Luckily, there was a realization that this was something that could be achieved, but a concern was that you know in that moment they wanted to do anything possible to achieve it, I think Olli, hopefully, by identifying this trend and then having more more people. Research has seen the reason behind. Therefore we can look at solutions to treat in this, just as we treat other mental health disorders.
