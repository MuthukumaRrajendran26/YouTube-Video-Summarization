Stephen Fowler remembered his son as someone who, squeezed every last drop of fun out of life. Speaking at Lucas's, funeral Fowler said he envied his sons drive to pursue his passion for traveling. He didn't just dream of traveling. He worked and saved and made it happen. He lived off the smell of an oily rag to get to places we've never heard of and along the way forged. Many friendships. The 23 year old Fowler seems to wear a smile in every picture you find even at 36 below zero, but it's especially true of the ones. Alongside his girlfriend Chyna Dees, the 24 year old American was killed alongside Fowler when tragedy struck, his father says Fowler was deeply in love and in fact, at his happiest we're so happy that Lucas and Chyna found each other. We so look forward to having Chyna in our family. Her mother tells us that Chyna wanted their kids to have an Aussie accent. This surveillance, video of the couple, was released by police. It was taken just two days before their bodies would be found. Next, to the van on the side of a BC Highway they'd been shot to death. Dc's family held a private memorial service. Last weekend in North Carolina, her mother says: she's watched the surveillance video over and over to rewatch this hug. The couple met in a hostel in Croatia they've, both been to numerous countries. Dc's mother says the travel always made her nervous, except for when her daughter went to Canada, while both families are focused not on the horrors of how their loved ones were killed, but instead on the way they lived with time, there will be fewer teas and more laughter, Aldi China. We can no longer hug a boy. Please hold him tight, you are in our hearts for it. Mike Armstrong, Global, News,.
