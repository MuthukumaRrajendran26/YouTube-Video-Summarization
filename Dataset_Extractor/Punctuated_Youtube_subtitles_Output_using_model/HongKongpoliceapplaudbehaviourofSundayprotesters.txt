The protest that took place on Sunday shows, if protests are peaceful, rational and orderly. The police will not and have no reason to intervene. Farlan only begets violence is never a solution. The police appealed to members of the puppy to reject all forms of violence and revert to peaceful and orderly expression of speech. But very often we found that our warnings for deaf ears and and that's why and a lot of people will gather around and it's necessary for us. If, at the time we need to use force, we will try our best to inform the general public before we use that and given the escalating escalating violence and the kind of weapons being used by the processor there, there is a need for our officers to escalate. They they use of force.
