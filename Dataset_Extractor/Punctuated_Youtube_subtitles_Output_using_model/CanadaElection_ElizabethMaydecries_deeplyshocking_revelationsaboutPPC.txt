It's it. It's deeply shocking and I find the eggs I, never thought I, never thought we'd, hear the term white, supremacists or neo-nazis I think the effect of what's happened in US politics has given oxygen to opinions to views to prejudices, to hatreds that I thought were long and I. Elated I mean it's one thing to recognize: systemic racism in a country, it's another to think that there's any space whatsoever and I've seen Mr Shearer play footsie with some of these groups I it needs to be called out. It needs to be denounced, but I don't know that at this point one can say that any view. Well, how do I put this in a debate if they've met the rules? This information may give our former Governor General cause to reconsider the decision. That's been taken, it's horrific and these groups need to be called out. I right now I would say clearly that I think that a lot of the efforts of CSIS and the RCMP are misdirected towards in.
