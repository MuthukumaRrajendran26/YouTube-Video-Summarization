I know I know, Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him the question: why is he on the phone with a foreign leader trying to intimidate a foreign leader? If that's what happened? That appears what happened? You should be looking at Trump Trump's doing this, because I'll beat him like a drum and he's using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something. To smear me, depending on what the court the house finds, you could be impeached, but I'm, not making that judgment now. The house should investigator at the house should investigate this. This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power to get in the phone with a foreign leader who is looking for help from the United States and asked about me and imply things. If that's what happened, that appears to be what happened? We know that's what Giuliani did. This is outrageous.
