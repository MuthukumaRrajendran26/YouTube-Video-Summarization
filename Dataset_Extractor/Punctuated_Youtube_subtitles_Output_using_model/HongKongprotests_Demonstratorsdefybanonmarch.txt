Pouring rain appropriate for protesters with the motto be like water, as in be flexible as darkness fell, clashes, intensified. Saturday marks the fifth anniversary of the decision by China to limit democratic reforms in Hong. Kong protesters threw bricks and beer bottle bombs and set fires in the street not backing down from their current push for democratic reform. There were more arrests and reports of injuries police trying to head off the protesters taken to the subway officers, fired, tear gas and water dyed blue to mark and identify people referring to color of a different kind on China Central Television. This scholar took the government line calling this a color revolution, claiming these protesters are backed by evil Western forces. The protesters have Chinese faces, he says, but British or Canadian passports anti-communist and anti China. Yes, 300,000 Hong Kongers have Canadian passports, but for people who are living and working and making their life in Hong Kong, they are seeing this as a fight to keep. What they see is their distinct City. Distinct. President of the Rideau Potomac Strategy, Group Eric Miller, says this isn't a foreign influenced revolution, but on all the tension points with Beijing he says Canada is stuck responding instead of playing, offense Canada doesn't have a viable China strategy, and so it's playing whack-a-mole, whether it's the mangwon Jo case or whether it's the detention of the two Michael's or the bar on cote canola exports. In this case, Canada has spoken out against the violence in Hong Kong. Earlier this month, Foreign Affairs, Minister, Christian Freeland, said Canada supports Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy from China and peaceful right to protest earning her a direct rebuke from the Chinese embassy here in Ottawa.
