Well, I'm, not siding with anybody. We've been in Syria for many years. You know, Syria was supposed to be a short-term hit, just a very short-term hit, and we were supposed to be in and out that was many many years ago, and we only have 50 people in that area. That's a small sector and I. Don't want those 50 people hurt or killed or anything I. Don't want anything bad to happen to our people and I told that to president Erdogan I said: don't hurt any of our any of our people. Get hurt big trouble now a couple of things I think there's a lot of pressure on Turkey they've been fighting with the PKK for many years, their natural enemies. Have you read today a couple of reports saying that when President Obama started this whole thing, as you know, it was started by President Obama. He created a natural war with Turkey and they're, their longtime enemy, PKK and they're. Still there and they're still hating each other beyond anybody's belief, but I have told Turkey that if they do anything outside of what we would think is humane to use. The word a second time we talked about Hong Kong. We talked about this. They could suffer the wrath of a extremely decimated economy. I consulted with everybody, I always consult with everybody. If you remember about eight months ago, I talked about doing this and we kept 2,000 people there and then slowly brought them out, but once we captured Isis I didn't see, I don't want to stay there for the next 40 years, not gonna do anything. The end game is going to be the same. I have great respect for all of the people that you named and they have their opinion and a lot of people do and I could also name many more than you just named of people. That totally are supportive. You see the names coming out. People are extremely thrilled because they say it's time to bring our people back home, we're not a police force, they're policing, the area, we're not a police force.
