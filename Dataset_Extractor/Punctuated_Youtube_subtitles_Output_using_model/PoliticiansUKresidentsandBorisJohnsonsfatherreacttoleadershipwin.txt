Well, obviously, I'm very disappointed for me and my team, but I'm also incredibly proud of the campaign that we ran. I think we did ourselves proud, and this was always going to be uphill for us, because I was someone who voted remain. We have a prime minister who voted remain and I. Think lots of conservative party members felt that this was a moment when you just had to have someone who voted for brexit in the referendum, and that was in retrospect. That was a hurdle we were never able to overcome. But I think that being said, there was a lot of progress and you know: I am delighted for the country that Boris has become Prime. Minister I think he will be a great Prime Minister. You know, I think Boris fought. A very, very good campaign was very clear campaign. His messages were absolutely clear and you know I think as I say he will now be a great Prime Minister, it's a challenging moment for our country. This is perhaps the most difficult legacy that a Prime Minister is inherited in peacetime. It's a it's going to be very challenging, but he has got the confidence and the optimism and the energy to get us through this, and you know that's why I think, whatever our differences on brexit, the biggest risk to this country is Jeremy Corbyn and that unites every single Conservative MP, whichever part of a brexit debate they're on, and they know that if we don't now unite as a party behind the new Prime Minister, then we are going to hand the keys at number 10 to someone who certainly won't deliver brexit. We will do an enormous amount of damage in many many other ways. I, don't think we are necessarily looking at an OD or brexit I think that the European Union do want to find a deal and if we approach this in the right way as I'm sure Boris will then I think there's every chance that we could do a deal. But they have to know that what is not up for negotiation is the fact. A brexit I was actually leaving the European Union, yeah and I'm. Looking forward to you know, obviously gotta get breakfast out, but you know you're, not a primary table is not just for Christmas and this Prime Minister's present. You know, listen, look ahead. Let's look ahead. No survivors, the pyro Prime Minister, one of the first places I would go to would be Brazil. Look what happened to the Brazilian rainforests of the Amazon rainforest. You know he needs to sit down with president box and say: look come on the whole world's future is being affected by why what's happening the Amazon? So that's that's one of the items on the agenda and yes, how will the family celebrates a very good question? We must have a little family meeting to say how should we celebrate? We will celebrate that's for sure, I think at this particular weekend. You know there'll be a lot else happening, but we'll find the time you choose them have chosen boys, Johnson's people, burger and I. Think in retrospect it was officially the trees are made to be part of the mandate when she became Prime, Minister I think it made I'm. Not this part and I think this is a very propitious stop boys. He will unite the party and the country once we've left the European Union. Almost nobody will ever want to rejoin such a failing organization. So it's a terrific opportunity for unity and positivity for this great nation. That's very good news for us has done so well, but I've been supporting Boris for a long time. He has my complete support. If he wants me to do anything for him, I'll of course, do it, but the key is that we deliver brexit and deliver what the country needs not about me. We recognize that this is one of the biggest challenges that we faced online, being a very deep relationship with yoga. We continue to have European values. We continue to be the heart to have a close relationship with your bu, but it is also essential. We deliver on the biggest motive of history and deliver brexit, which is what 7.4 million people voted for. So Boris absolutely gets that and that's what is permitted to do. Will you be the Houston? It's always for the new prime minister is for the boys, because I think he's the right person to take the country forward, but it's always with a new family I. Think it's just a next Trump. To be honest, so you know it's not going well. I was kind of rooting for Teresa meadow, and that was unfortunate, but you know just probably for another election, maybe horrified to be honest. I just think like do you think two huge powers run by these sort of white men with blonde, probably hair, who don't really care what they say as long as it's pop their opinion, yeah I mean it's around us I. Do you think he probably is a smart person, but I don't think he has anyone's best interest at heart of his own I. Don't think he's got any more charts and trees and mayor I think he's. If he's a good politician, he's very good at spinning his own story, I think it's quite sad for our country. To be honest with you, I think the people deserve the truth.
