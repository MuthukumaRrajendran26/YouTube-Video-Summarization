We know Canada is not on track to meet our commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but there are some experts who believe all is not lost. A group called eco fiscal, an independent economics organization. Looking at policy options has put out a new report that says the right approach can still make a big difference and it concludes the right approach. Is carbon pricing? That's at the heart of what our political leaders are arguing about. Our chief political correspondent, David akin, has read through the report and joins me from Ottawa David. Well, Donna. All parties- and this includes the Conservatives- say that climate change is a serious threat to the planet and all of them agree that Canada needs to hit its paris target of cutting emissions by 30 percent compared to 2005 levels and to do that by 2030. But how to do that? That's where the arguments start. Politicians like Ontario's Doug forward and Alberta's Jason Kenney think emissions can be cut with tough regulations that focus on big emitters. Like energy companies, an economist set, the Eco fiscal commission say it is possible to hit our Paris targets that way, but that will cost the average Canadian -. The problem with that is that if you're going to focus policy only on the heavy industry basically and have very expensive subsidies, there's an economic cost to pay. If you're going to put a lot of subsidies in place, generous subsidies, you've got to raise taxes to pay for them. Personal income taxes would have to rise somewhere in the ballpark of four to six percent over the next decade and that kind of tax hike could choke. Overall economic growth, Trudeau's liberals, on the other hand, along with governments in BC and Quebec, believe putting a price on carbon, is a better system than relying on regulation, and the experts at the Commission agree is the most visible, but it is also the best for the economy. It's the least cost policy and it's the least cost. By a considerable chunk. The current federal carbon tax and rebate plan has carbon priced at $20 a ton rising to $50 a ton by 2022. The Eco fiscal commission says the price will have to rise to 220 dollars a ton by 2030, and that means the carbon tax would quadruple, but so would rebates given to consumers again to keep everything revenue neutral now convincing voters, particularly those in the West that quadrupling the carbon tax and rebate, is the cheapest and lowest cost way to hit our international commitments is going to be a tough sell, but the Eco fiscal commission believes that some frank talk from all political parties about the true costs and benefits of their plans will help make voters to make the right choice for their pocketbooks and the planet. Donna David thanks. This is the final report from eco fiscal, more details on the report and the people behind it there on our website.
