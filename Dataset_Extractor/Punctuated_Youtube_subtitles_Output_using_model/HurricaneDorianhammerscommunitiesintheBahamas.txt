And from this angle, which is directly all right, our house is on a cul-de-sac, so water is all around us, but this is the direct canal. That's right behind us and you can see the waves are just raging as if we're at sea visibility is very low and the waves are just like on the ocean. Now I'm on the other side of the house. Our garage door has already come off and it's floating in this very high water. This is very deep water, which would be about eight feet right now and I'm heading over to the other window. We just pray that we can come out of this once we come out of it with our lives. We're happy come ask: can you get me? Go man go man, the Chuck Chuck I'm, sending the feed box the bus gone. Alright, we need to focus on Annalise and Malachi. I'm gonna drop, my shoe. We need help everything. Now everything down come on move off. My house I just took a light tank off life. This is no provenance.
