Believing he can defy history, President Donald Trump revealed his plan to bring peace to the Middle East. All prior administration's from President Lyndon Johnson have tried and bitterly failed, but I was not elected to do small things or shy away from big problems. The eighty page proposal strongly favors Israel. It was drafted by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner and is already backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It addresses the root cause of the conflict. The incident by insisting that the Palestinians will finally have to recognize Israel as the Jewish state. The plan would redraw the map. Creating a Palestinian state with limited sovereignty. Israeli settlements in the West Bank would remain. Israel would also keep control over Jerusalem's holy sites. Under this vision, Jerusalem will remain Israel's, undivided, very important, undivided capital, almost immediately protests erupted in Jordan, while Palestinian leaders who were not at the table branded the plan as a conspiracy. It just looks like Trump with all of his strong support of Israel from the get-go is yet one more time trying to do a favor for his friends in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. That's what it feels like to most people. Previous American presidents have tried to bring the two sides together to negotiate that two ended in failure. Trump's plan was likely dead. The moment it was announced, but it's already being used as a road map by Netanyahu who plans to move ahead to annex West, Bank settlements in the coming days.
