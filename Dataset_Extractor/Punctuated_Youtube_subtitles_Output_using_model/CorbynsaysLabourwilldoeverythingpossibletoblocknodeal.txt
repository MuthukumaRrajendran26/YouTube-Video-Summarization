It's the Conservative Party's failure on brexit and it's a lurch to the hard right that has provoked the crisis. Our country faces this autumn. After failing to negotiate a brexit deal that would protect jobs and living standards. Boris Johnson's Tories are driving the country towards a No Deal cliff edge. Let's be very clear, we will do everything necessary to stop a disastrous No Deal, for which this government has no mandate. I am the leader of the Opposition, the leader of the Labour Party. All the constitutional precedents are when a government collapses. It's the leader of the Opposition that takes over there seems to be an orphan. It seems to me an awful lot of very imaginative. What if we in the press at the present time, we will put a motion of no confidence in the government. We will hello, we will do everything we can to stop a No Deal brexit I have written to the leaders of all of the other opposition parties, inviting them to join me in this and I simply say to them this and to those probably quite small number of conservatives who are alarmed at the prospect of a No Deal brexit, if you're serious about stopping a No, Deal brexit, then back by motion of no-confidence to stop this government taking us over a cliff edge on the 31st of October. You.
