Well, thank you. All for being here, we've had a tremendous three days in New York at the United Nations I want to thank the secretary-general. It's been really incredible. What's been taking place and he's been a fantastic host to a lot of countries, the meetings I had on a bilat or clothes were pretty staggering. I think we set a new record, but you'll have to check that out. The we met very very for pretty extended periods of time, either to one to one-on-one or just about at that level, with Pakistan Poland New Zealand Singapore, Egypt, South, Korea, United, Kingdom, India, Iraq, Argentina, Germany, Brazil, France, Japan, Ukraine, Honduras, El, Salvador, Saudi, Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, UAE, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru other than that we weren't too busy over the last three days and unfortunately the press doesn't even cover it. You know we have. We've made some fantastic deals like with Japan for farmers. We have a tremendous trade deal with Japan and that doesn't get covered because you waste your time on nonsense. The PMI manufacturers index is has gone substantially up, which was an incredible Larry Kudlow wherever you may be Larry, please stand up. We just gave me these numbers and existing new home sales are through the roof. Just came out, oil prices have gone down ever since the Saudi Arabia incident and they've gone down very substantially. So we have plenty of oil, but those numbers were surprising to you, Larry and the extent of the increase. Is that a correct statement? So thank you, Larry Kudlow. We think we'll make this little announcement to you because important you know the so-called whistle blower, the one that didn't have any first class or first rate or second tier information from what I understand. You'll have to figure that out for yourself, but I've spoken with Leader, Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans many of them, and we were going to do this anyway, but I've informed them all of the House members that I fully support transparency on the so-called whistleblower information, even though it was supposedly secondhand information which is sort of interesting and other things have come out about the whistleblower that are also maybe even more interesting, but also insist on transparency from Joe Biden and his son hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China millions of dollars. Millions and millions of dollars taken out very rapidly while he was vice president and I think they should have transparency for that. I've informed for the leader about that and, additionally, a demand transparency from Democrats who went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new president who I met and is an outstanding person who just met a little while ago. Some of you were there, I think he's going to be outstanding, get elected on the basis of corruption. He wants to end corruption in Ukraine and I. Think that's great, but they went there and they wanted to force the new president to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat. They threatened him if he didn't do things now. That's what they're accusing me of, but I didn't do it. I didn't threaten anybody. In fact, the press was asking questions of the president of Ukraine and he said no pressure. I used the word pressure. I think he used the word push, but he meant pressure, but it's the same thing. No push, no pressure, no, nothing! It's all a hoax folks! It's all a big hoax and the same thing about this hoax is that we worked so hard with all of these countries and I mean really hard. This has been I've been up from early in the morning to late in the evening and meeting with different countries, all for the good of our country and the press doesn't even cover all of this and it's disappear. It's really disappointing also to those countries that are with us and spend so much time with us. So we want transparency, we've informed, Kevin, McCarthy about transparency, and we said vote for it. So I think you have close to a hundred percent of the Republican votes, I hope and they got almost no attention. But in May CNN reported that senators Robert Menendez Richard Durbin and Patrick Leahy wrote a letter to Ukraine's prosecutor general expressing concern at the closing of four investigations. They said were critical in the letter they implied that their support for US assistance to Ukraine was at stake and that everything I didn't do the right thing. They wouldn't get any assistance see. Doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that sound familiar and Chris Murphy? Who I've been dealing with on guns? You know so nice he's always? Oh no. We want to work it out. We want to work it out, but they're too busy wasting their time on on the witch-hunt. So senator chris murphy literally threatened the president of ukraine that if he doesn't do things right, they won't have democrats support in congress. So you're gonna look all of this one. Other thing, I'm just going off certain notes in elements of what we've been doing over the last three days, but this just came up a few minutes ago, the Amazon Washington Post just put out a fake article that Acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph McGuire, who I've gotten to know and he's a tough cookie and I was surprised. I was shocked to hear this was going to quit, blaming the White House for something that they wouldn't. Let him talk openly freely and I was shocked because I know Joe and he's tough, tough guy and I was really surprised to hear he was gonna quit before I could even either talk to him or talk to anybody else. He put out a statement. I didn't speak to Joe yet, but he said at no time have I considered resigning. My position, in other words the story in The Washington Post, was a fake at no time have I considered resigning. My position since assuming this role on August 16th 2019 I, have never quit anything in my life and I am NOT going to start now, I'm committed to leading the intelligence community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation. That's from the Acting Director of National Intelligence, a very good man, Joseph Maguire, so we're having a great period of time. Our country is the strongest it's ever been economically. Our numbers are phenomenal. Wilbur. Thank you and Larry everybody. The numbers are phenomenal. Our economy is the strongest in the world we're the largest economy in the world. Had my opponent won. We would be second right now, because China was catching us so rapidly. We would have been second by this time and unless somebody does a very poor job as president we're gonna be first for a long way, because we picked up trillions and trillions of dollars in value and worth of our country and China has lost trillions and trillions of dollars and millions of jobs and their supply chain, and they want to make a deal. This year, America came to the United Nations stronger than we have ever been before. Since my election, the United States has not only brought our economy to a level that we have never seen the most jobs that we've ever had. You know you've heard me say it many times: african-american asian-american, Hispanic American, the best unemployment numbers we've ever had, and the most and best employment numbers, 160 million, very close to that number in jobs, we've never been anywhere, close wages are up and inequality is down something that people don't like writing about, but wages are up. I used to speak to her in the campaign and I talked about wages where people were making less money three years ago, then they were making twenty one years ago, twenty two years ago and they'd have to two jobs and three jobs. When I say three years ago, I'm talking into the area sometime prior to the election and they were doing very badly and now for the first time in many years, wages are up and employment is up and unemployment is down, and it's a beautiful thing to watch in a week of active and ambitious diplomacy here at the United Nations America renewed our friendships. We advanced our values greatly and made clear to everyone that the United States will always defend our citizens to promote prosperity. I met with Prime Minister Boris Johnson at length, the United Kingdom continuing our discussions on a magnificent new bilateral trade deal. So we'll see what happens with respect to brexit, but I suspect we'll have a fantastic deal with the UK. It should be much bigger than it has been over the last number of years over the last 20 years. Frankly, it should be a much bigger deal. That's true with many countries we're going to have much bigger trade deals with a lot of countries that have a opportunity to come and they all want to do business with the United States, especially now earlier today, I stood alongside Prime Minister of Japan friend of mine. A great gentleman had a great reelection and we signed a terrific new trade deal which tremendously helps our farmers and ranchers and technology. The technology companies are really big benefices. We also held very productive conversations with leaders of Pakistan India and many other nations on achieving stronger ties, a fair and reciprocal trade. With respect to Pakistan and India, we talked about Kashmir and whatever help I can be I said I offered, whether its arbitration or mediation or whatever it has to be I'll, do whatever I can because they're at very serious odds right now, and hopefully, that'll get better. You look at the two gentlemen heading those two countries, two good friends of mine I, said fellas work. It out just work. It out, pose it to nuclear countries. They've got to work it out this week. We also made incredible strides on national security with president Duda of Poland. We signed a joint declaration, advancing defense cooperation and, crucially, Poland has agreed to put up 100 percent of the money, something I don't think. You've ever heard said before, but they're going to put up a hundred percent of the money of hosting additional US military personnel that will be taking from various other countries. We won't have, moreover, will have will be moving them around. Poland is building us phenomenal new facilities, spending everything in there they're going to really do a job, but we'll be moving. A few thousand soldiers and Poland will be paying that for it. Together with Prime Minister Lee of Singapore signed an important agreement extending our defense cooperation. This hasn't been changed in many years and yesterday, I met with prospective members of the Middle East strategic alliance, which is a group that I know very well. I know all of them. Through this effort, the nations of the Middle East are taking more responsibility for securing their own future and their own neighborhood and they're also reimbursing us and paying us for a lot of the military work that we incredibly do, but because we're now independent energy, wise, we're energy independent. We have very few boats going over the Middle East. We used to have them going through the Straits all the time, and you probably noticed that every once in a while, they go after somebody else's, they haven't gone after ours. Yet if they do, they've got big problems, but we have very few boats going over there. They were saying the other day. They've never attacked an American boat, I'm, not asking for trouble, but if they do they know they have far bigger trouble, but then they said, but you know we don't see. Very many American boats over here anymore. This week also bought extraordinary progress to nations of our own hemisphere. In recent days, we've achieved historic asylum cooperation agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. We were with El Salvador. Today, a great young gentleman became the president he's strong and tough and he's taking care of crime. He was really something today. I was very impressed with him and likewise, with Honduras who we met, we signed a cooperation agreement with both and also with Guatemala, we're working with our partners in Central America to ensure that asylum seekers can pursue relief as close to their home countries as possible. That'll make a tremendous difference at our southern border and Mexico I have to say, President, Lopez Obrador has been outstanding and an outstanding partner and he's doing a great job in Mexico. The cartels are way down and the numbers are Secretary's here now. The numbers are way down way way down and we're doing that without the help of Congress, meaning the Democrats in Congress, who won't give us a single vote to take care of loopholes. We have loopholes that are so horrible and it would be so easy to fix and they know they should be fixed, but they don't want to do it because they don't want to give Trump any credit, because it's all about the election, that's all they care, but they don't care about our country. They care about the election, and the sad part is with all of the tremendous work that we've done this weekend, whether it's secretary, minuchin or secretary Pompeo, who had some outstanding outstanding meetings with all of this tremendous work that we've done, the press doesn't even cover it and the Democrats did this hoax during the United Nations week. It was perfect because this way it takes away from those tremendous achievements that were taking care of, doing that were involved in in New York City at the United Nations. So that was all planned like everything else. It was all planned and the witch hunt continues but they're getting hit hard on this witch hunt, because when they look at the information, it's a joke impeachment. For that, when you have a wonderful meeting or you have a wonderful phone conversation, I think you should ask we. Actually you know that was the second conversation. I think you should ask for the first conversation also I can't believe they haven't. Well, though, I heard there's a there's a rumor out. They want the first conversation. It was beautiful. It was just a perfect conversation, but I think you should do that. I think you should do and I think you should ask for VP Pence's conversation, because he had a couple of conversations. Also I could save you a lot of time. They were all perfect. Nothing was mentioned of any import other than congratulations, but the word is that they're going to ask for the first phone conversation. You can have it anytime, you need it and also Mike Pence's conversations which were I, think one or two of them. They were perfect. They were all perfect. It's versed what the Democrats are doing to this country, they're dividing they're, belittling they're, demeaning our country. So many leaders came up to me today and they said sir, what you go through. No president has ever gone through and it's so bad for your country. People laugh at the stupidity of what they've asked for, and here we could do asylum. We could do all of these different things so easily. We could do asylum quickly, we could do loopholes, get rid of them. Instead, we actually make deals with Mexico and with Guatemala El Salvador Honduras and we're doing it with them instead of with our Congress, but we're doing it, we get it done. The wall is being built by the way they've got little coverage. I went to the border, it's going up in New Mexico, it's going up in Arizona, it's going up in California, believe it or not. They really wanted that wall in California in San Diego Sooners was completed. They said we don't want a wall, they were begging me for a wall. I should take it out and move it to another location. We were with the governor, spoke to him a lot, but the governor of Texas, lieutenant governor of Texas Attorney General of Texas, the Senators of Texas corn, Ted Cruz, and we're building an incredible wall. That's going to number! What's going to look great, it's going to be virtually impossible to cross unless you're one hell of a mountain climber. It's very tough! It's going to be very tough to get people and drugs over those walls, because they're the real deal I went to the Secretary of Homeland Security and he got all those people together. I said give me four walls, your optimum, every single thing included and they give me 20% last 20%, less than 20%, less meaning less cost. They came back. They said this is the wall, so this would be the best we have the panels on top which are anti-climb panels. I, don't know! If you noticed the steel unta, we have a different design for a different area, but there's and Clym it's very tough they've. We had people going out and real climbers telling us, which is the toughest to climb, but these are anti climb panels very tough to get across and the wall is going up many miles a week and we hope to have over 400, but maybe as much as 500 miles, which will pretty much do it because you have a lot of natural barriers. You have mountains, you have really rough rivers. You have some really rough land that you can't cross very easily, so they serve as their natural walls, but we will have we think over 400, but we could even have 500 miles to combat the malleus corruption of both the Venezuelan and Iranian dictatorships. Today, I issued proclamation suspending the entry into the United States of senior regime officials and their families, and further to promote American values on Monday. I was proud to be the first president in history to host a meeting at the United Nations I'm, so surprised. First, president for this I can't believe that I'm first I spoke to Franklin Graham about that. I can't believe it at the United Nations on protecting religious freedom and liberty for people around the world, while some partisans and unelected bureaucrats in Washington may choose to fight every day against the interests and beliefs of the American people, my administration is standing up for the American people, like no administration has in many many years. You forgot the American people. You totally forgot the American people this week, every every week, I really can say of my presidency: we're standing up for American prosperity, American security and the American Way of life, and, together with our friends and partners, we're building a more peaceful, prosperous and promising future. We have a tremendous relationship now with a lot of nations that are very happy with what's going on, and that includes in South America, where they've been so helpful when nobody thought this would be possible. The relationship with Mexico is an example or El Salvador or Honduras or Guatemala. Nobody even knew about it. Yeah we sent them hundreds of millions of dollars and all we got back was caravans of people pouring in we had tremendous. We had tremendous. It was terrible and we've got that stopped and the countries are now helping us and we stopped those payments by the way. We don't pay those countries that money anymore, but I will tell you if they're as good as they seem to be they're, really doing a job on crime and stopping the wrong people from leaving and coming to the United States, we'll be helping them a lot with economic development projects and other things. So with that we had a tremendous three days. It was beautiful to see made a lot of new friends. I read you a list of all the countries. I saw pretty much one on one and it's been very busy, but it's been very, very fruitful. So we could take a couple of questions. I'd love some questions on some of the things that we accomplished at Unga. Instead of the witch-hunt, the phony witch-hunt questions which I know, that's what you want to ask, because it's probably better for you, but it's not better for the country. So maybe we'll take a few. A few questions, please Thank You. Mr. president, you've suggested that you didn't do anything wrong and in the course of your conversations with the Ukrainian president, but can you explain to the American people why it is appropriate for an American president to ask a foreign leader for information about a political rival and what you would have said if you discovered that Barack Obama perhaps had asked a foreign leader for information about you? If you have a campaign for the presidency? Well, that's what he did the isn't it really when you think about it. Look that whole witch hunt was started and hopefully that'll all come out, but there have been some fantastic books written. It just came out whether you look at Gregg, Jared or McCarthy's book that just just came out recently and so many other books and a lot of books are coming out. When you start reading those books, you see what they did to us. What they've done to this country is a disgrace. They've hurt this country very badly and no other president should have to go through what I've gone through the president, the new president of Ukraine is looking to stop corruption. There's a lot of corruption going on and there was corruption. I just told you about senators that threatened him with votes and no money coming into Ukraine. If they do things, that's really what people are trying to say that I did, but the only difference is I didn't do it. You take a look at that call. It was perfect, I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo, but there was with Biden and there was with these senators and they threatened. They said you do this. You do that. We're not going to give you votes, that's that's the real deal. So we have a an honest group of people that have been maligned and you know it's. A lot of people say: I'll do I'll, do even better I'm very happy. Yesterday, I guess we had a 53 poll and a lot of people say add 10 points to anything anybody voting for Trump. You can add any time you get a poll, you can add 10 points or seven points or six points. Take it any way you want, but I don't know if I consider that to be a compliment, but in one way it is a compliment that I guess that's what happened in the last election, far more people came to vote than anybody thought possible. So why should the American people then be comfortable with an American president asking a foreign leader for information about American, citizen? Well, I think you could look at your Senators and you can look at Biden and you can look at all these other people. But what we're looking for is corruption. A an investigation started called the Russian witch-hunt fection italy and it was a total phony scam. It was set up by people within the government to try and stop somebody from getting elected and after that / after that person, namely me won and convincingly won at 3 or 6 to 223 and the electoral college, which, by the way, when you run a race if you're running electoral. Now, if you go by the college electoral college, that's a much different race than running popular vote and it's like the hundred yard dash or the mile. You train differently and I can't help it that my opponent didn't go to Wisconsin and should have gone much more to Michigan and Pennsylvania and other places. But that's the way it is. We won an election convincingly convincingly, and then you had the text message on well. If she doesn't win, we've got an insurance policy. How bad was that you know with the insurance policy, that's sort of what has been taking place over the last number of years. The insurance policy know there are a lot of very dishonest people, we're the ones that played it straight, and you know what the millions of people out there that are looking at. What's going on those people understand it, they see it and they think it's disgusting and our people are being hurt and our country is being hurt when a Nancy Pelosi allows her position to be taken over by radical far-left socialists or worse, that's pretty bad. That's pretty bad, especially when the Senators and all of these other people have actually done what they're accusing me of doing, which I didn't do. I'm gonna have Mike Pompeo, say a couple of words: I'm gonna have Steve minuchin, say a couple of words and then we'll do a couple of more questions. Mr. president, I thought I'd I'd start by talking about Iran. We had a productive week. We saw the Europeans take a position with respect to the attacks that took place in Saudi Arabia, making clear this was Iran just as President Trump and I had been saying and have now joined us and saying that the existing jcpoa frameworks it's not going to work, it's not going to solve the world's problems not going to create Middle East stability, and then we had a good set of meetings with our Middle East allies as well. The president joined for a meeting of the GCC, where we talked again about how we can help deter. We want peace. We want a peaceful resolution with the Islamic Republic of Iran, we're hoping we can get that way in the end. It'll be up to the Iranians to make that decision or whether they'll choose violence and hate, and this president said Mississippi yesterday to the General Assembly. If their blood thirst will continue, we hope that's the net. We hope we can get the opportunity to negotiate with them and get an outcome, that's good for both of them for the United States to make sure that they never have a nuclear weapon, that they can't foment their terror with ballistic missiles and in the way they have all around the world and I think we made real progress uniting the world on that here. Over these past few days, Thank You secretary Pompeo, said on Iran. We had very good discussions with all of our allies about the sanctions program, which is the maximum pressure and unity on the sanctions program. The Europeans made it very clear. They would not do anything without our consent and then, on the economic front, we had the entire economic team here for all the meetings. Secretary Ross Larry Kudlow ambassador light hyzer just left to go back to DC he's working hard on trying to get us MCA passed, but we had a lot of productive discussions. The Japanese trade deal and a lot of discussions on investing in the u.s. more jobs in the US and more trade. Thank you. Okay. Go ahead, please thank you. Christina Parts novelist, Fox Business I want to focus on markets because I'll leave it to everybody else. To talk about impeachment markets reacted positively after you spoke about China and that it would happen sooner then, rather than X. But unexpectedly. Yet you have the foreign minister of China saying that they have no intention of you, know: unseating the United States and yet they're investing heavily in infrastructure and millet anymore. Maybe, but what what is it? Maybe they just say that what is different this time now the fact that you're saying it's progressing, oh I, just think it's progressing I think they want to make a deal they're losing their supply chain. You know you have something specific well I, don't want to say that, but I can tell you that these two men, and in this case more specifically Steve we're having some very good conversations and I guess it's next week that a group is coming in and the week after. So we have a lot of. We have a lot of talks going on and also by telephone. They want to make a deal and you know why they want to make a deal because they're losing their jobs and because their supply chain is going to hell and companies are moving out of China and they're moving to lots of other places, including the United States, and that's not good, that's far worse than they thought and by the way, in the meantime, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs, we're taking in tremendous numbers in tariffs and we're helping our farmers who get targeted now by the way, China is starting to buy our agricultural product again they're starting to go with the beef and all of the different things. Pork very big on pork. But if you look and if you see- and they actually put out I- think a statement but they're starting very heavy to buy our AG again now they want to make a deal and they should want to make a deal. The question is: do we want to make a deal if us MC doesn't pass through? Congress is that it for NAFTA. Well, that would be a shame. Well, I don't want to answer that question, but you know how I feel about NAFTA I. Think theft is the worst trade deal ever made, although I also happen to think World. Trade Organization was not one of the greats, not one of the greats. That was the creation of China, which went like a rocket ship from the day they signed it was. It was terrible, but no we're going to find out. That's gonna be a very interesting question with Nancy and Chuck and all of these people focusing on the witch-hunt because they can't beat us at the ballot. They can't beat us at the ballots and they're not going to win the presidential we're having great polls. We have internal polls that are fair, oh hi, oh Iowa, Pennsylvania's. Looking at North Carolina, we just won two races that a lot of people that we thought were going to lose both those races. One was down 17 points three weeks before the race and he ended up winning by a substantial margin by substantial margin and Dan Bishop, and then we had a second race as you know, and he was up one or two points and he ended up winning by what was it 25 points or some incredible I'll ask you folks, because I don't want to be inaccurate. Otherwise, I'll have a front-page story. We have breaking news Trump exaggerated, but he won by many many points and he was leading by maybe two, maybe three, but he won by in the 20s. So it's it's been so we're looking great in North Carolina looking great in Florida and you had one or two congressman Democrats saying: listen. We can't beat him at the election. So let's impeach him right. Didn't you hear Al Green, that's a beauty, he's a real beauty that guy, but he said very distinctively. So it was all over the place. I don't know they're trying to lose that tape. I guess. But he said we can't. Essentially he said we can't beat him. Let's impeach him, that's pretty! That's pretty dangerous stuff! Steve! Go ahead. Thank you, sir yeah. You had expressed some concerns about the president of releasing the Treasury I. Don't why did you go ahead and do it because I was getting such fake news and I just thought it would be better and now they're asking for the first phone conversation and I'll released that too, if it's important to you but they're, asking for because I had a conversation previous on a previous election Plateau that he had hit the the current president hit a couple of different letters and I spoke to him previous to the call that we released, which was a very innocent, call, very, very innocent, very nice call and as he said, we were, I wasn't pushed I wasn't pushed meaning pressured. He wasn't pressured at all, but I don't like the concept of releasing calls, because when a president or a prime minister or a king or Queen calls the United States, you don't like to say gee we're gonna release your call to the fake news, media and they're gonna make you look like a fool. What happens? Is it's hard to do business? That way you want to have people feel comfortable, so I hated it, but you folks were saying such lies, such horrible things about a call that was so innocent and so nice. In fact, Lindsey Graham said to me when he read it was very interesting. He's a good man he's a smart man. He said I can't believe it I never knew. You could be this really nice to a person. He said. I cannot believe it. You were so nerd I didn't think you had that in you to be so. Nice I was nice I'm nice to a lot of people. People don't understand that, but I was but he was shocked that it was such a nice call and if I said there he said there is nothing here and and all fair people say the same thing but I, don't like the precedent: Steve I, don't like it, where you're dealing with heads of state and to think that their call is going to be released, but I felt that, and you know we spoke to Ukraine about it. Mike actually called up his counterpart and we spoke to Ukraine about it because we want because they could have been if they didn't want us to do it, we would not have done it, but he actually said that was a very innocent call. You can release it all. You want, and are you now braced for a long impeachment saga? Well, I thought we won. I thought it was dead. It was dead. The Muller report, no obstruction, no collusion. You look at all of the things that happened. Corey Lewandowski was fantastic, the other day as as a person that they have been tormenting. You look at all the people that they've tormented all the legal fees. People came here with with bright eyes. They wanted to make life so great for other people and they left where they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees that they didn't have. And it's a sad thing what these Democrats have done to ruin lives is so sad. I have seen people with only good intention. They came to Washington because they wanted to make the United States and the world a better place and they went home. They would dark. They got hit by Muller subpoenas I, think there were 2,500 subpoenas or some ridiculous number 500 people were interviewed, and yet they don't interview Joe Biden and his son. If you're a Democrat, you have automatic protection, that's years and years of people putting in certain people into positions. But when you look at all of the all of the trauma that these fakers have caused and the press look, the press is much of. The press is not only fake. It's corrupt. These stories, a right are corrupt, they're, so wrong, and they know that you know it used to be I used to get great press until I ran for politics. I mean I used to be the king of getting good press. I was very good at it, and I got good I mean they covered me well for what otherwise, I probably wouldn't be here and once I ran. I said why this is incredible, but if you see the way they treat my family used to be treated great, my family works so hard. The people that work with me these people all of these people, they work so hard. They've done such a good look. We have the greatest economy we've ever had. We have a military two and a half trillion dollars. We've rebuilt our military. You don't hear the vets complaining, we got choice approved it couldn't be approved, but when you see what happened with the viciousness and when you see little Adam Schiff go out and lie and lie and stand it than my smart guy by the way stand at the mic and act like he's so serious, and then he goes into a room with Nadler and they must laugh their asses off. They must laugh their asses off, but it's so bad for our country. People have said rush limbaugh, great man, Sean Hannity, said it. A lot of people have said it mark levin. They said they don't know if one man anywhere in the world with all the men they know or woman that could handle what I've had to handle, and I think that's true, but I handle it to me. It's like putting on a suit all right. How about one more question: question on the economy, a question on the economy: go ahead. Go ahead! Mr. president, VP ITV from Venezuela Caracas, Venezuela, Wow, yeah, hey. How are you doing how you doing over there, pretty bad yeah I would say pretty bad yeah sure, but we are fighting and it was one of the great countries and one of the richest countries not so long ago, 15 years ago, it's incredible, but we are gonna, make it right. I, agree with that and and we're helping you yeah yeah I, know and thank you. Go ahead. I have to question to take advance of this Maduro travel to Russia and geostatic a barrier to North Korea, two of the most antagonist nation in the US interests. What can be done to contain this? Where are they looking for in that country and because they're, special and boy mr. Evans said that the Russian are willing to negotiate it? This is one question and the other. Mr. president, you say that the socialist is one of the biggest challenger. You say yesterday in the United Nation, but the region is far from from safe. Mother is still a dictator full in power ban and in Argentina and Brazil are under threat about the Socialists and populism. Are you worried about it? Well, I just say that socialism will never happen in the United. States can't happen in the United States and Venezuela. Unfortunately, I have to use your country as the example of what socialism can do, how it can tear the fabric of a country apart because I know a lot about Venezuela I've had many, many friends of mine come from Venezuela. They live many in Miami. A certain section of Miami I won't mention the name because they'll say I'm thinking about my business and I'm not, but they are fantastic people and they, like your president, they've voted overwhelmingly for me. They like what I'm doing for Venezuela. We have Venezuela very much in our hearts and very much in our sights and we're watching it very carefully, and you know what I would say we're giving millions and millions of dollars in aid, not that we want to from the Maduro standpoint, but we have to because on a humanitarian people are dying, they have no food, they have no water, they have no nothing, they die, no medicine, their hospitals are closed or or don't even have electricity. It's so sad to see. Let me just say that we have it under control, we're watching it very carefully and we're going to be very, very really we're watching it very carefully, including other countries that may or may not be playing games. We're watching it very much. You know if Rocha is talking with USA or wide or okay. What can you tell just put this? In the back of your mind, it's all gonna be fine. We know everything that you said and it's all gonna be fine, we're very much involved. We very much know what's going on and we're very much in whoa, okay. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
