Mtv Video Music Awards, the VMAs Taylor, was there Liz Oh Shawn Mendes, but despite all of that, everybody this morning is talking about another John Travolta mix up here's. What happened! Taylor Swift won a VMA yeah, so in her video for you need to calm down it features a group of drag queens and Taylor brought a bunch of them on stage with her. As you can see, one of the performers there is Jade Jolie who's, a Taylor, Swift impersonator, but Jonny T apparently got a little mixed up and thought that was the actual Taylor Swift. You know it's hard to take that one back right. It's like! Oh sorry! As we know, this is not the first John Travolta award show faux pas. Yeah he's got kind of like a history of doing this sort of thing right. Yes, you may recall the Oscars idina menzel was to perform. Let it go of the iconic song from frozen. Let it go introduced her as and here is adele dazeem yeah, which I think for a solid year after that's exactly what idina menzel was known as everybody was making that joke, and you remember years previous to that it was I- think the Golden Globes. He won a Golden Globe and forgot to thank his wife, Kelly Preston, going through his acceptance speech, the camera just kept going to Kelly waiting for that recognition, yeah and it never came and I think it was even registering on her on her face. Going he's not gonna. Tell me everything. So the question begs is John Travolta. Is he the greatest thing or the worst thing for a watch? Oh my gosh, like I, would think he would say I'm out guys, but everyone's saying stay him. Oh no you're making the highlight reel every as a matter of fact Jon we got a ticket book for you for Calgary for the Canadian Country, Music Awards, and a couple of weeks here on global okay. We need you.
