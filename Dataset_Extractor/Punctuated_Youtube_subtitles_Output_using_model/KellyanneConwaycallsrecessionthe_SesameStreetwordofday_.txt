In front because it's nice to see the media finally cover the Trump economy, you seem to cover it only when you can use the Sesame Street word of the day, recession and so you're, using a tweet here or a report there or an economists words here and there. The fact is, the fundamentals of our economy are very strong and you know it there. We have more people working in this country right now than ever before. In the nation's history, we have more people coming off the sidelines, going back to work. We have people who don't just have job availability, but now they have job security. In fact, they have job mobility. They can go and try to compete for one of the other, seven million-plus jobs that are available apart for the one they may already have, or the part-time one they may have, or one that doesn't have sufficient benefits or is too far from home for them, so that they've got all these choices. It's called freedom and free market contrast that to Medicare for all in green new deals and taxes for everyone else and free healthcare for illegal immigrants. That would tank our economy, and everybody knows that so the fundamentals of strong I would also say that consumer confidence is very high. The optimism is there, but again you don't have a magic wand to say and now we're in a recession. Last one.
