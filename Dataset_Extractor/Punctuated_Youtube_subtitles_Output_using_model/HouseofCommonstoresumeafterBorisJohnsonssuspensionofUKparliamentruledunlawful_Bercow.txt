Good afternoon, I welcome the on screen judgment this morning of the Supreme Court. That's judgment is unanimous. That judgment is unambiguous and that judgment is unqualified. As you all now know, that judgment is that the probation of parliament was unlawful, unlawful because it's prevented or frustrated Parliament in the discharge of its core duties, and it did so at a crucial time for our country. The citizens of the UK are entitled to expect that Parliament does discharge its core functions, that it is in a position to scrutinize the executive, to hold ministers to account and to legislate if it chooses. In the light of that explicit judgment, I have instructed the house authorities to prepare not for the recall the prorogation was unlawful and is void to prepare for the resumption of the business of the House of Commons. Specifically, I have instructed the house authorities to undertake such steps as are necessary to ensure that the House of Commons sits tomorrow and that it does so at 11:30 a.m. I have contacted party leaders and where that has not been possible senior representatives of political parties in order to inform them of my thinking and to prepare the way for the House of Commons to do its work owing to notification requirements with which I'm sure you're all closely familiar, it will not be possible for the to be a Prime Minister's Questions tomorrow, however, for the avoidance of doubt, there will be full scope for urgent questions for ministerial statements and for applications for emergency debates, understanding order, number 24. Colleagues I. Thank you for your interest and I hope. You will agree that the position is clear and unmistakable good afternoon.
