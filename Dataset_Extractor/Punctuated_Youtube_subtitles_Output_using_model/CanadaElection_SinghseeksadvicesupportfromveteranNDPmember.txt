Our micro Couture is on the NDP campaign, trail Mike. Well, Robin. It was a bit more of a relaxed morning for jug meets Singh before he began preparing for Monday's all-important english-language leaders debate. He did have one public event where he partnered with a party stalwart from the past, hoping to channel that into votes for the future. I always say this yet, but you want to I, want to be when I grow up, because I love, how like you've always been so helpful. Supportive Singh met up with former NDP leader Ed Broadbent at a farmers. Market Broadbent was once considered one of the most popular politicians in Canada when he led the party in the 70s and 80s. The two men walked around the stands meeting people and taking pictures. The photo-op was orchestrated to pump up Singh's profile in Ottawa and be a symbolic image of the old guard of the party supporting the new face. It was also an opportunity for the seasoned political minds to give Singh some advice ahead of the all-important English debate: I'm, not exactly an expert in French, but I fought. It followed the debate the whole time and he did superbly and if he repeats that he'll be a winner for sure he's. The expert here he said be myself, so I'm gonna try my best, but what we've really tried to do in this campaign is to be the voice for people. A lot of people feel like they're not being heard now. Monday's debate is extremely important for saying it's his first nationally televised debate as a federal leader and likely his best opportunity to convince voters to vote for the NDP, and it comes at a time when the party remains a distant third in the polls.
