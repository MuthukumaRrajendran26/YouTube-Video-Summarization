September 27th 1967 I was here promoting the motion picture and one would say, but we're in in T Oland and how come at the lakeshore Motel where's the salt. How does this get the Easy Rider of it? Is it just? Was there that's when the story came and I paid attention to it? Why I have to do this journey? Why I have to save these girls I, just like didn't think about my children. I think I bought my sister and myself how we were just hung out to dry and we can't let that happen and there's all you know right now and in the country there's an idea of trying to repair family of the idea, family, whatever happens, he's paying a car than that right, miss hope, I'm, just realizing I, don't know enough about anything to say no.
