It appears to be business as usual here at the Gilliam RCMP detachment, no officers gearing up in camo, no large firearms, no more manhunt police say the nationwide search is finally over. The discovery was made around 10:00 a.m. yesterday, and it took about ten hours before the bodies were transported by boat from a secluded area of northern Manitoba. A spa locals say, is too dangerous to access by foot. It's not clear how Brier schmegle skiing can MacLeod got there, but we do know police spotted a boat on the river, which is what drew police to the area in the first place. But haven't said if the boat is tied to the murder suspects, and that's just one of the many questions that still remain, the bodies are now in Winnipeg for autopsy Joe, Scarpelli, Global, News.
