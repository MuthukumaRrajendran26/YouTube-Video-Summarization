Taxes are always a big part of campaign promises, but they loom especially large in this election for the Liberals and the Conservatives. It's mostly about lowering taxes. Both parties have promised broad tax cuts that would each cost around six billion dollars a year and leave around 300 to 400 dollars more per year in the pockets of the average taxpayer. The Conservatives are also saying they will eliminate carbon pricing and the GST on home heating costs and introduce a long list of tax credits on things like public transportations and green home renovations. When it comes to tax increases, the focus has mainly been on taxing the rich. The Liberals want a luxury tax for Canadians, buying cars, boats and aircraft, valued at $100,000 or more. The NDP and the Greens propose attacks on wealth over twenty million dollars and hiking taxes on capital gains, which would mostly affect the wealthy. It's a long list and those are just some of the promises. But how will these tax changes play out? Will they make a difference and are they a good idea? Although the conservative and the liberal plans would cost about the same amount in lost tax revenues, those benefits would go to different people under the two plans. The conservative plan would give a bigger tax cut to Canadians, who receive higher incomes. Result of that is to get the full benefit under the conservative plan. You'd have to be earning about $50,000 or more that's quite a bit of money. We contrasted. The liberal plan gives roughly the same amount to most Canadian taxpayers today, except for the very top of the income distribution, and it's important to remember that we don't have a lot of information on some of these tax promises and with tax policy. Often the devil is in the detail. That's your money! One. Two three four, this week, I'm Erica aleni.
