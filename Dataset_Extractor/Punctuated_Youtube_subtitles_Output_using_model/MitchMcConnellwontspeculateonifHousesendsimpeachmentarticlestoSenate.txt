Wait a minute: what we have here mm is an allegation related to Ukrainian aid by whistleblower. That's about all, we know now the way to handle it in the Senate at this particular point is the acting head of DNI. The acting D&I is coming up to the Intelligence Committee on Thursday. The Intelligence Committee in the Senate has a reputation for dealing with things in a responsible way and in a bipartisan way, and that's where it all starts in the Senate I'm gonna address all of these various hypotheticals that have been aired out about what may or may not happen in the house and I. Think all of that's quite premature. The good news is, it finally happened. I have no idea what precipitated the delay, but I was among those advocating that we needed to stick with our Ukrainian friends. I was not given an explanation. Fortunately, it finally happened and I'm glad about that. I'm, not sure why the delay, but the good news is the aid was released. Well, we're going to find out what happened in the Senate through a process pre established by the Intelligence Committee behind closed doors, initially with the Acting Director of Deana I. Think that's the responsible rather apolitical at least bipartisan way to proceed. What with what we think we know at this particular point.
