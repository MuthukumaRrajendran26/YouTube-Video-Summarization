Effective today, I am no longer leader of the Green Party of Canada, Elizabeth May hasn't hidden the fact she's done being a political leader, just not done with politics. I wanted to choose a moment when we had had a lot of success before leaving the party had high hopes of winning more seats in 2019, the Greens landed with free MPs in Ottawa and 6.4 percent of the popular vote. That's the best result for any Green Party in the world under first-past-the-post system. It's always been a challenge for greens to elect additional MPs because of the discriminatory electoral system. May a lifelong environmentalist took the helm of the party in 2006. It wasn't easy being green and a party of one. This is a woman who came in with a group of political activists and created a national party that could hold its own on the national stage. The new leader will be picked in October 2020 and will have to be election ready because the minority government could fall at any time. They will be hoping for candidates for the leadership who have a relatively high profile, who are known quantities at least regionally. Ideally nationally and have a strong reputation that can build on what Elizabeth May herself has has built. Thus far, the opening creates an opportunity for provincial green leaders. Who've had historic, wins, Quebec's, Alex Terrell is already considering what will be a tough job going beyond the existing pockets of support and building a stronger party is a real uphill challenge. In Canada's, first past the post electoral system may is staying put as an MP she's, even considering the speaker's job after the next election, but her first priority. You can't postpone the decision. It just makes sense. Thank you very much. Stepping aside for the sake of the party's fortunes, when the writ drops Robin Gill, Global, News, Vancouver,.
