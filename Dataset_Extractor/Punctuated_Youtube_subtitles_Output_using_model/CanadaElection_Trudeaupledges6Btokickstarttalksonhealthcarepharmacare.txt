Medications very expensive: they can't afford it. Three million Canadians, don't fill their prescriptions because they can't afford to I, tend to just get that I have to get and if I can't afford it I'll be perfect. We are announcing today a six billion dollar down payment over the next three years: a six billion dollar down payment, just to begin to negotiate with the provinces on big promises, Pharma care and a doctor or nurse practitioner for all, as well as mental health supports. So this is a historic moment. Actually, three of the federal parties have made a commitment to implementing universal public pharmacare. The greens and New Democrats are also promising pharmacare. The NDP are committing to ten billion dollars a year. No question Healthcare is top of mind for voters, but it's also under provincial jurisdiction. The feds need buy-in for provinces to roll anything out. There is a great desire to build a drug delivery program which is based on need and not ability to pay. This is what Universal pharmacare offers. So it's interesting that that there was not a single province. That said no to us today, Trudeau slammed Ontario Premier Doug Ford, by name more than a dozen times, so the question becomes for Canadians. Who do you want negotiating with Doug Ford? When it comes to your health, it could be very expensive and right now, what we have are just essentially some a little bit of information about how much the the federal government would be willing to inject into the system. The Liberal government's own advisory council on pharmacare peg the cost at fifteen billion dollars a year, but when asked by reporters today, Trudeau offered no costing and no specifics on a time frame: abigail Beeman, Global, News, Hamilton, Ontario,.
