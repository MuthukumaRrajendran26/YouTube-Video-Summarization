To Boeing 737 max crashes over the past year claimed a total of 346 lives. This final report on the line air crash pinpoints two major technical issues: a faulty sensor on the plane's nose and as suspected in both crashes problems with Boeing's M Cass flight control system and Cass pushes the aircraft nose down. If the sensor thinks the nose is pointing up too much. The report also says an MKS error also meant the pilots were not warned of the faulty sensor that Boeing failed to inform pilots about the EM caste system and that Boeing misjudged how pilots would react to its behavior earlier this week it emerged. Boeing's. Pilots knew about MKS issues as early as 2016 pilot was not aware to the mcat system and they cannot identify what happened on the on the flight, since they did not recognize to the what happened to the aircraft, but the pilots themselves didn't escape. Blame the captain fought the plane for control before handing over to the inexperienced copilot just before the crash. Just as damning was the finding that line air should have grounded the plane after it had similar issues a day before those pilots failed to properly report what had happened. The report also says the sensor was likely poorly calibrated by the supplier and improperly installed by Lyon air doctor. Breathing factors is items s connected each other that in if one of them is not occurring on this day, the accident may be may not happen. Relatives of the victims complained, the blame is being spread too thinly. Boeing hopes the 737 max will be cleared to fly again by New Year's Redman Shannon Global News London.
