Jeongmi Singh is promising free dental care with a plan he says, will help 4.3 million Canadians and can roll out as early as next year. One in three Canadians have no coverage at all. This is a serious concern. Now Singh says this plan will cost about 860 million dollars a year for tax payers more in the beginning, as Canadians get up to speed with the program. Anyone with a household income who is uninsured under seventy thousand dollars a year would get free dental care and those with household incomes between seventy and ninety thousand dollars a year would be eligible for part of a sliding scale. Co-Payment program I asked the NDP leader where this money will come from for the second day in a row he answered by slamming the Trudeau government for their choices, saying the new Democrats will make better choices, but he didn't go into any specifics.
