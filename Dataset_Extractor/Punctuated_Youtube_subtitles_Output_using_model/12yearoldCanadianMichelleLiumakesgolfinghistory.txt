She kind of looks like a kid who snuck out onto the course until you see her swing. Michelle Leo is nervous this week, but not out of place. Definitely gonna be a challenge for me. In my mental game to be able to, you know, focus and like keep my mind on like each and every shot leo earned her spot this week, she qualified by finishing as the lowest Canadian in the Canadian Women's Amateur Tournament last month. Well, she's, making history just by showing up. She is the youngest golfer to ever play in this country's national championship. In fact, she's beating the record by two years see if Brooke can make this birdie a record held by one of Michelle's idols. Brooke henderson was just 14 when she first played in the Canadian Open today. Henderson is the defending champion and the reigning queen of Canadian golf. When Henderson won last year. She ended a 45 year. Drought for this country, we'll use a big fan, partly because of Henderson success and partly because she doesn't know a whole lot about Canadian golf history because, like I, really saw like a lot of Canadians being like up there on the leaderboard Michelle did meet Henderson this week, no word on whether she got any tips. But Henderson says one of the challenges for her when she was 14 was trying not to be starstruck just walking around the clubhouse with the best players in the world when you're 14 years old, trying not to ask for autographs I think was probably the hardest thing. You may be small in stature, but she crushes the ball off the tee. She already hits it about 230 yards she's a long shot this week, but may have a long future in the game.
