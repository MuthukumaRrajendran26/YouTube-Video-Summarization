Police say: another item was discovered in a secluded area along the Nelson River close to where two bodies were found on Wednesday six RCMP search-and-rescue members could be seen on a boat heading towards the site, with metal detectors and other investigative equipment. Any trace or items belonging to the two BC murder suspects can help answer some crucial questions that remain in this case. After several hours, police then returned to where schmegle, ski and McLeod's torched rav4 was spotted but didn't find anything they're determining a motive may be tough. You know you want to be able to link people to certain property. Can we link someone to a crime? Can we find their trail? You know these people make movies that they make leave, notes something information might come from somewheres from some sorts they may have talked to someone prior to them, leaving, like you say, there's still a lot of people. We probably need to speak to a lot of pieces to put together. That's when you put it all up together. So wait a minute this. This could be an idea police believe the autopsies have been completed and BC RCMP should have the results. Next week, though, it's not clear if the RCMP will make those autopsy results.
