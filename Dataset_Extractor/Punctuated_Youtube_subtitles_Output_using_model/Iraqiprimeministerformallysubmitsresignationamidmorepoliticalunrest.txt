Chaos and bloodshed have spread across Iraq in the southern part of the country. Protestors tried to storm a local police station, they were met with live ammunition, scores were killed and dozens more injured, adding to the grim toll of two months of violence and instability. Since the beginning of October, at least 400 people have been killed in a bid to temper the violence, Iraqi Prime Minister Adele Abdul Mahdi announced he will resign. It comes a day after more than 40 protesters were killed, and shortly after the country's senior Shiite Muslim cleric urged lawmakers to reconsider their support of the government. The news caused protesters to break out in song and dance, but Abdul Mahdi's departure will not be enough to satisfy their demands. He is only part of the problem. Only a broken piece in a chess game said this civil rights activists all must leave. The entire government should leave because they are responsible for the bloodshed said this man. The protesters, mostly young and unemployed, want a complete overhaul of Iraq's political system which has ruled since the fall of Saddam Hussein. They say it's too corrupt, too focused on serving foreign interests, including Iran, which backs the current government. After weeks of rage, there is no end in sight to the violence. The country's religious leaders have warned if the fighting doesn't stop. Iraq risks, civil war and a possible return to dictatorship. Jackson prosto, Global News.
