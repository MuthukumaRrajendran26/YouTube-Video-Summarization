It would be completely unfair to do this Halloween story and draw from another holiday to save draw parallel with the Grinch again. That would be completely unfair to materials mayor we want to be proactive. Valarie plant is not canceling Halloween and holds no hatred for the holiday. The mayor announced with a tweet she's, just postponing it one day, suggesting kids of all sizes trick-or-treat tomorrow, instead well, initially I thought it was hilarious, meteorologist, Anthony, Farr analysis. He was a little shocked at first, but then looked at the frightful forecast, it's a combination of the wettest weather ever recorded in Montreal and on October 31st, along with strong gusts, a dangerous combination. That's when it gets to be that next level of seriousness and and probably a good idea to just hold off and keep the kids at home know. This won't surprise anyone, but a lot of kids right now are questioning the mayor's judgment to change the world ride celebration because, like for example, on Christmas, you wouldn't change that a different day and the Halloween you probably should not either I just rather go both days both days. Is that an option? My day we went out in snow now for parents there are two sides, those who are having a little trouble with this postponement. It's Halloween, it's not tomorrow, so yes, I'm going anyway, and there are others who agree with it. For safety and slightly selfish reasons, Oh had to happen, it's gonna be unsafe and you guys I just don't want to go out in the rain. There is the chance. This is win-win for kids, they'll, be drier and get more loot who wouldn't want a trick-or-treat after stores, cut their prices and put candy on sale. My carbs are global news. Montreal.
