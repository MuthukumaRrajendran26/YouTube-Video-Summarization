No, no I don't care public; they should be public. What I said it was misreported as usual. What I said is very simple: there shouldn't be anything there shouldn't be. A Pietschmann hearings is what I said. So maybe they misconstrued it or what I say is read the transcript. It's all about the transcript they're having people I, never even heard of some of these people, I, don't know who they are and by the way, it's all third hand knowledge, but regardless of what anyone says, read the transcript now they want to have a transcript of the other call. The second call and I'm willing to provide that we'll probably give it to you on Tuesday, Monday, being a holiday will probably give it to you on Tuesday, but we have another transcript coming out, which is very important. They asked for it and I gladly give it there's never been a president who's been so transparent. This is a witch-hunt at the highest level and it's so bad for our country. But here's the deal read the transcript you'll see the call now I'll give you a second transcript, because I actually had two calls with the president of Ukraine. So you'll read the second go and you'll tell me if you think there's anything wrong with it, but never in history. Has anybody gone through this? It's a witch hunt and it should never happen to another president. Thank you.
