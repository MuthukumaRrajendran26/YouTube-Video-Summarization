It's another uncertain evening up and down the coast of Florida with Dorian's path and timing still questionable at this point, it seems like Tuesday is the most likely point of arrival, but the system continues to slow, where exactly it might, land remains an open question, and so the entire East Coast of Florida is on edge. We've seen a run on supplies at stores. Here many of the shelves for essentials like bread and water are completely empty. At this point, most gas stations have already run dry and again we're several days away. From the arrival of this storm, we've heard that the airport in Orlando will be shutting down its operations at 2:00 a.m. on Monday. The governor has also announced that fuel tankers will be moving out under police escort to try and reinforce supplies before the storms arrival. But the bottom line is it's still a waiting game and a guessing game. People don't know whether or not to stay put or whether they should leave their homes. They don't know what exactly to stock up on at this point, because so much of Dorian is uncertain. The only thing that is known is that it is a monster of a storm churning offshore and getting ever closer by the day. Jackson prosecco, Global, News, Cocoa Beach Florida.
