I'm very excited to be here, and it's going to be very much fun today and to once again stand together, people from all around the world for one common, because that is very empowering and it is very moving to see everyone, everyone who is so passionate to to March and strike people of all ages, all generations so yeah, it is very- is this very good day? I would say my message to to all the politicians around the world is it's the same, just listen and act on the best available, United science Thanks, it's electric here really, there's thousands of people, young people, adults signs everywhere, we're just on this! The root of the the rally so they'll be coming through here soon, but a lot of excitement a lot of energy down here. Climate change is too important to play. Politics with this is all of our futures. We know it's already happening now. We know if we don't have things are only gonna get worse. We're gonna see you know. I was just at the zoo, for example, last weekend with my kids and already I'm, seeing signs everywhere, they're saying: beware of ticks, beware of lining and health problems. These things are gonna affect all of us in our future. So it's time for everybody to step up all political, but together we'll finally change plans. You know we do have, as you said three of the four parties who are now committing to really bold ambitious plans, but unfortunately, concerns have not been I, hope, they'll, reconsider and either way, Canadians have a chance to make their voices heard at the polls in just a few weeks, Turner we're gonna fight. You.
