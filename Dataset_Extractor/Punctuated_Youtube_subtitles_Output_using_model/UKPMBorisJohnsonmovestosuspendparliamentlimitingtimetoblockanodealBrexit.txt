Thank you well, thank you very much for coming in, as I said on the steps of Downing Street. We're not gonna, wait until October the 31st before getting on with our plans to take this country forward, and this is a new government with a very exciting agenda to make our streets safer. It's very important. We bring violent crime down, we need to invest in our fantastic NHS. We need to level up education funding across the country. We need to invest in the infrastructure. That's gonna take this country forward for four decades and we need to deal with the cost of living moving to a high wage, higher productivity economy, which is I, think what this country needs to be, and to do that we need new legislation. We've got to be bringing forward new and important bills, and that's why we are going to have a queen speech and we're gonna. Do it on October, the 14th and we've got to move ahead now with a new. That is completely untrue. If you look at what we're doing we're, bringing forward a new legislative programme on crime on hospitals and making sure that we have the education funding that we need- and there will be ample time on both sides of that crucial October, the 17th summit ample time in Parliament for MPs to debate the EU to play brexit and all the other issues not have a majority even with the DUP, only barely has a majority. Should we take from this that you are planning a general election before the end of this year? No, what did you take from this is what we're doing exactly what I said on the steps of Downing Street, which is that we must get on now with our legislative domestic agenda. People will expect our people do. I will do we need to get on with the stuff that that Parliament needs to approve on tackling crime on building the infrastructure we need on technology, leveling up our education and and reducing the cost of living. That is why we need a queen speech and where we're going, we're gonna get on with it, whether you're going to get a deal and the outlook could be quite different, whether you do or whether you don't so. What have you got to say to the public who may be concerned about the economic we need to get on with her with with our domestic agenda and that's why we're Lansing a Queen's Speech for October, the 14th? Ok, thank you.
