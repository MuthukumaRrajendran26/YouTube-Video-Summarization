Day, one of the ceasefire was anything but peaceful along parts of the syria-turkey border. Shelling and intermittent clashes continue to be reported around Russia align the fighting eased mid-morning and the five-day ceasefire agreed by turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and US Vice President Mike Pence appears to be holding it's designed to allow the Kurds to retreat, which is exactly what Iran wanted. It comes after Donald, Trump's bizarre letter to Iran, saying don't be a fool. Mister, we won't forget the letter said Erwin. What is necessary will be done when the time is right. He said Herman also detailed plans to occupy the so-called safe zone in Syria, even after the conflict in Washington Trump sang the praises of a situation triggered by his decision to pull US troops from the region.
