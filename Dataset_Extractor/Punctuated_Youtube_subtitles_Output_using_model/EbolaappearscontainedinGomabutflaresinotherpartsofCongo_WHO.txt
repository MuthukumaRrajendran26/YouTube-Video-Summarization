Over again, over the last couple of weeks, we've seen whirring extensions of the disease. You will all have seen that we've had the cluster of cases. A moranga to the south of bukavu. We've had a a case in pinga, which is a very difficult and an accessible area to the north east of coma in pinga to the north east of coma, which is still part of the overall chromosome we've had one confirmed case. The challenge in this case is that this case has no apparent epidemiologic links to other cases and no recent travel outside our visitors from outside. So this case is a little bit of an outlier and we've been working very hard to identify a possible source of infection, and we obviously need to ensure that we haven't had another spillover from the forest or from a zoonotic or animal source, and that's currently under investigation and there's further testing going on in genetic sequencing. Positively we haven't seen secondary transmission in Goma represents a huge credit to the teams on the ground. Then the city, the size of Goma, we're approaching the end of the observation period for all of the contexts, with no evidence of further transmission within the metropolitan area. There also to be frank, negative voices out there. There are negative social media campaigns. People who've tried to convince populations that the vaccine is used to infect you and the therapeutics are used to finish you off, and there are whatsapp groups and many social media conversations that are going on at that level, and populations like in every country in the world are exposed to both the positive and the negative media around any intervention like this, and we need to be smarter and quicker and more effective at having our message heard and listened to by communities. So they have a choice. Communities always have a choice.
