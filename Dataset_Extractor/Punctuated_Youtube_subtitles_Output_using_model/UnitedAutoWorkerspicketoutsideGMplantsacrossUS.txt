Well, you know nobody wants to be a little sprite. You know everybody is unhappy because corporation they're made a whole lot of money. You know no we're not asking for a whole lot. You know we have a lot of young families in there. Well, we have temporary workers, they don't know from day-to-day week-to-week whether they have a job and that's no way to live.
