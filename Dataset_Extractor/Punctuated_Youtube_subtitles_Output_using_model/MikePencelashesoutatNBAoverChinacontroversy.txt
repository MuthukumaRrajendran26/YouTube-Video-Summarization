Nike promotes itself as a so-called social justice champion, but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door. Nike stores in China actually removed their Houston Rockets merchandise from their shelves to join the Chinese government in protest against the Rockets general managers. Seven-Word tweet, which read fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong and some of the NBA's biggest players and owners who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of the people of China, in siding with the Chinese Communist, Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of elite. That authoritarian regime I'm pleased to observe that Hong Kong authorities have withdrawn the extradition bill that sparked the protests in the first place and Beijing has shown some restraint in the days ahead. I can assure you the United States will continue to urge China to show restraint, to honor its commitments and respect the people of Hong Kong to the millions in Hong Kong who have been peacefully demonstrating to protect your rights these past months. We stand with you. We are inspired by you and we urge you to stay on the path of non-violent protest.
