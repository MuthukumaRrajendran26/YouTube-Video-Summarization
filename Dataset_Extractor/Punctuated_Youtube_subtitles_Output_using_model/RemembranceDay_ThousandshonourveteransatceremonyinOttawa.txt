During a bombing of Syria beau deployed to Rwanda and Kelly during the the genocide I serve as the second in command of the NATO role 3 hospital in Canada. We were part of the group that sank that lasted active Nazi. Battleship closest to the ceremony sit the veterans with the longest history. There are so few here who fought in the Second World War Alex palawan is 94 I served on three ships on two of them on the last man standing and so I owe them something. I got to keep the memory alive to be here is privileged and you pay for it because it's cold and uncomfortable, then you remember a lot of things that are not pleasant. Bill Anderson is 97. We should get out and be here, so people can look and can say they were there a powerful moment when Anderson and other Second World War vets stand and salute during the national anthem and as veterans, military members and cadets marched in the parade. The Prime Minister Governor General and the Silver Cross mother looked on World War, 1 and World War two. This is probably the one that comes to mind all the time that monument is there since then there, but you know, there's modern veteran now and they're as important as the one that, beyond and they're the one that the crown now has to look to very marvelous to see them, but turnout yeah, very important to us all. Thank you very much. The Royal Canadian Legion estimates 32,000 people paused to remember in our nation's capital, Abigail Beeman, global news, Ottawa.
