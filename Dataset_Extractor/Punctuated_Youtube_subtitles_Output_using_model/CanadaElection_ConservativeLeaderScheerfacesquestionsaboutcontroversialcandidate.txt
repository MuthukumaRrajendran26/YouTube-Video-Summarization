At the end of a tough week, conservative leader, Andrew Scheer gets a chance to refresh and reset. First with a mourning ceremony, consecrating a new Buddhist temple, the largest Buddhist temple in North America at the ceremony. Shearer is given a Chinese name in English, shears Chinese name means peace, prosperity and wisdom from there, a whistle-stop with a small business owner who thinks government should do more to help him find skilled employees. More immigration he says, would help the closing one day of the week, because we cannot feel that feeling and finally, a stroll, through a street festival in a riding, the tories hope to steal from the Liberals a peaceful finish to a week which went downhill fast with Wednesday's French language debate. In Montreal it was shears first chance to go toe-to-toe with Liberal leader, Justin Trudeau, but Shearer struggled in French. It's a second language, and there was broad consensus in the Quebec media that the Conservative leader got pummeled. Then sheer faced questions about his dual citizenship. Shearer is both the Canadian and an American, though he said he is in the process of renouncing his American citizenship and late Friday. The campaign was forced to fire a candidate in a riding in British Columbia that the party had a good chance of winning the candidate there. Heather Leung was dropped after the NDP, dug up videos and news stories in which she made homophobic slurs. How did your vetting process mitt the homophobic comments at wrong video? Well, as you know, it's been fired from our campaign and Russia will be off the campaign trail on Sunday and he'll, be prepping for Monday's one, and only english-language TV debate. The only one of its kind before we vote on October 21st and for Shearer it'll be a fresh start, a chance to re-energize his campaign.
