To help in this effort, as the governor I'm authorized to provide a reward and we're doing so, a $25,000 reward for the apprehension, the arrest and the conviction of this individual- and we want to remind you the last thing I'll say is we need you to be vigilant. We need you to provide information. We need you to help law enforcement because it's very important to the state of Tennessee and to the citizens of our state that we apprehend it's important for the family of Deborah and we we appreciate all of your help in apprehending this very dangerous individual. So it's my understanding that someone did so Deborah had been in the department for 38 years. As I said earlier, she had a great relationship with both staff and inmates in the T DLC system. Many a lot of inmates knew who Deborah was. She was very personable and she was very respected with the inmate population in regards to this particular inmate I. Don't have any knowledge of specific communications or a direct link with the inmate, but it's not uncommon for her to know these inmates that work on the property she lived. Sure we have had we've had now over 75 tips that placed the suspect in a number of places throughout the state, as well as other states, and so we are following up on every tip that we receive the ones that we feel are most credible. We're checking them first and then we're working from that. But there have been a number of alleged sightings. We have yet to locate him at any of those places that we've been reported.
