Good afternoon we begin with breaking news to Port Alberni teenagers thought to be missing are now considered suspects in the deaths of three people in northern BC. With more on this shocking twist, we are joined by Romina daya Romina police just provided an update. What's the latest information sonia is just moving at a stunning pace at this point. Just incredible news this morning that the missing teens are now considered suspects in connection to three bodies found in the course of a week in northern BC last week, cam McCloud and Breyers Miguel, ski 18 and 19 years old, they're, both quite tall six for a hundred and sixty-nine pounds. They were last spotted in northern Saskatchewan driving a grey 2011 rav4. The new pictures we're showing you are actually taken from CCTV footage that is not a file shot of the vehicle. The suspects are believed to be in that van now. Rcmp are not saying where they were spotted they're, not pinpointing a location because they're telling us that that could jeopardize the investigation but they're not giving any details as to how that's a possibility at this point the teens could be anywhere. They may have changed their appearance. They may have also changed their vehicle. Yesterday, I asked specifically about cam, McCloud and briars from the kelskiy about whether or not they were suspects in the homicide. Yesterday, you looked at this. He told us that it was still a missing-persons case. What has changed significantly significantly since yesterday to make these two men suspects in three murders in one week? I think that is a testament of how dynamic and ever-changing the information is thanks to the public. Yesterday we had no information as to cam and briers whereabouts, and because we made the appeal yesterday, we now have new information where we've confirmed that they were seen in northern British. Columbia we've been able to confirm that information within the last 24 hours and I have been receiving new information honestly before I just stepped up on this stage. New information is still coming in now Sonia, the police are making a public appeal today, not just across this province but nationwide. For these teens they are saying that they are considered dangerous, they're, asking the public to exercise extreme caution and vigilance, and if you see them do not approach, you are asked to call 911 Romina Police says staying very tight-lipped about the cause of deaths in these three homicides. Do we know why, as I mentioned earlier, they're saying that if they release any more details, it could possibly jeopardize the investigation. What we do know, though, is that the double murder, the tourists from Australia and from the United States, that's Lucas, Fowler and Chyna DS. We know that they were shot. That's all police will say as far as the other individual, the unidentified man that was found near the teens camper van that was burned out. He was found about two kilometers away. We're all we're being told is that he was found dead, they're, not saying whether it's a homicide they're not calling it a suspicious death they're refusing to release any details about that person's death. Sonya Romina dia joining us with that breaking news. Thank you very much. Romina.
