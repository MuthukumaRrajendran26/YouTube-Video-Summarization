But we understand when we go to Mars and Americans are going to Mars we're gonna, have to develop new technologies, new equipment and gain new experience that we can only gain on the moon and the president fully endorses that. It's one of the reasons why we set the goal that we're going to return American astronauts to the moon in the next five years and then go on to Mars. President Trump wants to get back on the point of American leadership in human space exploration and and he wants to send a send America on an unalterable trajectory to put astronauts on Mars, and we all understand that to do that. First, we've got to have American rockets going up from American soil and literally within the next year. We'll have American astronauts going back into space from right here in the USA on American Rockets. Then it's to the moon, where we establish a presence. So this time, major, when we go to the moon, we're not we're not going to visit we're going to stay, we're gonna, develop resources, we're gonna, develop new methods, new technology and then it's on from the moon to Mars. The president's made it very clear that we're looking to NASA and to our traditional partners to develop their rockets and the technologies to get us to the moon within the next five years and to lay a foundation to go to Mars. But if our traditional partners can't do the job we're going to look to the private space industry to give us the rockets and the technology to get there. That's one of the most exciting things about American leadership in space today is the burgeoning private space industry. You have leaders like SpaceX and Blue Origin or developing all new technologies. Space tourism will be a reality for Americans.
