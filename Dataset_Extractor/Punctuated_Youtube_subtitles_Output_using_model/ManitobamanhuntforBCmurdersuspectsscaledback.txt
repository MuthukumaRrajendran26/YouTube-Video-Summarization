I know that today's news is not with the families of the victims and the communities of northern Manitoba wanted to hear the news that the search for Canada's two most wanted men is being drastically scaled back, taking into account all of the work so far. This come time to reassess our deployment of resources to the area. The Canadian Air Force is withdrawing its aircraft for the search police, say they've, canvassed every home in this town and the nearby Fox Lake Cree First Nation, an intense search for cam McCloud and briars Miguel ski the pair wanted for murder in the deaths of three people in northern British Columbia. More than a week ago after crossing the country by car into Manitoba, they disappeared, I'm, standing on the exact spot, where the two fugitives abandoned their vehicle and then apparently set it on fire. You could see the wide area here, that's been scorched by the extreme heat police, don't know why they did it or where the men went so today. Once again, the RCMP used a tracking dog and a tactical team in their search police, acknowledged they've, been relying on the public to try and find the suspects. They say, they've had more than 250 tips from people in the area, but none has panned out. Today's decision is not defeat, they say and they will keep some additional staff here. Police also admit it is possible. The men are no longer alive, we're keeping all possibilities in mind as we go forward with this. The town's mayor didn't want to criticize the RCMP s decision to scale back residents here had openly welcomed the large police and military presence, in the hope that if the men were found life here could go back to normal back to you.
