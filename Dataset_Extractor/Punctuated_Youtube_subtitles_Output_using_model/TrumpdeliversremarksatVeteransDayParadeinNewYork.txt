Thank you very much. Let us also show our profound appreciation to the 2019 grand marshals of the parade who have served in World War, two Korea Vietnam, the Gulf, War and Iraq this morning is more than 30,000 patriotic Americans lined the streets of Manhattan. We carry on a noble tradition that began one century ago in 1919, the people of this city filled the block after block to welcome home General Pershing and his 25,000 American soldiers, after victory in World War one just a few years before many of those soldiers had boarded ships not far from here at Hoboken port, more than four million Americans fought in the Great War and more than one hundred and sixteen thousand made the ultimate sacrifice. At the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, the Armistice was declared. The war had come to an end and the Allies achieved a great great victory every year since on November 11th, we have shared our nation's deepest praise and gratitude to every citizen who has worn the uniform of the American army, Navy Air, Force, Coast, Guard and Marines. We are profoundly moved to have with us veterans of World War, two, including one of the grand marshals, woody Williams. Thank you. Thank you woody. Thank you very much woody to each veteran of the war. The glory of your deeds will only grow greater with time. This city is graced by your presence. This nation is forever in your debt and we thank you all. We're also pleased to be joined by veterans of the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War and the war on terror. You are the reason our hearts well with pride, our foes tremble with fear and our nation thrives and freedom. Would you please stand so that we can honor your heroic service, please. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you all. Each year, this parade highlights one branch of our military. This year we honor the elite masters of air, land and sea, the legendary Leathernecks, the feared devil dogs, the first to flight, the United States Marines. Let's hear it yesterday we celebrated the Marines two hundred and forty fourth birthday. That's pretty good. The few and the proud are always faithful and they always win. I also want to thank the Marine Corps law enforcement foundation, which provides scholarships to children of our fallen heroes to every gold star family. We will stand by your side forever. That is very fitting that the Veterans Day Parade begin right here in New, York City, since the earliest days of our nation, New York has exemplified the American spirit and has been at the heart of our nation's story of daring and defiance on July, 2nd 1776. The British Armada sailed into New York Harbor, numbering more than 400 ships and carrying more than 30,000 men. The British came here to snuff out what they thought was just a minor american revolution didn't turn out to be that way, but the Redcoats did know what they did know was. They were going to have a problem, but they didn't know that New York would meet them with the fearsome power of American patriots in World War, one New York regiments, like Harlem Hellfighters, the Lost battalion and the fighting 69th were revered all over the globe during World War, two 63 million tons of supplies and more than three million service members shipped out of New York Harbor on September 11 2001. The whole world saw the horror and responded to America's wicked enemies, with unwavering courage, unbreakable spirit and resolve that is deeper than oceans, fiercer fed fires and stronger than steel. Last week, I was honored to award the presidential citizens medal to an extraordinary American Rick Rescorla Rick enlisted in the Army at the recruiting center in Times, Square became a great war hero in Vietnam and then became head of security at Morgan Stanley in the World Trade Center, when September 11th he saved 2,700 lives before giving his own. Today, we are immensely grateful to be joined by Rick's son Trevor Thank You Trevor. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you to Trevor in every 9/11 family. We pledge to never ever forget the towering spirit of strength that we see in this city lives within the heart of every American, warrior from the snow Valley Forge to the jungles of Vietnam, from the forests of Bella wood to the beaches of Normandy, from the mountains of Afghanistan to the deserts of Iraq. That spirit has helped our fighters defeat, tyrants, conquer fascism, vanquish communism and face down terrorism. Just a few weeks ago, American special forces raided the Isis compound and brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice. Thanks to American warriors al-baghdadi is dead. His second in charge is dead. We have our eyes on number three. His reign of terror is over and our enemies are running. Very, very scared. Thank you. Thank you. Those who threaten our people don't stand a chance against the righteous might of the American military. In a few weeks, we will mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, our nation's bloodiest battles of World War, two more than 47,000 Americans were wounded and 19,000 gave their last breath for their country. We are proudly joined today by a veteran of the Battle of the Bulge, a native New Yorker, who is 94 years old and still going very, very strong, corporal Jack Foy. They look good jack. You look good Jack enlisted in the Army right out of high school. He fought through brutal months of the campaign in northern France on Christmas Eve. After marching nearly 100 miles in the snow and sub-zero temperatures, he arrived outside the town of Bastogne and Belgium for two weeks, Jack fought under ceaseless artillery fire and helped push the enemy back from a critical Road. At one point a mine blew up and it destroyed his vehicle badly hurting many. He was wounded three times, but he kept on fighting after the Allied victory at the Battle of the Bulge. Jack fought for the remaining nine months of the war across the Siegfried line up the mosel river through the Rhineland and all the way across Germany until he reached the gates of Ord roof concentration camp, the firts Nazi camp to be liberated. That was number one. That was a big big event, as Jack has said about the Battle of the Bulge, when the chips were down and the situation was desperate, the American soldiers stood up to be counted for a brief moment in history. These men held our nation's destiny in their hands. We did not fail. Thank you very much and corporal Foy. We will forever be proud of what you and your fellow soldiers achieved for all of humanity. Also here with us today, his Loren Matthews, the grand daughter of a battle of the Bulge veteran who has since passed away. His name was Master Sergeant, Roddie Edmonds, like so many of our veterans. Rowdy, never talked about the war. Laura never knew her grandfather story until she embarked upon a school project. About ten years ago, rowdy was in the 420 2nd regiment, which was overwhelmed when the Nazis launched their surprise assault. He and his men fought for 3 treacherous days before being taken as prisoners of war. After they arrived at a prison camp, the German commander sent an order over the loudspeaker. The Jewish American soldiers were all told to step out of line during roll call the next day, knowing the terrible fate that would come to his Jewish comrades. Rowdy immediately said we're not doing that. He said two orders to have every American step out of line with their Jewish brothers in arms. The next morning, 1292 Americans stepped forward the German commander stormed over to rowdy and said they cannot all be Jews rowdy stared right back. He said we are all Jews here. At that point, the German put a gun to rotties head and demanded. You will order the Jews to step forward immediately or I will to shoot you right now. Through the head, rowdy responded major, you can shoot, but you'll have to kill us all. The German turned red got very angry but put his gun down and walked away. Master Sergeant Edmonds saved 200 Jewish Americans soldiers that day so proud to be Jewish and so proud of our country. Lauren. Thank you for being here today, as we remember your grandfather's, unbelievable and exceptional valor Lauren. Please stand up. Thank you very much one of the 200 Jewish American soldiers who were saved that fateful day is Staff Sergeant, Lester, Tanner Lester is now 96 years old and he joins us here boy. You guys are looking very good. 96 Lester, you're, really 96, Lester I, don't believe you're looking good. Thank you very much. Thank you also for your very noble service and for sharing this incredible story with the world. Thank you very much. Listening the men and women who have donned our nation's uniforms are the bravest, toughest strongest and most virtuous warriors ever to walk on earth. You left your families and fought in faraway lands. You came face-to-face with evil and you did not back down. You returned home from war and you never forgot your friends who didn't return, including prisoners of war and those missing in action every day you think of them and pray for them.
