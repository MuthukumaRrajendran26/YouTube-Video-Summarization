Over the next few weeks, we will be comprehensively reviewing the recommendations and developing a government-wide approach to address them. I want you to know that I feel for all of you and I want you to know that the government is here to support you as recommended by Justice Scalia. We will provide counseling services to the surviving victim and the victims, families and loved ones for two years following the inquiries conclusion today. This was never in question. Additionally, as recommended by Justice Scalia, our government will formally submit a report to the Ontario legislature to be tabled in jail, July 31st 2020, as well as continued updates leading up to that submission. We will spend the next year acting on what we've heard here today and part of that plan will include providing new funding to help address the recommendations by the Commissioner. We will consult with the long-term care subcommittee of the Premier's Council on approving healthcare and ending call weight medicine, as we take action on the recommendations.
