I've been looking for freedom, I've been looking so long, I've been looking for freedom. Still, the search goes on. Why do people still believe that I had something to do with bringing down the wall? I had nothing to do with bringing down the wall. I I say a song called I've been looking for freedom. It happened to be the right song at the right time and I capitalized on that, because I realized the severity and the horrible dehumanization of these people, because I went there and they were singing my song and they looked at me as a hero and I became a hero because I had to become a hero. It was God gave me Knight. Rider God gave me a lot of good things. God gave me a lot of bad things, but God gave me the power to help. People have hope and that's what that song is about. It's about hope and I'm, still singing a 30 years later, and it's still very pertinent, but nobody in America knew what was really going on. They didn't understand, I understood because I'd been there and I saw the people hugging and I saw everyone. Crying I saw, keep it on the wall. People on the wall, we're singing my song and there was a band on the wall. I'm singing I like this and there's a bangor da da da horns playing looking for freedom. It was just a completely magical night that I remember every moment about it, because I knew that they would never come again. If something like this will probably happen. Only once in a lifetime that that night was families were reunited that night everybody got along and it would be really nice. If um, we could go back to New Year's Eve in 1989 and get the world to look at it. Walking down the road with my below Oh.
