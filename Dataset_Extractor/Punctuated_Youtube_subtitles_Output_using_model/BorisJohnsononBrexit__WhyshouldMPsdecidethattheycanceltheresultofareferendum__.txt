We've got a deal oven, ready by which we can leave the EU in just a few weeks. It's a great deal for this country. It delivers everything that I wanted. When I campaigned for brexit, we can leave the EU as one UK whole and entire and perfect, as we promised, and so it's been frankly mind-boggling in the last few weeks to see how Parliament first first voted to approve this deal and then voted for delay and I'm afraid that it is clear that if Parliament had its way, then this country would not be leaving even on January the 31st, and that, of course, is bad for democracy. It's disastrous for trust in politics. Why should MP's decide that they can cancel the result of a referendum? And if we can get this deal over the line with a sensible majority government, we certainly can. Then we can release that pent up flood of investment. Hundreds of billions are waiting to pour into the UK and we can inject a surge of confidence into our system, and that is our mission. If I come back here with a working majority in parliament, then I will get Parliament working again for you on day, one of the new Parliament in December. We will start getting our deal through, so we can get brexit done in January and unleash this country's potential I hope very much that you will support us. Let's get brexit done and unleash the potential of the whole United Kingdom. Thank you very much.
