The full force of Hurricane Dorian, now being felt here in downtown Halifax winds are whipping upwards of a hundred kilometers in per hour and they are bringing down tree branches and, in fact, entire large trees littering the streets. There are over two hundred thousand customers in the dark in Nova Scotia alone, and that's only going to go up as the full force is Affeldt over the next few hours. Landfall of this now category two hurricane expected later tonight, just east of here on the western side. It's the rain. It has been a relentless, a hundred and fifty to almost two hundred millimeters expected and that will cause flooding waves just off in the Atlantic ten to fifteen meters. This storm already has done damage from Bahamas through North Carolina and now inflicting more damage on Atlantic. Canada I'll have an update later this evening, I'm chief meteorologist Anthony Parnell.
