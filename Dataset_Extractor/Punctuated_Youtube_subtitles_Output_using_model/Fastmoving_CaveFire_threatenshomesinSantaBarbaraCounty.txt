What is the actualities as far as how close are those flames to the homes? No homes have been burned. A lot of homes came close over in the overnight hour down in San Antonio Creek Road. The fire made a push down that Canyon and there were some homes that were threatened. Montecito fire, Carpinteria, Sunland, Fire, Department, Santa, Barbara County in Santa, Barbara City saved some homes in that area. Is that fire pushed down that Canyon driven by those erratic winds and came within feet of several homes. Same thing office in Agitos, Road, the Santa Barbara City, Fire Department was doing structure protection there and they were assisted by LA County Fire Hawk helicopter that made a water drop and saved a home up on top see Nikita's as well. We're all thankful for the hard work that firefighters have been doing throughout the night and into the morning, as you can see we're on this two-lane road here. That is very windy. Lots of signs to slow down your speed as you go up. How is the terrain and even the ability for firefighters to get up this hill affecting their ability to fight the fire? Well, the problem with the fire is it started on East Camino Cielo, and then it started marching its way down towards 154. There's, really no real access between the two. We had to make our stand: 1:54 as it crossed downed off via chaparral and in the san antonio creek road and down oficina Ghita. So that's where the fire fighters made their stand and they did a good job of stopping those flames from advancing onto those homes. This area. Here it's a lot of no man's land in between the road on 154, as well as a communal CLO. So that's why that fire is just chewing through vegetation that hasn't burned in 30 years, since the painted cave fire in 1990. So this is old fuels that have been ready to burn for 30 years, which is probably the oldest fuel on the south coast. Since we've had numerous fires in between Oh.
