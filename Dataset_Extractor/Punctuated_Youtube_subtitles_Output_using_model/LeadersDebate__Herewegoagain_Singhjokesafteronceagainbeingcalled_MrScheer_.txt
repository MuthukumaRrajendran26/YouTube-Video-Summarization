For indigenous people, mr. Schurr, we'll start with those things well strut with you here we go again and I wore my orange turban again about anyways, though Casio ten, most serious. That's a very serious question. If you see what I've seen is mr. trudeau, he talks a lot of. He talks a good games publicly about the decisions he makes privately are the problem when it comes to indigenous communities. If there was a willingness to do something right away, it could be done it's as simple as that. If the decision was to fund indigenous kids the same way as other Canadian kids, that could be done, it shouldn't have to go to court. I would respect these communities. It's a matter of dignity. If you start with that recognition, it could solve so many problems. Equal funding. Thank you is the starting point. Thank you.
