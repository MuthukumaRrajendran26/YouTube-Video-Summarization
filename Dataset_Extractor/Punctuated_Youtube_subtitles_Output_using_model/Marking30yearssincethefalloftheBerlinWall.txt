In June 1961 East Germany's leader Volta Obrist, was asked if the rumors were true, the city would be split in two. Nobody has the intention of building a wall. He said two months later, the soft city border was closed up. The last route for East Germans to escape communism was gone over nice families, friends and neighbors were separated, and over years and decades one city became to accept it. You just had to accept the wall, says former East Berliner Dagmar, sim Dorn. In some ways the wall was the end of the world. She says: Angelika bondic lived a stone's throw away on the western side near a section that remains preserved. My husband used to drink a beer out here, he'd raise a glass to the guards, but they just stare back. She says it was easier for West Berliners to laugh. They could visit the east, but the so-called Ozzie's were locked in on November 9th 1989. Each hammer blow was filled with 28 years of emotion and when Sim Doren saw the first hole in the wall, it barely seemed real. It was almost like Alice in Wonderland. She says he just stood there with an open mouth Canadian Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney was the first Western leader to visit Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev. After the wall came down, there's been a revolution this taken place in thinking and in the lives of Nations in the last month, the by then unstoppable process led to the end of the Soviet Union and the Cold War. Today, the Berlin Wall is as much about tourism as it is a lesson of history where you can buy an authentic piece of the wall at your own risk. For some visitors, 30 years is more than a lifetime ago. I guess it's quite shocking to see how it would have split communities and also I, don't know to me at the moment I'm thinking more places where there still are wolf.
