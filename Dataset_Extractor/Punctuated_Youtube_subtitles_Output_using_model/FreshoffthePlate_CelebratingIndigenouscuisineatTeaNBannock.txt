Food is full of feeling and memories for chef, Tina's, Miller and Thomas Norton TN Banach is more than just a restaurant. It's where the past meets the present. When you say to a friend, let's go for tea and Vanek. That means you're going to sit down like this and chat. I. Think the inspiration of this unbeknownst to me would have been started back in the 80s sitting in a log cabin years later we came to Toronto and we were thinking. What could we do? That would be useful, and so this came to my mind just like that in general for people who have never experienced indigenous cuisine, how would you describe it kind of laid-back cuisine, I mean there's nothing really spicy, but if we let the flavors of the individual food items come through, how much of you know your childhood and what you grew up with influenced what goes on the menu? The the experience behind being able to cook indigenous food is something that is a new experience. For me, I am what you would call one who walks in both worlds in that I'm part of the 60 scoop, so I've had to catch up with a lot of my own heritage. It's been a struggle, but you know if I have managed it and to be working here is it's kind of like you know, come full circle. We have Navajo Indian taco wild rice comes from Manitoba. Arctic char is wild-caught from Nunavut. What? What do you want? People who are hearing about indigenous food for the first time? What do you want them to know I'd like to have them experience it and pick up a little history? I think reconciliation really happens when you sit down at the table once you can do that, then then, you're on the way.
