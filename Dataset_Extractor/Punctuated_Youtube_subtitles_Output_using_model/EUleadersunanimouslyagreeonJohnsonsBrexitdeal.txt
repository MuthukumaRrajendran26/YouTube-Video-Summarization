Divorcees laughing outside their lawyer's office, the relief is clearly visible. Thank You, Jean Croton Kai papers particular tribute to you. It's already a victory of sorts for Boris Johnson, getting Europe to renegotiate Teresa Mays old deal, something the EU had said it would never do. It is testament to our commitment to funding solutions. He provides certainty. We're blessed, creates uncertainty.

It's been long, it's been painful, it's being divisive, and now is the moment for us as a country to come together. Now is the moment for our parliamentarians to come together and get this thing done. Mps will now vote on the deal at a special common session, the first on a Saturday since the Falklands War of 1982.
