A Hong Kong Thanksgiving, thousands of pro-democracy campaigners gathered to give thanks for Donald Trump after the u.s. president rubber-stamped new laws in support of their efforts.

In the past few months the laws mean Hong Kong's special trading status will be tied to its level of autonomy from China human rights abuses could result in sanctions and the sale of some equipment to Hong Kong police will be banned. President Trump says he hopes. This will mean long term, peace and prosperity, but the move won't help efforts to seal a us-china trade deal as the two superpowers continue: their trade war, Hong Kong Beijing called the laws, interference and a u.s. plot doomed to fail. It is warned it may retaliate. A former Hong Kong leader says the u.s. is using the city as a proxy in the trade war. I, don't think they have Hong Kong's and freedoms.
