They are images that immediately put you there, a family escaping their home, forced out by rising floodwaters. Now taping, it isn't most people's first instinct, but the man with the camera is also a journalist. I'm coming I just saved some photo. This was photographer Tim Allen returning to his home two days later. For the first time the escape was through the window going back in they used the door. Ellen would spend much of the time recovering memories, photographs of his children and his wife, the woman, whose decisions he says saved their lives. She turned the power off. She said the window, not the front door. Ellen's home is about three kilometers from the ocean. He says he never even considered flooding the water hit. Suddenly it rose incredibly quickly about a foot in a matter of minutes. They considered going to the attic but figured they'd, be trapped and said they went out searching for higher ground there. The current was very strong. It was cold water, they were explaining, they were shaking. No Ellen is able to describe the harrowing escape almost clinically. What he has trouble with is something else. It's incredible. They have at the amount of outreach that Pyrrhus since his family story got out. Palin says support has been pouring in and it's needed. You know we're all wearing the same clothes that we escaped this house in. So sorry, so it's just really good to get that support and know that you can rebuild like we'll just find another house and just start again, it's a cliche to say everything is just stuff as long as everyone is safe, but for Allen the things that were lost can be replaced. The family members who made it out couldn't have been my carbs from global news.
