Good morning, everyone Hurricane durian is ready to unleash its fury on our state. The storm has regained strength, it is serious and it can be deadly. The message this morning is this: get to safety and stay there. Don't let your guard down this won't be a brush by whether it comes ashore or not. The eye of the storm will be close enough to cause extensive damage in North Carolina conditions in Eastern, North Carolina are deteriorating rapidly overnight, durian strengthened to a category 3 hurricane. This is a dangerous storm that is already spawning tornadoes in our state. A tornado touched down this morning in Brunswick County, causing some damage. The latest forecast track is more dire up to 10 inches of more or more of rain in coastal areas and from 3 to 6 inches in central North Carolina. The new forecast projects sustained winds of a hundred miles an hour at our coast, with gusts up to 125 storm surges will be as high as 7 feet. In short, hundreds of thousands will lose power, and that has already begun. Winds will topple trees and power lines and roads and buildings will be flooded. I have activated more North, Carolina National Guard soldiers, and we now have 488 on duty with additional high water rescue vehicles. As hurricane Dorian moves northward along our coast, there will be flash flooding I urge everyone, even those inland, to pay close attention to flood watches and warnings and be ready to evacuate if asked to by local officials. Remember it only takes a few inches of water to cause flash floods and to wash your vehicle off of the road. The majority of deaths in hurricanes are from drowning, and we know that all too well in North Carolina never drive on flooded roads and never drive around a barrier. It's there for your protection.
