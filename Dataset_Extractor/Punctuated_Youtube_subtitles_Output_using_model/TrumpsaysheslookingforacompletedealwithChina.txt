Is that gonna be enough for you, sir, in order to get a deal done? What do you need to see at this point to get that deal past the finish line, we're looking for a complete deal, I'm, not looking for a partial deal. China has been starting to buy our agricultural product if you noticed over the last week and actually some very big purchases, but that's not what I'm looking for we're looking for the big deal, so they would like to do something. As you know, we're talking a little bit this week talking a lot next week and then top people are going to be speaking the week following, but I'm not looking for a partial deal, I'm looking for a complete deal, no I, don't think I need it before the election. I think people know that we're doing a great job and China is eating that you know China is eating the tariffs because of the devaluation. Now that doesn't happen with all countries, China's China and they know what they're doing as well as anybody. My relationship with President Xi is a very amazing one, very good one, but we have right now a little spat but I think we're doing very well. Our country is doing well the president's right. The arrangement they will come to and I'm confident they will with China, will be one that will set. You know a new bar in terms of how China's economy then deals with a lot of these complicated issues in the future, with developed economies like Australia, so we look on with interest and I think. Ultimately, when we arrive at that point, it's going to put global trade on a stronger footing in honor of Australia and the Morrisons. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
