Protests have hit the streets of India. This comes just a day after the country's parliament passed a law, making it easier for non-muslim minorities from neighboring countries to seek Indian citizenship in the northeastern state of Assam, which shares our border with Bangladesh protesters, say the measure will open the region to a flood of foreigners. Others say the new law is blatantly anti-muslim. The citizenship amendment bill grants, Indian, nationality to Buddhists, Christians Hindus, Jains, Parsees and Sikhs, who fled Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Before 2015 Prime, Minister, Modi's, Hindu nationalist government denies it discriminates against any group in a tweet Modi promised it would alleviate the suffering of many who face persecution for years. Meanwhile, troops have been deployed in Assam and the internet has been suspended according to government officials to prevent inflaming passions and exasperating the law and order situation. The bill was passed in Parliament on Wednesday and becomes official law once signed by the president, which is simply a formality.
