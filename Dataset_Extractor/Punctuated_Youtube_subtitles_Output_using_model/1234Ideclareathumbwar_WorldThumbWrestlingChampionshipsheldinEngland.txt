They said the rules of thumb wrestling are. We have best of three rounds. There were sixty second rounds to start the match off. We have a professional thumb ring where people put the thumbs and and get a good grip inside the ring, and then they'll say one two. Three four I declare a thumb. War from there on you've got 60 seconds to pin your opponent for as long as it takes to say, 1 2, 3, 4, I, win the thumb war, 1, 2, 3, 4 I win. If you're not got a big strong thumb, then a small, thin agile thumb is just as good as that and we've had a mixture of winners over the years. Our rigorous training regimes, as a lot of thumb, ups on the old doorframes lot of press ups and the thumbs waited from ups, so rigorous, come on. My god fell on top the world. To retain rhetoric for the fourth time in a row is feels amazing.
