Restoration crews were at work early Sunday morning as post durian cleanup continued. Some crews have worked around the clock. They're focused on clearing downed trees, blocking roadways across the region. Many residents were out early doing their part and I heard the tree. Snap then turned around and actually saw it fall directly into the windshield Dorian made a mess, but in terms of the passing tropical storm, Halifax may have dodged. A bullet. Early reports show the eye of the storm passed south of Halifax. Although the winds did reach well into the hurricane-force category. Some of those strongest winds didn't quite make it on shore. So in that respect absolutely, but the front end of the storm did bring wind gusts when landfall happened were clocked between 120 to 150 kilometres. An hour range toppling at our crane, where police remain on scene, Sunday, Police, Chief, Dan, Kinsella, said police did speak with the construction company and others about securing sites. Before Dorian's, the Ministry of Labor has been contacted and they are going to be looking into the details around how and why the crane itself collapsed. It will be their investigation to complete and and continue the site will remain closed for the investigation, meaning no work will be allowed, are obviously concerned about what happened on some of the construction sites and the debris that happened, but I think one thing that is demonstrated to all Nova Scotian is that when they get a warning like this, they need to pay attention to it. The Red Cross continues to run three emergency shelter sites and the Halifax Regional Municipality have added five comfort stations to give residents without power a place to go and power up and recharge, even as prepared as Nova Scotia was. The Dorian cleanup won't happen overnight. It'll take some time to get back to normal Jessie Thomas, Global, News, Halifax.
