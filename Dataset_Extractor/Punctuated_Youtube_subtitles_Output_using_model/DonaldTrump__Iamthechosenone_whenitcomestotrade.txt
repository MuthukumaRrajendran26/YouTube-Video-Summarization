So somebody excuse me: somebody had to do it. I am the chosen one. Somebody had to do it so I'm taking on China I'm, taking on China on trade, and you know what we're winning, because we're the piggy bank we're the one that all these countries, including the European Union, wants to rob and takes advantage of European Union 200 billion dollars, China more than 500 billion dollars. Sorry I was put here: I was put here by people. I was put here by people to do a great job and that's what I'm doing and nobody's done a job like I've done now with China, rather wait for a little more than a year and try and get sleepy Joe Biden to negotiate with instead of President Trump. Maybe but I, don't think so. You know why they're losing too many jobs too fast. They had the worst year in 27 years, but I think it was actually 52 or 54 years that the worst year they've had in a half a century, and that's because of me and I'm not proud of that. But you know what they want to negotiate and sleepy Joe doesn't have a clue. Sleepy Joe said Oh China is wonderful. Well, China is wonderful for China, but I'm wonderful for the USA. They want to make a deal. It's got to be a deal, that's good for the United States, where they want to make a deal. Probably we will make a deal, but if I didn't do that and I'm not doing that, somebody said it's Trump's trade WA. This is in my trade war. This is a trade war that should have taken place a long time ago by a lot of other presidents.
