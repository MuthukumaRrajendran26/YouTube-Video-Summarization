Good morning, everyone festival food at DC. We are just four days away down from Election Day and the choice Athenians. If you go conservatives, you are voting for a government that will put more money in your pocket, so you can get ahead. We've laid out a clear, fully costed plan that will make life more affordable. For example, and this week, I have laid out exactly what we will do during our first 100 days to help you get ahead as part of my 100 day action plan I've outlined how a new Conservative government will introduce the get ahead. Fiscal update and we'll put our green home renovation, tax credit, green public transit tax, credit, children's fitness tax credit and children's arts and learning tax credit into law by January. 1St I will tear down the trade barriers between promises by convening a meeting of Canada's First Minister's on January 6 to kick-start negotiations for aboriginal free trade, deal, creating more jobs and more prosperity. We will start the work towards creating a signal tax return and will bring in penalties. H equals a this week. Just true is desperately trying to salvage. By doing a coalition deal with the NDP, but this is the coalition medians cannot afford the higher taxes or deficits, fewer jobs and much. It is clear that Justin Trudeau will pay any price to stay of power, he's using your money to pay, and there is perhaps no better example of Trudeau making changes to pay more than his carbon tax. His carbon tax that there's nothing to lower emissions, but instead only makes everyday essentials like gasoline or traits of containing, more expense and in the NDP calling the shots and a trio led coalition, there's no telling how much higher it would go. We already know the Trudeau is planning to increase the carbon tax at a hundred and thirty two dollars two times the price the Parliamentary Budget Officer said, is needed to reach Canada's emissions reduction targets, the impact on families working huge, it will add 31 cents, the leaders with price of gas and four hundred and sixty nine dollars for cost of natural status. All told families here in Brampton and across Ontario be on the hook for at least eleven hundred and fifty dollars more in household costs and that's the part to beat saying an NDP have they're saved as Trudeau's coalition partners and force him to hike it even higher. It is truly the coalition you cannot I've been consistent since I became the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada. My first piece of legislation as a prime minister will be repealed and today I'm pleased to announce that, as part of my 100 day action plan, I will introduce and pass the carbon tax repeal that there is no time to lose. We will use every available legislative tool to overcome any obstruction and delay is that we pass this legislation on time materials. Carbon tax will be history by January, 1st 2003, cinco-fone, metals and other council is a topic sentence under their presently. They adopt a that was soul. Evolution alternate access will occur on the iPad at all apparel, with a two days until the legislative update. Second legislative, the tax will occur on the closer shows. The pass ad see the premier Tommy. Okay. This means that families in Alberta will never have to pay the carbon tax at all, and it means the families in Saskatchewan, New, Brunswick and Manitoba families right here. In a turn, we get relief from the Trudeau carbon tax in time for the quarter and $400 back into your family's pockets starting next year now, in addition, as part of our 100 day action plan, we will pass legislation to remove the GST from Holland energy costs. We know that rising home energy costs are a particular burden on low and middle class families. Justin Trudeau believes we should punish families for turning up the thermostat on a cold winter day. I do not in Canada heating, your home in the winter, isn't a luxury, it's a necessity, and that's why we'll take the GST off of home energy bills before the cold winter weather truly sets their crews, not a casual internet or contacts of the Sun Tzu's hello and update increase your legislative well eliminated ApS. They created frottage wisconsin who serve on the low fantasy on the acutal energy so far, dopamine my central cooperative, we own with nearly 50 Pascal's social content, quality bad. If I want Oh Canada so shabbily map de Patrick's city neccessity, six brothers are all eliminated tibia de facto - Melissa, don't see how I long for the map say stop this will save the Canadian families over from $100 per year on their energy bills for the average family right here in Ontario. These two measures will start putting three hundred and fifty eight dollars per year back in your pocket right away. I need to be clear, though only a strong conservative majority delivered these savings. I am the only leader determined to help lower and middle class families, keep their plans a Trudeau NDP. Perhaps Green Party Coalition will act immediately to drive up to carbon tax to just start cuts. We need to understand how the carbon tax rates, making filling your gas tank or heating your home unaffordable. It's not a side effect of the carbon tax, which is the entire point of the carbon tax, but we know that you don't have to hurt lower middle class families by climate change. There are better alternatives to the carbon tax. That's why I will extract official opinion implementing measures to fight global climate change, as outlined in our real plan. This will include a displacing dirty foreign energy sources. Canadian cleaner, the exporting Canadian green technology to reduce emissions around will deliver the first step, Center plan to take the climate change by global starting in year. One and we'll do so working closely with our provincial partners, respecting their constitutional right to make their own a carbon tax. It's not the only way to fight climate and climate change. It's certainly not the best. It's time to turn the page of Justin Trudeau's failed carbon tax and deliver a real climate change. The lowers total emissions trading scheme or coalition food osed keymap expose the accident Phoebe DFO. Amid all we don't know the whole possible we see together. So the choice in this election is crystal clear: a Trudeau NDP polish that won't work together. The carbon tax or conservative majority government news last night, Lisa Laflamme, you said but party to gets the most seats in election, should be the right to govern. You are a former Speaker of the House. You know the conventions of a Westminster Parliament and that allows the incumbent party to have the first crack at former government. Are you saying that that precedent should be thrown up? Obviously, majority mandate? It is the case that party at the saving, Honka Honka on that one in five Canadians of the age of 15, is living with a disability, while those people don't feel their issues with a served in this campaign. Are you committed to implementing in the it's my job to do music? You want to create finally confession from super lightweight hippity, because only the Condor me a common that a planet under Tama our function to bleep I've got my own style approach. We run writing parties chapter NeoGeo, this party I'm very excited by this platform. There are a lot of new innovative ideas. I think this is it here. They see they're pleased that this is you. Your plan finds a certain infrastructure but you're sending the overall package how are needing to know whether their projects gonna be the ones that get posted. So if we made the commitment that we will honor all existing agreements and all projects that they greenlit by all, in addition to that, we have identified priorities that help reduce commute times. So we were. That means the massive tunnel replacement here in. We are the only parts that are committed, we're the only parts that is committed, I'm, the only leader that has made a firm commitment or the Ontario line as a young expansion. The other parties have not made that commitment. In fact, the Liberal Member of Parliament had applied that hybrid. The senior Liberal Member comment continues to criticize that plan, so it's quite clear that only a Conservative government will see those projects. I have to know that it's the Parliamentary Budget Officer himself, too, pointed out for the liberal infrastructure plan did not exist and after 40% of the price laughs every year, so we're saying is we're gonna have a responsible plan. It's important to remember this is the choice. Choice between communities is a liberal ndq coalition that continues to ratchet up billions of billions of dollars worth of new debt, and that means that, or or of your tax dollars will go just to pay the interest on that package. That's dandy, beautiful coalition planners are plans to get back to bounce, but they're responsible to make investments. Health care, education, social programs and eliminating corporate welfare in 25, eliminate 1.5 billion dollars in corporate welfare, 25% of foreign aid spending and eliminate waste in that government spending like parchments, that is a choice. Now I make a clear choice on Mondays and I'm, confident they will shoot fiscal responsibility that one good morning, Christopher cup with the world of mail, thousands of Canadians have died as a result of the opioid crisis and some public health experts have warned that your specific policies could potentially result in additional deaths. So, specifically, what would you do to prevent a death toll from rising when you're opposed to things like supervisor? Congestion takes what you said. Father's injection sites that there must be community engage. There must be companies decided to put these types of facilities. That is something they're Canadian support, robbery. We are the only party, that's also talking self-discovery. So, instead of just focusing on maintaining addictions, we want to start the process to ensure that our services available to help them get people specifically we've also called for more inspection is out, of course, for shipments goods coming in from China, and that would also send a message to China I've heard some of their actions against in our exports also allow our Border Services Agency. How could you specifically talk about recovery dying? Is the drug supply? Well, that's exactly why I had what's a balanced approach that actually all that was necessary or significant, some and in a case of someone that felicity sure, so we are committed to making sure that our police, or the only party with us he's talking about illegal games, there's no, that a lot of black market or different types of drugs are controlled by gangs and we're the sake of increasing penalties at bringing in and but the excellence in the addictions fields say that to tackle the opioid epidemic, the best way is to treat addiction by the health issues. An intern or to the colonel one, so I'm just wondering what it is about. The evidence that is there's a choice I can even make on Monday it's clear that justice you're going many of his MPs have. This is something many of their colleagues treating addictions like health issue that you see that can help more than criminalizing. Are you trying to score political points instead of saving lives? She shares stuff. You love it's the Canadian Press usual on me. What do you think is the single greatest international threat to Canada? There are a lot of threats like please take seriously. Obviously there evidence mr. Ahmed gratifies our cyber threats. So that's that's! The second question. Satrughna government made a number of strides in the area of gender equity. They placed a priority on ensuring diversity of government, appointments and federal balance cabinet. Did you send women captive and whether which among goes they'll continue with don't you go back, will always fight for equality rights of all Canadians. You know you will have a cabinet of highly qualified candidates meesa. That's all about what this eye conference on the department is that good morning. Mr. chair Katie Simpson CBC News, you said at the start of your news conference a response to one of my colleagues questions that recently there aren't examples of government being able to hold the companies in a problem somewhere if they are, if they didn't win the most number C. But in VC that's not the case of 2017 the NDP. They don't hold most mercies, but they are. They are in power. So my session to you is you're, a former Speaker of the House who know the rules of Parliament. So if you recognize that to these powers depends on waiting and it is quite clear that Justin Trudeau will try to do it to stay. What I'm saying and the other context is that a Prime Minister and enters into comes out of that election with fewer seats than another party of resins. That is likely election that more in this edge, then okay, Patti, Davis, yeah SSA in common and even though the rules allow for it. You see I believe that we have put for to find out what these very a selection of a very strong man. They were asking opinions for majority mandate to prevent an NDP document coalition that have massive deficits and raise their tax. It is clear that in modern Canadian history, the party with the most seats forms the government and that a prime minister who comes out of an election with fewer seats than another party resigns in occupation. I have been focused on federal issues. Putting for our platform, or one thing I can tell you- is that the people of Ontario understand the damage that the very same people who are instrumental remains. Governments are now working. For instance, we go and are following the same place. Massive deficits you've been campaigning like Doug Ford is a liability to do? Have you actually reliability? Our are measures that will leave more money in the pockets of all Canadians. We're talking about important investments in things like you know, tear your line, expansion, making our communities safer by going after illegal gang members and people who traffic illegal firearms I had illegal drugs. Those are issues of speed directly to the people of this province. We're going to continue to that connects your that here. This is event very costly to this concert promise you know exactly after they come on the kathleen. Neither dr. le the director dr. serve they men or we have the ng speed committed to the University. We have at least one concern, and one of my colleagues asked you what sort of funding you said. You also be committed to restore the downtown blue portion as well. Having spent a lot of my summers in Mississauga, taking the number eight Oh, you.
