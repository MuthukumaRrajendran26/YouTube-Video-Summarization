Hey, the police have just arrived here. We're going to be here. I want us all to open our hearts for a moment for the people in Australia who are living in an inferno as a result of the climate crisis, people are who are losing their homes, who are fleeing their lands, a land that has recently lost to the fires. What is reported to be a billion animals, our hearts go out to them. In the last few days, the specter of war has loomed again the climate movement and the anti-war movement must move as one and climate. The climate crisis makes our nation in all nations less secure. So I just wanted to say that, because if we are called again to confront this administration about the possibility of going to war, we all have to rally we all have to rally together on behalf of diplomacy and not war. The meat and dairy industry is the third leading cause of climate change and I. Think sometimes we wonder what can we do in this in this fight against climate change and there's something that you can do today right now and tomorrow, by making a choice about what you consume? We are called to find something in our lives worth fighting for something that unites the will of the spirit with the work of the flesh, something that can help us lift up this nation and all its people to that place where the heart is without fear living in some person we're seeing the destruction of our territory right now is important for people like you to protest. You know.
