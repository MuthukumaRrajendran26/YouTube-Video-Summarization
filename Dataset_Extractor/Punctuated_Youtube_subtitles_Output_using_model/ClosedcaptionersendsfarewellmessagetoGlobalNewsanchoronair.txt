I just got this email from Dean good morning: Mike I'm, the daytime live closed, caption for global Edmonton, yes working out, of course, headquarters in Toronto wanted to send a quick note to wish a all the best. On his last thing on TV, some of my favorite bits to caption are those in which Shay goes off script and I, especially loved it when he and Holly get into it, I'm sure he'll be making entertaining radio and I'll miss captioning him Dean I'd love to see that guy work one day. So I wonder if he's doing this right now, like I, wonder what I just read was captioned by Dean Dean was captioning himself at he could have been. If he's working right now, I'm not sure he's working right now, everything's happening, there's no way for us to know I guess we know well, somebody tell somebody has CAPTCHA. Do Brian just put the captions on Dean. Are you watching right now? Dean, maybe Dean can actually fill in that thing and say he's watching right now. We're watching. Where does it say? Brian has Dean responded. Brian, you can talk. It's okay, Dean! Are you watching? It says that, but no, what are you watching? Has he answered? No I guess he's. Not yes! Dean says yes, yes, he's watching. That is amazing TV. We have never done that before. Well. Thank you very much. Dean I'm sure you appreciate that I. Do that's very cool. That's quite the gig! Anyway, let's do some weather right now.
