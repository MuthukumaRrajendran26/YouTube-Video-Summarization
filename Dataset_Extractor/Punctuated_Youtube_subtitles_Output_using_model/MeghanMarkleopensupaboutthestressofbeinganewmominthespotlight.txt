Look any woman when there, especially when they're pregnant, you're, really vulnerable, and so that was made really challenging and then, when you have a newborn no a long time ago, but I remember yeah and especially as a woman. It's really it's a lot. So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed. It's yeah, well, I, guess, and also thank you for asking. This is not many people have asked if I'm okay, but it's it's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes, and the answer is, would it be fair to say no? Really? Okay, it's really been a struggle. Yes,.
