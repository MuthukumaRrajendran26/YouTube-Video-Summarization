Always discuss with a sit-down with President Trump we've had some good conversations already, particularly on the global economy, partly because of the trading relationship. We have great work. We did quite frankly around the table. There's a lot of people wanted to make trade deals with each other. We have. We have a deal that we were able to negotiate this good for our workers for our citizens. That's the kind of thing will be more of around the world, always a pleasure to talk about a broad range of so we're going to be significantly expanding our trading relationship. When the u.s. MCA gets completed, our farmers love it the union's love it the workers, love it. Manufacturers love it. Everybody likes, it I think most Democrats like it so hopefully that'll be put to a vote fairly soon. It's got tremendous support itself, I believe Democrat and Republican. It has been signed and finalized, essentially by Canada and essentially, if I measure, so we're waiting for that from the United States, and we have. We have really great support and it's something I think it's a very special agreement and replaces NAFTA, which is perhaps the worst rate agree we've ever done within our country. I can think of one worse, but it's not within our country outside of our country. That's the w3! Oh, that's a beauty, so we're very happy with the agreement and I congratulate you. I hope it gets done. I guess we should save the congratulations for when they vote, but hopefully that will be put to a buck pretty soon. Thank you very much thanks pres right this way.
