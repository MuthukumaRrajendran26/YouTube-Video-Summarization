So we have everything from movie monsters to animation. We have famous people and krump ecad, so pretty much everything something for everyone and nothing too scary, okay and the cat face for that, because it was smiling and that's what that's. What I love I kind of like the suction, where they did the tributes to the people who have passed, but they were really authentic. They looked real I like to break into our one fact. We think this is awesome. It's such an awesome opportunity for the kids to go out and use their imagination, be outside I. Almost have it straightforward, but um I think it's specially, because um I mean it's fun for kids to get to see them and everything, and it's a great way for like families to get together to come and see it. So that's really fun.
