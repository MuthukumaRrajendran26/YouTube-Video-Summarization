Hi good to see you and good to see the Prime Minister, my friend boys Johnson. We have a deal and this deal means that was no need for any kind of pollination. This is a fair, a balanced agreement. It is testament to our commitment to finding solutions. He provides certainty where black seed creates uncertainty. He protects the rights of our citizens and he protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland. There will be no border on the island of Ireland and the single market will be protected. The deal is not about us. The deal is about people and peace and I. Look forward to continue my conversations with Boris, because we'd start the negotiation on the future relations immediately after the deal will have been approved. We start our debates on the first of November without interruption tonight, together with finish our body, I will explain the deed to the heads of states and governments and, of course it is for both our Parliament's to have the final say: it's not only Westminster having to approve the deal, the deal being, in fact the treaty. It's also up to the European Parliament. To do the same, so thank you very much Thank You, Jean, Claude and I pay particular tribute to you, jean-claude and also, of course, to Michel Barnier and all your team Michel in the negotiating team in in the Commission and I. Do think that this deal represents a very good deal both for the EU and for the UK and it's a reasonable, fair outcome and reflects the large amount of work. That's been undertaken by by both sides and I agree very much jean-claude with what you said about protecting the peace process in the island of Ireland and in Northern Ireland and, of course, for us in the UK. It means that we can deliver a real brexit that achieves our objectives and it means that the UK leaves whole and entire on October, the 31st and it at first, and it means that Northern, Ireland and every other part of the UK can take part not just in free trade deals offering our tariffs exporting our goods around the world. But it also means that we can take together as a single, a United Kingdom decisions about our future about our laws borders. Our money and how we want to run the UK and those decisions will be taken in the UK by elected representatives as the people at the UK and I hope. Very much now, speaking of elected representatives, that my fellow MPs in in Westminster do now come together to get brexit done to get this excellent deal over the line and to deliver for exit without any more delay, so that we can focus on the priorities of the British people, improving our health service, investing in 20,000, more police lifting up the living wage and many many other things and jean-claude I just want to conclude by agreeing wholeheartedly with your final point. Now is the moment for us to get bricks it done and then together to work on building our future partnership, which I think can be incredibly positive, both for the UK and for the EU and I. Just remind you what I always say. We are a quintessential European country, solid, European, friends, neighbors and supporters, and we look forward to working with you in building that partnership in the weeks and months to come. Thank you all very much I have drawn clods the boss here. Yeah I have I have to say that I'm happy about the deal, but I'm set about what have a good time. Okay minutes, you.
