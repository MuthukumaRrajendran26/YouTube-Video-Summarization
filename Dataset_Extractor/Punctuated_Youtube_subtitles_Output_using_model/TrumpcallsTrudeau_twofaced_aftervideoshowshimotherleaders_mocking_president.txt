Well, he's too fast and honestly with to know he's a nice guy I find him to be a very nice guy, but you know the truth. Is that I told them out of the fact that he's not paying 2% and I guess he's not very happy about it. I mean you were there a couple of you were there and he's not playing 2% and he should be paying 2%, it's Canada, they have money and they should be paying 2%. So I called him out of that and I'm sure he wasn't happy about it. But that's the way it is look I'm representing the US and he should be paying more than Fang and he understands it so I can't imagine him. I can imagine he's not that happy, but that's the way it is.
