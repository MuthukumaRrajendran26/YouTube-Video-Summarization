Before I begin, I'd like to briefly address news from the Manhattan Correctional Center over the weekend regarding Jeffrey Epstein, this sex trafficking case was very important to the Department of Justice and to me personally, it was important to the dedicated prosecutors in the Southern District of New York and to our FBI agents, who investigated the case and we're preparing it for trial. Most importantly, this case was important to the victims, who had the courage to come forward and deserve the opportunity to confront the accused in the courtroom. I was appalled, and indeed the whole department was, and frankly angry, to learn of the MCCS failure to adequately secure this prisoner. We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation, the FBI and the Office of Inspector General are doing just that. We will get to the bottom of what happened and there will be accountability, but let me assure you that this case will continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein. Any co-conspirators should not rest easy. The victims deserve justice and they will get it.
