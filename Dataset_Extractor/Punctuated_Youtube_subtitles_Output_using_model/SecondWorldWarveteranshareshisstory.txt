My name is Alex palawan and I served in a Canadian Navy as a seaman HMCS here on Alex palawan joined the Canadian war effort in 1941 the same year. The Nazis invaded his birthplace of Lithuania. He was just 17 I learned more about Canada by foot from speaking to the various crew members that I could have ever imagined and about people. Where is a 17 18 year old kid guarded at the opportunity we were sort of all in the same boat. We were an all-purpose destroyer, it's perfect worshippers! You can get to do all sorts of jobs that you want to do. We were good for everything. The most famous battles were in English channels. We had the most dangerous luckiest jobs. You know that was our job right front to clean the channel out, so you can imagine what they could have done. You know a shell could kill a thousand people, one shadow. There was a wonderful feeling, the lives that we saved, and that was our job 10 of us. Ten destroyers love these trees. Today at ninety five still have a few hairs. Wet Able, Seaman palawan remembers the war firsthand and still speaks at hundreds of events, I again with historic, a Canada well at times, I was the most frightened person in the world and there were times that I felt like the bravest person in the world. I get try my best to for Canada and my two relatives my two uncles near the end of the war. He learned his two uncle's have been killed by the Nazis. He never forgot the suffering of his Jewish family in Lithuania. Now I'm gonna go to the end of the war by then I knew that my uncle's have been murdered and I had a dream. I had a dream that they came down and they hugged me and they kissed me, and they told me how proud they were of me and actually one of the first few times my life I cried and I never dreamt of the war. Again after that, the war I did my part I repaid what they did for me. I tried my best to repay it and I wasn't at peace with that. You.
