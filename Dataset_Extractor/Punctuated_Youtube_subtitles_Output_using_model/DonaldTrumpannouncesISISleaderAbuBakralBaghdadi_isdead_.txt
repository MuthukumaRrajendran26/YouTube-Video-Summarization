Last night the United States brought the world's number-one terrorist leader to justice. Abu Bakar al-baghdadi is dead. He was the founder and leader of Isis, the most ruthless and violent terror organization anywhere in the world. The United States has been searching for Baghdadi for many years. Capturing or killing Baghdadi has been the top national security priority of my administration, US Special Operations Forces executed a dangerous and daring nighttime raid in northwestern Syria and accomplished their mission and grand style. The u.s. personnel were incredible. I got to watch much of it. No personnel were lost in the operation. Well, a large number of Baghdadi's fighters and companions were killed with him. He died after running into a dead-end tunnel whimpering and crying and screaming all the way the compound had been cleared by this time with people either surrendering or being shot and killed. Eleven young children were moved out of the house and are uninjured. The only ones remaining were Baghdady in the tunnel, and he had dragged three of his young children with him. They were led to certain death. He reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest killing himself and the three children his body was mutilated by the blast. The tunnel had caved in on it. In addition, but test results gave sir immediate and totally positive identification. It was him the thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him. We were in the compound for approximately two hours and after the mission was accomplished. We took highly sensitive material and information from the raid much having to do with Isis origins, future plans, things that we very much want. Baghdadi's demise demonstrates America's, relentless pursuit of terrorist leaders and our commitment to the enduring and total defeat of Isis and other terrorist organizations.
