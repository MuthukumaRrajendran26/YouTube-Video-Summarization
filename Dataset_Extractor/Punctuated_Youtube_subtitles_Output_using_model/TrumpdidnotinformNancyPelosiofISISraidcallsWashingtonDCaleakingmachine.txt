We've notified some others are being notified. Now, as I speak, we were going to notify him last night, but we decided not to do that, because Washington leaks, like I've, never seen before. There's nothing. There's no country in the world that leaks. What like we do and Washington is a leaking machine and I told my people. We will not notify them until the our great people are out not just in but out I don't want to have them greeted with firepower, like you wouldn't believe so we were able to get in. It was top-secret, it was kept. There were no leaks, no nothing! The only people that knew with a few people that I dealt with no I didn't I. Didn't I didn't do that. I wanted to make sure this kept secret. I don't want to have men lost and women I don't want to have people lost.
