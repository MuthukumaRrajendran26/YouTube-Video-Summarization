In August 1917, more than 1,800 Canadian soldiers died at Hill 70. Thousands more were injured, troops seized and held the strategic hill above the town of laws. The Canadian Corps led for the first time by a Canadian Lefton in General, Arthur, Currie and now, 102 years after the battle, an impressive memorial site near Hill 70 to honor the sacrifice of those soldiers. Of course, these regimens and the families never forgot. Ron Lucas's grandfather James died here, but his body was never found. This is an emotional day when Lucas first visited the site nine years ago. It was just a field. I always come here to see the progress and to see it complete. It today is just I can't put it into words. John cowan is part of the team that spent a decade making it happen. It's one thing to have an idea, but gosh it's not all that, often that it works on this kind of scale. Cowen says: public awareness of nearby Vimy Ridge is partly due to the impressive memorial at that battle site. The people who built the Vimy memorial in the 30s between the wars never imagined in a million years that hill 70, which was viewed as at least equal to Vimy, would be forgotten. The obelisk at Hill 70 is now surrounded by landscaped hills and walkways six of the paths representing the Canadian soldiers who were awarded the Victoria Cross among them, company sergeant major Robert Hill Hana. It's hard to believe that a hundred and two years after my father was here that we're standing here in the same same site, Bob Hannah's, family, now honoring Roberts bravery with each footstep yeah. It's really important for us all to be here and experience this together as a family. This park now a place for Canadians to pay their respects. Ensuring Hill 70 will never again be Canada's forgotten battle. Redman, Shannon, Global, News loosened well France.
