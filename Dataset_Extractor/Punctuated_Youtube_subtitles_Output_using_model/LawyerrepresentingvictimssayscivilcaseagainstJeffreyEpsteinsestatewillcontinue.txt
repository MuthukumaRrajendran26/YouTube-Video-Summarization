Even though he's gone, his victims are still suffering from a lifetime of pain of anguish of derailed careers, and they deserve full and fair compensation for what he did to them. I am calling today, on behalf of his victims, for the administrator of his estate, to freeze all of his assets and not disperse them, not dissipate them and instead to create a fund for his victims. Who can then file civil cases establish that they were victimized by him and get compensation? Everybody needs to be brought to justice. Everybody who knew what this man was doing, who saw him with underage girls or young women who he was preying on. They all need to be investigated and brought to justice.
