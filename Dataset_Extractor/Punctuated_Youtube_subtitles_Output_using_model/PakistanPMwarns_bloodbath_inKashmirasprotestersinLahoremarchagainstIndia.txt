And it's arrogance that makes people make mistakes and do stupid things cruel things like what Narendra Modi has done. It's sheer arrogance and it's arrogance that has blinded him from the fact that what is going to happen when the curfew was lifted. Has he thought about it? This hasn't been thought through. The world hasn't done anything look. What is going to happen when the curfews lifted will be a bloodbath. The people will come out there. Nine hundred thousand troops there they haven't come to as Narendra Modi says. He's done this to for Prosperity of Kashmir. This is supposed to be for the development, these nine hundred thousand troops. What are they going to do when the devil when they come out there'll be a bloodbath? Has he thought it through? What happens then? Mr. president, has anyone thought that what happens when there is a bloodbath? What do you think the impact will have on people of Kashmir and we will fight and when and when and when and when a nuclear-armed country fights to the end, it will have consequences far beyond the borders, it will have consequences for the world, which is why I repeat I'm here, because I'm warning you it's not a threat, it's a fair worry that where are we headed and it I've come here to tell the UN you've got to? This is a test for the United Nations. You are the one who guaranteed the people of Kashmir the right of self-determination.
