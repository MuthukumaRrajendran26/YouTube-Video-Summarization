Today, we're announcing the new energy savings rebate program that will help Ontarians save up to $1,000 when they buy energy-efficient, washers dryers refrigerators, air conditioners, water heaters, evie chargers and more. This helps them keep families right here in Willowdale and across Ontario, save money, reduce their energy costs and do right by the planet and I know that is really important, because when I talk to folks they care about their kids and the grandkids and a more sustainable future, and this is a practical way that Ontarians can be part of the solution. This money is funded through the Canada's low-carbon economy funds program. That program was designed to support provinces that were committed to action on climate change. Unfortunately, we all know what happened under premier Ford first day he came into office, he made it free to pollute, but he cut energy efficiency programs, programs that were helping businesses, schools, hospitals, cities, people save money through this program, 200 million dollars will be put towards these this energy efficiency program. Where you can save money, you can buy a new appliance and you can do right by the planet. We need to take action on climate change, we don't have a choice and there are practical ways. We could do it. It's exactly what we're doing today and this rebate will be available at Rona as early as tomorrow, so come on back and we're eligible products are sold across Canada loo many other retailers, Lowe's Canada, Canadian, Tire, Best, Buy, Canada, Leon's, peppermints and scores of other retailers, big and small, in communities across the province. Who understand that we can be more energy efficient, that we can reduce energy costs, that we can create good jobs, and we can do right by the planet.
