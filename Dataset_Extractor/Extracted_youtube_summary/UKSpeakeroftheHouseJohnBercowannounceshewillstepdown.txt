UK House of Commons Speaker John Bercow says he will step down by the end of next month after a decade in the job. Bercow told lawmakers that if Parliament votes Monday in favour of an early election, he will quit before the campaign. If they don't he will quit October 31 - the day Britain is due to leave the European Union.  He says he will quit both as speaker and as a member of Parliament.
