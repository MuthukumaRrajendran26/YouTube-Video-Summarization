Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau says if he is re-elected next month, he plans to ban assault rifles.Trudeau made the announcement on Friday morning in Toronto following a walkabout through the Danforth neighbourhood, the site of a 2018 mass shooting that killed two and injured 13 in the midst of a broader spate of gun violence that has gripped Toronto and other urban centres over recent years.
