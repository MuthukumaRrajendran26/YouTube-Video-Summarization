Astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir spoke to reporters on Monday, a couple of days after they floated outside the International Space Station for history's first all-female spacewalk.  The all-female team was sent out to replace a 232-pound battery charger in the lab's solar power system. This was Koch's fourth spacewalk and Meir's first.
