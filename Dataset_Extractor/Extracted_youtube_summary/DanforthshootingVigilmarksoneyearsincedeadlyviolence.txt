A vigil was held at a parkette on the Danforth in Toronto on July 22 to mark one year since a mass shooting in the neighbourhood left two dead and 13 others injured.The event took place at Alexander the Great Parkette near Danforth and Logan Avenues, which is where the shooting began last year.The names of the deceased and injured were read aloud, and St. Barnabas’ church bells tolled the same number of times as the victims' ages.There was a choral presentation by an interfaith choir from the Danforth community in honour of the anniversary of the tragic event.
