NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh spoke in Winnipeg, Manitoba on Tuesday morning to outline his plan to partner with First Nations communities to combat climate change.Singh was also critical of the Liberals and Conservatives, saying both have fallen short on the Climate Change file.'Instead of addressing climate change, the Liberals spent billions of taxpayer dollars buying an oil pipeline that will threaten our environment and violate Indigenous rights – and the Conservatives don’t believe we’re in a climate crisis at all," Singh told reporters in Winnipeg.
