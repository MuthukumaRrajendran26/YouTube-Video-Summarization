The extensive, nine-day manhunt for two alleged killers in northern Manitoba is shrinking.With no new leads to pursue, RCMP have decided to “reassess deployment of resources” in the remote community of Gillam, Man.RCMP Assistant Commissioner Jane MacLatchy said investigators covered 11,000 square kilometres in the air and searched more than 500 homes and buildings with no signs of Bryer Schmegelsky and Kam McLeod.The long-time friends are wanted in connection with the deaths of three people in B.C.“Even with this extraordinary effort, we have not had any confirmed sightings of the suspects since the burned vehicle was located,” MacLatchy said at a news conference in Winnipeg on Wednesday.“To be clear, we are not ending this search. A number of resources will remain positioned in the Gillam area and will continue the efforts to locate the murder suspects.”
