U.S. President Trump's ex-campaign chief Corey Lewandowski tangled with Democratic members of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, telling the panel he would refuse to answer any questions about his conversations with Trump in a tight-lipped testimony during a hearing to consider whether to impeach Trump.  Lewandowski stoutly defended his former boss and lashed out at Democrats as the panel probed him about Russian interference in the 2016 election, his interview on national television, and discussions with the president.
