Hundreds of people, including celebrities Joaquin Phoenix and Martin Sheen, showed up on Friday to rally alongside Jane Fonda for her weekly climate change rally, which she's labeled "Fire Drill Fridays," that have taken place in Washington, DC for the past several months. Fonda has been arrested five times at past protests, but was not this time. Instead, Phoenix was taken into custody during the protest. The actress and activist said she began the protests inspired by youth climate action around the world. She also remarked on the Australia bushfires, saying they mourned for those who have lost their homes and the animals that died in the fires.
