Speaking Baltimore, MD Monday morning, Reverend Al Sharpton hit back at President Donald Trump's attack on Rep. Elijah Cummings and his Baltimore congressional district, saying Trump has always displayed "particular venom" for people of colour.In a series of tweets, Trump insisted that his comments Saturday referring to Cummings’ majority-black district as a disgusting mess where “no human being would want to live” were not racist. On the contrary, Trump argued, “if racist Elijah Cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district, and Baltimore itself, perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership.”
