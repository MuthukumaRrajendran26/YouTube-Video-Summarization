Botham Jean's mother and other family members thanked the community for support through the trial of Amber Guyger, the Dallas police officer convicted of the murder of Jean. Jean said it was difficult to be in Dallas since her son died, but said she does not see the residents as "another Amber Guyger" and believes in the good of the community. Brandt Jean, Botham's brother, also spoke about the video of him hugging Guyger saying he still believed in what he said, that he hopes for the best for Guyger.
