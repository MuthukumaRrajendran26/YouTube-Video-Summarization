Speaking in British Columbia Thursday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau slammed Opposition leader Andrew Scheer for his comments earlier in the day, saying they didn't go far enough to address concerns stemming from his 2005 comments on same-sex marriage. Earlier in the day, Scheer said that if Canadians elect a Tory government this fall, the party won’t reopen debates on issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion.
