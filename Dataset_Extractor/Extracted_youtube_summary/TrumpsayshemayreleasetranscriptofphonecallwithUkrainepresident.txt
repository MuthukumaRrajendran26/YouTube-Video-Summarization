U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that he did not tell Ukraine's president that U.S. aid would be contingent on his launching an investigation into Joe Biden and his family, but that it would "probably, possibly be ok" if he did. Trump also said that he "may consider" releasing a transcript of the phone call.
