Descanso Gardens in La Cañada Flintridge, Calif., put on a spooky pumpkin display, just in time for Halloween. Artfully carved pumpkins brought a mile-long Halloween pumpkin path to light as families came to see the display. Carvings ranged from Disney characters, to horror icons, to pop culture icons and more.
