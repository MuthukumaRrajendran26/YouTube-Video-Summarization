The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William and Kate, joined Sir David Attenborough at the "Boaty McBoatFace" naming ceremony to reveal U.K.'s new polar research ship's name. Kate announced the polar ship's official new name as 'Sir David Attenborough' after the historian himself on Thursday among thousands of people who gathered at the Cammell Laird shipyard to witness the event. The ship's role, Attenborough said, is to address the climate crisis and to find the science to deal with the environmental problems facing the world today.
