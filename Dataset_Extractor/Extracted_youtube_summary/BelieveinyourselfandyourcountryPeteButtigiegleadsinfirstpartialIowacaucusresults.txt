With about 62% of precincts reported in Iowa late on Tuesday showing Pete Buttigieg in the lead, the Democratic candidate took an early victory lap while on the campaign trail in New Hampshire.Buttigieg became emotional when speaking about the first Iowa caucus partial results, saying that it “validates for the kid somewhere in the community wondering if he belongs,” and that “if you believe in yourself and your country, there’s a lot backing up that belief.”More results were expected to be posted later on, as the Iowa Democratic Party continued to sort out a major technical malfunction that caused a delay in the totals.
