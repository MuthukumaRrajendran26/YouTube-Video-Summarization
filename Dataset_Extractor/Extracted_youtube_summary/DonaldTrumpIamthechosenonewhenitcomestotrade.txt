Speaking with reporters outside the White House Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump decalred himself the "chosen one" when it came to trade, specifically with China, indicating that it was his responsibility to solve issues of trade imbalance that no other president was able to solve. The president also remarked on the ongoing trade war with China, insisting again that this isn't his trade war, it's one that "should have taken place a long time ago by a lot of other presidents." Still, Trump took responsibility for it, saying that he is "the chosen one" to take on Beijing during this time.  "Somebody had to do it. I am the chosen one," he told reporters.
