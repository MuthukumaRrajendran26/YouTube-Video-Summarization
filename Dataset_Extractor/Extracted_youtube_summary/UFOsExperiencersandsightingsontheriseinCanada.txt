Canada’s UFO community is thriving in Canada.   From the “experiencers” who believe they’ve been abducted by aliens to hundreds of documented sightings each and every year, it’s getting harder to ignore what’s long been considered a fringe group of society.   But how much of it is really unexplainable?  According to MUFON, an independent group dedicated to investigating UFO phenomena, no matter how hard they try six percent of all the reports that come in can’t be explained.   And “experiencers”, who used to be referred to as Alien Abductees, are turning to hypnotists to reveal long-lost memories of when they came in contact with extra terrestrials.  Is the truth really out there? Or are they out there?
