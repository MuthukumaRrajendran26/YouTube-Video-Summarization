A judge in Chicago ruled Friday the special prosecutor appointed in the Jussie Smollett case will continue to handle the case. A court filing had revealed that Dan Webb, the special prosecutor once donated a thousand-dollars to Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx.Foxx's attorney first revealed the donation to Webb, who in turn disclosed it to the court.The donation came from a fundraiser in October 2016 at the law firm Winston & Strawn, where Webb serves as a co-executive chairman.Webb has said that it is common for partners at the law firm to host fundraisers and to show support and that he almost always donates, unless he has a specific reason he does not want to support the candidate.Smollett is accused of lying to Chicago police, telling them in January that he was beaten up and the victim of a racist and homophobic hate crime.Police claim Smollett actually staged the attack. But in March, Foxx suddenly dropped charges against Smollett.In August, Cook County Criminal Court Judge Michael Toomin appointed Webb as a special prosecutor to investigate the State's Attorney's office's decision to drop the charges.Toomin had earlier ruled that a special prosecutor was needed in the case, due to "unprecedented irregularities" in how Foxx handled the case, specifically by handing it over to her second-in-command after announcing she had recused herself.The judge said Foxx had no authority to appoint someone to take over the case for her, so every decision her office made from charging Smollett, to indicting him, to ultimately dismissing the case was invalid.
