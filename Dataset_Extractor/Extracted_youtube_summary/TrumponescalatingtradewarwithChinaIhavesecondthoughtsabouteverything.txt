Sure, why not?” Trump told reporters when asked if he has second thoughts about escalating the conflict, adding he has “second thoughts about everything.”But hours later, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement saying Trump was “greatly misinterpreted,” saying Trump only responded, “in the affirmative – because he regrets not raising the tariffs higher.”
