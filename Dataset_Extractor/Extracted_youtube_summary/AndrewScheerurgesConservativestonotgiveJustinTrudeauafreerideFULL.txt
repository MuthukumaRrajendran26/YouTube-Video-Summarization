Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says the fact his party is now in a leadership race doesn't mean the Liberal government can do whatever it wants in the House of Commons.Speaking to Tory MPs and Senators atFriday's caucus retreat, Scheer says no day can be wasted to show Canadians his party is the one that best represents their interests.Scheer is expected to remain leader of the party until members choose a new boss on June 27th, while many Tories are plotting for how best to replace him.
