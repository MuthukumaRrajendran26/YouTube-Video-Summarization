Speaking at an event on Monday evening, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson labelled Extinction Rebellion protesters as "uncooperative crusties" who live in "heathen, hemp-smelling bivouacs" when mentioning how his security team didn't want him to attend as they feared he might be hit by eggs from the climate change protesters.Climate group Extinction Rebellion hit back with banners on Tuesday, urging the U.K. to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2025, rather than the government's 2050 target.
