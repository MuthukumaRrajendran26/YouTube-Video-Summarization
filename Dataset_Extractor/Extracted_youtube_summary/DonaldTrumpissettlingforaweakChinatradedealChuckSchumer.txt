Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday said the 'Phase 1' trade agreement between the U.S. and China is 'remarkable for how little it achieves at an enormous price'.China has pledged to buy almost $80 billion of additional manufactured goods from the United States over the next two years as part of a trade war truce, according to a source.Under the terms of the trade deal to be signed on Wednesday in Washington, China would also buy over $50 billion more in energy supplies, and boost purchases of U.S. services by about $35 billion over the same two-year period, the source told Reuters on Monday.
