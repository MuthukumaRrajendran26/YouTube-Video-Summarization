Speaking alongside Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, U.S. President Donald Trump decried what he called a "hoax" in regards to a whistlebowler complaint over his call to the President of Ukraine, but promised he would cooperate with any subpoenas as he "always does." Trump also decried what he called a previous U.S. policy of being the "sucker country" when it comes to monetary contributions around the world, which Trump said was the focus of his controversial call with the President of Ukraine.
