Warning: Disturbing language. Discretion advised. The ex-girlfriend of the man police say committed the Dayton shooting said on Tuesday that following the crime, "yellow flags" that appeared during their relationship had become red and questioned if it could have been prevented if she had told someone earlier.She says when she first heard who the man was, she thought it was someone else, but once she learned it was a person from Bellbrook, she says she started crying before calling the police tip line. She also said she wasn't "entirely surprised" that he did "something bad," but didn't think he would end up in the news "for this."
