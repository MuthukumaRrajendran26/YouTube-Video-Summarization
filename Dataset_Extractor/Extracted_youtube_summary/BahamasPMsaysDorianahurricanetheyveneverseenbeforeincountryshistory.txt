Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said Sunday that it was the "worst day of my life" to address the public and said Hurricane Dorian was a storm they had never seen in the country's history. He said that many people had remained behind in the country and that there were some in the western area who refused to leave, adding he can only hope "this is not the last time that they would hear my voice."
