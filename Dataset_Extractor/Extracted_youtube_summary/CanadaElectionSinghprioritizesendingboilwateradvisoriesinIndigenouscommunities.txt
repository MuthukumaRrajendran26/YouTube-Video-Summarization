NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh visited Grassy Narrows First Nation in northern Ontario on Saturday and answered questions about his party's strategy to combat boil water advisories across the country, saying he would do "whatever it takes" for Indigenous communities' access to clean drinking water.Singh criticized the Liberal federal government for its neglect of the Grassy Narrows First Nation, a community dealing with generations of mercury poisoning from contaminated water, and brought up Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau "mocking" a community activist who tried to raise the issue with him.When asked if he was just writing a 'blank cheque' for all problems faced by indigenous communities, such as lack of clean drinking water, Singh replied by asking if the same question would be raised if big cities of Canada like Toronto or Vancouver had a clean drinking water problem.
