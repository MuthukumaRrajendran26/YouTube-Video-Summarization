Every year over 500,000 children under the age of five die due to inadequate sanitation.  A significant amount of those deaths would be prevented if toilets, safe drinking water, adequate sanitation and hygiene were accessible.  Every year on November 19, the United Nations celebrates World Toilet Day to raise awareness for the sanitation crisis across the world.
