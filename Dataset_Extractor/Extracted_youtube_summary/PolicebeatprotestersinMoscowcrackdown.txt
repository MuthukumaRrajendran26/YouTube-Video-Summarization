WARNING: Video contains violent content. Viewer discretion is advised.More than 600 people were detained, an independent monitor said, as they called for free elections.Among the arrested, prominent activist Lyubov Sobol - pulled from a taxi moments before the demonstration was due to start and bundled into a van.She'd called on people to attend the protest which authorities had warned was illegal. They say the timing and location of the demonstration had not been agreed in advance.Opposition activists say protests are repeatedly refused, leaving them no choice but to go ahead anyway.At a similar protest a week earlier, more than 1,000 people were detained, sometimes violently, and to widespread international condemnation.The focus of the protesters' anger is a ban on a number of opposition candidates from taking part in a September election in Moscow.A number of those candidates are allies of jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny.On Saturday, Russian investigators said they had opened a criminal investigation into the alleged laundering of 1 billion rubles, or $15.3 million, by an anti-corruption foundation he set up.Navalny and his allies say the foundation is transparently financed from public donations.
