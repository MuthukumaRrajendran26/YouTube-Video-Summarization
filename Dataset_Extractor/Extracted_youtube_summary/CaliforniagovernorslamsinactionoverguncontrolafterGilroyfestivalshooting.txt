California Gov. Gavin Newsom slammed inaction by politicians on gun control after three people died during a shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival on Sunday night. He criticized the fact when they've tried to take action in California, gun lobbies like the NRA have launched lawsuits preventing their own gun control methods from taking effect. Newsom also expressed sympathies for the families impacted by the shooting and said a young girl who had been shot actually comforted him when he visited one of the hospitals where families were staying.
