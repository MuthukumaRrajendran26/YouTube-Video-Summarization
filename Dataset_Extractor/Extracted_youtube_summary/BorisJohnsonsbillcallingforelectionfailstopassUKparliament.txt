Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s call for a general election on Oct 15. was defeated after he failed to win over enough lawmakers.After saying it was the only way out of Britain’s Brexit impasse after opposition lawmakers moved to block his plan to leave the European Union next month without a divorce deal, Johnson needed to have the backing of at least 434 lawmakers.Only 298 voted in favour of the early election while another 56 voted against. Jeremy Corybn instructed the opposition Labour Party to abstain on the vote.Earlier in the day, lawmakers in the House of Commons approved a bill designed to halt a no-deal Brexit — delivering the second setback to Johnson in as many days — he said: “There is only one way forward for the country.”Johnson insists Britain must leave the EU on Oct. 31, with or without a deal, and he accused the opposition of trying to “overturn the biggest democratic vote in our history,” referring to the outcome of the 2016 referendum to leave the EU.
