In the face of fresh sanctions imposed by the Trump administration, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday struck a defiant tone during a speech to supporters at a government event, saying that the country would never be defeated by the United States and that Venezuela would "win this battle."Maduro also criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to sign the new sanctions against Venezuela as the country grappled with the aftermath of mass shootings, calling him a "promoter of white supremacy and racism."
