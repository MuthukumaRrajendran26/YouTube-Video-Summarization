U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Sunday the National Guard had been activated to help New York state, California and Washington state combat the COVID-19 outbreak. He also announced that medical supplies would be sent to all three states as well as hospital ships - military vessels equipped with hospital beds, medical supplies and equipment - will be deployed to New York and California.Asked about testing for undocumented immigrants, Trump said they would be allowed to get tested at testing centres without fear of being deported, stressing they don't want to send people back to the countries they came from if they have the virus. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams added that they are working to prioritize healthcare workers, inpatients and those at highest risks, stressing to the first group "we hear you."Trump also said the U.S. was open to help other countries if they asked, saying one example would be if they create a less invasive test that's easier for people they would be happy to provide to other countries.The president also expressed well wishes to two Congressional Republicans, Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart and Sen. Rand Paul, who tested positive for COVID-19 and said he hopes they will recover quickly.
