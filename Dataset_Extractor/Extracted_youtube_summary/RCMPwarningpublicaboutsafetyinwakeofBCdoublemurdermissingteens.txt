RCMP are warning the public to stay vigilant about safety in the wake of a double murder and two teens missing both in the northern B.C. area. Australian Lucas Fowler and American Chynna Deese were found shot dead last week in the region prompting a large scale investigation into the homicide. Over the weekend, two teenagers were also reported missing in the same region with their vehicle was found in flames, and authorities say it is "possible" the two may be linked.
