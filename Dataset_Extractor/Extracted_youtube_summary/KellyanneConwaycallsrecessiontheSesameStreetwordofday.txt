The Trump administration continued to downplay concerns over a looming recession on Monday after the U.S. Treasury yield curve temporarily inverted last week for the first time in 12 years."It's nice to see the media finally cover the Trump economy, you seem to cover it only when you can use the Sesame Street word of the day recession," White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said. "The fact is the fundamentals of our economy is very strong."U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Monday added to a chorus of presidential officials downplaying concerns over a looming recession."Eventually there'll be a recession but this inversion is not as reliable, in my view, as people think," Ross said in an interview with Fox Business Network.On Sunday, Trump and top White House officials dismissed concerns that economic growth may be faltering, saying on Sunday they saw little risk of recession despite a volatile week on global bond markets, and insisting their trade war with China was doing no damage to the United States."We're doing tremendously well, our consumers are rich, I gave a tremendous tax cut, and they're loaded up with money," Trump said on Sunday.
