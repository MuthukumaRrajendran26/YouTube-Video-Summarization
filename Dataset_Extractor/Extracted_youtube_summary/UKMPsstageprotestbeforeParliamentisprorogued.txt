Some UK MPs staged a protest, shouting "shame on you" and one MP appearing to hold onto Speaker John Bercow on Tuesday as the official ceremony to suspend Parliament took place. Parliament was eventually prorogued and more chants of "shame on you" could be heard as Conservative MPs left the Commons to head to the House of Lords where the prorogation ceremony would take place.
