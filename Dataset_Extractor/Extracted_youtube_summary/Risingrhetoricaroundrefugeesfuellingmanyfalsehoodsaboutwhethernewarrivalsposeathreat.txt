A lot of attention has been paid to the roughly 45,000 asylum seekers who began crossing into Canada in 2017.One of the most heated debates has been about whether these migrants are “illegal” or “irregular” border crossers.There’s also been a lot of misinformation – on social media, in the press and from government – about asylum seekers and whether they pose a threat to Canadian security.But new data provided exclusively to Global News shows the number of migrants who entered Canada irregularly and were then found to have a serious criminal past is exceptionally low.
