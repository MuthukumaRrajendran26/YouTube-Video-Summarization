Speaking in the House of Commons Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau praised Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's "dedication and service" following news of the latter's resignation. His resignation comes as a direct result of new revelations that he was using Conservative Party money to pay for his children’s private schooling, according to Conservative sources who spoke with Global News.Senior Conservatives say the expenditures were made without the knowledge or approval of the Conservative fund board, including the chair of the board.There are also calls for the party president to resign over the schooling expenses.
