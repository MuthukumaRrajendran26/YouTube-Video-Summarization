FBI Director Christopher Wray told a House panel in Washington D.C. on Wednesday that the Bureau has open over a thousand investigations of theft of U.S. based technology which all lead back to China."On the counter intelligence front we're especially focused on China. They're using an expanding set of non-traditional methods, blending both lawful and unlawful techniques. So on the one hand to come after the United States, on the one hand you've got things like corporate acquisitions, funding of research, but then woven into those you have cyber intrusions, stealing trade secrets and a whole variety of supply chain threats" Wray told the committee.
