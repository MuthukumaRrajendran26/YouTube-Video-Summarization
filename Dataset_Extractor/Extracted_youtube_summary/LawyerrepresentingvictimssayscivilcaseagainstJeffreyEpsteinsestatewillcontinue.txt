A lawyer representing a number of Jeffrey Epstein’s accusers said they intend to file a civil suit against the embattled financier’s estate despite his death.“Predator Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. On behalf of the victims I represent, we would have preferred he lived to face justice. Our civil cases can still proceed against his estate. Victims deserve to be made whole for the lifelong damage he caused. We’re just getting started,” tweeted Lisa Bloom, who is representing two of the alleged victims and says she’s happy to speak to any others.She said in an appearance on MSNBC that her clients are “on the verge” of filing a civil suit against Epstein's estate.According to a statement from the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Epstein died by apparent suicide and was found unresponsive in his cell at 6:30 a.m. Saturday morning.
