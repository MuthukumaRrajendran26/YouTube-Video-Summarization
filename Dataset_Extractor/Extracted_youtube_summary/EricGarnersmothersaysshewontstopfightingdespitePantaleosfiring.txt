The mother of Eric Garner, Gwen Carr, said Monday that the firing of officer Daniel Pantaleo doesn't mean they will stop fighting and said Pantaleo can appeal the decision, but she'll be there "for the long run."Carr did say she was glad, however, that police commissioner James O'Neill had made the "right and conscious decision" to fire Pantaleo.
