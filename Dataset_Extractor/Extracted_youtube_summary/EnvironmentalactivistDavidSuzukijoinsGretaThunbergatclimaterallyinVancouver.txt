Environmental activist David Suzuki joined Greta Thunberg at a climate rally in Vancouver on Friday where he talked about the important role of science in saving the climate and about taking the climate fight to the courts.This strike is organized by local youth climate strike organizing group Sustainabiliteens and builds on the momentum of September 27’s historic climate strike, which saw over 150 000 people in the streets of downtown Vancouver.
