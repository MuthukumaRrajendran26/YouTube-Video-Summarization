A senior RCMP official arrested and is facing charges, including breach of trust, communicating "special operational information," and obtaining information in order to pass it to a "foreign entity", was reportedly a top adviser for former RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson, according to sources. The charges don't specify which foreign entity or what type of information, but a source said Cameron Ortis had allegedly amassed "terabytes of information," including a list of undercover operatives, when he was arrested in Ottawa on Thursday, Sept. 13, 2019. Ortis faces up to 37 years in prison if convicted on all counts.
