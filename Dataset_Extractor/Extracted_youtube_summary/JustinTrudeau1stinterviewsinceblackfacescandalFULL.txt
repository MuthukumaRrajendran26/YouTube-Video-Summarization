Liberal leader Justin Trudeau sat down with Global National’s Dawna Friesen Tuesday, while making a campaign stop in British Columbia. This was Trudeau’s first sit-down interview since images emerged of him in brown and blackface last week.Trudeau also faced questions on a range of other issues, including his plans to tackle climate change and improve healthcare — and the price-tag on those promises, and was asked why Canadians should give him another mandate after he broke ethics rules twice in his first term.
