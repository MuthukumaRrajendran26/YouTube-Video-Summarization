A vigil was held Friday, Sept. 6, 2019 for the victims of a fatal boat fire in California earlier this week that left 34 people dead. People laid flowers for the victims and spoke about what the loss meant for so many. Dozens of people were trapped on a scuba diving boat that caught fire before dawn on Monday and quickly engulfed the boat. Officials say smoke, not fire, was to blame for the deaths.
