Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that U.S. President Donald Trump’s Mideast plan was not conditional on whether or not the Palestinian territories accept the deal or not, saying “whether they accept it or not, it's going to happen." Netanyahu added that mapping of the boundaries between Israel and the proposed Palestinian state is already underway.
