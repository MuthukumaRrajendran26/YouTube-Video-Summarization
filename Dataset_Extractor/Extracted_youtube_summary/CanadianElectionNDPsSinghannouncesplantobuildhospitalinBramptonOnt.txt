Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is channeled his roots as a member of the Ontario legislature on Sept. 12, by promising to build a hospital in the city of Brampton if he is elected prime minister.The commitment, which comes despite the fact hospitals fall squarely within the domain of the provinces, suggests the New Democrats are concentrating their efforts in areas where they havethe best chance to win seats.Although the federal Liberals swept Brampton's five seats in 2015, Singh is no stranger to the area northwest of Toronto, which he represented as deputy leader of Ontario's New Democrats. It also has a large south Asian population.The NDP leader acknowledged the difficulty he could face in fulfilling the promise, given that Doug Ford's Progressive Conservative government would ultimately have jurisdiction over theproject.
