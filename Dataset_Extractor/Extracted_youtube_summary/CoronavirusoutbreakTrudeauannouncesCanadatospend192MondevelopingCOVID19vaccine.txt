Federal ministers will speak soon after Trudeau at approx. 12pm ET.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada is spending $192 million on developing and producing vaccines for the novel coronavirus.He says being prepared to mass-produce a vaccine, no matter who creates it, will be essential for suppressing COVID-19 in Canada in the long run.Trudeau said this will allow the government to “put their plan into motion,” including up to $82 billion in support for families, workers and businesses impacted by the pandemic.“I know that together we can protect Canadians, save jobs and set the groundwork for our economy to rebound after this crisis,” he said.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says there is no tolerance for those flouting orders to socially distance from others in an effort to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.“You all think you’re invincible. You’re not. Enough is enough,” he warned in an address to Canadians on Monday from Rideau Cottage, where he is currently in self-isolation.
