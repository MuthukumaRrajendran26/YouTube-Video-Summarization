Canadian firefighter Scott Ruddy held the leash of his rescue dog tightly as the trained animal stepped under, over and through mountains of scattered debris in a flattened field where, just two weeks ago, houses stood before Hurricane Dorian tore through the Bahamas.Wearing a helmet and goggles, the Burnaby, British Columbia fire lieutenant kept a close eye on his dog as it made its way around lumber, household items and even tossed cars.With no electricity, water or internet in the area, Ruddy described near impossible conditions.
