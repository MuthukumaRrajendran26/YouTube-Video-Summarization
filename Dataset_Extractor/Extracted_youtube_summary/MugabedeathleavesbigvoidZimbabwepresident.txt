President of Zimbabwe Emmerson Mnangagwa on Sept. 6 said his predecessor Robert Mugabe's death "leaves a big void in our nation". Mugabe died at the age of 95 on Friday in the Gleneagles Hospital in the southeast Asian city-state of Singapore, where he had received treatment in recent years. An ex-guerrilla chief, Mugabe took power after independence from white minority rule in 1980 and presided over a country whose early promise was eroded by economic turmoil and allegations of human rights violations.
