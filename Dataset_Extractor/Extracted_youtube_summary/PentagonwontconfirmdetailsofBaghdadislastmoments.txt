A Pentagon official said on Wednesday that he could not confirm "one way or another" any details about Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's last seconds.In an address following Baghdadi's death, U.S. President Donald Trump had suggested he may order the release of the video so that the world knows al-Baghdadi did not die of a hero and spent his final moments “crying, “whimpering” and “screaming.”Trump said he watched the operation from the White House Situation room as it played out live.
