Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that they agreed with the findings of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal over compensation for First Nations children, saying conversations to get the compensation right can't happen during a writ period and they are appealing the ruling to give them time to "get it right."He also said that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling over compensation for First Nations children came down days before the election period began and said the deadline to bring a plan of action by December is "simply not practical given the electoral context we're in" and more time is needed to get it right.
