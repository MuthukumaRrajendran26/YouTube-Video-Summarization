The New Zealand volcano that fatally erupted earlier this week is "highly volatile" and could explode again in the next day, making it too risky to send in recovery teams to retrieve bodies, officials said on Thursday.The bodies of eight victims presumed dead are on White Island, and the official death toll is expected to rise from eight to 16. More than two dozen people are in hospital, many in a critical condition with burn injuries. One of the injured has not yet been identified."We are now living with a growing sense of desperation to bring home those that we know are there and those we love," Whakatane Mayor Judy Turner told reporters. "The frustration of those families most affected is completely understandable."The volcano, a popular tourist day-tripper destination, erupted on Monday (December 9), spewing ash and steam over the island.
