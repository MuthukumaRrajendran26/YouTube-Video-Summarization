Manitoba RCMP has reportedly found new clues in the ongoing search for two B.C. murder suspects along the Nelson River after finding items they say are "directly linked" to the two men. They said on Tuesday that the items had been found on Friday. Authorities had been searching along the river over the weekend after a damaged boat had been found.
