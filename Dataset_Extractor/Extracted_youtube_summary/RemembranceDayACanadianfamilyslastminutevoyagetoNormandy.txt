As part of the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, France, a local school was named after Louis Valmont, a Canadian soldier who died there. The ceremony happened back in June, with Valmont's family invited as guests of honour. But as Redmond Shannon reports, they almost didn't make it there.
