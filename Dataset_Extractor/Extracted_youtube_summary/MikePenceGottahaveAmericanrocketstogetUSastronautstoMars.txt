U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence said on Saturday during an interview with CBS' Major Garrett that the U.S. is focused on developing the technologies needed to send American astronauts back to the moon and to Mars. Pence said the U.S. would have American astronauts launching into space from the U.S. within the year, and that when the U.S. goes back to the moon it's "not going to visit. We're going to stay."Pence also said that the U.S. will turn to private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin if traditional NASA "can't do the job."
