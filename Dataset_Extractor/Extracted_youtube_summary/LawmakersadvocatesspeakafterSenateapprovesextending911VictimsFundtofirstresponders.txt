Democratic and Republican lawmakers were joined by advocates, including comedian Jon Stewart, after the Senate voted overwhelmingly to extend the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund to first responders.Republican Sen. Rand Paul had on Wednesday blocked fast-track approval of the bipartisan bill that would ensure a victims’ compensation fund related to the Sept. 11 attacks never runs out of money.Paul objected to a request by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., to approve the bill by unanimous consent.Paul, R-Ky., questioned the bill’s 70-year time frame and said any new spending should be offset by corresponding cuts. The government already faces a $22 trillion debt, a figure that grows every year, Paul said.The Congressional Budget Office estimates the 9-11 bill would result in about $10.2 billion in additional compensation payments over 10 years, including more than $4 billion for claims already filed.
