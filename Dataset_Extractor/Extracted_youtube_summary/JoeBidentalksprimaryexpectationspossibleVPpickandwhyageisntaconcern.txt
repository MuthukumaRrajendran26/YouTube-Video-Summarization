Democratic presidential hopeful and former vice-president Joe Biden spoke on Saturday in South Carolina about his campaign so far and discussed various questions that have arisen during his run.He talked about his expectations in the primaries, calling it a "marathon" and that even if he doesn't win in one state there are others he expects big victories. Biden also spoke about questions over who he would pick as his vice-presidential running mate, saying it was too soon to make that choice but he "wouldn't hesitate" to pick a woman or African American, so long as they were "consistent with what I believe in."The former vice-president also addressed concerns he and other Democratic nominees, such as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have faced about age, saying he brings with him experience, including sitting in the Obama administration's war room.
