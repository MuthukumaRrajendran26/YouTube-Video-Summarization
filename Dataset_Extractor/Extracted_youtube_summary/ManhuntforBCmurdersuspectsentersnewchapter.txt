RCMP is beginning to scale down its search efforts in northern Manitoba and some of the focus is starting to look at northern Ontario after receiving an unconfirmed sighting of the two suspects in the B.C. murders. Officers responded but their search turned up nothing. With answers scarce, some people say there is still unease, especially in Gillam, Man. where a major search effort has taken place over the past several days but is now paring down. The search will, however, continue in the community despite the smaller search team that will remain.Authorities ask people across Canada to call 911 if they see someone who matches the suspects' descriptions.
