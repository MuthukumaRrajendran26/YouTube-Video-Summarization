A group of masked Hong Kong protesters on Monday decried police treatment over the violent weekend, equating it to "dehumanization" committed by Adolf Hitler's genocidal regime, and calling for an independent investigation.On the same day, Hong Kong police admitted to using undercover officers in the weekend protests and defended their actions, following local media reports and video surfacing of police officers appearing to be disguised as protesters to assist with arrests.
