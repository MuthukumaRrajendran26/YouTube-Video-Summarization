U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused Rep. Adam Schiff of making up the details of a call between Trump and Ukraine's leader and reading it out to Congress, calling on Schiff to resign "in disgrace." Trump also renewed allegations of corruption against former vice-president and presidential hopeful Joe Biden, but said he'd rather run against Biden "than almost any" Democratic candidates.
