Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan warned on Friday in a speech to world leaders at the United Nations that there would be a "bloodbath" when India lifts its curfew in the disputed region of Kashmir and that any all-out conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations would reverberate far beyond their borders.Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of Pakistan's Lahore on Friday to protest against India's treatment of Kashmir as Khan delivered his address.
