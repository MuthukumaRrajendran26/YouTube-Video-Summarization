French climate activists held allegedly stolen portraits of President Emmanuel Macron upside down in front of the Eiffel Tower on Sunday as a way to denounce what they say has been a lack of action by the government on climate change. The demonstration coincided with the annual U.N. climate summit in Madrid, which opened last Monday. Negotiators are hoping to resolve remaining disagreements on how to implement the Paris accord by the end of COP25.
