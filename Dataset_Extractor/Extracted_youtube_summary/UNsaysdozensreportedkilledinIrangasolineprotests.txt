A United Nations official said on Tuesday the UN was "deeply concerned" over reported violations of international norms in Iran and that dozens had been killed during protests in response to a hike in fuel prices. UN spokesperson Rupert Colville called on authorities in Iran to restore the internet service, cut off since November 16, and uphold the demonstrators rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.
