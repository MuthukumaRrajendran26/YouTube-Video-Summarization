Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced Thursday morning that if elected, he will increase the Age Tax Credit to save individual seniors up to $150 and couples as much as $300. Scheer also told reporters Thursday morning that in his opinion, Canadians cannot accept Justin Trudeau’s apology for recently-surfaced examples of racist makeup after Scheer said Trudeau lied about the existence of a video showing him in “blackface” during his recent public apology.
