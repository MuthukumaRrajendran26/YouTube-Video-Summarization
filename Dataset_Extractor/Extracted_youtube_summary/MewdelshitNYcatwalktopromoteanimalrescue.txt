It was a literal catwalk in the lobby of the Algonquin Hotel in New York Aug. 1, as the legendary scene was filled with feline fashionistas.Some ten dressed-up cats were entered into the annual fashion show to raise awareness for animal rescue and adoption.The year's theme was, "It's a Small World." The cats represented countries including Ireland, Spain, the United Kingdom and of course, the United States."We want people to be aware that adoption is the only option," said event organizer, Alice De Almeida.All the proceeds of the event went to the Mayor's Alliance for New York City Animals, which helps find homes for stray cats and dogs.
