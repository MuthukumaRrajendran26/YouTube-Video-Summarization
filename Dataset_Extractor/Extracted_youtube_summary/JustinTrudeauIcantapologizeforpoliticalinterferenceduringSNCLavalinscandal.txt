Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he “can’t apologize” for what the federal ethics commissioner has now ruled was improper political influence in the SNC-Lavalin scandal.That’s because he maintains he was trying to protect Canadian jobs, despite the commissioner finding Trudeau and his staff broke the rules repeatedly over the course of several months in which they pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to help the Quebec firm avoid a criminal trial.“I can’t apologize for standing up for Canadian jobs,” he said when asked about the report on Wednesday.
