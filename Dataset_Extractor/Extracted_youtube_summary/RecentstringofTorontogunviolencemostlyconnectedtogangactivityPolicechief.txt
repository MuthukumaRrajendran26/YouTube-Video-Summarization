During an Aug. 9 press conference, Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders commented on the investigations of the recent string of gun violence in Toronto within the last 10 days. He said the vast majority if these shootings are related to street gang activity. He said that roughly 326 people charged with firearm offences in Toronto out on bail, and the Toronto Police Service is hoping to build a stronger relationship with the courts and let them know "the impact these types of offences are having on the community."
