Greg Zanis, the creator of "Crosses for Losses," who creates crosses for the victims of mass shootings says for him to come to incidents like the El Paso shooting is "like a day in hell."Zanis makes hand-made crosses to honour those killed in mass shootings and has done so since 1997, with over 20,000 crosses made. He started making them after his father-in-law was murdered in the 90s, prompting his desire to help and reach out to those facing similar situations.
