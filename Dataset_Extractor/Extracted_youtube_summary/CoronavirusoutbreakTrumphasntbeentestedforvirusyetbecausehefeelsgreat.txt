Speaking to reporters Tuesday in Washington, D.C., U.S. President Donald Trump said he hadn't yet been personally screened for COVID-19 because he "feels great" and isn't exhibiting any symptoms. Trump also disagreed with the sentiment from some lawmakers and journalists that the U.S. is lagging behind when it comes to screening for COVID-19, saying he thinks the country has done a "very good job on testing."
