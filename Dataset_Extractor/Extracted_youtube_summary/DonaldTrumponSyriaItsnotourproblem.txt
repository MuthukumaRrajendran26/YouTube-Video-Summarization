U.S. President Donald Trump said he's "fine" with Russia involving itself further in the ongoing conflict in Syria, saying Syria has "a lot of sand" for Russia to "play with." Trump also said on Wednesday that U.S. troops have been removed from the region in northern Syria, adding "it's time for us to come home. We're not a policing agent."Turkey has begun an offensive incursion into the region in opposition to the Kurdish forces, who were allies of the United States in the war against ISIS.
