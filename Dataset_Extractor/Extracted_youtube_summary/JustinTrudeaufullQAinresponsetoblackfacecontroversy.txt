Controversy erupted around Trudeau's re-election campaign late Wednesday following the release of a 2001 photo of him wearing dark paint on his hands and face while dressed as Aladdin in a turban.He has apologized and acknowledged his decision to wear blackface was racist.More images of Trudeau in skin-darkening face paint, including a brief video from the early 1990s, have since surfaced.Speaking to reporters today in Winnipeg, Trudeau says he didn't recall some of those earlier images and that he didn't see at the time that it was wrong because of his privileged upbringing.He says he deeply regrets his behaviour and that he understands the hurt he caused to people who face intolerance on a regular basis.
