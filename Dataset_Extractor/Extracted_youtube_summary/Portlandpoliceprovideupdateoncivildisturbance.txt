Police arrested 13 people and seized metal poles, bear spray and other weapons Saturday as hundreds of far-right protesters and anti-fascist counter-demonstrators swarmed downtown Portland, Oregon, and authorities closed bridges and streets to try to keep the rival groups apart.The city’s mayor said the situation was “potentially dangerous and volatile.” As of early afternoon, most of the right-wing groups had left the area via a downtown bridge and police used officers on bikes and in riot gear to keep black clad, helmet and mask-wearing anti-fascist protesters — known as antifa — from following them.
