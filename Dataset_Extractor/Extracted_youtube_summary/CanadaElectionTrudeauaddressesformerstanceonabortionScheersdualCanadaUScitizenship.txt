Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau told reporters on Friday that it was not "coherent or consistent" to hold anti-abortion views, referring to his own stance in 2011, saying he's "evolved past" that perspective and doesn't "feel the need to say" he is against abortion.  Trudeau also commented on Conservative Andrew Scheer's "anti-choice convictions," questioning his ability to defend women's rights if elected as Prime Minister.Trudeau also said that having dual citizenship should not disqualify anyone from being a politician, but that Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer needs to "be honest with Canadians" as a candidate for Prime Minister.
