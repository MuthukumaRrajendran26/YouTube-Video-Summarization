Investigators were trying to piece together the movements of a large cargo truck found Wednesday containing the bodies of 39 people in one of Britain’s worst people smuggling tragedies.  Police initially said the truck had traveled through Ireland and then to Wales via ferry, but that theory changed Wednesday afternoon when Essex police in England said they believe the truck went from the port of Zeebrugge in Belgium to Purfleet, England.Police did not explain the change from the route explained at a news conference Wednesday morning.Details about the victims, including where they were from, were scarce. Essex police said they have not been identified — a process they warned would be slow.
