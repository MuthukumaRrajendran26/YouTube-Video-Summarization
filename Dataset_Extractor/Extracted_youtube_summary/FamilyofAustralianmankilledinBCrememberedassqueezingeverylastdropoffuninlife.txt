The family of Lucas Fowler, who was found dead alongside American Chynna Deese in northern B.C., was remembered Friday by his family as a man who squeezed "every last drop of fun out of life." His father Stephen said he envied Fowler's drive to pursue his passion for travelling. They also said when the tragedy struck, Fowler was "deeply in love" and the family had looked forward to having Deese as part of their family. Authorities are still searching for the two suspects wanted in connection to the couple's death as well as that of another man in northern B.C.
