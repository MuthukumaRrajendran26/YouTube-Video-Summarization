Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot took Ivanka Trump to task at a Tuesday news conference, telling reporters that her tweet about shootings over the weekend were inaccurate and "not helpful."Trump's tweet said, "With 7 dead and 52 wounded near a playground in the Windy City- and little national outrage or media coverage- we mustn't become numb to the violence faced by inner city communities every day."Lightfoot responded by saying "She got the numbers wrong, she got the location wrong. That's the danger of trying to govern via tweet."
