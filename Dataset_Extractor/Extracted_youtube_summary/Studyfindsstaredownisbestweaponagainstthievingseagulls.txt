Breaking news from a park bench in the United Kingdom: you can scare seagulls away from your chips by making fierce eye contact with them.That’s the conclusion Exeter University researcher Madeleine Goumas and her team reached in a study published in the Royal Society’s Biology Letters on Tuesday.The findings could revolutionize your next visit to the beach — if the science holds up.“We found that human gaze direction significantly affected gulls’ latency to approach the food,” Goumas wrote in her paper. “Gulls took less time to approach when the experimenter was facing away versus looking directly at them.”In other words, seagulls really do try to snatch your food when you’re not looking.
