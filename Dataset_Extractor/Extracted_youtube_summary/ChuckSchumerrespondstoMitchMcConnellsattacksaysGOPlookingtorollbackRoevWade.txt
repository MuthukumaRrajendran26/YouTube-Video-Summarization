Responding to comments made by Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the floor of the United States Senate Thursday morning, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said McConnell deliberately misrepresented his comments made outside the Supreme Court Wednesday, and accused the Republican Party of trying to roll back Roe v. Wade.McConnell was responding to Schumer's remarks at a rally outside the court while a high-profile abortion case was being argued inside. "You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You will not know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions," Schumer said, naming the two appointees of President Donald Trump, according to video of the rally available online.
