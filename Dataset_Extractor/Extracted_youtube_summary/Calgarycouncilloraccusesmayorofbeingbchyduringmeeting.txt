Calgary’s city hall erupted with infighting on Sept. 9 during the first fall session of council.Tempers flared when Ward 11 Coun. Jeromy Farkas attempted to add a motion to the agenda calling for the city to establish a so-called “Blue Book” standard and make public all spending in excess of $10,000.To add the motion to the agenda past deadline and have it debated as a matter of urgent business, Farkas required a two-thirds vote from council.It was as Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi explained this to Ward 4 Coun. Sean Chu, who was supporting Farkas’ motion, that sparks flew.
