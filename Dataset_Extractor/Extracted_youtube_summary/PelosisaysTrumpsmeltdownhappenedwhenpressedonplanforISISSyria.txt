House Speaker Nancy Pelosi further discussed President Donald Trump's "meltdown," during her weekly address, saying the boiling point was when Trump was pressed for a concrete plan to combat ISIS now that some of them have been unleashed in Syria after he withdrew U.S. troops from the northern region, a move that was condemned by the House of Representatives.The Democrats exited the meeting complaining that they were expecting to hear Trump provide details on a plan for dealing with an unfolding "crisis" in Syria but instead were subjected to "derogatory" language from him about congressional Democrats and Democratic former President Barack Obama.Subscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt#GlobalNews #PelosiAddress #Pelosi #Trump
