Groovy 1960's "flower power" was in full bloom in upstate New York state on Aug. 17 during the second to last day of the annual anniversary concert that marks the landmark Woodstock music festival of 1969.The much-anticipated Woodstock anniversary concert started on Thursday in the rural farming community of Bethel. Thousands of people have been gathering at either the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts to watch the bands perform on stage, or camped out at the nearby wooded area close to the dairy farm where the original concert was held in 1969.On Saturday, the ground breaking guitar rock band Santana headlined the day's line up of music along with The Doobie Brothers. Both bands had played at the original concert fifty years before.
