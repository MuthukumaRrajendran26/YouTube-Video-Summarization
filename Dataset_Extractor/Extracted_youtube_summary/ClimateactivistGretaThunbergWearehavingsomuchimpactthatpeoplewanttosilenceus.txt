Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who joined a climate strike in Montreal, said on Friday that people want to "silence" her because she and the activists are "becoming too loud for people," but Thunberg said that should be seen as a compliment.The 16-year-old spoke at the protest, which is taking place less than a month before a federal election where the environment is one of the top issues for voters, according to polls.
