Hundreds of masked protesters marched through the streets of Hong Kong on Saturday, many of them wearing masks in open defiance of a new government ban on covering faces during political demonstrations.Protests continued after a night of chaos in which police shot a teenage boy and pro-democracy protesters torched businesses and metro stations, which remained closed Saturday morning.The U.N. human rights chief slammed the face-mask ban and called for an investigation after the past week saw the worst outbreak of violence so far.
