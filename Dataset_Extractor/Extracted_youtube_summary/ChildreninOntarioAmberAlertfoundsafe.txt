The search for five children who were the subject of an Amber Alert in Ontario is over. Niagara Regional Police say they are safe and sound. The alert had been issued on Tuesday afternoon, but police said it had expired later that night. As Shallima Maharaj reports, as one search comes to an end the pursuit of answers continues.
