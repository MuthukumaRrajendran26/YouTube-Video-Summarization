Global News has obtained video showing Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau in blackface, the third instance of racist dress to come to light in 12 hours.Trudeau addressed reporters in Winnipeg on Thursday. He said what he did “hurt” racialized Canadians.“Darkening your face, regardless of the context or circumstances, is always unacceptable because of the racist history of blackface,” he said.“I should have understood that then and I never should have done it.”Pressed by the media to say how many times he appeared in racist makeup, Trudeau said he was wary of being definitive.“I think the question is, ‘How can you not remember that.’ The fact is, I didn’t understand how hurtful this is to people who live with discrimination every single day,” he said.
