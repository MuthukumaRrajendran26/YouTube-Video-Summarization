Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne provided an update Sunday on Canada's bid for a seat on the U.N. Security Council and said so far he's heard from African leaders that they'd welcome Canada on the United Nations Security Council, adding several nations have signalled that Canada is "more engaged" than their previous bid. Champagne also said that the second plane chartered by Canada to repatriate Canadians from Wuhan, China was on its way to bring them home.The issue of the black boxes of the Ukrainian International Airlines flight that crashed in January was also raised Sunday, with Champagne saying Iran had to "come to terms" with the fact the expertise and technology needed to examine the black boxes could not be brought to Iran, and was why the devices had to be sent to France.
