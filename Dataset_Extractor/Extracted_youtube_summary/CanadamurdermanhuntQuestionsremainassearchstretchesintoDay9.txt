The manhunt for B.C. murder suspects Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, and Kam McLeod, 19, continues into its ninth day on Wednesday. The two Port Alberni, B.C., men have Canada-wide warrants out for their arrests. They are charged with the second-degree murder of Leonard Dyck, 64, and are also suspects in the double homicide of Lucas Fowler and Chynna Deese. RCMP have concentrated their search efforts in the remote region of northern Manitoba. They were canvassing door to door in Gillam last weekend and were present in the small community of York Landing this past Sunday and Monday.
