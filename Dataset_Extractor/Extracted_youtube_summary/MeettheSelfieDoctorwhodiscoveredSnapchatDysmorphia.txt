Dr. Tijion Esho may be better known as the "Selfie Doctor" after defining the term "Snapchat Dysmorphia."The UK cosmetic surgeon has seen many patients enter his clinic seeking treatments to alter their appearances to reflect the looks they are able to achieve on social media apps like Instagram and Snapchat through the assistance of filters and facial editing apps.According to Dr. Esho, cosmetic surgeons worldwide also experienced these requests, which he says can represent signs of physical and mental health issues.
