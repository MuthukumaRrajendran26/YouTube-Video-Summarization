On Monday morning, U.S. President Donald Trump congratulated Gen. Mark Milley on becoming the new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Trump attended a rainy welcome ceremony for Milley at a military base in Arlington, Virginia.  Trump says he's always heard that rain on a big event brings luck and told Milley, "I want to congratulate you. You're my friend, you're my adviser and you deserve this position I never had a doubt."  The role of the Joint Chiefs chairman is to advise the president, defense secretary and the National Security Council on military issues. Milley, formerly the Army chief of staff, succeeds Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford.
