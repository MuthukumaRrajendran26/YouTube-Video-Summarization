Academics and researchers across Canada are launching an unprecedented project to monitor and combat online disinformation during the federal election campaign. The collaboration between universities in BC, Ontario and Quebec will involve monitoring social media platforms and hundreds of thousands of websites, looking for trends that could point to organised disinformation campaigns. They’ll combine that effort with regular national surveys and a study of 2,000 voters whose online activities will be tracked. As part of Global News' 2019 Federal Election coverage, Jeff Semple will explore disinformation and provide a forensic analysis of the distortion campaigns that proliferate largely on social media in order to keep audiences informed and armed with the truth throughout the campaign.
