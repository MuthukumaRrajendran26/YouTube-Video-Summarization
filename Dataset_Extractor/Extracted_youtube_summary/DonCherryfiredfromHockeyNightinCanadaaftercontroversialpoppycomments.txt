Long-time hockey commentator Don Cherry is out as co-host of Coach’s Corner following televised remarks where he claimed new immigrants don’t wear poppies and implied they don’t support veterans.“Following further discussions with Don Cherry after Saturday Night’s broadcast, it has been decided it is the right time for him to immediately step down,” Sportsnet president Bart Yabsley said in a statement. “During the broadcast, he made divisive remarks that do not represent our values or what we stand for.”Cherry, 85, made the comments during his weekly “Coach’s Corner” segment on “Hockey Night in Canada” that sparked fierce condemnation from the public, politicians and the National Hockey League.
