During the G7 summit on Sunday in Biarritz, France, U.S. President Donald Trump told British Prime Minister Boris Johnson that the U.K. will have a "very big trade deal" with the U.S., adding that Johnson was the "right man" to take the U.K. out of the European Union.The G7 gathering is taking place against a backdrop of growing worries about a global economic downturn and coincides with an era of international disunity across an array of issues that have strained decades-old allegiances. Major policy differences over trade protectionism, climate change and Iran clouded the run-up to the summit in the Atlantic coastal resort of Biarritz.
