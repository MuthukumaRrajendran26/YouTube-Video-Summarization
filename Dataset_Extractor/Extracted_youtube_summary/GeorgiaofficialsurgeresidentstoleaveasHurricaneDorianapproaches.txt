U.N. and Red Cross relief officials rushed to deal with an unfolding humanitarian crisis in  Hurricane Dorian’s wake Tuesday after the most powerful storm ever to hit the Bahamas devastated thousands of homes, crippled hospitals and trapped people in attics. At least five deaths were reported, with the full scope of the disaster still unknown.Over two million people along the coast in Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina were warned to evacuate. While the threat of a direct hit on Florida had all but evaporated, Dorian was expected to pass dangerously close to Georgia and South Carolina — and perhaps strike North Carolina — on Thursday or Friday.More than a quarter-million visitors and residents have been told to leave North Carolina’s coastal region ahead of the hurricane.The most populous coastal county to be evacuated is Dare County, where 250,000 people, including 36,000 residents, have been told to get out.
