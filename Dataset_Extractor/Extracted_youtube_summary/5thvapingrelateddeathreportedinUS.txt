Health officials in the U.S. are warning people to stop vaping until the cause of a severe respiratory illness linked to five deaths is determined.Research published in the New England Journal of Medicine found the first 53 cases were healthy people with most being men. The cases had a median age of 19, most had to be hospitalized and half required intensive care. Investigators believe the illnesses have been caused by exposure to some kind of chemical used in the vape juice inhaled from e-cigarettes, but it's not known what substance that is. Health Canada is monitoring what is happening in the U.S., but no warnings have been issued.
