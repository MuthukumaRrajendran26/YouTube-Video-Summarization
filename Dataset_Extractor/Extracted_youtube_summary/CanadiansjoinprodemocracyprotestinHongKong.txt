Canadian couple Mary Cheu and Jean-Christophe Clément moved from Montreal to Cheu’s native Hong Kong 10 years ago. But lately, they’ve been feeling homesick.“We’re a bit worried, that’s for sure,” Cheu said, explaining her fears over Beijing tightening its grip on their semi-autonomous city.“What we are seeing is a deterioration of basic rights that we had enjoyed when we were living in Canada. And we expect to have those same kind of basic rights in Hong Kong.”The couple took that message to streets on Sunday, joining 1.7 million others at a pro-democracy rally in Hong Kong’s Victoria Park, according to organizers.
