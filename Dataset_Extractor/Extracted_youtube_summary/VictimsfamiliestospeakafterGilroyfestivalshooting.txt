Three young people died when a gunman opened fire at the popular Gilroy Garlic Festival in California this past weekend. Two were children — a teen who may have saved a relative’s life and a 6-year-old who was a sharp dresser — and the third was a 25-year-old New York college graduate who loved sports.
