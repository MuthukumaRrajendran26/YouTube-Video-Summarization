He looked for freedom on the Berlin Wall in 1989 and now, as the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Wall, pop icon and actor David Hasselhoff said the song's message of hope is more relevant than ever.Hasselhoff told reporters in Berlin this in September, while promoting a new album and audio book entitled "Up Against the Wall" which was released on the October 3 anniversary of German reunification.The thriller, set against the backdrop of the end of the Cold War, fictionalizes the real David Hasselhoff being mistaken for a spy and the spy mistaken for Hasselhoff.Affectionately known as "The Hoff", the singer and actor shot to fame on TV shows "Knight Rider" and "Baywatch", but in West Germany he found fame on music charts in the summer before the fall of the Berlin Wall with "Looking For Freedom".The song was a cover version of the 1970s German hit, "Auf Der Strasse Nach Suden" ('Freedom'), and with the political landscape changing in Europe, Germans took it to heart.For years the myth has circulated, albeit with some tongue in cheek, that Hasselhoff was solely responsible for bringing down the Wall and reuniting East and West Berlin, which he has also strongly denied.Hasselhoff maintained strong links to the German capital and took part in several campaigns in 2013 to save a part of the Berlin Wall threatened by developers.
