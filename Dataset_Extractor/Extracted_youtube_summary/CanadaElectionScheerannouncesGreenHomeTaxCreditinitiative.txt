Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer spoke in Jonquiere, Quebec Wednesday morning to announce his party's proposed Green Homes Tax Credit, a two-year program to encourage homeowners to renovate their homes with emissions-reducing technologies with a 20% income tax credit for "green" improvements that could save them up to $3800 dollars annually.
