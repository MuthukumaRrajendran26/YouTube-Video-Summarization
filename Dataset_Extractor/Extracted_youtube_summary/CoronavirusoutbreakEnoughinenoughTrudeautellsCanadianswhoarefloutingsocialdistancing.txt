Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says there is no tolerance for those flouting orders to socially distance from others in an effort to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.“You all think you’re invincible. You’re not. Enough is enough,” he warned in an address to Canadians on Monday from Rideau Cottage, where he is currently in self-isolation.“Go home and stay home.”Trudeau’s warning comes as provinces and territories over the weekend threatened to roll out fines and potentially even criminal enforcement measures like arrests in order to enforce social distancing.
