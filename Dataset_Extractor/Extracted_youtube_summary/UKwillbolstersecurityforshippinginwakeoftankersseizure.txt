U.K. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Monday, July 22, 2019 that the UK would be working with European allies to bolster security for shipping vessels following the seizure of a British-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran seized the ship last week in the busy waterway. Hunt also said it had raised the security alert level for tankers.
