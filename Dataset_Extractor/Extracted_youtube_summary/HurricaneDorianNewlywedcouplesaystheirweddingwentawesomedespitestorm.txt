A newlywed couple spoke with Global News chief meteorologist Anthony Farnell on Sunday as they toured a street lined with fallen trees, saying their wedding that happened the day prior went "awesome" and most people showed up despite Hurricane Dorian making its way through the province.They said their wedding was to happen in the evening of Saturday, Sept. 7, 2019 but due to Dorian it was pushed back a few times to 12 p.m. ADT. Despite this, they said they enjoyed their wedding before the storm arrived and joked they don't plan on naming any children after the storm.
