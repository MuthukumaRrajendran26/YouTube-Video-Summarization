Jon Stewart spoke out on Tuesday after the Senate voted to extend the 9/11 Victim Fund to include first responders. Stewart said he hopes the decision will allow first responders "to heal without the burden of having to advocate."The Congressional Budget Office estimates the 9-11 bill would result in about $10.2 billion in additional compensation payments over 10 years, including more than $4 billion for claims already filed.
