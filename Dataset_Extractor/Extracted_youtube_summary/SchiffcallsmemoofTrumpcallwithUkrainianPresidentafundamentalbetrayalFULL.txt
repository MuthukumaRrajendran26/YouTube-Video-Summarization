House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff held a news conference after the White House released a memo of U.S. President Donald Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that sparked an official Congressional impeachment inquiry. Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate whether former Vice President Joe Biden shut down an investigation into a company where his son worked, according to a summary of the call released by the Trump administration on Wednesday.
