U.S. President Donald Trump continued his criticism of the impeachment probe against him, saying that Democrats have the votes in the house but claimed the "phony witch hunt" had resulted in his poll numbers going "through the roof" and campaign fundraising to set a record. Trump also claimed that Democrats had "taken our rights away," though he did not elaborate whose rights were taken away. The president said that his administration had been treated "very unfairly" and believed the impeachment probe would pass the House of Representatives, but claimed most Democrats don't want to impeach. As well, Trump said when he speaks with foreign leaders he does so in an appropriate way.
