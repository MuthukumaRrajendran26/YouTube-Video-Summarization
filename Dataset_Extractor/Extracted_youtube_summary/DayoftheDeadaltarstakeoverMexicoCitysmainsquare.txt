Mexico City came alive on Friday to celebrate the dead with a Day of the Dead celebration, complete a with massive offering dedicated to iconic deceased Mexicans in the capital city's main square, the Zocalo. The Day of the Dead is a pre-Hispanic tradition in which families remember their dead and celebrate the continuity of life. They set up offerings to the dead which include photographs, food, candles, flowers, personal items, skulls made out of sugar, skeletons of paper mache and sweets.The annual event holds that the dead return once a year from the underworld. To mark their return, Mexicans construct altars. Burning incense and candles, participants adorn the altars with candy skulls, marigolds, chocolate coffins, paper mache skeletons and photographs of the deceased. Nov. 1 is reserved for children returning from the afterlife. Nov. 2 is for adults.Mexico's Day of the Dead celebrations are considered a Cultural Heritage by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and with the success of Pixar's Coco film, the event has become a tourist postcard for the country.
