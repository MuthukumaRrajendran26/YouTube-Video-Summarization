U.S. President Donald Trump visited parts of Nashville on Friday to assess damage caused by a series of tornadoes that hit the state of Tennessee earlier in the week, killing 25 people."This is real devastation like you'll never see, hopefully again," Trump said after reviewing parts of the damage. He added that the state had "tremendous heart" and that the reconstruction taking place could not occur without the community's "great leadership." Trump was joined by Tennessee leaders: Cookeville Mayor Ricky Shelton, Putnam County Mayor Randy Porter, Tennessee First Lady Maria Lee and Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, who told reporters that it had “been a painful tragic week” for the state, but that "Tennesseans are hopeful."
