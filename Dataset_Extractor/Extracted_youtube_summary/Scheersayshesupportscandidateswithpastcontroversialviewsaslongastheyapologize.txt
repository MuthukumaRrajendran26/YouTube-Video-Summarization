During a scrum with reporters on an overnight flight to Vancouver, B.C. on Sunday, Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer said he would stand by Conservative candidates who expressed controversial opinions in the past, as long as they apologize and take responsibility for it now. Mike Le Couteur reports.Scheer had a wide-ranging chat with reporters on an overnight flight to Vancouver Sunday in a bid to put his campaign back on solid footing following another day of message trouble delivered by Liberal researchers digging up dirt on Tory candidates.Since Thursday morning, the second day of the campaign, Scheer has fired one candidate and defended four others for comments about abortion, transgender rights and Muslims as well as homophobic slurs, almost all of them after social media posts and online videos were unearthed by Liberal researchers.
