U.S. President Donald Trump urged the new leader of Ukraine this summer to investigate the son of former Vice-President Joe Biden, a person familiar with the matter said. Democrats condemned what they saw as a clear effort to damage a political rival, now at the centre of an explosive whistleblower complaint against Trump.Biden told a reporter on Sept. 21 that President Donald Trump 'deserves to be investigated" over a classified whistleblower complaint, and that Trump is using an "abuse of power" to smear him.
