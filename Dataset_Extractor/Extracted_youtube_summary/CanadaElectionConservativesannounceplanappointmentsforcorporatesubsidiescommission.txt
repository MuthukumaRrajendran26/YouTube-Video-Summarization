Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer announced on Oct. 12 in Burnaby, B.C., that in his first 100 days on the job, if elected prime minister, his government would appoint Kevin Falcon, former deputy premier and finance minister of British Columbia, and Yves Desjardins-Siciliano, the former president and CEO of VIA Rail Canada, to oversee the Commission on the Reduction of Government Subsidy Programs to Corporations. This program would review and reduce business subsidies, and operate under the Department of Finance.
