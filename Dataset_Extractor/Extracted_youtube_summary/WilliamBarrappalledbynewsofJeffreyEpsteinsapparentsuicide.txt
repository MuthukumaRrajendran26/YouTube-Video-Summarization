U.S. Attorney General William Barr said he and the Justice Department were "appalled" to learn of Jeffrey Epstein's death inside his jail cell over the weekend, saying the "failures" in the correctional facility in New York where he was being held would be investigated.The mystery surrounding how he was able to kill himself in jail comes as investigators have been digging into allegations of sexual abuse and conspiracy against Epstein. An additional federal investigation was launched Saturday after the Federal Bureau of Prison said Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell at a high-security jail in Manhattan. He was later pronounced dead from an apparent suicide, the BOP said.
