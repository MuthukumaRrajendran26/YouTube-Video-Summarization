Days after millions of young people took to the streets worldwide to demand emergency action on climate change, leaders gathered at the United Nations on Monday to try to inject fresh momentum into stalling efforts to curb carbon emissions.Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that Germany would double its contribution to a U.N. fund to support less developed countries to combat climate change to 4 billion euros from 2 billion euros.  New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the country is determined to be the most "sustainable food-produced in the world," while Indian Prime Minister Modi pledged to increase the country's renewable energy capacity. Over 60 world leaders and CEOs of energy and financial companies are expected to address the United Nations conference and announce climate finance measures and transitioning from coal power.
