After hearing an answer from French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday regarding returning former-ISIS fighters, U.S. President Donald Trump offered a backhanded compliment when he called Macron's statement "the greatest non-answer I've ever heard." U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday took aim at President Emmanuel Macron over the French leader’s criticism of NATO, and criticized the other members of the military alliance for being too slow to beef up their defence budgets.As prime ministers and presidents of the 29-member alliance converged on London for a summit marking NATO’s 70th birthday, Trump told reporters Macron’s comments were “very nasty” when he lamented the “brain death” of the organization due in large part to a lack of U.S. leadership.
