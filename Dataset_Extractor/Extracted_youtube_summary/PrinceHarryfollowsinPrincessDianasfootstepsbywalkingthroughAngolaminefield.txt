Britain's Prince Harry wore a protective vest and visor at a de-mining project in Angola on Friday and photos of his visit mirrored a famous series of images taken of his late mother Princess Diana more than 20 years ago.Harry's visit to the de-mining field outside Dirico, a town in Angola's Cuando Cubango province, is part of a southern African tour with his wife Meghan and their four-month-old son Archie.The landmines were planted during Angola's 27-year civil war, which ended in 2002. Many people remain displaced and thousands have been left with disabilities from landmines which continue to maim and kill.
