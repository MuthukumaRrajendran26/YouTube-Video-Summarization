Criminal psychologist Eric Hickey spoke to Global News about what he predicts some of the outcomes of the RCMP's manhunt for the teenage murder suspects, Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky, could be. He said that like money, food and water, the boys need social media to survive and will have to come out of hiding eventually to obtain resources and connect to social media.Currently, RCMP officers are going door to door in Gillam, Man., and on the Fox Lake First Nation over the next few days looking for leads after a Rav 4 formerly in the possession of the two murder suspects was found near the town.
