The U.S. House Rules Committee debated the impeachment of President Donald Trump on Tuesday ahead of setting terms for the full vote on the House floor scheduled for Wednesday. The committee rehashed familiar arguments about the president's phone call with Ukraine's president, and heard testimony from representatives from the Judiciary Committee. The Rules Committee is expected to lay out how much debate time the House will spend on the two articles of impeachment against Trump, and could also structure votes to allow lawmakers to vote on each article separately.
