British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday that he would schedule a Queen's Speech for mid-October in order to launch new legislation, in a move that will see parliament suspended for a month and limit lawmakers' time to block a no-deal Brexit.The decision would effectively shut parliament for a month from mid-September, giving lawmakers less time to combat Johnson's plans to leave the EU on October 31 without a divorce deal if necessary, which has triggered outrage across the political spectrum.
