Oklahoma's attorney general and state attorneys reacted Monday to the verdict by a judge that found Johnson & Johnson liable in the state's opioid epidemic, stating that it deceptively marketed painkillers. The company was ordered to pay damages of US$572 million.One state attorney, Reggie Whitten, became visibly emotional in talking about the ruling, saying his son, who was a victim of the epidemic, was probably "celebrating" over the verdict.
