Conservative leader Andrew Scheer will attend a campaign stop in Woodbridge, Ont. on Sept. 11, which is expected to a highly contested riding within the Greater Toronto Area.The riding voted Progressive Conservative in the last provincial election. The federal Liberals warn Scheer will proceed with cuts to spending similar to those made by PC Premier Doug Ford in Ontario.Ford is among the wild cards in this election campaign; with Ontario a key battleground, federal Conservatives are running up against voters in that province frustrated with Ford and ready to take those feelings out at the federal level.
