Queen Elizabeth called for an emergency crisis meeting to figure out next steps after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle dropped a royal bombshell last week saying they would be stepping away from senior royal duties. For the first time, Prince Harry is sitting face-to-face with his grandmother to talk about how this will all work, including sorting out what obligations they will have, security details, and if the couple will keep their royal titles.The Queen held the meeting with Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry, with Meghan Markle reportedly being phoned in from Canada.
