Prime Minister Justin Trudeau broke the federal Conflict of Interest Act by trying to exert influence over former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould in what came to be known as the SNC-Lavalin scandal, according to a new report.Ethics commissioner Mario Dion released the hotly anticipated findings of his report into allegations that Trudeau improperly pressured Wilson-Raybould to override the decision of the director of public prosecutions not to offer the Quebec engineering giant a deal to avoid criminal prosecution on charges of corruption and bribery.Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer had previously called for Trudeau to resign when the allegations first emerged.He gave a press conference on Wednesday saying he thinks the findings in Dion’s report merit RCMP investigation as to whether Trudeau tried to obstruct justice by interfering in the criminal process playing out with SNC-Lavalin, and said Canadians should vote him out of office.NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh also reacted to the ethics commissioner's report, telling reporters he hopes Canadians will punish Trudeau in the voting booth.
