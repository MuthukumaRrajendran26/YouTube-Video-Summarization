Liberal Party Leader Justin Trudeau said on Sept. 26 in Sudbury, Ont., that if he were to be re-elected as Canada's Prime Minister, he would expand the Learn to Camp program for children to learn "important outdoor skills." He said the Liberals would also create a national Experience Canada program, which would allow for 75,000 children who qualify could take a trip to a national or provincial park for up to four days.
