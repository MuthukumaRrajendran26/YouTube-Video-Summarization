The Trump administration announced new rules Wednesday morning that would allow the government to detain families with children crossing the U.S. border together during the immigration proceedings, ending the Flores agreement.The move is the latest effort by the administration to restrict immigration, President Donald Trump’s signature issue, and is aimed at restricting the movement of asylum seekers in the country and deterring more migrants from crossing the border.Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan held a news conference on the changes to Flores ruling for U.S. Customs and Border Protection to expand on what that will mean.
