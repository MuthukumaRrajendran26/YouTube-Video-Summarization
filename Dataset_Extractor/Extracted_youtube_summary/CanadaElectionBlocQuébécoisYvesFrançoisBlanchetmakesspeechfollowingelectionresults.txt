Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-François Blanchet celebrated a strong election night by his party, as he promised to work with any minority government as long as its proposals are good for Quebec.During his speech to supporters, Blanchet said he was willing to work with any government, unless its intent was to move more oil through the province of Quebec or pressure it to back down on its values or language.
