British Airways pilots began a two-day strike on Sept. 9, grounding nearly all of its flights and disrupting thousands of passengers in a dispute over pay.The airline, part of the International Airlines Group (IAG), cancelled 1,700 flights to and from London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports on Sept. 9 and 10 ahead of action by British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) members in BA's first ever pilot strike.The airline said it had no detail from BALPA on which pilots would strike, and had no way of predicting how many would come to work or which aircraft they are qualified to fly, so had no option but to cancel nearly 100% of its flights.BA has offered its pilots an 11.5% pay rise over three years, which it said would take the pay of its highest earning captains from US$205,000, plus $20,000 in allowances, to nearly $247,000.Its pilots on average earn around $111,000 a year.BALPA wants the pay deal to include profit sharing.The airline dismissed a new offer by BALPA last week as an "eleventh hour inflated proposal" that was not made in good faith. BALPA had said it would have called off the strikes this week if BA had engaged with the offer.
