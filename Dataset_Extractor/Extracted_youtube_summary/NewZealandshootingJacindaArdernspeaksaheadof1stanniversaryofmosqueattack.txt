Speaking ahead of the first anniversary of the Christchurch mosque shootings on Thursday, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said 60,907 firearms had been “removed from circulation.”On March 15, 2019, a gunman, armed with semi-automatic weapons, attacked Muslim worshippers attending Friday prayers in the South Island's largest city, broadcasting New Zealand's worst mass shooting live on Facebook. Ardern swiftly introduced new gun laws and started a global movement to stamp out online hate in a response that was hailed as a model for other leaders.
