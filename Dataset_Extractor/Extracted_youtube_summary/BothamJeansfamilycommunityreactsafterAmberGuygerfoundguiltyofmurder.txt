The family of Botham Jean and community members reacted on Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2019 after former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was found guilty of murder. During testimony following the verdict, and outside of the courtroom, family members spoke about the difficulties they've faced since Jean was killed. Guyger shot Jean in September 2018 when she found him in an apartment she said she mistook for her own.
