Family members of Botham Jean and community members reacted on Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2019 to former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger being sentenced to 10 years in prison for the death of Botham Jean. During Jean's brother Brandt's victim impact statement, he asked to hug Guyger and said he hopes the best for her. Some community members, however, took to the hallway after the sentence, chanting "no justice, no peace," saying they were angered over the sentence and that Guyger should have received a much longer prison term.Jean's mother, Allison, also spoke saying she felt that the sentence would be a "time of reflection" for Guyger, but said more needs to be done in the Dallas police department to prevent a similar incident from ever happening again.
