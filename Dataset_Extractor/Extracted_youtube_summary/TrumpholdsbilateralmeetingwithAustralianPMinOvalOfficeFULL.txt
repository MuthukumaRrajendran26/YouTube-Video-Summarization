U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday welcomed Australia's prime minister Scott Morrison to the White House in only the second state visit of his administration.They spoke in the Oval Office ahead of a meeting where they are expected to discuss security and trade, as China's increasing assertiveness, especially in the energy-rich South China Sea, has raised concerns within the region and the United States.The leaders are also set to release a plan on Friday aimed at securing the supply of rare earth minerals, as concerns grow that China, the world's largest processor and producer of the minerals, could cut off shipments of the prized commodities.
