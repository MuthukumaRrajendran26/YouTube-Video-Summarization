Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a bilateral meeting on Saturday in Biarritz, France ahead of the G7 summit, where Johnson noted that Canada and the U.K. are "side by side" on issues like biodiversity, the Amazon rainforest wildfires, girls' education, and the global free trade system, which are all topics up for discussion during the G7 leaders' weekend work retreat.
