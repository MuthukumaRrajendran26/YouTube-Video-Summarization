Puerto Ricans rallied in San Juan's old city for the eighth day in a row on July 20, calling for governor Ricardo Rossello to quit over misogynistic and homophobic messages. Protesters banged pots and pans, chanting, "Ricky resign!".The chats, from a Telegram message group and referring mainly to politicians and officials, were published earlier this month, on July 6.
