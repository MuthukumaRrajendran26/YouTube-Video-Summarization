A herd of Kashmiri goats were spotted munching through vegetation and nibbling away at flowers in the town of Llandudno, the largest seaside resort in Wales, where the streets have been largely deserted due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.The herd of goats normally live on the heights of the Great Orme, but locals think they wandered into the town because the streets have been so quiet during the COVID-19 lockdown.
