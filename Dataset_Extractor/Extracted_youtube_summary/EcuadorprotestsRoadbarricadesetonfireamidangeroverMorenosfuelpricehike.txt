Striking transport workers and Indigenous protesters set fire to a road blockade on the outskirts of Quito, Ecuador on Monday, causing traffic disruptions amid public anger over President Lenin Moreno's austerity measures that cut fuel subsidies.The fiery barricade in Mariachi stopped traffic to those entering Quito, with protesters vowing to stay put until the price of petrol goes down. Many in this town rely heavily on fuel to get them in and out and of the capital for work. Ecuadoreans have been complaining that consumer prices have risen sharply as a knock-on effect of Moreno's abolition of fuel subsidies, which has also triggered the nation's worst unrest in more than a decade.
