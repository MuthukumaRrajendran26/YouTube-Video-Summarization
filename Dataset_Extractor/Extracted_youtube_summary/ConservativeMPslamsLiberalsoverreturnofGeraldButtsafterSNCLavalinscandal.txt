Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre slammed the Liberals on Monday, July 22, 2019 after it was reported former principal secretary Gerald Butts would have a key role in the 2019 Canadian federal election campaign.Butts resigned earlier this year as the controversial SNC-Lavalin scandal continued to impact the Liberals in the polls.Poilievre said Monday that Butts' return showed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had learned nothing from the scandal and claimed that similar controversies would happen again if the Liberals were re-elected in October.
