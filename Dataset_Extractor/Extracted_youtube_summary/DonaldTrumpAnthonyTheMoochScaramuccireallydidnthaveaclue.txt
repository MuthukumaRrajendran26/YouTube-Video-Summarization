Speaking with reporters outside Marine One Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump blasted Anthony Scaramucci AKA "The Mooch" as someone who "didn't have a clue" during his brief time working for Trump.Scaramucci, a Wall Street hedge fund manager who was also called “the Mooch,” was on Trump’s team for just over a week. He replaced the acting communications director Sean Spicer who resigned on July 21 after Scaramucci was appointed.In his brief time as communications director, Scaramucci made a big splash in the media when he called a reporter at the New Yorker to complain about leaks in the White House in a profanity-laced rant, and also lambasted Trump’s then-chief of staff Reince Preibus. Preibus resigned that same week and was replaced by General John Kelly.
