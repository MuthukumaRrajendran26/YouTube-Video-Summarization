Toronto's medical officer of health Dr. Eileen de Villa confirmed on Wednesday that a woman in her 60s presented herself at hospital on Monday and was later confirmed to be a presumptive case of the COVID-19 virus. She said that the woman was now at home in self-isolation, adding that two members of the patient's family are in self-isolation. de Villa said due to the mobile nature of the population, it was "quite likely" more people will present symptoms.
