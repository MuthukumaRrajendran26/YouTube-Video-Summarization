The Royal Canadian Mounted Police held a press conference on July 22 regarding two separate investigations in northern British Columbia. The RCMP said there's a possibility the two cases could be linked, but nothing is certain at this point. One of the cases discussed involves the killing of a young tourist couple along the Alaska Highway (Lucas Fowler and Chynna Deese), and the other involves two missing teens, Kam LcLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky from Port Alberni, B.C.
