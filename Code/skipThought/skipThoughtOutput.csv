0,"Time Warner said on Friday that it now owns 8% of search-engine Google. But its own internet business, AOL, had has mixed fortunes. However, the company said AOL's underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn. It lost 464,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters. But its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results. For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%, and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins. ""Our financial performance was strong, meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility,"" chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said. It intends to adjust the way it accounts for a deal with German music publisher Bertelsmann's purchase of a stake in AOL Europe, which it had reported as advertising revenue. It will now book the sale of its stake in AOL Europe as a loss on the value of that stake."

""I think the chairman's taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he's taken for some time,"" said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York. Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. ""He's taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next."" China's currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency's sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive. But calls for a shift in Beijing's policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the ""time is ripe"" for a loosening of the peg. The half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar."
2,"Yukos unit buyer faces loan claim
The owners of embattled Russian oil giant Yukos are to ask the buyer of its former production unit to pay back a $900m (£479m) loan. Yukos' owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets. ""The pledged assets are with Rosneft, so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of Yugansk assets,"" said Moscow-based US lawyer Jamie Firestone, who is not connected to the case. Menatep Group's managing director Tim Osborne told the Reuters news agency: ""If they default, we will fight them where the rule of law exists under the international arbitration clauses of the credit."" Rosneft officials were unavailable for comment. State-owned Rosneft bought the Yugansk unit for $9.3bn in a sale forced by Russia to part settle a $27.5bn tax claim against Yukos."

British Airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits. BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue. However, it said sales would be better than previously forecast. Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA's latest quarterly results as ""pretty modest"". ""Our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products,"" Mr Eddington said. ""For example, we have taken delivery of six Airbus A321 aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our Club World flat beds."" BA's shares closed up four pence at 274.5 pence."

Shares in UK drinks and food firm Allied Domecq have risen on speculation that it could be the target of a takeover by France's Pernod Ricard. The other two-thirds of Seagram was bought by market leader Diageo. In terms of market value, Pernod - at 7.5bn euros ($9.7bn) - is about 9% smaller than Allied Domecq, which has a capitalisation of £5.7bn ($10.7bn; 8.2bn euros). The WSJ said that the two were ripe for consolidation, having each dealt with problematic parts of their portfolio. Pernod is home to brands including Chivas Regal Scotch whisky, Havana Club rum and Jacob's Creek wine."
5,"Revised figures indicated growth of just 0.1% - and a similar-sized contraction in the previous quarter. Improvements in the job market apparently have yet to feed through to domestic demand, with private consumption up just 0.2% in the third quarter. But in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead, observers were less sanguine. ""I maintain the view that Japan's economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb, and we will monitor developments carefully,"" said economy minister Heizo Takenaka."
6,"Jobs growth still slow in the US
The US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years. The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000. He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November's Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover. As a result, job creation became a key issue in last year's election. However, when adding December and January's figures, the administration's first term jobs record ended in positive territory. ""It suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace,"" said Rick Egelton, deputy chief economist at BMO Financial Group. ""That means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers."""
7,"He said the issue is not globalisation but ""the terms of engagement in globalisation."" India calls for fair trade rules
India, which attends the G7 meeting of seven leading industrialised nations on Friday, is unlikely to be cowed by its newcomer status. India, along with China, Brazil, South Africa and Russia, has been invited to take part in the G7 meeting taking place in London on Friday and Saturday. Palaniappan Chidambaram, India's finance minister, argued that these organisations need to take into account the changing world order, given India and China's integration into the global economy. ""A flexible exchange rate is one more channel for absorbing both positive and negative shocks,"" he told the conference. ""Some countries have tried to use fixed exchange rates. I do not wish to make any judgements,"" Mr Chidambaram said."
8,"Nevertheless, 2.2 million Ethiopians will still need emergency assistance. The report calculated emergency food requirements for 2005 to be 387,500 tonnes. Good rains, increased use of fertilizers and improved seeds contributed to the rise in production. ""Local purchase of cereals for food assistance programmes is recommended as far as possible, so as to assist domestic markets and farmers,"" said Henri Josserand, chief of FAO's Global Information and Early Warning System. On top of that, 89,000 tonnes of fortified blended food and vegetable oil for ""targeted supplementary food distributions for a survival programme for children under five and pregnant and lactating women"" will be needed. Agriculture is the main economic activity in Ethiopia, representing 45% of gross domestic product."

A US government claim accusing the country's biggest tobacco companies of covering up the effects of smoking has been thrown out by an appeal court. Among the accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson. Prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to surrender $280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products. They also say they have already met many of the government's demands in a landmark $206bn settlement reached with 46 states in 1998."

11,"Indonesia pays subsidies to importers in order to stabilise domestic fuel prices, but higher oil prices have forced the government to spend more on holding prices down. It spent 59.2 trillion rupiah ($6.58bn; £3.5bn) on fuel subsidies in 2004, a sum far in excess of its original projection of 14.5 trillion rupiah. ""The (January to March) quarter of this year is the best time for us to increase fuel prices,"" said Sri Mulyani Indrawati, State Minister for National Development Planning. ""We are still considering if a 30% hike is suitable at the moment. Indonesia's previous government, led by President Megawati Sukarnoputri, also attempted to cut subsidies in 2003, but was forced to back down in the face of public protests. The sooner the better for the state budget."" ""The big question is whether they go for one big, short, sharp shock and raise prices between 20% and 30% or whether they try to stagger it,"" she said."
12,"Peugeot deal boosts Mitsubishi
Struggling Japanese car maker Mitsubishi Motors has struck a deal to supply French car maker Peugeot with 30,000 sports utility vehicles (SUV). Falling sales have left Mitsubishi Motors with underused capacity, and the production deal with Peugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it. Mitsubishi Motors has forecast a net loss of 472bn yen in its current financial year to March 2005. Last month, it signed a production agreement with Japanese rival Nissan Motor to supply it with 36,000 small cars for sale in Japan. US-German carmaker DaimlerChrylser, a 30% shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors, decided in April 2004 not to pump in any more money. The deal with Peugeot was celebrated by Mitsubishi's newly-appointed chief executive Takashi Nishioka, who took over after three top bosses stood down last month to shoulder responsibility for the firm's troubles. It has been making cars for Nissan since 2003."
13,"Journalists at the firm met on Friday afternoon to discuss how to react to the surprise announcement. The National Union of Journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out a strike. ""They have shown a complete disregard for the consultative rights of our members,"" said Mr Fitzpatrick, who added that the company now planned to observe the consultation procedures. NUJ official Barry Fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies. In recent months News Corp's News International unit, which publishes The Sun and the News of the World, the Guardian Media Group, Trinity Mirror and the Daily Mail & General Trust have all announced substantial investments in new printing plants. The two Telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists. The Guardian is hedging its bets, planning a larger tabloid format like those popular in continental Europe. Many newspapers are investing in new printing machinery that enables them to print more colour pages, or in some cases, have colour on every page. ""Journalists are the lifeblood of any newspaper, and maintaining the quality of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph for our readers is vital,"" he said. ""However, action to improve our production capability and secure our titles against the competition is also vital."""
14,"The EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights. When this happens against a passenger's will, airlines will now have to offer compensation. Airlines fear that ""extraordinary circumstances"" may not include bad weather, security alerts or strikes - events which are outside of their control. The European Commission is facing two legal challenges - one from the European Low-fare Airlines Association (ELAA) and the other from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which has attacked the package as a ""bad piece of legislation"". Air passengers win new EU rights
Air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation. ""It's a preposterous piece of legislation, we among all airlines are fighting this,"" Ryanair deputy chief executive Michael Cawley told Radio 4's Today programme. New technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added. On Wednesday, Jacques Barrot, vice president of the European Commission and also Commissioner for Transport, said that the changes were necessary. ""We reckon it's going to cost European air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that's over £1bn a year loaded onto European passengers,"" Mr Clarke said. ""That's basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted."""
15,"The curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices. There were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. Growth in China remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year. A low exchange rate - China's yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - means Chinese exports are cheap on world markets. To some extent, the credit controls do seem to be taking effect."

Parmalat, the Italian food group at the centre of one of Europe's most painful corporate scandals, has reported a doubling in profit. On Tuesday, the company's administrator, turnaround expert Enrico Bondi, sued Morgan Stanley, its former banker, to return 136m euros relating to a 2003 bond deal. But a crucial factor for the company's future is the legal unwinding of its intensely complex financial position."
17,"India's foreign currency rating is now one notch below investment grade, which starts at 'BBB-'. The increase has put it on the same level as Romania, Egypt and El Salvador, and one level below Russia. ""The upgrade is positive and basically people will use it as an excuse to come back to India,"" said Bhanu Baweja, a strategist at UBS. ""Money has moved out from India in the first two or three weeks of January into other markets like Korea and Thailand and this upgrade should lead to a reversal."""
18,"Communications Minister Dayanidhi Maran said that there is a need to fund the fast-growing mobile market. India widens access to telecoms
India has raised the limit for foreign direct investment in telecoms companies from 49% to 74%. Potential foreign investors will however need government approval before they increase their stake beyond 49%, Mr Maran said. ""It is a positive development for carriers and the investment community, looking to take a longer-term view of the huge growth in the Indian telecoms market,"" said Gartner's principal analyst Kobita Desai. Analysts and investors have welcomed the government decision. The decision to raise the limit for foreign investors faced considerable opposition from the communist parties, which give crucial support to the coalition headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh."
19,"Call centre users 'lose patience'
Customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests. This, Ms Diemont warns, is ""scary"" and not good for the bottom line either. When the query is passed on to a second or third person - a specialist or manager - rates rise to about 70%, but that is still well below the industry target of an 85% resolution rate. When automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation, where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages, the number of abandoned calls is even higher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. ""Once a call centre may have looked after mortgages, now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards, insurance and current accounts,"" Ms Diemont says. Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers. However, companies that decide to ""offshore"" their operations are driven not just by cost considerations. The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of Dimension Data, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents. What are your experiences with call centres? Are you happy to listen to Vivaldi or Greensleeves, or do you want an immediate response?"
20,"Advisors Goldman Sachs are understood to have valued its demerged Deluxe Film unit at £300m, the report added. Rank now aims to concentrate on its gaming, bars and hotels business, including extending its Hard Rock brand to its casinos - trials of which have been a success. A spokesman for the firm refused to comment on the reports, but said any results from the demerger study were likely to be set out when it unveiled its results on Friday. The move left the group with three core divisions: gaming, Hard Rock and Deluxe Films, which provides technical services to Hollywood studios. However, that business is seen as less successful. It also owns Deluxe Media, which makes and distributes DVDs and videos. Last year it made profits of £21.5m on a turnover of £392.1m and experts suggest its success in moving to DVDs from VHS video could make it an attractive target for a private equity buyer."
21,"But officials said stagnant growth was still stifling the job market. The brunt of the unemployment is still being felt in the eastern part of Germany, where the rate is 18.8%. High oil prices and the soaring euro - which damages the competitiveness of exporters - were also having a negative effect, he said. Sluggish economy hits German jobs
The number of people out of work in Europe's largest economy has risen for the tenth straight month as growth remains stubbornly slow. ""The deterioration of the labour market does not come as a surprise,"" said Isabelle Kronawitter at Hypovereinsbank. ""But growth of 0.1%... in the third quarter is still insufficient to deliver positive momentum to the labour market."" The scheme's formal launch is January, but hirings for these positions are already taking place and affecting the unemployment statistics, economists said."
22,"If confirmed, that would be the best quarterly showing since early 2002. It leaves GDP up 2.3% for the full year, but short of the 2.5% which the French government had predicted. ""The numbers are good,"" said David Naude, economist at Deutsche Bank. Also on Friday, France's industrial output for December was released, showing 0.7% growth. ""They send a positive signal of a rebound in output... and open the way for a continuation in that trend into the New Year."""
23,"US trade gap hits record in 2004
The gap between US exports and imports hit an all-time high of $671.7bn (£484bn) in 2004, latest figures show. Democrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices. For all of 2004, US exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion, but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion. Meanwhile, the Bush administration argues that the US deficit reflects the fact the America is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world, spurring on more demand for imported goods. Some economists say this may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter. Imports were not affected by the dollar's weakness last year. ""We expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend,"" said economist Marie-Pierre Ripert at IXIS."

""Such activities require the continued participation of the Russian government."" Texas Judge Letitia Clark said Yukos did not have enough of a US presence to establish US jurisdiction. In her ruling, the judge acknowledged that ""it appears likely that agencies of the Russian government have acted in a manner that would be considered confiscatory under United States law"". ""The vast majority of the business and financial activities of Yukos continue to occur in Russia,"" Judge Clark said in her ruling. But she said her role was simply to decide on jurisdiction. Russia had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the US courts. ""Our assets were illegally seized. We want them back or damages paid."""
25,"The affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years, GM said. Safety alert as GM recalls cars
The world's biggest carmaker General Motors (GM) is recalling nearly 200,000 vehicles in the US on safety grounds, according to federal regulators. This is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures, requiring more braking. GM is also recalling 19,924 Cadillac XLR coupes, SRX SUVs and Pontiac Grand Prix sedans from the 2004 model year. This could allow hydraulic fluid to leak, which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash, it warned. However, GM stressed that it did not know of any injuries related to the problems. In January, GM said higher healthcare costs in North America, and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005."

Mittal Steel, one of the world's largest steel producers, could cut up to 45,000 jobs over the next five years, its chief executive has said. The Indian-born magnate did not say where the job losses would fall. Mr Mittal told US investors that once the acquisition of International Steel Group was completed, the company would aim to reduce its workforce by between 7,000 and 8,000 annually. Mittal Steel was formed last year when Mr Mittal's LNM Holdings merged with Dutch firm Ispat. ""We are trying to create a sustainable steel industry and if we want to do that, we have to invest in new technology,"" a spokesman said. This could see its workforce trimmed from 155,000 to 110,000 staff by 2010. Mittal Steel has operations in 14 countries."

Crude oil prices surged back above the $47 a barrel mark on Thursday after an energy market watchdog raised its forecasts for global demand. The US Department of Energy reported that crude stockpiles had fallen 1m barrels to 294.3m. The Paris-based IEA watchdog, which advises industrialized nations on energy policy, said the upward revision was due to stronger demand from China and other Asian countries. ""I think that prices are now beginning to set a new range and it looks like the $40 to $50 level,"" said energy analyst Orin Middleton of Barclays Capital."

Critics say the powers - which President Chavez argues are needed to help the country's poorest citizens and develop the Venezuelan economy - trample all over private property rights. UK firm faces Venezuelan land row
Venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a British company as part of President Chavez's agrarian reform programme. ""The legal boundaries did not match up with the actual boundaries and there is surplus,"" state prosecutor Alexis Ortiz told Reuters. ""As a consequence the government has taken action.""

Many foreign firms had protested that the SEC was imposing an unfair burden. Over the past few months, delegations of European and other business leaders have been heading to the SEC's Washington DC headquarters to protest. They say the burden is too expensive and the timescale too short and some, particularly the UK's CBI, warned that companies would choose to let their US listings drop rather than get in line with section 404. ""They have been listening to us and to many overseas companies, who have reminded America what globalisation really means: that they can't make these rules in isolation."" ""I think this signifies a change of heart at the SEC,"" CBI director-general Sir Digby Jones told the BBC's Today programme.

One of Japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood.

""I fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby-boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver. If existing promises need to be changed, those changes should be made sooner rather than later,"" Mr Greenspan said. Pension and healthcare costs posed the greatest risks to the economy, he said. He also urged Congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the US heading further into the red. Speaking to the House Budget Committee he urged Congress to take action to cut the deficit, such as increasing taxes. Despite the dire warnings, Mr Greenspan did offer some good news for the short term."
41,"The UK's biggest coal producer blamed geological problems, industrial action and ""operating flaws"" at its deep mines for its worsening fortunes. It expected 2005 to be a ""transitional year"" and to return to profitability in 2006. In early trade on Thursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. ""We have a long journey ahead to fix these issues. We continue to make progress and great strides have already been made,"" said Mr Spindler. UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham."
42,"The move comes as the conservative country inches open the door to working women. ""Our educational reforms have created a new generation of highly-educated and professionally trained Saudi women who are acquiring their rightful position in Saudi society,"" Arab News quoted Prince Saud as saying. Earlier this week, the local Arab News said Labour Minister Ghazi al-Gosaibi had ""caused uproar"" when he said his ministry was having difficulty hiring women because they demanded segregated offices. ""I am proud to mention here that this year we shall have women working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the first time."""
43,"The Tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced, but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year. Figures released by the government's Cabinet Office showed that GDP, on an annualised basis, fell 0.5% in the last three months of 2004. A previous estimate of 0.1% growth between July and September was downgraded to a 0.3% decline. However, the economy's fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending, a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies. Gross domestic product measures the overall value of goods and services produced in a country. Japan's economy has seen stretches of moderate growth over the past decade but has periodically slipped back into recession. ""The economy must be assessed comprehensively and we cannot look at GDP alone,"" Mr Takenaka stressed. Analysts said the figures were disappointing but argued that Japan's largest companies had been recording healthy profits and capital spending was on the rise. ""The results came in at the lower end of expectations but we shouldn't be too pessimistic about the current state and the outlook for the economy,"" said Naoki Iizuka, senior economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute."
44,"The gains tracked a surge in US gasoline futures to a record high of $1.4850 a gallon. A spokesman for the group was unable to say when the production unit would be back up and running. ""This market simply wants to go up,"" Citigroup Global Markets analyst Kyle Cooper told Reuters news agency. The jump followed a fire at Western Refining Company's refinery in Texas, which shut down petrol production. Ed Silliere, analyst at Energy Merchant, added: ""Gasoline is up because of the refinery issues in Texas, which means there will be a scramble for product in the (US) Gulf Coast."" Oil prices are roughly 45% higher than a year ago and have risen sharply in recent weeks due to a combination of colder weather, the declining value of the dollar and fears that Opec could rein in production to head off a seasonal drop in demand."
45,"The economy has grown for six quarters but growth slowed dramatically in the last quarter amid weaker global demand. According to figures from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the decline was led by a fall in demand for electronic parts for mobile phones and digital televisions. Production dropped 1.6% in October, reflecting a decline in exports, while unemployment levels edged up 0.1% to 4.7%, slightly higher than forecast. Japan downgraded its overall economic assessment earlier this month for the first time in a year. ""It's a sign that the economy's adjustment phase is stronger than expected,"" said Takashi Yamanaka, an economist with UFJ Bank. Japanese government officials played down the latest data, arguing that domestic consumer demand was still resilient. Despite the rise in unemployment, jobless figures are still some way below historical highs of recent years."
46,"The carrier reported a drop in quarterly profit earlier this year after it was hit by higher fuel costs. However, when it reported the results, the airline was upbeat about prospects for 2005, despite tough competition in the budget airline market. Ryanair in $4bn Boeing plane deal
Budget airline Ryanair has placed an order for 70 Boeing 737-800 planes, in a deal valued at $4bn (£2.1bn) which should lead to 2,500 new Ryanair jobs. ""With this new order and new pricing in place, Ryanair expects that unit operating costs (excluding fuel) will continue to fall each year for the next five years,"" he added. About 2,500 new jobs should be created in the next seven years, it added."
47,"The firm gained protection from creditors in 2003 after revealing debts of 14bn euros ($18.34bn; £9.6bn). This was eight times higher than it had previously stated. Parmalat to return to stockmarket
Parmalat, the Italian dairy company which went bust after an accounting scandal, hopes to be back on the Italian stock exchange in July. The company's creditors will be asked to vote on the plan later this year. Creditors of Parmalat, the main operating company, are likely to see the percentage of debt they receive fall from 7.3% to 6.9%. Lawmakers said on Wednesday night Enrico Bondi, the turnaround specialist appointed by the Italian government as Parmalat's chief executive, spoke positively about the company during a closed-door hearing of the Chamber of Deputies industry commission."
48,"""The risk is that after they've invested massively in the brand, demand tapers off like it did with the new VW Beetle,"" said Brad Wernle, from Automotive News Europe. Not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue. The rise, from 189,000 last year, is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. Since its launch during summer 2001, the new Mini has gone from strength to strength. The price of the car has also gone up. Indeed, Mini is not only producing more cars than MG Rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of Land Rovers and Range Rovers (which are made by the former Rover unit that BMW sold to Ford) are taken into account. Last year, in the same factory, almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4,500 Mini-workers. When it was launched, the cheapest Mini cost just more than £10,000. Second-hand Minis are not cheap either. The Mini factory's current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 Rover cars."
49,"A poor summer across the continent - in contrast to the prolonged heat wave in 2003 - ""severely affected"" demand for ice cream. Revenue dipped 1.4% to 86.7bn Swiss francs ($74.6bn; £39.1bn) in 2004 as sales of ice cream and mineral water were dampened by the wet summer. Nestle said that the strength of the Swiss franc against the US dollar, the disposal of businesses and challenging trading conditions in Europe all dented sales. Bad weather hits Nestle sales
A combination of bad weather, rising raw material costs and the sluggish European economy has hit sales at Swiss food and drink giant Nestle. Sales of bottled water also fell, although chocolate, coffee, frozen goods and petcare products performed better. Nestle is to raise its dividend by 11% after paying back some of its debt. ""The option of selling is Perrier is still on the table,"" chief executive Peter Brabeck-Letmathe confirmed on Thursday."
50,"Steps being considered include listing Ferrari and bringing Maserati and Alfa Romeo closer together, it said. Despite strong sales of Alfa Romeo, Fiat's car business is making a loss. Fiat owns a 56% stake in Ferrari -best known for its dominant Formula One motor racing team - having first bought into the business in 1969. The Financial Times said Fiat may transfer Maserati within its wholly- owned Alfa Romeo division in an effort to exploit commercial synergies. The price tag would change if Maserati was stripped out. It said Fiat was set to restructure its business after reaching a $2bn (1.53bn euros; £1.05bn) settlement with GM about Fiat's ownership. Maserati and Ferrari sell about 10,000 cars between them and both companies broke even in 2003. Fiat, Italy's largest private sector employer, did not comment on the reported changes."
51,"He will present an ""Action Plan for the Development of Italy"" in a meeting with industrialists and trade union leaders. Also in focus will be bankruptcy laws and the slow pace of the legal system. The prime minister is scheduled to start the meeting at 1830 GMT. Italy to get economic action plan
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will unveil plans aimed at kickstarting the country's sputtering economy on Thursday night in Rome. Mr Berlusconi is expected to table reforms aimed at boosting research and development (R&D) spending, and the competitiveness of small firms. According to Il Sole 24 Ore, Italy's business newspaper, the government will focus on ""opening up markets, infrastructure, research, making more incentives available, bankruptcy law, the slow pace of the justice system"". At the same time, bankruptcy laws make it difficult for failed company directors to set up new businesses and emerge from their debts, a situation that is hampering Italy's entrepreneurial spirit. The country has been one of the eurozone's worst economic performers in recent years. Growth was 1.1% in 2004, up from just 0.3% in 2003 and 0.4% in 2002 - an improvement but still a long way from ideal. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of Italy's economy."
52,"Reuters also managed to slow a decline in underlying revenues to 5.4% from 10.2% in 2003 and cut its debt back to £160m from £610m a year earlier. Under its three-year Fast Forward turnaround plan it had aimed to save £220m during the 12 months to 31 December. The news and financial data seller said the year had begun well, adding it expected ""further gradual improvement"" in the second quarter of the year after good January sales. ""Improving customer relationships, more competitive products and continued strong cost discipline position us well for 2005,"" chief executive Tom Glocer said, adding the company was beginning ""to look beyond recovery to growth""."
53,"The company didn't give details of its investment but it said the new plant would produce 150,000 cars a year. Hyundai to build new India plant
South Korea's Hyundai Motor has announced that it plans to build a second plant in India to meet the country's growing demand for cars. By 2010, it expects to nearly double sales to 400,000 cars. This will boost the annual production capacity of the company - India's second-largest car manufacturer - to 400,000 units. Figures show that currently only eight people per thousand are car owners. ""We desperately need to expand our production in order to meet growing demand in the Indian auto market, which is growing over 12 percent every year, and to top our competitors,"" chairman Chung Mong-koo said in the statement."
54,"Aiming to both stir economic growth and aid the country's poor, finance minister Trevor Manuel said the focus of the 2005 budget was ""more for all"". Spending on health and education will rise by 9.4% and 8.1% respectively. All the spending increases will run over the next three years. Given that both corporate and personal taxes are being cut - under the new measures, those earning less than 35,000 rand a year will be exempt from income tax - the extra 22.3bn rand in social spending will be partly met by higher fuel, tobacco and alcohol taxes. Unveiling the 418bn-rand budget to parliament, Mr Manuel said the South African economy had grown by an average of 3.2% over the past four years, slightly below the African average of 4%. ""In this budget, the focus is on more for all, not more for some, and not a hell of a lot more for a few, but spread across all of South Africa,"" said Mr Manuel. ""It's pleasant to see the cut in company taxes, it's a good incentive for business,"" he said."
55,"It is launching a revamped version of its 3-Series saloon class next month. BMW drives record sales in Asia
BMW has forecast sales growth of at least 10% in Asia this year after registering record sales there in 2004. There was also a significant increase in sales of Rolls-Royces on the continent. The company, which is vying with Mercedes-Benz for the title of leading premium carmaker, is confident about its prospects for the region in 2005. The luxury carmaker saw strong sales of its three marques - BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce - in Asia last year after the launch of three new models. ""Here in Asia, we consider a double-digit increase in retail on the order of 10 to 15% to be realistic on the basis of current features,"" said Helmut Panke, BMW's group chief executive. The company only began assembling luxury high-powered sedans in China in 2003."
56,"Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). ""Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available,"" Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club. Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target. The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. Private sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates, Ms Lomax said. ""The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past,"" she said. ""The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate,"" Ms Lomax said. ""The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years."""
57,"Electrolux to export Europe jobs
Electrolux saw its shares rise 14% on Tuesday after it said it would be shifting more of its manufacturing to low-cost countries. The company has two manufacturing sites in County Durham. Electrolux's subsidiary brands include AEG, Zanussi and Frigidaire. ""It looks pretty grim,"" said Swedish trades union official Ulf Carlsson. ""What are we going to end up producing in Sweden?"""
58,"Worldcom ex-boss launches defence
Lawyers defending former WorldCom chief Bernie Ebbers against a battery of fraud charges have called a company whistleblower as their first witness. Her warnings led to the collapse of the firm following the discovery of an $11bn (£5.7bn) accounting fraud. She said Andersen had given a ""green light"" to the procedures and practices used by WorldCom. Mr Ebbers has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy. Cynthia Cooper, WorldCom's ex-head of internal accounting, alerted directors to irregular accounting practices at the US telecoms giant in 2002. However, Ms Cooper said Mr Sullivan had not mentioned ""anything uncomfortable"" about WorldCom's accounting during a 2001 audit committee meeting. The prosecution's star witness, former WorldCom financial chief Scott Sullivan, has said that Mr Ebbers ordered accounting adjustments at the firm, telling him to ""hit our books""."
59,"He admitted one felony count of scheming to defraud and faces up to four years in prison. The highest ranking executive pleading guilty on Tuesday was former Marsh senior vice president Joshua Bewlay. Last month Marsh agreed to pay $850m (£415m) to settle a lawsuit filed by Mr Spitzer, but under the settlement it ""neither admits nor denies the allegations"". Mr Spitzer's investigation of the US insurance industry looked at whether companies rigged bids and fixed prices."
60,"Average earnings rose by 4.3% in the year to December up from November's 4.2%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) added. Meanwhile, the benefit claimant total fell 11,000 to 813,200 last month. Throughout 2004, the number of people in work increased by 296,000 to 28.52 million - the highest figure since records began in 1971. While the UK's jobless rate rose to 4.7% from 4.6% in the previous quarter, the rate still remains one of the lowest in the world, compared with 12.1% in Germany, 10.4% in Spain and 9.7% in France. Marc Ostwald, a strategist at Monument Securities told Reuters that while no immediate market impact could be expected, ""it is enough to underline that they (the BoE) will be more hawkish on rates""."
61,"Any profits would depend on the outcome of legal cases resulting from a change in steel contractor, it added. It cut A$68m from profit targets for Wembley and another UK project. The decline came despite Multiplex reporting an 11% rise in pre-tax profits to A$67.7m for 2004 and reaffirming its 2005 profit forecasts. These claims could take up to two years to resolve. ""It is expected that profits will be possible in future periods as the claims are finalised."" Wembley Stadium is to due to be completed in January and will officially open for the 2006 FA Cup Final. ""Multiplex believes its claim are sound and ultimately will exceed the level needed to support the break even position,"" it said."
62,"The 3.3% fall in car sales had been expected, coming after December's 4% rise in car sales, fuelled by generous pre-Christmas special offers. US retail spending is expected to rise in 2005, but not as quickly as in 2004. Sales at restaurants, bars and coffee houses rose by 0.3%, while grocery store sales were up 0.5%. ""Consumers continue to retain their strength in the first quarter,"" he said. Steve Gallagher, US chief economist at SG Corporate & Investment Banking, said January's figures were ""decent numbers"". In December, overall retail sales rose by 1.1%. Parul Jain, deputy chief economist at Nomura Securities International, said consumer spending would continue to rise in 2005, only at a slower rate of growth than in 2004."
63,"Lufthansa said that it may lose millions of euros as a result of Air Force One landing at Frankfurt airport. ""We are checking if there is action to be taken and in which courts it could be taken."" Central to the problem was that instead of half an hour, the arrival of President Bush on the German leg of his European tour took the best part of an hour, Lufthansa said. The company said that it had to cancel 77 short and medium-distance flights, affecting about 5,000 passengers. Long-haul travellers were not disrupted. During that time, restrictions were put on planes taxiing, taking off and landing at Frankfurt's Rhein-Main airport. Mr Lamberty explained that the company did not plan to pursue Germany's air traffic controllers' organisation or the airport authority but wanted instead to see if it was possible to sue the German federal agencies that gave the orders."
64,"Airlines have reacted strongly against the proposed fuel levy. The policy makers are to ask for a report into how more development money can be raised, the EU said. ""Of course we applaud humanitarian initiatives, but why target the airlines?"" EU aiming to fuel development aid
European Union finance ministers meet on Thursday to discuss proposals, including a tax on jet fuel, to boost development aid for poorer nations. said Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus, secretary general of the Association of European Airlines. ""Our industry is in the midst of a fundamental crisis...only to be once again confronted with a measure designed to increase our costs,"" he continued. It added that any plan to levy taxes on jet fuel ""should not hinder the competitiveness of the airlines and that they themselves will not be solely funding development"". At their meeting in London, G7 finance ministers backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts of some of the world's poorest countries."
65,"""We're surprised that the Ifo index has taken such a knock,"" said DZ bank economist Bernd Weidensteiner. Germany's economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. ""The main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak, particularly in the retail trade."" Economy and Labour Minister Wolfgang Clement called the dip in February's Ifo confidence figure ""a very mild decline"". Exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004, but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making German products less competitive overseas. He said that despite the retreat, the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected ""a modest economic upswing"" to continue. Eurozone interest rates are at 2%, but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation, prompting fears that interest rates may rise."
66,"FAO warns on impact of subsidies
Billions of farmers' livelihoods are at risk from falling commodity prices and protectionism, the UN's Food & Agriculture Organisation has warned. Trade barriers and subsidies ""severely"" distort the market, the FAO report on the ""State of Agricultural Commodity Markets 2004"" said. The most endangered are those who live in the least-developed countries. Global exports of these products are mainly in the hands of the European Union and the US, who - thanks to subsidies - sell them at very low prices. According to the organisation, subsidies and high tariffs have a strong impact on the trade of products such as cotton and rice. The market situation has divided developing nations in two groups, the FAO said. These countries are mainly situated in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean."
67,"Kamal Nath, Commerce and Industry Minister, announced the decision in Delhi on Thursday following a cabinet meeting. The government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers, and benefit steel and brick-making industries. The Indian government's decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector, according to some Indian firms. A spokesman for DLF Builders, Dr Vancheshwar, told the BBC this will mean ""better offerings"" for consumers as well as builders. He said, ""No country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone."" ""Foreign investors can enter any construction development area, be it to build resorts, townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50,000 square meters (538,000 square feet) within a specific timeframe,"" said Mr Nath, without specifying the timeframe. Mr Majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets. Anshuman Magazine, managing director, of CB Richard Ellis - an international real estate company - told the BBC this was ""a big positive step."""
68,"The 777-200LR, which had its launch delayed by the 11 September attacks in the US, is the fifth variation of Boeing's twin-aisle 777 plane. The company offically ""rolled-out"" the new 777 in Seattle at 2200 GMT. Boeing plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world's airports, getting rid of the need for connecting flights. But the 777-200LR ""is a niche player"", Mr Learmount continued, adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft. Mr Learmount pointed out that the 777-200LR has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders. ""Boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful,"" said David Learmount, operations and safety editor at industry magazine Flight International. From there, passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by smaller planes. Both Boeing and Airbus have been taking orders for their new planes. Boeing said earnings during the last three months of 2004 dropped by 84% because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner, the 717, and the cancellation of a US air force 767 tanker contract. These orders should help underpin the company's profits."
69,"The bid has come from Boston-based private investment firm Highfields Capital Management, which already owns 6.7% of Circuit City's shares. Highfield said that it intends to take the Virginia-based firm private. One analyst suggested that a bidding battle may now begin for the company. The retailer is debt free with a good cash flow, despite the fact that it is said to be struggling to keep up with market leader Best Buy and cut-price competition from the likes of Wal-Mart, said Mr Armstrong."
70,"Japan's long economic downturn helped drive the trend, as drinkers looked for cheaper opportunities to drown their sorrows. Asahi is predicting profits to rise 50% in 2005 as it launches a drink based on soybean peptides rather than malt. The chosen name, ""Shinnama"" or ""new draft"", disguises its non-beer nature. Now, according to Asahi Breweries, the market for so-called ""beer-like"" drinks is set to grow 84% this year. Happoshu has been a mainstay of brewery profits for years, taking over from beer thanks to its low tax and therefore low cost."
71,"S Korean consumers spending again
South Korea looks set to sustain its revival thanks to renewed private consumption, its central bank says. ""The economy is now heading upward rather than downward,"" said central bank governor Park Seung. ""The worst seems to have passed."" Credit card debt is falling, with only one in 13 of the 48 million cards now in default - down from one in eight at the end of 2003. Economic growth in 2004 was about 4.7%, with the central bank predicting 4% growth this year. The country's economy has suffered from an overhang of personal debt after its consumers' credit card spending spree. But domestic demand seems to be taking up the slack."
72,"According to the statistics office, Destatis, rising exports were outweighed in the fourth quarter by the continuing weakness of domestic demand. It said growth in the third quarter had been zero, putting the economy at a standstill from July onward. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. The ECB's mandate is to fight rising prices by boosting interest rates - and that could further threaten Germany's hopes of recovery. The effect has been to depress prospects for the 12-nation eurozone as a whole, as well as Germany."
73,"Turkcell said the decision ""increases the risks"" attached to the project. Turkish-Austrian consortium TAV was chosen to build and run Tehran's new Imam Khomeini International Airport - but the army closed it just hours after it opened in May 2004. ""The possibility of carrying out this project is next to zero,"" said Atinc Ozkan, analyst at Finans Investment in Istanbul. In both cases, the justification has been national security, amid allegations that the Turkish firms are too close to Israel. If Turkcell does back out, MTN - the South African firm which lost out in the original tender - may well be back in the running. The hardline posture taken by parliament, which is dominated by religious conservatives, could yet impact other inward investments."
74,"The world's richest countries have said they want to boost the amount of aid they give to 0.7% of their annual gross national income by 2015. It was keen to point out earlier this week that any new tax on jet fuel should not hurt the ""competitiveness of the airlines"". Global leaders have focused attention on poverty reduction and development at recent meetings of the G7 Group and World Economic Forum. Ministers will also be discussing reforms to regulations governing European public spending. The EU said a tax would only be passed after full consultation with airlines."
75,"Unemployment stood at 25%, compared with 10% before the uprising against Israeli occupation four years ago. Palestinian economy in decline
Despite a short-lived increase in Palestinian jobs in 2003, the economy is performing well below its potential, said a World Bank report. The closures arranged by Israel restrict the movement of Palestinian people and goods, slowing down trade. It also called on the Palestinian Authority to revive its reform programme and maintain financial discipline to create an investment-friendly climate. ""Closures are a key factor behind today's economic crisis in the West Bank,"" said Nigel Roberts, World Bank country director for the West Bank and Gaza. The report said even more would be on the poverty line without an average of $950m a year from international donors, some of which goes towards job creation."
76,"The Kremlin said on Tuesday that the $6bn which Russian state bank VEB lent state-owned Rosneft to help buy Yugansk in turn came from Chinese banks. Rosneft and VEB declined to comment. According to Russian newspaper Vedomosti, these credits would be used to pay off the loans Rosneft received to finance the purchase of Yugansk. The deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China's desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. Yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines. ""Clearly the Chinese are trying to get some leverage [in Russia],"" said Dmitry Lukashov, an analyst at brokerage Aton. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once the country's richest man, Mr Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion. ""They understand property rights in Russia are not the most important rights, and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies."" ""If the price of oil is fixed under the deal, which is unlikely, it could be very profitable for the Chinese,"" Mr Lukashov continued."
77,"Deadline nears for Fiat-GM deal
Fiat and General Motors (GM) have until midnight on 1 February to settle a disagreement over a potential takeover. GM, whose own European operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable Fiat unit. For its part, GM's European units Opel and Saab have both had trouble, with Opel management threatening to cut 12,000 jobs. The German firm wanted to buy Fiat outright. But Gianni Agnelli, the godfather of the group, wanted to keep control, and preferred GM's offer to buy a 20% stake and give Fiat the right to sell in the future, known as a ""put option"". ""The last thing they need is additional production capacity in Europe,"" said Patrick Juchemich, auto analyst at Sal Oppenheim Bank."
78,"ID theft surge hits US consumers
Almost a quarter of a million US consumers complained of being targeted for identity theft in 2004, official figures suggest. The total cost of fraud reported by consumers was $546m (£290m). The report marks the fifth year in a row in which identity fraud has topped the table. Misusing someone's identity to claim new credit cards or loans comprised 16.5% of the total, with almost 12% coming from false claims on existing credit. Internet auctions were the second biggest source of fraud complaints, comprising 16% of the total. Among the 100,000 internet auction complaints, the failure of sellers to deliver or the supply of sub-standard goods were the most common woes reported."
79,"Argentina, Venezuela in oil deal
Argentina and Venezuela have extended a food-for-oil deal, which helped the former to overcome a severe energy crisis last year. Last year, Argentina's severe energy crisis forced President Kirchner to suspend gas exports to Chile. Under this deal, the Argentine market will be opened to Venezuelan investment. Argentina fears that rising demand could spark another crisis and wants to prevent it by signing this deal. The two countries also formalised a co-operation deal between Venezuelan energy firm PDVSA and Argentina's Enarsa."
80,"The faulty part does not represent a safety risk and the recall only affects pumps made in December and January. The additional three-day stoppage will mean a production loss of up to 3,600 vehicles, BMW said, adding that it was confident it could make up the numbers later. It is to close the Mercedes factory in Sindelfingen on Monday and Tuesday. BMW said that it was too early to say how many cars were affected or how much the recall would cost. When asked if BMW would be seeking compensation from Bosch, the carmaker's chief executive Helmut Panke said: ""we will first solve the problem before talking about who will pay"". A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler, parent company of Mercedes Benz, said it will however have to halt some production."
81,"Takeover rumour lifts Exel shares
Shares in storage and delivery firm Exel closed up 9% at a two-and-a-half year high on Tuesday on speculation it is to receive an imminent takeover bid.

82,"But Deutsche Bank - itself a target of a Yukos lawsuit - said documents had been backdated to strengthen the case. By doing so, he said, the firm had intended to reinforce its US presence - and thus its chances of getting its case heard in US courts. In the end, the auction was won by an unknown shell company for $9.4bn - much less than most assessments of its value - before ending up in the hands of state-controlled oil firm Rosneft. Yukos chief financial officer Bruce Misamore, who had moved to the US in early December to set up Yukos USA, acknowledged the point. But he said that the papers documenting the transaction were not drawn up till weeks after Yukos made its bankruptcy application on 14 December, and then backdated. Even so, he told the court that only $480,000 had been in the accounts that day, with the rest arriving a day later. Yukos accused of lying to court
Russian oil firm Yukos lied to a US court in an attempt to stop the Russian government selling off its key production unit, the court has heard. Yukos maintains that it filed for bankruptcy in the US because it feared it would not be able to do so in Russia. It also said that in the event of going bust, it could offer the chance of restructuring. ""It gives us a kind of life after death alternative,"" said Yukos chief executive Steven Theede."
83,"The growth in remittances has sparked fierce competition between banks. The Bank of Mexico said that remittances grew 24% last year and now represent the country's second-biggest source of income after oil. The Inter-American Development Bank estimates that remittances to Latin America and the Caribbean reached $45bn in 2004. Last year, there were 50.9 million transactions, with an average value of $327 per remittance, the bank said. Bank of America announced last week that it planned to eliminate transfer fees for some customers."

The number of mortgages approved in the UK has risen for the first time since May last year, according to lending figures from the Bank of England. ""The modest rise in mortgage approvals and lending in December reinforces the impression that the housing market is currently slowing steadily rather than sharply,"" said Global Insight analyst Howard Archer, commenting on the BoE's figures. Separately, the Bank of England said that consumer credit rose by £1.5bn in December, more than the £1.4bn expected and above the £1.4bn reported in the previous month.

Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers, who is accused of overseeing an $11bn (£5.8bn) fraud, never made accounting decisions, a witness has told jurors. During cross examination, he asked Mr Myers if he ever knew Mr Ebbers ""make an accounting decision?"". ""Did you ever know Mr Ebbers to make an accounting entry into Worldcom books?"" ""Not that I am aware of,"" Mr Myers replied. Mr Weingarten pressed. The phone company collapsed in 2002 and prosecutors claim that losses were hidden to protect the firm's shares. Mr Myers has admitted that he ordered false accounting entries at the request of former Worldcom chief financial officer Scott Sullivan. Worldcom's problems mounted, however, as competition increased and the telecoms boom petered out. He has firmly declared his innocence."

Meeting in Brussels, finance ministers of the 12 eurozone countries voiced their concern that the rise of the european currency was harming exports. Europe blames US over weak dollar
European leaders have openly blamed the US for the sharp rise in the value of the euro. The European ministers' comments, said Junya Tanase of JPMorgan Chase bank in Tokyo, were ""generally too weak to produce a market reaction"". And the European Union's monetary affairs commissioner, made it clear that action was necessary. ""We are concerned about these developments, which are destabilising, and which are linked to the accumulation of deficits by our American friends,"" he said. But that was not enough for Mr Sarkozy. ""I fully welcome the words of Mr Snow,"" said Joaquin Almunia, ""but we will need to see decisions adopted in that direction.

89,"Wine makers, however, claimed the support did not go far enough. The package was announced by agriculture minister Dominique Bussereau after talks with vintners' representatives. The financial package is aimed at assisting vintners in financial trouble and improving how its wine is marketed. The French wine industry, the world's second largest, has been hit by declining consumption at home and the growing popularity of New World wines. The aid package would ""create a positive climate around French viticulture,"" Mr Bussereau said. A further 15m euros will be made available to wine cooperatives, which make up the majority of French producers, in low interest loans. However, wine makers and farmers said the support was much less than they had been hoping for. ""I am afraid the resources are not up to the ambitions,"" Jean-Michel Lemetayer, from the FNSEA agricultural union, told the Associated Press news agency. Production is currently outstripping demand by about 30%."
90,"Standard & Poor's has classed Russian bonds as ""investment grade"", up from their former ""speculative"" rating. S&P had held back through fear that the government was dragging its feet on economic and legal reforms. Russia's reputation among investors has been hurt in recent months by the heavy tax bills and asset seizures imposed on companies such as oil giant Yukos. Now, though, it has finally followed suit. But the agency made it clear that the improved rating did not mean that the risks were a thing of the past. Instead, with Russian government coffers brimming with tax revenues from energy sales, S&P said the government's own debt is looking a good bet. ""These improvements are so significant that they now outweight the serious and growing political risk that continues to be a key ratings constraint on Russia,"" wrote S&P credit analyst Helena Hessel. The Yukos saga is the most high-profile of the political risks to which Ms Hessel alludes."
91,"Turkcell now says it may give up on the deal altogether. Turkcell signed a contract for the new network in September. They have already given themselves a veto over all foreign investment deals, following allegations about Turkish firms' involvement in Israel. Conservatives in parliament say Turkcell's stake in Irancell, the new network, should be cut from 70% to 49%. Parliament as a whole - dominated by religious conservatives - will vote on the ruling on Tuesday. Iran currently has only one heavily congested mobile network, with long waiting lists for new subscribers. Israeli industry minister Ehud Olmert was reported in June to have attended a meeting between Ruhi Dogusoy, Turkcell's chief operating officer, and executives from Israeli telecoms firms. ""If management control and financial consolidation of Irancell cannot be achieved... the realisation of the project will become risky,"" it warned in a statement. The two countries strengthened ties in both defence and economic issues in 2004."
92,"Yesterday Argentina's economy minister, Roberto Lavagna, said that he estimated that the results of the restructuring would be ready around next Thursday (3 March). The estimated loss to bondholders is up to 70% of the original value of the bonds, yet the majority are expected to accept the government's offer. Argentina's President, Nestor Kirchner, said on Friday: ""A year ago when we started the swap (negotiations), they told us we were crazy, that we were irrational."" But he added that his government was close to achieving: ""The best debt renegotiation in history."" Of Argentina's bondholders, 38.4% reside in Argentina, 15.6% in Italy, 10.3% in Switzerland, 9.1% in the United States, 5.1% in Germany and 3.1% in Japan. By 18 February, creditors holding $41bn - or 40% of the total debt - had accepted the offer. Sorting out its debt would enhance the country's credibility on international markets and enable it to attract more foreign investment."

Patents on a number of well-known products are due to run out in the near future, representing an opportunity for Dr Reddy, whose shares are listed in New York, and other Indian generics manufacturers.

US car firms General Motors (GM) and Ford have been forced to cut production in the face of falling car sales. Overall. US sales at GM sank 12.7% in February compared to a year ago while Ford sales dropped 3% as foreign rivals took a bigger share of the market. sales across the industry also fell to 1.25 million vehicles from 1.27 million a year earlier. GM added that US truck sales fell 9% in February while car business tumbled 17%, however it did acknowledge that some new products - such as the Pontiac G6 and Chevrolet Cobalt - had put in solid performances. Chrysler, the US unit of Germany's DaimlerChrysler, was the only Detroit based automaker to boast an increase in market share during the month - with sales rising 8%. But America's loss was its foreign rivals' gain as they continued to nibble away at the US market.

Australia is raising its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in four years despite signs of a slowdown in the country's economy. However, opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the Australian economy grew just 0.1% between October and December and 1.5% on an annual basis. The figures, representing a decline from the 0.2% growth in GDP seen between July and September, were below market expectations. The Bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts. ""Over recent months it has become increasingly clear that remaining spare capacity in the labour and goods markets is becoming rather limited,"" said Ian Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank. ""The economy has been strong and it is properly moderating but it doesn't look to me like it's slowing in any unreasonable way,"" said Treasurer Peter Costello. ""This suggests the economy really did slow very sharply in the second half of 2004."""

A US defence and telecommunications company has agreed to pay $28.5m after admitting bribery in the West African state of Benin. It agreed to pay $13m in criminal penalties, as well as $15.5m to settle a civil lawsuit brought by the US financial watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Some of the money was used to pay for T-shirts with campaign slogans on them ahead of the 2001 election.

An ongoing restructuring drive at the group also led to a $337m hit in the fourth quarter, the world's biggest insurer said. The insurer hit the headlines in October last year when it faced accusations of price rigging. The latest layoffs will take the total number of jobs to go at the firm to 5,500 and are expected to lead to annual savings of more than $375m. In February, a former senior executive pleaded guilty to criminal charges in a wide-ranging probe of fraud and bid-rigging in the insurance industry. Looking ahead, Mr Cherkasky forecast profitable growth for the year ahead ""with an operating margin in the upper-teens, and with the opportunity for further margin expansion"". ""As a result, we are ready to put these matters behind us and move ahead in 2005 to restore the trust our clients have placed in us and to rebuild shareholder value,"" Mr Cherkasky said. Marsh did not say when the move would take place, but said it had signed a letter of intent. New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer sued the company, accusing it of receiving illegal payments to steer clients to selected firms as well as rigging bids and fixing prices.

A three-judge panel agreed with the companies, finding that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws. Prosecutors went after the companies using legislation put in place to fight organised crime, and accused the firms of conspiring and running ""Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations"". Prosecutors had argued that tobacco firms lied about the dangers of smoking, ignored research that highlighted problems, looked to increase addiction by manipulating nicotine levels and targeted the young with their adverts. Among the firms accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson. Despite denying for decades that smoking could be linked to illness, the companies have modified their stances in recent years. Government lawyers have until 21 March to file their appeal."

Liberia is recovering from a 14-year civil war that came to an end in 2003. The IMF also said it was crucial that the Central Bank of Liberia be strengthened, the national budget be effectively managed and a sound economic basis built to allow the country's large external debt to be addressed. In particular, it pointed to mystery surrounding the sale of iron ore stockpiles and the alleged disappearance of some import and export permits. ""The IMF team stands ready to assist the (Liberian) authorities in strengthening the areas mentioned,"" said the report.

He also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970.

The Argentine Work Ministry has been mediating in the conflict and it could call an ""obligatory conciliation"", which would force both sides to find a solution and put an end to the conflict. It said it would put this commitment on paper. ""We are taken as hostages. I don't know who is right, but the harm ones are us,"" said accountant Jose Lopez."

Japanese communications firm Softbank has widened losses after heavy spending on a new cut-rate phone service. The service, launched in December and dubbed ""Otoku"" or ""bargain"", has had almost 900,000 orders, Softbank said. But without the Otoku marketing spend it would have made a profit - and expects to move into the black in 2006. The acquisition spurred its broadband internet division to pole position in the Japanese market, with more than 5.1 million subscribers at the end of December."

Australian mining firm WMC Resources has seen a fivefold rise in profits while continuing to be the target of a hostile takeover bid. WMC's interests in uranium deposits were a contributing factor, Mr Vaile said. Nickel prices rose 43% during the year, with copper up 36%.

125,"Barclays' chief John Varley said the bank had ""caught the winds"" of a very strong world economy. Barclays results were in line with market expectations. According to analysts' forecasts, HSBC, the biggest UK bank by stock market valuation, will report profits of £9.4bn later this month. Its Global Investors wing made £347m, an 82% jump on 2003 figures. The bank also blamed margins pressure on its mortgage business and spending on its branches over the past year for a 1% fall in profits in its UK retail division to £1.13bn. ""The outlook for 2005 is good as a result of balance sheet growth and investments made in 2004,"" Mr Varley said. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Mr Varley declined to be drawn on reports that Barclays had held merger talks with US bank Wells Fargo. ""They are a bit more aggressive than we had expected. The cost overshoot is not in Barclays Capital but in the UK bank."""

The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (£15.2bn). ""We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,"" said Tim Osborne, a director of Group Menatep. ""The time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today."" Menatep has already asked Rosneft to repay a $900m loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets. It accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities, and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze Yukos accounts and seize Yugansk. Arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in Stockholm or The Hague, Mr Gaillard said. But Mr Gaillard told BBC News that the Charter came into effect on signature, not ratification. ""Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors,"" he said. He has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors."

""The tsunami affected travel patterns in ways that we were a bit surprised about,"" chief executive Geoff Dixon explained. As soon as the tsunami hit we saw ... a lessening with bookings for Australia."" Higher fuel costs also are expected to eat into earnings in coming months. Qantas boss Mr Dixon also said he would be reviewing the group's cost-cutting measures.

But the Indian Air Force is also considering proposals from other foreign firms such as France's Dassault Aviation, Sweden's Saab and Russia's Mikoyan-Gurevich. The US company also said it had agreed with a new Indian budget airline the sale of 10 737-800 planes for $630m. On the civilian front, Boeing announced a deal with India's HCL Technologies to develop a platform for the flight test system of its 787 Dreamliner aircraft. ""No other market is going to see the growth that will be seen here in the coming years,"" said Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president Boeing. In addition, the European company has plans to open a training centre in India. The airline, SpiceJet, will also have the option to acquire 10 more aircraft. Meanwhile, flag carrier Air India is considering to buy 50 new aircraft from either Boeing or Airbus."

The merger, backed by Russian authorities, will allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom shares. According to reports from Russian News Agency Interfax, the deal should go through in the next two to three months. However, the merged group will still remain outside Russia's top five oil producers - led by Lukoil with 11% of the market , followed by TNK-BP which is half owned by BP, and Surgutneftegaz. ""This is positive news for the international investment community,"" Global Asset Management investment chief David Smith said. ""The majority of investors are going to be happy,"" he added. Analysts said the deal would give Gazprom control of 8% of Russia's total oil production, an improvement on its current 2.5%, but still far less than the 20% share it would have gained had it also taken over Yugansk. Yukos unsuccessfully sought to halt the auction by applying for bankruptcy through the US courts. The shell company was then snapped up by Rosneft. The unit was auctioned by Russian authorities to help pay off a $27.5bn back-tax bill."

132,"Salary scandal in Cameroon
Cameroon says widespread corruption in its finance ministry has cost it 1bn CFA francs ($2m; £1m) a month. About 500 officials are accused of either awarding themselves extra money or claiming salaries for ""non-existent"" workers. The scam is believed to have begun in 1994. Fidelis Nanga, a journalist based in the Cameroon capital Yaounde, said the government was considering taking criminal action against those found guilty and forcing them to repay any money owed. The prime minister's office said auditors had found ""irregularities in the career structure of certain civil servants"". ""The prime minister has given instructions for exemplary penalties to be meted out against the accused and their accomplices if found guilty,"" he told the BBC's Network Africa programme. In certain cases, staff are said to have lied about their rank and delayed their retirement in order to boost their earnings."
133,"In a welcome economic boost for newly re-elected President George W Bush, the Labor Department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains. Jobs were created in every sector of the US economy except manufacturing. The 337,000 new jobs added to US payrolls in October was twice the 169,000 figure that Wall Street economists had forecast. ""It looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays, and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year,"" said economist Gary Thayer of AG Edwards & Sons. In addition, the Labor Department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months - to 139,000 in September instead of 96,000, and to 198,000 in August instead of 128,000. Other analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the US Federal Reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2% when it meets next week."
134,"The case will also have a major impact on Britain's sole feta producer, Yorkshire company Shepherds Purse Cheeses. ""In our opinion it is a generic designation and we do not have any other name or term for this type of cheese,"" Hans Arne Kristiansen, a spokesman for the Danish Dairy Board, told the BBC. Denmark is Europe's second largest producer of feta after Greece - producing about 30,000 tonnes a year - and exports its products to Greece. ""It would cost millions if we wanted to introduce a new designation,"" Mr Kristiansen said. ""That is just one of the costs."" Judy Bell, the company's founder, said it would cost a huge amount to rebrand its product. ""If we lose we will have to go through a massive re-merchandising process and reorganisation,"" she said. ""We have never tried to pull the wool over anyone's eyes - it's very clear from the label that it's Yorkshire feta."" Feta is a soft white cheese made from sheep or goat's milk, and is an essential ingredient in Greek cuisine. The Court is expected to reach a verdict in the case in the autumn."
135,"Ukraine revisits state sell-offs
Ukraine is preparing what could be a wholesale review of the privatisation of thousands of businesses by the previous administration. But on Wednesday Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3,000 firms. ""They don't want to be seen to be transferring assets from one set of oligarchs to a new set."" An open-ended list could further damage outside investors' fragile faith in Ukraine, said Stuart Hensel of the Economist Intelligence Unit. ""They're aware of the need not to scare investors, and to be careful of internal divides within Ukraine,"" he said. The privatisation review's number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included Viktor Pinchuk, Mr Kuchma's son-in-law, for $800m (£424m) despite higher bids from several foreign groups. His opponent, Viktor Yanukovich, still has huge support in the country's eastern industrial heartland. But he warned that the government could decide to take the easy route of revaluing the company and charging the existing owners the revised price rather than undertaking a fresh sale. The mill, Krivorizhstal, is one of the world's most profitable. ""If the original privatisation is annulled and a new tender issued, then we would look at it with great interest,"" a spokesman told BBC News."

""There have been sufficient signs in the economy of a slowdown to stay the Bank of England's hand,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I still think interest rates are going up,"" he said. ""We are not out of the woods."""
137,"Winter freeze keeps oil above $50
Oil prices carried on rising on Wednesday after cold weather on both sides of the North Atlantic pushed US crude prices to four-month highs. US crude was trading at $51.39 at 0710 GMT in Asian electronic trade on Wednesday. The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices. Opec members said on Tuesday that, given such high prices, the cartel saw no reason to cut its output. ""The primary factor is the weak dollar,"" said Victor Shum, a Singapore-based analyst with Purvin and Gertz. ""I agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this,"" Fathi Bin Shatwan, Libya's oil minister, told Reuters. ""I do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel,"" he added."
138,"The news comes as the head of Germany's panel of government economic advisers predicted growth would again stagnate. The German government is trying to tackle the stubbornly-high levels of joblessness with a range of labour market reforms. At their centre is the ""Hartz-IV"" programme introduced in January to shake up welfare benefits and push people back into work - even if some of the jobs are heavily subsidised. Widely leaked to the German newspapers a day in advance, they produced screaming headlines criticising Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrat-Green Party administration. Mr Schroeder had originally come into office promising to halve unemployment. The soaring official unemployment figure follows a change in the methodology which pushed up the jobless rate by more than 500,000 in January. Still, some measures suggest the picture is not quite so bleak."
139,"Steelmakers have been enjoying record profits as demand for steel has risen, driven by the booming economies of countries such as China and India. The boom times are far from over, but analysts say that earnings growth may slow. Shares in Germany's ThyssenKrupp, the UK's Corus and France's Arcleor fell while Japan's Nippon Steel slid after it agreed to pay 72% more for iron ore. China's Baoshan Iron and Steel Co. said it was delaying a share sale because of weak market conditions, adding it would raise steel prices to offset ore costs. Miners Rio Tinto and Cia. Steel analyst Peter Fish, director of Sheffield-based consulting group MEPS, said the extent of CVRD's price rise was ""uncharted territory"", adding that the steel industry ""hasn't seen an increase of this magnitude probably in 50 years"". Analysts now expect other iron ore producers, such as Australia's BHP Billiton, to seek annual price rises of up to 70%. The firm had been expected to offer 22.5bn yuan ($2.7bn) worth of shares to investors. The news triggered the share price weakness. ""It sparked worries that steel makers might not be able to increase product prices further [ to cover rising ore costs]"" explained Kazuhiro Takahashi of Daiwa Securities SMBC. In Europe, Arcelor shed 2.1% to 17.58 euros in Paris, with ThyssenKrupp dropping 1.7% to 16.87 euros."
140,"In contrast, he said, the popularity of van-style seven-seat vehicles and traditional saloon cars would fade. Speaking at a BMW event ahead of the Geneva motor show, Helmut Panke predicted demand for such crossover vehicles would soar in Europe. ""We have decided that BMW will enter the [crossover] segment,"" he said in the clearest indication yet about the car maker's intentions. ""Customers are moving out of the mini-van (and) traditional concepts are not as attractive anymore,"" he said. While in the US drivers tend to prefer sports utility vehicles (SUVs), such as the BMW X5 and its sibling X3, in Europe demand for crossover vehicles is likely to be considerable, Mr Panke said. ""We are going to go that way."""
141,"The dollar suffered its biggest one-day fall in four months on Tuesday on fears that Asian central banks were about to lower their reserves of dollars. The dollar's latest slide began after a South Korean parliamentary report suggested the country, which has about $200bn in foreign reserves, had plans to boost holdings of currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollar. Japan has $850bn in foreign exchange reserves. On Wednesday, however, South Korea moved to steady the financial markets. Japan, too, steadied nerves. It issued a statement that ""The Bank of Korea will not change the portfolio of currencies in its reserves due to short term market factors"". The focus has been on the country's massive trade and budget deficits, and analysts have predicted more dollar weakness to come."

On Monday, oil prices rose for a sixth straight session, reaching a four-month high as cold weather in the US threatened stocks of heating oil. US demand for heating oil was predicted to be about 14% above normal this week, while stocks were currently about 7.5% below the levels of a year ago. Cold weather across Europe has also put upward pressure on crude prices."
144,"Winn-Dixie files for bankruptcy
US supermarket group Winn-Dixie has filed for bankruptcy protection after succumbing to stiff competition in a market dominated by Wal-Mart. It said its 920 stores would remain open, but analysts said it would most likely off-load a number of sites. A 10-month restructuring plan was deemed a failure, and following a larger-than-expected quarterly loss earlier this month, Winn-Dixie's slide into bankruptcy was widely expected. The company's new chief executive Peter Lynch said Winn-Dixie would use the Chapter 11 breathing space to take the necessary action to turn itself around. ""This includes achieving significant cost reductions, improving the merchandising and customer service in all locations and generating a sense of excitement in the stores,"" he said."
145,"His conclusion was simple: too many of the targets will be seriously missed. The circumstances weren't conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by EU leaders in Lisbon in 2000. You find trade unions fighting change. ""The [Lisbon] vision is a compelling one, but in order to do it society has to change,"" said Paul Hofheinz of the Lisbon Council, a Brussels-based citizen action group. But also the employers' associations. While there has been growth in overall employment rates in Europe, productivity lags behind that of the US. ""Even though they tell you they're in favour of change, many are actually pushing for less competition, more subsidy and less free market activity."" Targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the Lisbon case, they covered too much, according to the Wim report. It will be up to the incoming president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, to adopt Mr Kok's recommendations and press them on EU governments. ""This is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do."

""Powertrain told us today that Alfa Romeo engines will no longer be made in Arese,"" said union leader Vincenzo Lilliu, as reported by the Reuters news agency. GM had to pay former partner Fiat 1.55bn euros ($2bn; £1.1bn) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the Italian carmaker outright. ""The assembly line will be dismantled and the six-cylinder Alfa Romeo motor will be replaced with an engine GM produces in Australia."""
148,"It will not be sold in the US, said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster. GM's announcement should go some way to allay fears of the Saab factory's closure. They may now have to face a larger proportion of GM's cuts. Yet it could prove tough for Cadillac to steal market share from the majors in Europe. The segment's leaders do not agree. GM's plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers. In a separate announcement, GM unveiled a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models. But not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. ""We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is today,"" the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News.

He argued that economic growth was picking up, and that the equity, credit and housing markets had been stronger than expected. However, the minutes added: ""Some members noted that an increase might be warranted in due course if the economy evolved in line with the central projection"". Ross Walker, UK economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said he was surprised that a dissenting vote had been made so soon. ""If the economy pans out as they expect then they are probably going to have to hike rates."""
151,"A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 to $51.15 in New York on Tuesday. The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices. ""The dollar moved sharply overnight and oil is following it,"" said Chris Furness, senior market strategist at 4Cast. Several Opec members said a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia. ""If the dollar continues to weaken, oil will be obviously higher."" ""I agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this,"" Fathi Bin Shatwan, Libya's oil minister, told Reuters.

The figure means the annual rate of increase in the UK is down to 10.2%, the lowest rate since June 2001. House prices have risen 0.9% this year, Nationwide said, and if this pace of increase persists, prices would rise by just under 6% in the year to December. Homeowners now expect house prices to rise by 1% over the next six months, Mr Bannister said. ""I think the key is what the Bank expects to happen to the housing market. Further evidence of a slowdown in the housing market emerged from Bank of England lending figures released on Tuesday. We always thought we would see a small rise, they thought they would see a small decline."" The past few months have seen approvals fall to levels last seen in 1995. New mortgage loans in January fell to 79,000 from 82,000 in December, the bank said. Overall, mortgage lending rose by £7.2bn in January, marginally up on the £7.1bn rise in December."
153,"It comes just weeks ahead of the Budget and an expected general election. A review by the ONS found it had made a mistake by ""double counting"" some spending on roads since 1998/9. In January the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Mr Brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year's Budget. Mr Letwin said: ""This is a very murky area... After the ONS announcement, economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004/05 of about £400m. There will inevitably be suspicions that the figures are being fiddled."" ""Accordingly, it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course.""

The two companies, facing competition from the likes of Wal-Mart, tried to merge two years ago but talks failed. Sources familiar with the deal said that negotiations between the two companies sped up after May's chairman and chief executive Gene Kahn resigned in January. The combined firm will operate about 1,000 stores across the US, with combined annual sales of $30bn. Federated has annual sales of $15.6bn, while May's yearly sales are $14.4bn.

155,"The news sent Tokyo shares to an eight-month high, as investors hoped for a recovery from the three quarters of contraction seen from April 2004 on. Only an exceptionally strong performance in the early months of 2004 kept the year as a whole from showing a decline. At the same time, retail sales picked up faster than at any time since 1997. Within the overall industrial output figure, there were signs of a pullback from the export slowdown. ""Overall I see a low risk of the economy falling into serious recession,"" said Bank of Japan chief Toshihiko Fukui, despite warning that other indicators - such as the growth numbers - had been worrying.

""To my embarrassment, I could not understand the file of complaints against me,"" he told a Moscow court. Mr Lebedev headed the Menatep group, the parent company of Yukos.

158,"But the heavy spending on poverty reduction means the 2005-6 target for the deficit will be 4.3%, Mr Chidambaram said - falling short of the new law's requirement. Under the fiscal responsibility law, Mr Chidambaram has to trim the deficit by 0.3 percentage points each year, a target he says he has now met for the current year. The following year, though, would have to be back on track, he warned. ""I was left with no option but to press the pause button vis a vis the act,"" he said. The coming year's reduction has meant bringing more of the businesses in India's burgeoning services sector into the tax system and restructuring the personal tax system, although there are numerous corporate tax and duty reductions built into the budget. But Mr Chidambaram is under pressure from the Communist parties to focus on increasing social spending. He said India's economy grew 6.9% in 2004. ""Given the resilience of the Indian economy... it is possible to launch a direct assault on poverty,"" Mr Chidambaram said. ""The whole purpose of democratic government is to eliminate poverty."" As part of his reforms he has announced:
- Duty cuts on capital goods and raw materials 
 - Expanded service tax net 
 - Raised the income-tax threshold to 100,000 rupees ($2,300) 
 - Reduced income tax for those earning less than 250,000 rupees ($5,700) to 20% 
 - Reduced corporate tax rates to 30%

159,"But Fiat's heavy losses have convinced GM - whose own European operations are in the red - to back away. The Fiat-GM alliance came about in 2000 as an alternative to selling Fiat outright. The pay-off means the two firms will unwind joint ventures, but Fiat will keep supplying diesel engines and the money will allow it to reduce its debt. ""We now have absolute freedom to design our own future,"" said Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne. For its part, GM was keen to ward off any criticism that the deal had been a mistake. Instead, GM swapped a 6% stake in itself for 20% of Fiat - and gave Fiat a ""put option"" to sell GM the rest of the car maker between January 2004 and July 2009. German-US car firm DaimlerChrysler had been willing to buy the firm, but Fiat patriarch Gianni Agnelli did not want to give up control. But despite the alliance Fiat failed to put itself back on track, continuing to lose money and market share."

The Pentagon revealed earlier this week that it would examine eight other contracts worth $3bn which it believes may have been tainted by Ms Druyun's role in the procurement process. Mr Sears told prosecutors that no other Boeing officials were aware that Ms Druyun was still responsible for major procurement decisions at the time she was discussing a job with Boeing. She subsequently joined the company in January 2003. Boeing was sued by Lockheed Martin after its rival accused it of industrial espionage during a 1998 contract competition. However, analysts believe Boeing may yet face civil charges arising from the scandal. Boeing's corporate ethics have come under scrutiny on several occasions in recent years. Boeing apologised publicly for the affair - although it claimed it did not gain any unfair advantage - and pledged to improve its procedures."
161,"The US telecoms market is consolidating fast, with former long-distance giant AT&T being bought by former subsidiary SBC earlier this year for $16bn. The bankruptcy followed its admission in 2002 that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. Shareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed, while 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Last week, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn. The two firms are expected to seal the deal on Monday morning, according to news agency reports, despite what was thought to be a higher bid from Qwest. MCI is the US's second-biggest long distance firm after AT&T. Buying MCI would give either Qwest or Verizon access to MCI's global network and business-based subscribers."
162,"In contrast, the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. But core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since December 1998, increasing inflationary concerns. US data sparks inflation worries
Wholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January, according to government data. The economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. ""But this Michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that."" ""The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates,"" said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor's. But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the PPI report was ""much less alarming"" than at first glance. Prices for autos and trucks also jumped in January, but Shepherdson said ""it is a good bet these increases won't stick""."
163,"Yukos submitted the suit in Houston, where it filed for bankruptcy. Yukos sues four firms for $20bn
Russian oil firm Yukos has sued four companies for their role in last year's forced state auction of its key oil production unit Yuganskneftegas. It also has vowed to use all legal means at its disposal to go after any firm that tries to buy or take control of its assets. Yukos called the sale illegal and has turned to courts in the US in an effort to regain control of the oil production business. Earlier this month it sued the Russian government for $28.3bn. In Houston, bankruptcy Judge Letitia Clark will start a two-day hearing on 16 February to hear arguments on whether a US court is the proper forum for the case. The threat of legal action from Yukos and its bankruptcy filing in Houston did have an effect on last year's auction, however. Concerned that it would be caught up in a court battle, Gazprom and Gazpromneft withdrew from the auction, and Yuganskneftegas was sold to little-known investment firm Baikal Finance Group. Mr Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, is in prison, having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail."
164,"""It was a little softer than the consensus, but not a real surprise,"" said Gary Thayer, an economist at AG Edwards & Sons. The economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.7% in the July to September period, the Commerce Department said. In an effort to pre-empt rising inflation, the Federal Reserve has pushed through three quarter-point rate rises since June this year, taking borrowing costs to 1.75%. The figure marked an increase on the 3.3% growth recorded in the second quarter, but fell short of the 4.2% rate pencilled in by forecasters. Consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the US. ""The economy regained some traction in the third quarter, but the growth is not robust,"" AG Edwards' Thayer. ""I think that means the Fed can take its time raising rates. We'll probably see one more rate hike before the end of the year."""
165,"A second reading could follow on 16 or 17 March. It says the UK Treasury has allocated £7.5bn ($13.99bn) for the project and that talks with business groups on raising the rest will begin shortly. ""We've always said we are going to introduce a hybrid Bill for Crossrail in the Spring and this remains the case,"" the Department for Transport said on Sunday. The Mail on Sunday's Financial Mail said the £7.5bn of Treasury money was earmarked for spending in £2.5bn instalments in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The new line would go out as far as Maidenhead, Berkshire, to the west of London, and link Heathrow to Canary Wharf via the City. However, he said some impetus may have been provided by the proximity of an election."

Shares in Solidere, the Lebanese company founded by assassinated former prime minister Rafik Hariri, fell 15% in renewed trading in Beirut. ""Solidere should be above $10 but because of this disaster it is falling,"" said one trader. Critics had accused Mr Hariri of using Lebanon's post-war reconstruction drive for his personal financial gain. ""If Solidere drops much lower I would consider it a buying opportunity.

However, it faces stiff competition from rivals and low-cost carriers."
169,"Nationally, house prices rose at an annual rate of 10.7% in December, less than the 13.7% rise the previous month. The average UK house price fell from £180,126 in November to £178,906, reflecting recent Land Registry figures confirming a slowdown in late 2004. December is traditionally a quiet month for the housing market because of Christmas celebrations. The volume of sales between October and December dropped by nearly a quarter from the same period in 2003, the Land Registry said."
170,"Analysts said that the move is aimed at winning over investors opposed to its bid for the London Stock Exchange. Late on Monday, Deutsche Boerse said it would lift its 2004 dividend payment to 70 euro cents (£0.48; $0.98) from 55 euro cents a year earlier. Rival pan-European bourse Euronext is working also on a bid. ""There is a whiff of a sweetener in there,"" Anais Faraj, an analyst at Nomura told the BBC's World Business Report. Deutsche Boerse is ""trying to buy them off in a sense"", he said."
171,"The eight central European states which joined the EU last year will see 4.6% growth, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) said. Publishing its 2005 economic survey, the UNECE said central European countries such as the Czech Republic and Slovenia would provide the backbone of the continent's growth. The global economy will slow in 2005, the UNECE forecasts, due to widespread weakness in consumer demand. The UK economy, on the other hand, is expected to slow in 2005, with growth falling from 3.2% last year to 2.5%. Separately, the Bundesbank warned that Germany's efforts to reduce its budget deficit below 3% of GDP presented ""huge risks"" given that headline economic growth was set to fall below 1% this year. It warned that growth could also be threatened by attempts to reduce the United States' huge current account deficit which, in turn, might lead to significant volatility in exchange rates. Smaller nations such as Cyprus, Ireland and Malta would also be among the continent's best performing economies this year, it said. ""In view of the fragility of factors of domestic growth and the dampening effects of the stronger euro on domestic economic activity and inflation, monetary policy in the euro area is likely to continue to 'wait and see', the organisation said in its report. ""The orderly reversal of the deficit is a major challenge for policy makers in both the United States and other economies,"" it noted."
172,"Both are looking to Russia and China to provide future growth as western European markets are largely mature. Heineken increased its dividend payment by 25% to 40 euro cents, but warned that the continued impact of a weaker dollar and an increased marketing spend may lead to a drop in 2005 net profit. It blamed weak demand in western Europe and currency losses. Despite the dip in profits, Heineken's sales have been improving and total revenue for the year was 10bn euros, up 8.1% from 9.26bn euros in 2003. Heineken, which also owns the Amstel and Murphy's stout brands, said it would also seek to cut costs. This may involve closing down breweries. It had warned in September that the weakening US dollar, which has cut the value of foreign sales, would knock 125m euros off its operating profits. Carlsberg is more optimistic than Heineken about 2005, projecting a 15% rise in net profits for the year. ""We remain cautious about the medium-to-long term outlook for revenue growth across western Europe for a host of economic, social and structural reasons,"" investment bank Merrill Lynch said of Carlsberg."

Yangtze Electric Power, the operator of China's Three Gorges Dam, has said its profits more than doubled in 2004. The firm has benefited from increased demand for electricity at a time when power shortages have hit cities and provinces across the country. That has led to an energy crunch, with demand outstripping supply. Earlier this month, work was halted on an underground power station, and a supply unit on the Three Gorges Dam, as well as a power station on its sister Xiluodu dam because of environmental worries."
174,"Rising sales of household equipment were behind the increase. Despite the general increase in spending in January, French households bought fewer cars in January. The National Statistic Institute (INSEE) added that consumer spending in January rose 3.8% on a year-on-year basis. Economic research group ISAE has said that Italian consumer confidence rose to 104.4 from 103.3, despite a slight deterioration in short-term sentiment. ""It's a growth that will remain fragile and vulnerable to risks like a strong rise in long-term interest rates, tension in the oil price,"" Emmanuel Ferry, from Exane BNP Paribas told Reuters news agency."
175,"The result is that drugs supplied to Africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in Europe; bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of HIV-positive Africans through their government's health care systems. This is a very sensitive area for the big drugs companies. It is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way. The company, GlaxoSmithKline, is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills, currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement. GlaxoSmithKline believes that by coating the pills destined for Africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging, then this trade can be substantially reduced."
176,"Optimism remains over UK housing
The UK property market remains robust despite the recent slowdown, according to mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley and housebuilder George Wimpey. The comments came as it reported a 6% rise in profits to £280.2m ($532m). Overall, B&B said that ""housing market fundamentals remain strong"". Despite the upbeat tone, shares in B&B were down more than 4% at 325.5p in morning trade as analysts worried over future earnings growth. ""Visitor levels and interest in this period have been encouraging and reservations have been at the stronger end of our expectations."" Wimpey said the UK housing market had proved ""challenging"" last year. ""By late summer, the market in general had slowed sharply across the country and showed no real improvement during the autumn,"" it added. However, the first seven weeks of this year had produced promising signs, Wimpey said."

A decision could be reached in December, when the WTO's 148 current members gather for a summit in Hong Kong. While pinpointing several areas in which there are difficulties in the bilateral and multilateral work with Russia, the US said the meeting was ""much more efficient than we've seen for some time"".

The US dollar has dropped against major currencies on concerns that central banks may cut the amount of dollars they hold in their foreign reserves. At the start of the year, the US currency, which had lost 7% against the euro in the final three months of 2004 and had fallen to record lows, staged something of a recovery. ""The comments from Korea came at a time when sentiment towards the dollar was already softening,"" said Ian Gunner, a trader at Mellon Financial.

181,"Analysts said French companies, keen to protect their profit margins at a time of rising energy costs, were reluctant to take on extra staff. ""[Oil prices] will weigh on consumer spending in the short term, and potentially on confidence,"" he said. ""[The unemployment figures] show the main problem of the French economy: we have growth but without an improvement in employment,"" said Marc Touati, an economist at Natexis Banques Populaires. Many economists have urged the government to stimulate employment by reducing non-wage payroll costs, and by scrapping restrictions on working hours. ""Politicians must have the will and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms, otherwise in five or ten years, it will be too late."" That is above the projected eurozone average of just above 2%."

But Germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such Hungary or China. In Germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment. The Government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system, but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers, says Helmut Schneider, director of the Institute for the Study of Labour at Bonn University. Boss Henk Addink blames the low growth rate in Europe for the lack of orders closer to home. If we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half,"" he says.

New York Senator Charles Schumer said he was told by the Senate Rules Committee that the tapes were probably stolen from a commercial plane. But although there was no evidence of criminal activity, the bank said, the Secret Service - a federal agency whose brief includes investigations of serious financial crime - is said to be looking into the loss. ""We, with federal law authorities, have done a very robust, thorough investigation on this and neither we nor they would make the statement lightly that we believe those tapes to be lost,"" Alexandra Tower, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina-based bank, told Time magazine.

Snapping up MCI would give the buyer access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. Qwest may spark MCI bidding war
US phone company Qwest has said it will table a new offer for MCI after losing out to larger rival Verizon, setting the scene for a possible bidding war. Both company boards have backed the deal, but regulators will still need to give their approval. Also, MCI, while trading under the name Worldcom, became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in US history after admitting that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits.

Mr Marchionne, who only joined the company last year, said Fiat Auto was now the ""principal focus"" of his attention. The car business, best known for its Alfa Romeo marque, is expected to make a loss of about 800m euros in 2004. ""A profound cultural transformation is underway following a management reorganisation that has delivered a more agile and efficient structure,"" he added.

190,"The painkillers - called COX-2 inhibitors - are sold under brand names such as Celebrex and Vioxx. Putting Vioxx back on the shelves is likely to boost profits at Merck and make easier any legal battles with people who claim to have been injured by the drug, analysts said. Merck's shares tumbled more than 10% on the news and the company has had to set aside millions of dollars to cover the cost of Vioxx-related litigation. Facing stem criticism for its handling of the Vioxx case, the FDA said on Tuesday that it will create an independent body to oversee the safety of drugs already in the market place. Alarm bells were rung by a research note called Approve which showed that the risk of heart attack and stroke doubled in patients who had been taking the drug for at least 18 months. Merck's announcement of a possible reintroduction of Vioxx caught analysts by surprise. He went on to say that things have since changed in the light of new reports. Merck's head of research Peter Kim said that it withdrew Vioxx ""based on the information that was available to us at the time, knowing there were alternative therapies"". ""Given this new information, its is not clear that the cardiovascular risk observed in Approve makes Vioxx unique in the class of similar drugs marketed in the US,"" Mr Kim explained. The European Medicines Agency also said doctors should be ""cautious"" about giving the drugs to patients who have risk factors for heart disease."
191,"That meant Moscow would not have to adhere to US rulings in the Yukos case. Yugansk was sold to help pay off a $27.5bn (£14.5bn) back tax bill. Yukos says a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold, since it has a US subsidiary and local bank accounts. Yukos has claimed it sought help in the US because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection. Deutsche Bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by Yukos. The US court's jurisdiction has been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft, a former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft. It had agreed to loan Gazpromneft the money to bid for Yugansk.

It made a loss of 27.2m euros in the first half of the current fiscal year and said that total debts will increase to 134.7m euros by the middle of 2006 unless a restructuring plan is pushed through.

UK mortgage lending showed a ""post-Christmas lull"" in January, indicating a slowing housing market, lenders have said. At the same time, the British Bankers' Association (BBA) said lending was ""weaker"". Overall, the BBA said mortgage lending rose by £4bn in January, a far smaller increase than the £5.1bn seen in December.

The Treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 2008. Should the cycle end a year earlier, then the chances improve to ""50/50"". Either way, fiscal tightening is needed, NIESR said. It claimed revenues were likely to be £6bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts. Other than its warning on possible tax hikes, the NIESR report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy. ""Spending plans have been set out until 2008 and they are fully affordable."" GDP is expected at 3.2% in 2004, and 2.8% in both 2005 and 2006.

The controversial sell-off of a Ukrainian steel mill to a relative of the former president was illegal, a court has ruled. Analysts have suggested that the government needs to avoid the impression of an open-ended list, so as to preserve investor confidence. Mr Yushchenko had previously said the list would be limited to 30-40 enterprises.

Cairn's share price rose 300% last year after a number of oil finds, but its shares were hit in December following a disappointing drilling update. The company also said it now believed the development area would be able to produce oil for more than 25 years.

President Bush's government, which has been a strong supporter of the 40-year-old trade embargo on Cuba, introduced even tighter restrictions on Cuba in May. ""I think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash,"" says Jose Barrionuevo, head of strategy for Latin American emerging markets for Barclays Capital. Cubans living in the US are now limited to one visit to Cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives. ""The ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the US government to suffocate our country,"" he said. However, many of Cuban's poorest citizens could be worse off as a result. Critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards, reflecting the Cuban president's desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise. ""It is intended to be a permanent measure but I am not sure it can last too long."" In recent weeks, Cuba has suffered its most serious power cuts in a decade and there have also been water shortages in parts of the island. The tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading, Mr Barrionuevo said."

Novartis said that it would merge a number of departments, adding that there may be job cuts. ""The strong growth outlook for Sandoz, which will create jobs, is expected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work force,"" the firm said in a statement. However, not all analysts were initially convinced about the deal. Producers such as Sandoz can copy the branded products usually after their patent protection expires and can sell them more cheaply as they do not have to pay research and development cost. ""This is a very expensive acquisition,"" Birgit Kuhlhoff, from Sal Oppenheim investment bank, told Reuters. ""I find it strange that they are making acquisitions in exactly those markets where they suffered price pressure."""

A number of large MCI shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision, saying that Verizon's offer, made up of cash, shares and dividends, undervalued the company. MCI's directors have backed Verizon, despite it tabling less money. MCI shareholder sues to stop bid
A shareholder in US phone firm MCI has taken legal action to halt a $6.75bn (£3.6bn) buyout by telecoms giant Verizon, hoping to get a better deal. Chief executive Michael Capellas spent last week meeting with shareholders in an effort to win their backing. However, the firm - now renamed MCI - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last April. Friday's lawsuit argues that the Verizon offer makes no provision for future growth prospects and that consolidation in the US phone industry will put a premium on MCI's network, assets and clients. In 2002, investors in the then-named Worldcom lost millions when the company filed for bankruptcy following an accounting scandal."

Deutsche Boerse investors unhappy with its London Stock Exchange bid will have no chance to throw out the exchange's management until May, Reuters says. ""We are long-term investors and are experienced in removing management. We are not scared to take this to its conclusion this time,"" Atticus' David Slager told the Sunday Times. The Sunday Times reported that hedge funds TCI and Atticus were planning to demand the removal of the group's chairman and chief executive. However, Deutsche Boerse told Reuters: ""TCI's request for the removal of the supervisory board will be considered at the annual general meeting on May 25."" The group owns more than 5% of Deutsche - more than enough to demand an extraordinary general meeting to call on shareholders to oust the German exchange's management. Many commentators have suggested a bidding war between the two could break out."
203,"Vice-President Dick Cheney said the budget was the ""tightest"" so far. Mr Cheney admitted that the budget was the toughest of the Bush Presidency but argued it was ""fair and responsible"". About 150 federal programs could be cut or axed altogether as part of a $2.5 trillion (£1.3 trillion) package aimed at curbing the giant US budget deficit. Also not featuring in the proposals is the cost of funding the administration's radical proposed overhaul of social security provision. Most controversially, the government is seeking to cut the Medicaid budget, which provides health care to the nation's poorest, by $45bn and to reduce farm subsidies by $587m. Education, environmental protection and transport initiatives are set to be scaled back as a first step towards reducing the deficit to $230bn by 2009. Defence spending will rise, however, while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in Iraq. ""With the deficits that we are now running, I am glad the president is coming over with a very austere budget,"" he said. Some expects believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5bn trillion over a twenty year period. However, Democratic Senator Kent Conrad said the proposals exposed the country to huge financial commitments beyond 2009."

205,"With-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. Standard Life cuts policy bonuses
Standard Life, Europe's largest mutual life insurer, has cut bonuses for with-profit policyholders. The insurer blamed the cuts on poor share returns and low interest rates. The insurer argued that shares outperformed other investments over the long term and that policyholders would feel the benefit when the stock market recovered. John Gill, managing director of the insurer's life and pensions division, said that a strong stock market recovery in the past two years had only ""partly compensated for losses during 2001 and 2002"". In addition, low interest rates meant that ""long-term investment returns are well below historic levels"", Mr Gill added. However, Mr Gill maintained that with-profits continued to perform well over the long term. ""Our payouts continue to stand up well against other types of long-term investments over similar periods,"" he said."
206,"EMI shares hit by profit warning
Shares in music giant EMI have sunk by more than 16% after the firm issued a profit warning following disappointing sales and delays to two album releases. It blamed poor sales since Christmas and delays to the releases of new albums by Coldplay and Gorillaz. EMI said music sales for the year to March will fall 8-9% from the year before, with profits set to be 15% lower than analysts had expected. ""Therefore, for the full year, at constant currency, EMI Music's sales are now expected to be 8% to 9% lower than the prior year."" The company said it expected profits to be about £138m ($259.8m). Commenting on the delay to the release of the Coldplay and Gorillaz albums, Mr Levy said that ""creating and marketing music is not an exact science and cannot always coincide with our reporting periods"". ""While this rescheduling and recent softness is disappointing, it does not change my views of the improving health of the global recorded music industry,"" he added."

They added an extra 6.4% to $27.24 in electronic trading after the trading session had finished. The move may be a precursor to a full takeover, with analysts saying that a better-known international firm may also now show an interest in Sina. ""There could still be some potential parties that could still counter bid,"" said Wallace Cheung, an analyst at DBS Vickers. ""Even though Shanda has 20% of Sina, they still have quite a long way to take full control."""

The price of gold has fallen after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it will look at ways of using its gold reserves to provide debt relief. The IMF has 3,217 tonnes of gold, or about 113.5m ounces. Bringing the book price of the gold in line with market value would boost the IMF's balance sheet, giving it more money to distribute. ""The US is not convinced that's the necessary way to do it,"" said Treasury Under Secretary John Taylor. This idea has been put forward before, but there now seems to be a more committed political drive to address the issue of global poverty. Mr Brown said the meeting would be remembered as ""the 100% debt relief summit"". Canada, a key gold producer, also expressed reservations."

As a result, hopes that approval of the deal may be fast-tracked have disappeared, the paper said. According to the FT, the regulator has been annoyed by Rover's decision to talk publicly about the deal and the intense speculation which has ensued about what it will mean for Rover's future.

""Kirkcaldy, the birthplace in 1723 of Adam Smith and, by extension, of modern economics, is also of course, where your chancellor was reared. Dr Greenspan, 79, who has been in the UK to attend the G7 meeting in London, said the world could never repay the debt of gratitude it owed to Smith, whose genius he compared to that of Mozart. He continued: ""Smith reached far beyond the insights of his predecessors to frame a global view of how market economics, just then emerging, worked. Dr Greenspan was invited by Chancellor Gordon Brown, whose minister father John used to preach at the St Bryce Kirk church. ""I am led to ponder to what extent the chancellor's renowned economic and financial skills are the result of exposure to the subliminal intellect-enhancing emanation in this area."" ""The incredible insights of a handful of intellectuals of the Enlightenment - especially with Smith toiling in the environs of Kirkcaldy - created the modern vision of people free to choose and to act according to their individual self-interest,"" he said. Dr Greenspan - who became chairman of the Federal Reserve for an unprecedented fifth term in June 2004 - will step down in January next year."
213,"Economy 'strong' in election year
UK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report. The rise is due, in part, to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity. The only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election, BDO said. Its BDO's output index - which predicts GDP movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for January, implying GDP growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005. ""The UK is looking strong going into the general election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary pressures,"" said Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward. ""Growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services."""
214,"In a speech at the London School of Economics, William Donaldson promised ""several initiatives"". The Act comes into force in mid-2005. It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts. The 300-shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy, a delisting. Seen as particularly costly to implement, Section 404 obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm's internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts. Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would ""continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements"". ""We should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections"" without turning the US market into ""one with no exit"", he said. He revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the Act's least popular measure - Section 404 - for foreign firms. A delegation of European firms visited the SEC in December to press for change, the Financial Times reported. Air China picked the London Stock Exchange for its secondary listing in its $1.07bn (£558m) stock market debut last month."

""We have trust in this business and want to defend it by law,"" he continued, adding that any review would focus on ""dozens of companies, not hundreds or thousands"". Vice-Prime Minister Oleg Rybachuk called on the EU to recognise the steps that Ukraine was taking, fearing that should the country not be rewarded for its efforts there may be a backlash against closer relations with Brussels.

Tim Crawford, Group Economist at Halifax, said: ""The value of the private housing stock continues to grow and the family home remains, by a large margin, the most valuable asset of the majority of households in the UK."""
239,"Economy 'strong' in election year
UK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report. The rise is due, in part, to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity. The only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election, BDO said. Its BDO's output index - which predicts GDP movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for January, implying GDP growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005. ""The UK is looking strong going into the general election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary pressures,"" said Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward. ""Growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services."""
240,"Mr Brown said it was a major breakthrough for the international organisations to offer up to 100% multilateral debt relief - ""the vast bulk"" of money owed by the poorest countries. He added: ""It is the richest countries hearing the voices of the poor."" ""The US is completely committed to poverty reduction and providing financing to do that,"" he said. But US Treasury Under-Secretary John Taylor said the US could not support the IFF because of its ""legislative process"". ""But this particular mechanism does not work for the United States. The UK has made poverty in the poorest nations a key theme for its 2005 presidency of the Group of Eight (G8), which comprises the G7 and Russia. It works for other countries, and that is fine."" But South Africa Finance Minister Trevor Manuel told the BBC's Talking Point programme what was needed was one approach, with all wealthy nations on board. Mr Brown said G7 ministers had agreed to defer debt interest payments and repayments for some countries affected by the tsunami until the end of 2005. The G8 countries will meet at Gleneagles in Scotland."
241,"""Manchester United are a debt-free company. However, Mr Glazer's latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by £200m. We don't want to fall into debt and we don't need to fall into debt,"" Shareholders United's Sean Bones told the BBC. Q&A: Malcolm Glazer and Man Utd
The battle for control of Manchester United has taken another turn after the club confirmed it had received a fresh takeover approach from US business tycoon Malcolm Glazer. ""No-one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table."" In October 2004, Manchester United said they had received a ""preliminary approach"", which turned out to have come from Mr Glazer. ""Mr Glazer's bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment. ""If that's the case then Mr Glazer might well secure their support - if he does, this bid could well go ahead."" Indeed it is. Through their Cubic Expression vehicle they own 28.9% of the club."

243,"Market unfazed by Aurora setback
As the Aurora limped back to its dock on 20 January, a blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe. No-one, however, seems to have told the stock markets. The warning of a five-cent hit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the world's biggest investment banks had upped its target for Carnival's share price, from £35 to £36.20. Why the mismatch between the public perception and the market's response? ""It was clearly a source of uncertainty for the company - it was a long cruise, after all. Despite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, Aurora is just one vessel in a large Carnival fleet, the UK's P&O Princess group having been merged into the much larger US firm in 2003. But the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one-off events."" ""While not common, cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry,"" wrote analysts from Citigroup Smith Barney in a note to clients on Friday. Similarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. And with Carnival remaining the market leader, it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated Aurora in the future."
244,"US politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy. That will be the shock. The trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt, which will grow in 10 years, by conservative estimates, to more than half the nation's total annual output. How did this happen? Reducing domestic spending, or eliminating ""waste, fraud and abuse"" is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem. The US Government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of Japan and China, among other nations. But serious savings can only be found where the big money is. It's fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed. Finally, blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned. There is no good reason to fixate on it, anyway."
245,"The firm was forced into bankruptcy, the largest in US history. Mr Sullivan, WorldCom's former number two, is the government's chief witness in its case against Mr Ebbers. Prosecutors have alleged that Mr Ebbers, 63, directed Mr Sullivan to hide the true state of the company's finances by providing false information to the firm's accountants. Mr Ebbers has denied multiple charges of conspiracy and fraud. ""He [Ebbers] has got a hands-on grasp of financial information,"" Mr Sullivan told a New York court. ""We did not talk about these adjustments and the information was false."" ""He would talk about that there were more coffee filters than coffee bags and that means employees are taking coffee home,"" he said. Mr Sullivan said his former boss knew more about accounting matters than many chief financial officers and described him as ""detail-oriented"". ""We needed to cut expenses. We needed to cut a lot more than coffee expenses."""
246,"The firm said strong demand outside western Europe and the good performance of its Megane range lifted its results. Chairman Louis Schweitzer said 2004 had been a ""great year"" for the firm. France's second largest carmaker enjoyed a healthy 43% rise in net profits to 2.4bn euros ($3.1bn; £2.9bn) as sales rose 8% to 40.7bn euros. Japanese carmaker Nissan - in which Renault owns a 44% stake - contributed 1.7bn euros in net income over the year. Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn is to succeed Mr Schweitzer at the head of Renault later this year. ""In a sluggish market and an environment impacted by the rise in raw material prices, Renault intends to continue to grow its global sales,"" the company said in a statement."
247,"House prices were 11.8% higher on the year in the last quarter of 2004, down from 16.3% in the July-to-September quarter, the Land Registry said. The government figures are the first official confirmation of falls in the market at the end of 2004. Land Registry figures are less up to date than those of banks and building societies, since they record completions not mortgage approvals. Although the figures point to a slowdown in the market, the most recent surveys from Nationwide and Halifax have indicated the market may be undergoing a revival. In the capital, the volume of sales fell by 23% from 36,185 in 2003 to 28,041 for the same period in 2004. The biggest annual gains were made in Wales, where house prices were up by 23% in the fourth quarter. Members of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee will make their latest decision on interest rates on Thursday."
248,"The state department's planned budget would rise to just under $23bn - a fraction of the defence department's request - including almost $6bn to assist US allies in the ""war on terror"". The spending plan for the year beginning 1 October is banking on a healthy US economy to boost government income by 6.1% to $2.18 trillion. Mr Bush has promised to halve the US's massive budget deficit within five years. A key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of funding the administration's proposed radical overhaul of Social Security, the pensions programme on which many Americans rely for their retirement income. Concern over the level of the reserve, created in 1970s, has led to rises in oil prices over the past year. But the budget is still the tightest yet under Mr Bush's presidency. ""In order to sustain our economic expansion, we must continue pro-growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government,"" Mr Bush said in his budget message to Congress. But its estimates depend on the tax cuts not being made permanent, in line with the promise when they were passed that they would ""sunset"", or disappear, in 2010. Most Republicans, however, want them to stay in place. And the figures also rely on the ""Social Security trust fund"" - the money set aside to cover the swelling costs of retirement pensions - being offset against the main budget deficit."
249,"IBM pioneered the desktop PC market in the early 1980s, although strategic mis-steps helped lose it its early dominance. The firm is in the international spotlight after last year signing a deal to buy the PC division of personal computer pioneer IBM. If the $1.75bn agreement Lenovo signed with IBM on 8 December goes through, it will mark the end of an era. But Western firms such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard are also mounting a more solid fight for market share in China, and Lenovo's sales were down 3.7% by revenue to HK$6.31bn. Chinese PC sales have risen by a fifth in each of the past two years, but are now growing more slowly. The company is still by far the biggest player in China, with more than a quarter of the market."
250,"The largest US telephone company Verizon has previously held preliminary merger discussions with MCI, Reuters quoted sources as saying. MCI shares climb on takeover bid
Shares in US phone company MCI have risen on speculation that it is in takeover talks. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Qwest has bid $6.3bn (£3.4bn) for MCI. Buying MCI would give Qwest, a local phone service provider, access to MCI's global network and business-based subscribers. Shares in MCI, which changed its name from Worldcom when it emerged from bankruptcy, were up 2.4% at $20.15. MCI also offers internet services. The scandal was a key factor in a global slide in share prices and the reverberations are still being felt today. Shareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed, while 20,000 workers lost their jobs."
251,"At the time, Ofcom offered BT the choice of change or splitting into two. The move comes after telecom regulator Ofcom said in November that the firm must offer competitors ""real equality of access to its phone lines"". BT offers equal access to rivals
BT has moved to pre-empt a possible break-up of its business by offering to cut wholesale broadband prices and open its network to rivals. It added that it plans to invest £10bn in the next five years to create a ""21st Century network"". To meet the growing demand for greater bandwidth, BT said it would begin trials in April with a view to launching higher-speed services nationally from the autumn. ""The big question now is whether the industry, and particularly Ofcom feels BT's proposals go far enough ...Now the real negotiation begins,"" director of telecoms research Tony Lavender said. ""BT has a critical role to play, and today we are making a set of far-reaching proposals towards that framework,"" he said. ""BT has been challenged to play fair and its plans will introduce a level playing field. Chris Panayis, managing director of ISP Freedom2surf said that it would make the situation clearer for business. ""Ofcom needs to return to regulation of the wholesale broadband service [IPStream] and provide more robust rules for local loop unbundling if consumers are to see the benefits of increased competition and infrastructure investment."""
252,"Jobs growth still slow in the US
The US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years. The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000. He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November's Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover. As a result, job creation became a key issue in last year's election. However, when adding December and January's figures, the administration's first term jobs record ended in positive territory. ""It suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace,"" said Rick Egelton, deputy chief economist at BMO Financial Group. ""That means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers."""
253,"According to the Financial Times, chief operating officer Peter Chernin said that News Corp is ""kicking the tyres of pretty much all video games companies"". We ""would like to get into it"". The days of arcade classics such as Space Invaders, Pac-Man and Donkey Kong are long gone. France's Ubisoft, one of Europe's biggest video game publishers, has been trying to remain independent since Electronic Arts announced plans to buy 19.9% of the firm. Mr Chernin, however, told the FT that News Corp was finding it difficult to identify a suitable target. ""We are struggling with the gap between companies like Electronic Arts (EA), which comes with a high price tag, and the next tier of companies,"" he explained during a conference in Phoenix, Arizona. Some of the games industry's main players have recently been looking to consolidate their position by making acquisitions. ""These may be too focused on one or two product lines."""
254,"According to the Pensions Commission's report 12 million working people are not saving enough for their retirement. Reform could reduce poverty by aiding people with broken employment records. The PPI added that once the state system was reformed the government should look at options to overhaul private and workplace pensions. As a result, living standards could fall for the next generation of UK pensioners."
255,"The advance, the second-fastest in Asia after China, was led by growth of 13.1% in the key manufacturing sector. That was up from the third quarter, when it fell 3.0%, but was well below analyst forecasts. ""I am surprised at the weak fourth quarter number. The main drag came from electronics,"" said Lian Chia Liang, economist at JP Morgan Chase. Singapore's economy had contracted over the summer, weighed down by soaring oil prices."
256,"These valuations were the product of decades of inflation which, as recently as 2001, was as high as 70%. The change will see the end of such dizzyingly-high denominations as five million lira - enough for a short taxi ride - and the 20m note, worth $15. From that point, the one-million lira note will become the new one-lira coin. The government hopes the change will be seen as a promise of growing economic stability as Turkey embarks on the long process of trying to join the European Union. The Turkish economy teetered on the brink of collapse in 2001 when the lira plunged in value and two million people lost their jobs. Meanwhile, the economy is expanding at a healthy rate, with 7.9% growth expected in 2004. These tough measures have borne fruit. ""The Turkish lira has been like funny money,"" Tevfik Aksoy, chief Turkish economist for Deutsche Bank, told Associated Press. ""Now at least in cosmetic terms it will look like real currency."" However, some do not feel quite so happy about seeing the nominal value of their investments reduced."
257,"It has earmarked 100 trillion won ($96bn) for the first six months of 2005, 60% of its total annual budget. The government's main problems are ""slumping consumption and a contraction in the construction industry"". In 2004, growth will be between 4.7% and 4.8%, the ministry said. Not everyone is convinced the plan will work. It aims to create 400,000 jobs and will focus on infrastructure and home building, as well as providing public firms with money to hire new workers. The problem facing South Korea is that many consumers are reeling from the effects of a credit bubble that only recently burst. ""The focus will be on job creation and economic recovery, given that unfavourable domestic and global conditions are likely to dog the Korean economy in 2005,"" the ministry said. It also pledged to look at ways of helping families on low incomes. The government voiced concern about the effect of redundancies in the building trade. It also will look at real estate tax system."
258,"Doubts about the strength of the US recovery and overheating of the Chinese economy do however pose risks for 2005. Nevertheless, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) still forecasts growth of 4% for 2005. Both organisations also warned that high oil prices raise the risk of either inflation or recession. ECLAC also said that the six largest Latin American economies (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela) grew by more than 3% for only the second time in 20 years. Chinese and US economic strength helped boost exports, as did strong demand for agricultural and mining products. Regional blocs as well as free trade agreements with the US contributed to the region's strong performance, the IADB said."
259,"Thailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome. Investors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas were so under-developed that the tragedy would have little impact on Asia's listed firms. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. ""Our nation is in peril here,"" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. ""[But] it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense."" ""It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,"" he said. ""In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes."" Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage."
260,"Bigger markets further afield have barely twitched. Those that are listed have suffered: Confifi Hotel Holdings, a small Sri Lankan tourism firm, has halved in value this week. And where insurance certainly is in place - in, for example, the many tourist complexes affected - the costs will be borne in far-away corners of the global reinsurance market, rather than landing locally. But there are winners as well as losers. In fact, the markets are being perfectly rational. The need to find money to replace lost and damaged property is balanced by the beneficial effect of reconstruction activity; there is rarely, the centre says, any sort of rebuilding boom, but in most cases sizeable indirect losses are avoided. A study of the 1993 Des Moines floods, from the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware*, found that 70% of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster, and another 18% felt themselves better off. ""It is not that the broking community is indifferent to disasters or feelings,"" one Bombay trader said this week. ""But the reaction would have been seen if business had been affected. Business sense probably tends to overrule everything else."""
261,"""It came at the worst possible time,"" said Hans Goetti, a Singapore-based fund manager. Asian quake hits European shares
Shares in Europe's leading reinsurers and travel firms have fallen as the scale of the damage wrought by tsunamis across south Asia has become apparent. Travel-related shares dropped in Europe, with companies such as Germany's TUI and Lufthansa and France's Club Mediterranne sliding. ""That also has to do with the fact that the damage is very widely spread geographically."" ""It's still too early for concrete damage figures,"" Swiss Re's spokesman Floiran Woest told Associated Press. In Asian markets, adjustments were made quickly to account for lower earnings and the cost of repairs. The Thai baht lost 0.3% against the US currency, trading at 39.10. The unfolding scale of the disaster in south Asia had little immediate impact on US shares, however. Thai Airways shed almost 4%. Singapore Airlines dropped 2.6%."
262,"Eighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the Financial Services Authority (FSA). But when the stock market collapsed in 2000, the products left thousands of investors out of pocket. Firms involved were presented with 780 files of evidence detailing 27,000 taped conversations and over 70 interviews. The paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company, the FSA said. ""This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome,"" Rob McIvor, FSA spokesman, told BBC News. Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service. The FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to £350m in compensation."
263,"The German exchange said it had held ""constructive, professional and friendly"" talks with the LSE. But Euronext declined to comment after the talks ended on Friday. Speculation is mounting that the Germans may raise their bid to £1.5bn. There was speculation Euronext would use Friday's meeting as an opportunity to take advantage of growing disquiet over Deutsche Boerse's own plans for dominance over the London market. So far, however, neither have tabled a formal bid. But a deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange. ""The works council has expressed concerns that the equities and derivatives trade could be managed from London in the future,"" Reuters news agency reports a union source as saying. Commentators believe Deutsche Boerse, which has now formally asked German authorities to approve its plan to buy the LSE, may offer to sell Clearstream to gain shareholder approval. This would weaken the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings."
264,"Marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the SEC investigation. The SEC's investigation into so-called related party transactions includes dealings in the Trident Funds, managed by MMC Capital, the company's private equity firm. Prosecutors allege that Marsh - the world's biggest insurance broker - and other US insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover. Since that inquiry was launched in October, Marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board. The uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies - Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch - to downgrade Marsh in recent weeks. Marsh's new chief executive, Michael Cherkasky, is trying to negotiate a settlement with Mr Spitzer."
265,"Could Yukos be a blessing in disguise? ""An increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive, even accounting for increased levels of taxation,"" the authors say. The net result, the authors say, is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness. But shareholders benefited hugely: Sibneft started to pay dividends - $53m in 2000 and almost $1bn in 2001 - and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds. Since then, the Russian stock market has more than trebled in value, a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach. Does this analysis make sense? In part, certainly. As far as most commentators are concerned, the state is pursuing Yukos out of a political vendetta, rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude. In fact, the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in Russia - connections often greased by bribery - blur the apparently antagonistic relationship. But the authors' model does not quite cover all the complexities."
266,"According to a registration document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Nasdaq Stock Market plans to raise $100m (£52m) from the sale. Some observers see this as another step closer to a full public listing. The company first sold shares in private placements during 2000 and 2001. It was the most potent symbol of the 1990s internet and telecoms boom, nose-diving after the bubble burst. The Nasdaq is made up shares in technology firms and other companies with high growth potential."
267,"Giving financial gifts to children
Your child or grandchild may want the latest toy this Christmas, but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future? Gifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact. Parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to £1,200 a year, which will grow free of income and capital gains tax. Therefore, it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the Child Trust Fund which is tax free, with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual £1,200 limit being directed to a deposit account. The parent or guardian will be responsible for the Bonds and will receive notification of the purchase. These are single shares that give the return of an underlying index (so are really another form of tracker). Another favourite solution is Premium Bonds. For larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of a suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income. With the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account, they make great presents. One of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term - more than ten years - which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares."
268,"Air China plans to raise $1bn (£514m) from the flotation. No further details of the share price or number of shares were given. Air China in $1bn London listing
China's national airline is to make its overseas stock market debut with a dual listing in London and Hong Kong, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) has said. It opened an Asia-Pacific office in Hong Kong last month. ""We are delighted that Air China has chosen London for its listing outside China,"" said LSE chief executive Clara Furse. ""The London Stock Exchange offers ambitious Chinese companies access to the world's most international equity market combined with high regulatory and corporate governance standards,"" she said. A spokesman for the LSE said: ""We've been engaged with them (Air China) for about 18 months, two years now."" Air China's long-awaited flotation is part of a strategy to modernise a dozen state-owned carriers, which have been reorganised into three groups under Air China, China Southern and China Eastern. The shares will be denominated in Hong Kong dollars."
269,"US light crude traded in New York lost more than $2 to $43.25, its lowest close since 10 September. The news calmed worries about winter shortages. The price of both benchmark crudes has dropped 12% in two days. Opec nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild US stocks hit by supply disruptions after Hurricane Ivan in September. The long-awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. ""Mother Nature is going to be huge in the next several weeks,"" said Kyle Cooper, at Citigroup Global Markets. The falls were triggered when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago. ""Long term I think we're headed to $30-35 but I don't think we're doing that yet. We have a lot of winter left."" ."
270,"The club - which is currently listed on the smaller Ofex share exchange - is due to move into its new 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium at Ashburton Grove for the start of the 2006/07 season. Speaking at the Soccerex football business forum in Dubai, he said a full listing was ""one of the options"" for funding after the club moves to its new stadium. ""When the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review,"" Mr Dein said. ""Listing would be one option, but we are flexible and no decisions have been made on that issue yet. The club is funding its move to Ashburton Grove through a number of sources, including debt from banks, from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors, and from the sale of surplus property, including its Highbury Stadium. Mr Dein said that, although television money and coverage had driven the English game forward in the past 10 years, he feared there might now be too many games being shown. ""We want to be in the best financial health - maybe clubs can do it (listing), Manchester United have been a success."" ""Television has been the driving force over the past 10 years... but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the world's leading league competition. ""I think we have practically reached saturation point... sometimes I think less is more."""
271,"The main Bovespa index on the Sao Paolo Stock Exchange closed at 24,997 points on Friday, topping the previous record market close reached the previous day. Brazil is recovering from last year's recession - its worst in a decade. The market's buoyancy reflects optimism about the Brazilian economy, which could grow by as much as 4.5% in 2004. Brazil's currency, the real, also rose to its highest level against the dollar in more than two years on Friday. Investors were deeply suspicious of President da Silva, a former trade union leader who campaigned on a programme of extensive land redistribution and a large rise in the minimum wage. ""There should be more space for gains until the end of the year, somewhere up to 27,000 points,"" said Paschoal Tadeu Buonomo, head of equities trading at brokers TOV. Investors have praised his handling of the economy as foreign investment has risen, unemployment has fallen and inflation has been brought under control. ""Government accounts are in surplus, we have a current account surplus and inflation is under control."""
272,"The latest to pitch in has been President George W Bush himself, who told the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Chile that he remained committed to halving the budget deficit. On Monday afternoon, the euro was close to an all-time high against the dollar at above $1.30. And Mr Greenspan warned Asian states could soon stop funding the US deficit. But he also said that the rate was entirely up to the markets - a signal which traders took as advice to sell the dollar. Some had looked to the G20 meeting for direction. And last week US Treasury Secretary John Snow told an audience in the UK that the policy remained unaltered. At present, much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to Asian states such as Japan and China, since the dollar is seen as the world's reserve currency. For the US government, letting the dollar drift is a useful short-term fix. But already they are turning more cautious - an auction of debt in August found few takers. ""It seems persuasive that, given the size of the US current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point,"" he said."
273,"Google shares have risen since but fell $12.33 on Tuesday to close at $172.55. There were fears that the potential increase of shares in circulation from Tuesday would ease demand for stock. Selling the shares could turn many of Google's workers into millionaires. Sales surged to $805.9m in the third quarter, up from $393.9m a year earlier. However, analysts say they expected most shareholders would be holding back from selling all their shares immediately, as Google's good performance and future growth potential means demand will hold. Google's main service - its internet search - is free to users, so the firm makes much of its money from selling advertising space linked to the words for which its users search."
274,"""With the figures apparently the worst we've seen in the post-war period, these numbers are very charged politically,"" said Christian Jasperneite, an economist with MM Warburg. Changes to the way the statistics are compiled partly explain the jump of 572,900 in the numbers. But the figures are embarrassing for the government. On Wednesday, the German Federal Labour Agency said the jobless total had reached 5.037 million in January, which takes the jobless rate to 12.1%. ""They could well put an end to the recent renaissance we've seen by the SPD [the ruling Social Democrats] in the polls, and with state elections due in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, they may have an adverse effect on the government's chances there."" It added that government reforms, including unpopular benefit cuts, do not go far enough. The bad winter weather also took its toll, as key sectors such as the construction sector laid off workers."
275,"India power shares jump on debut
Shares in India's largest power producer, National Thermal Power Corp (NTPC) have risen 13% on their stock market debut. The share offer was eleven times oversubscribed. ""It is a good investment bet,"" said Suhas Naik, an investment analyst from ING Mutual Fund. ""Power needs in India are set to rise and NTPC will benefit from that."" The government's partial sell-off of NTPC is part of a controversial programme to privatise state-run firms."
276,"The economy is growing fast, they insist. Inflation is under control. A key factor for EU decision makers should be whether or not Turkey has met its economic criteria. As Turkey's gross domestic output (GDP) is set to grow by 6% per year on average, its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020. By 2014, one in four Turks - or about 18 million people - will be aged 14 or less. The point of all this has been to convince Europe's decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the EU, allowing Turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits. But only over time. ""Turkey will not be a burden for the EU budget."" ""There is no question that although Turkey is doing much better than in the past, it remains quite vulnerable,"" says Michael Deppler, director of the IMF's European Department. But economics is not a science."
277,"SBC said 5,125 positions would go as a result of network efficiencies. The takeover was announced on Monday. SBC currently employs 163,000 people while AT&T employs 47,000. The deal will be financed with $15bn of shares as well as a $1bn special dividend paid to AT&T shareholders. Both also have data network businesses. SBC and AT&T said estimated cost savings of at least $2bn from 2008 were a main driver for the merger."
278,"German bidder in talks with LSE
Deutsche Boerse bosses have held ""constructive, professional and friendly"" talks with the London Stock Exchange (LSE), its chief has said. However, rival suitor Euronext also upped the ante in the bid battle. Ahead of talks with the LSE on Friday, the pan-European bourse said it may be prepared to make its offer in cash. In a statement on Thursday, Euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but added that: ""There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made."" Among sweeteners reported to have been discussed by Mr Seifert with Ms Furse were plans to move the management of its cash and Eurex derivatives market to London, as well as two members of its executive board. ""It is not just the headquarters of the Boerse but also important market segments that must stay permanently in Frankfurt. This has special importance for the business activities of the banks and the consultants,"" he said. Local government officials in Frankfurt's state of Hessen have also spoken out against the move. ""It is our wish that the headquarters stay here to maintain Frankfurt's standing as the number one financial centre in continental Europe,"" Alois Rhiel, its minister for economic affairs added."
279,"Amex shares up on spin-off news
Shares in American Express surged more than 8% on Tuesday after it said it was to spin off its less profitable financial advisory subsidiary. Over the years it has delivered poor profits and even some losses. ""This is an excellent move by American Express to focus on its core businesses, and sell off a laggard division, which has been a problem for quite some time,"" said Marquis Investment Research analyst Phil Kain. The US credit card to travel services giant said off-loading American Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) would boost its profitability."
280,"Regular annual bonus rates on former Axa Equity & Law with-profits policies are to be cut from 2% to 1% for 2004. The rest will know their fate in March. The cuts on Axa's policies will mean a policyholder who had invested £50 a month into an endowment policy for the past 25 years would see a final maturity payout of £46,998. With-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. ""The stock market has grown over the past 18 months, however not enough to undo the damage that occurred during 2001 and 2002,"" Axa spokesman Mark Hamilton, Axa spokesman, told BBC News."
281,"Chinese dam firm 'defies Beijing'
The China Three Gorges Project Corp is refusing to obey a government order to stop construction of one of its giant dams, the Chinese state press has said. The Beijing News said the company may instead choose to pay a fine. Last week, it denied that its projects violated regulations. ""The Three Gorges Corporation has all along abided by the law and have built our projects in accordance with the law,"" it said. The Xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6% to 440,700 megawatts (MW). The firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the Three Gorges Underground Power Plant and the Three Gorges Project Electrical Power Supply Plant."
282,"In 2005 it ""will rise toward 13,000"", predicted Morgan Stanley equity strategist Naoki Kamiyama. The optimism in the financial markets contrast sharply with pessimism in the Japanese business community. Earlier this month, the quarterly Tankan survey of Japanese manufacturers found that business confidence had weakened for the first time since March 2003. Structural reform within Japan and an anticipated end to the banking sector's bad debt problems should also help, they say."
283,"Hopes are high for the future of finance, so foreign banks have been buying into the sector. The economy has become the second-most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of Sunday's election, according to Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq. One Iraqi woman told Ms Alexander about her frustration as she watched TV adverts for private hospitals soon after having failed to track down basic medicines from Baghdad's pharmacies. Observes Mr Hadi: ""The economy at present marks a big divide; the rich get richer, the poor get poorer."" Iraqi voters turn to economic issues
Beyond the desperate security situation in Iraq lies an economy in tatters. ""I think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast,"" Mr Hadi says. But the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many Iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work, observes Ms Alexander. But there are exceptions. ""Iraq's vast natural resources can support any magnitude of economic growth."" ""These guys are trying to work."
284,"EU 'too slow' on economic reforms
Most EU countries have failed to put in place policies aimed at making Europe the world's most competitive economy by the end of the decade, a report says. Combined with high environmental standards and efforts to level the playing field for businesses throughout the EU, the plan was for Europe to become the world's most dynamic economy by 2010. Among the biggest laggards, according to the report, are Greece and Italy. It also set out to raise the amount the private sector spends on research and development, while bringing about greater discipline over public spending and debt levels. Next week, the Commission will present revised proposals to meet the Lisbon goals. Many people expect the 2010 target to be quietly dropped."
285,"But officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed, with services providing much of the impetus. And overall investment in fixed assets was still high, up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. China continues breakneck growth
China's economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004, faster than predicted and well above 2003's 9.1%. The result could be higher interest rates. Despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said. China's economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, but also from soaring sales overseas. ""There is no sign of a slowdown in 2005,"" said Tim Congdon, economist at ING Barings. Despite urging to ease the peg, officials insist they are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate. ""Those who hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will not succeed in making a profit."""
286,"On the outskirts of Kyoto, 83-year-old Yuji Shimizu contemplates this phenomenon during a round of golf with his younger friends, who are in their seventies. Between tasks, this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is: ""Well, what's most important for me is to be Japan's number one."" So how will Japan's finances stay on track? Although President Bush must re-devise Social Security to take account of a 130% rise in America's over 65s, the IMF foresees a positive contribution to the US current account balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration. ""Who is going to build the economy, who are going to be the leaders? Who are going to be the producers of the GDP going forward?"" Mr Toshitsune wants to outlive everyone. ""Japan still has problems getting a viable banking system, let alone shifting their auto business or their semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas,"" says Mr Wood. Japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession. At 101, he chuckles that, he feels fine."
287,"GE said orders in the fourth quarter were 15% higher than in the same period of 2003, ""with growth across the board"". ""We are benefiting from our growth initiatives and an excellent global economy,"" said GE's chief executive Jeff Immelt. ""The industries GE is in are doing very well. GE's net profits were $5.37bn (£2.86bn) for the final three months of 2004, while sales came in at $43.7bn. The materials, financial and industrial sectors are all picking up,"" said Steve Roukis, an analyst at fund manager Matrix Asset Advisors, which has shares in GE. The success of Universal Studio's film 'Ray', a portrait of jazz musician Ray Charles, has helped boost earnings at the unit. Full year 2004 gains were less spectacular, but still respectable."
288,"UK economy facing 'major risks'
The UK manufacturing sector will continue to face ""serious challenges"" over the next two years, the British Chamber of Commerce (BCC) has said. The group's quarterly survey of companies found exports had picked up in the last three months of 2004 to their best levels in eight years. Manufacturers' domestic sales growth fell back slightly in the quarter, the survey of 5,196 firms found. The BCC found confidence increased in the quarter across both the manufacturing and service sectors although overall it failed to reach the levels at the start of 2004. It recently forecast economic growth will slow from more than 3% in 2004 to a little below 2.5% in both 2005 and 2006. ""Despite some positive news for the export sector, there are worrying signs for manufacturing,"" the BCC said. The reduced threat of interest rate increases had contributed to improved confidence, it said. ""While consumer spending is set to decelerate significantly over the next 12-18 months, it is unlikely that investment and exports will rise sufficiently strongly to pick up the slack."""
289,"The BRC said Britain's retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade. ""But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. On Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. Mr Frost added: ""The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists' expectations of a 0.3% rise. ""The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,"" he said. ""So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,"" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. ""However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates."" It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain."
290,"Tobacco stocks rose sharply on Wall Street after the 2-1 decision. Among the accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson. Charles A Blixt, executive vice-president of RJ Reynolds Tobacco, said the ruling ""dramatically transforms"" the government's lawsuit. Prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to ""disgorge"" $280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products. Altria Group said, in a statement, the government now ""must not only prove that the companies have engaged in fraudulent behaviour in the past, but that they are likely to do so in the future."" They were delighted by the decision, which sent Reynolds shares up 4.5% and Altria shares up 5.11%. Anti-smoking groups urge the government to fight on, but the Justice Department has not said if it will appeal. The three-judge panel in the District of Columbia's Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that the US government could not sue the firms under the anti-racketeering laws. ""All we're saying today is that we have received the ruling and are reviewing it,"" a spokeswoman said on Friday. ""We hold that the language of (the law) and the comprehensive remedial scheme of (the law) preclude disgorgement as a possible remedy in this case,"" he wrote."
291,"According to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last month. That took 2004's total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. ""It was a respectable report,"" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities. ""Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track."" Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. ""Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case"" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York."
292,"Now the board has confirmed that the US bidder is back, with a statement issued on Sunday reading: ""The board can confirm it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer. Man United had turned down the bid because it was based on a high level of borrowing. Glazer makes new Man Utd approach
Malcolm Glazer has made a fresh approach to buy Manchester United, which could lead to a bid valuing the Premiership club at £800m. Meanwhile, United's chief executive David Gill said in December that talks would not resume unless Glazer came up with ""definitive proposals"". But newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with a stronger and less debt-laden bid. United fans have reacted with anger at the announcement. ""The campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since Glazer first showed interest in the club."" ""We will fight tooth and nail to stop him whatever his offer says. We do not want him or anybody else taking over United,"" said Mark Longden of the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association."
293,"Many investors believe that Mr Bush's policies are more business-friendly than those of his Democrat challenger, John Kerry. The benchmark Dow Jones share index closed more than 1% higher at 10,137, while the Nasdaq rose 0.9% to 2,004. ""The relief for the markets may be that we have a decision and can move forward,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management. Investors had worried that the outcome of the poll would be inconclusive, paving the way for a repeat of the legal wrangling that marred the 2000 election. Wall Street cheers Bush victory
The US stock market has closed higher in response to George W Bush's victory in the presidential elections. Share prices in London, Frankfurt and Paris also closed higher. The US' recent economic performance has been mixed, with solid growth offset by disappointingly low job creation figures, and mounting worries over a record budget deficit. Successive polls in the run-up to Tuesday's election had shown the two candidates running neck and neck. Senator Kerry attacked President Bush's economic record during his campaign, hammering home the fact that a net 800,000 jobs were lost during his term in office. President Bush focused on the fact that two million jobs have been created in the past year, claiming that it has vindicated his tax-cutting agenda."
294,"Slower economic growth, rising oil prices, a stronger yen and weaker exports were blamed for the fall. December's confidence level was below that seen in September, the Bank of Japan said. However, September's reading was the strongest for 13 years. ""The economy is at a pause but unlikely to fall"", the economy minister said. Confidence among non-manufacturers was unchanged in the final quarter of 2004, but it is forecast to drop one point in the March survey. Companies reported they expect to invest 7.7% more in the year to March 2005 than the previous year - up from expectations of 6.1% increase in the September Tankan. Big manufacturers were even more pessimistic about the first quarter of 2005; their views suggest the March reading could go as low as 15 - still in positive territory, but weaker. China's attempts to cool down its fast-growing economy have also hit Japanese industry's sales abroad."
295,"It will also see more jobs created in India and China, advocates argue. The WTO itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry. ""Some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this. Christian Aid has called on British firms not to simply ""cut and run"" but look after their workers, in a new report called Rags To Riches To Rags. The WTO said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market. ""We are deeply concerned that the New Year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers."" ""International trade must not be governed by a 'race to the bottom' that pitches one set of poor people against another,"" Mr Pendleton added. ""The losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal,"" Andrew Pendleton, Christian Aid's head of Trade Policy, said. ""They will be hard-pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection. It added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake-up had not been considered, adding such seismic changes to policy should ""put the interests of poor people first - rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost""."
296,"Jobs will also be lost in the US - which accounted for 46% of profit in the first half of 2004 - and across its operations in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. ABN Amro's operations in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom will be hardest hit. Deutsche Bank said earlier this month it would reduce its German workforce by 1,920 while as many as 300 jobs will be lost at Credit Suisse First Boston. ABN Amro currently has more than 100,000 staff. ""To get any profit growth in the coming years, they will have to lower costs, so shedding jobs makes total sense,"" Ivo Geijsen, an analyst with Bank Oyens & Van Eeghen, told Bloomberg. Europe's leading banks seem set for a period of retrenchment."
297,"Fannie Mae last month warned that some records were incorrect. The investigation of Freddie Mac in June 2003 sparked concerns about the wider health of the industry and raised questionsmarks over the role of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), the industry's main regulator. The Securities & Exchange Commission accused Fannie Mae of using techniques that ""did not comply in material respects"" with accounting standards. Having been pricked into action, the OFHEO turned its attention to Fannie May and in September this year said that the firm had tweaked its books to spread earnings more smoothly across quarters and play down the amount of risk it had taken on. The SEC found similar problems."
298,"However, Judge Letitia Clark said the hearing would continue on Thursday when arguments in the case would be heard. Filing for bankruptcy protection in the US was ""a last resort to preserve the rights of our shareholders, employees and customers,"" said Yukos chief executive Steven Theede. Russian prosecutors are forcing the sale of the firm's most lucrative asset Yuganskneftegas to help pay a $27bn (£14bn) back tax bill, which they claim is owed by Yukos. Yukos asked the Houston court to order Russia to arbitration so that it can press claims for billions of dollars in damages over a ""campaign of illegal, discriminatory and disproportionate"" tax claims. As well as the bid to get Chapter 11 bankruptcy - which protects firms from creditors, allowing them to continue trading as they restructure their finances - the group also made a claim for damages against the Russian government. He added that the opening bid for the firm's Yuganskneftgas unit was $8bn - less than half of the $20bn that Yukos advisers say it is worth. ""We believe the only significant bidder at the auction on Sunday is Gazprom,"" he said, referring to Russia's natural gas giant. Yukos maintains that the forced auction is illegal and ""will cause the company to suffer immediate and irreparable harm."""
299,"Guidant is a key producer of equipment that combats heart problems such as implant defibrillators and pacemakers. The move by Johnson & Johnson has been widely expected and the firm will pay $76 for each Guidant share, 6% more than Wednesday's closing price.

Libya has withdrawn $1bn in assets from the US, assets which had previously been frozen for almost 20 years, the Libyan central bank has said. However, the withdrawal did not mean that Libya had cut its ties with the US, he added. ""We are in the process of opening accounts in banks in the United States,"" the central bank's vice president Farhat Omar Ben Gadaravice said. Bankers from the two country's had been working on how to unfreeze Libya's assets."

A slimming aid made from a southern African cactus is set to be developed by UK firm Phytopharm and Unilever. Analysts said Unilever could launch the new products in 2007. But the research collaboration came to an end in 2003. ""This deal goes a long way to restoring the market faith in Phytopharm's pipeline after the Pfizer exit,"" said analyst Erling Refsum at Nomura."

Earlier, Mr Wilson had said that president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has decided to step in and a decree of some kind of intervention could be signed this week. ""In practice, it will be an intervention, although this is not the technical name used"", he said. Varig, which operates in 18 countries apart from Brazil, has been driven to the brink of collapse because of the country's economic downturn. However, no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying, he added. The airline could also win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government. But the government can appeal the decision."
303,"Bombardier chief to leave company
Shares in train and plane-making giant Bombardier have fallen to a 10-year low following the departure of its chief executive and two members of the board. Analysts said the resignations seem to have stemmed from a boardroom dispute. Mr Tellier had indicated he wanted to stay at the world's top train maker and third largest manufacturer of civil aircraft until the restructuring was complete. But Bombardier has been faced with a declining share price and profits. ""I understand the board's concern that I would not be there for the long-term and the need to develop and execute strategies, and the need to reshape the management structure at this time,"" Mr Tellier said in a statement on Monday. Earlier this month the firm said it earned $10m (£19.2m) in the third quarter, down from a profit of $133m a year ago."
304,"The bill, proposed in 1993, has finally been approved by the leadership of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. According to Andreas Adriano of Latin Trade Magazine, the new bankruptcy law will help in reducing the spread - difference between the interest rates of the banks and federal bonds. The law also makes it more difficult for a company to declare bankruptcy. But President Lula became a defender of the reforms, arguing that the country's bank lending margins were among the highest in the world and were damaging the economy. The new regulations will limit payments to workers to 150 times the minimum monthly salary, which is currently $94. They considered that they undermined workers' rights."
305,"However, recent data from the British Retail Consortium showed a 0.2% slip in High Street sales during November. Many had expected sales to fall slightly in November as shoppers put off buying Christmas presents until December. The ONS data confounded analyst expectations. Aggressive tactics, such as one-day discount sales adopted by stores such as Marks & Spencer, appear to have paid off. ""Price discounting has certainly accounted for much of this because the value of retail sales hasn't grown as much as volumes,"" said Investec economist David Page."
306,"Cairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. But Cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a ""significant downgrade of the initial expectation"". Investors had piled into Cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in India this year. The shares closed down 247p, or 18%, at 1115 pence. Cairn, which also operates in Nepal and Bangladesh, was catapulted into the FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price. ""We have a pretty strong legal case here,"" he added, saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. Investors took a dim view of the statements though. ""Cairn refutes the government's position,"" Mr Gammell said. Its Mangala field, thought to contain a billion barrels, is its biggest find to date. Cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year."
307,"""I will give up my role as soon as the board of directors asks me to do so,"" he said. French boss to leave EADS
The French co-head of European defence and aerospace group EADS Philippe Camus is to leave his post. French finance minister Herve Gaymard is on record as saying that he ""deplored"" the infighting at the company. Fighting between Mr Camus and Mr Forgeard has hit the headlines in France and analysts feared that this fighting could destabilise the defence and aerospace group. EADS - Airbus' majority owner - admitted earlier this week that the project was running 1.45bn euros (£1bn; $1.9bn) over budget. ""But for the sake of transparency, we told our shareholders last week that if we look at the forecast for total costs of the project up to 2010, there is a risk that we will go over by around 10%, which is about 1bn euros (£686m; $1.32bn),"" he told France's LCI Television.

Shares in Anglo-Swedish drug have closed down 8% in UK trade after the failure of its Iressa drug in a major clinical trial. AstraZeneca had hoped to pitch its Iressa drug against rival medicine Tarceva. ""This would be two of the three blockbuster drugs that were meant to power the company forward failing... and we've got risks on Crestor,"" said Nick Turner, analyst at brokers Jefferies. AztraZeneca has now appointed a new executive director to the board. John Patterson will be in charge of drug development.

The global sports giant said it posted a profit of $261.9m (£135.6m), for the three months to 30 November, up from $179.1m in the same period last year. Philip Knight, chairman and chief executive, said: ""Nike's second-quarter revenues and earnings per share reached all-time high levels as a result of solid performance across our global portfolio.

310,"Stormy year for property insurers
A string of storms, typhoons and earthquakes has made 2004 the most expensive year on record for property insurers, according to Swiss Re. ""2004 reinforces the trend towards higher losses,"" said Swiss Re. Tightly packed populations in the areas involved in natural and man-made disasters were to partly to blame for the rise in claims, it said. Twenty-one thousand people lost their lives in the catastrophes with a cost to the global economy of around $105bn (£54bn). The largest claims came from the US, which was struck by four hurricanes, and Japan, which suffered the highest concentration of typhoons for decades plus a major earthquake."

Petrel said that it has not received any information from Iraqi authorities to confirm or deny the report. These two projects aim to develop Khurmala field to produce 100,000 barrels per day and raise the output of Himrin.

So the main question was how to structure this transaction. And, according to Tass news agency, Gazprom did not make a single bid, leaving the way open for Baikal, which paid above the auction start price of 246.75bn roubles. Meanwhile, Tim Osborne, head of Yukos main shareholders' group Menatep, said that Yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt, and that legal action would be taken, outside Russia, against the auction winners. Yukos unit fetches $9bn at auction
A little-known Russian company has bought the main production unit of oil giant Yukos at auction in Moscow. Kaha Kiknavelidze, analyst at Troika Dialog, said: ""I think a decision that Yugansk should end up with Gazprom was taken a long time ago. ""I would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and Gazprom now has a partner. ""Another surprise was that the winner paid a significant premium above the starting price."" However, Gazprom has announced it is not linked to Baikal in any way. There is still potential for surprises."""

In 2002 S&N and United agreed to form a strategic partnership, one that would include a joint venture business and a UK investment in the Indian brewer. Meanwhile, United's budget airline, Kingfisher Airlines, is to buy 10 A320 aircraft from Airbus and has the option to buy 20 more aircraft in a deal worth up to $1.8bn. A similar holding will be controlled by Vijay Mallya, chair of the Indian firm. India, with a population of more than one billion, consumes about 1.2 billion bottles of beer every year.

Last week, the LSE rejected a takeover proposal from German rival Deutsche Boerse - the 530 pence-a-share offer valued the exchange at about £1.35bn. It is also working with Morgan Stanley. Despite the rejection of the Deutsche Boerse bid last week, Werner Seifert, chief executive of the Frankfurt-based exchange, may well come back with an improved offer. It has long wanted to link up with London, and the two tried and failed to seal a merger in 2000. Last week the LSE said not only was the bid undervalued, but that it had ""been advised that there can be no assurance that any transaction could be successfully implemented"". However, it has indicated it is open for further talks. While Mr Seifert has suggested a merged company would be run out of London, the mayor of Frankfurt has raised concerns that such a move could cost German jobs."

The fate of Russia's Yuganskneftegas - the oil firm sold to a little-known buyer on Sunday - is the subject of frantic speculation in Moscow. Russia's newspapers claimed that Baikal was a front for gas monopoly Gazprom, which had been expected to win. The authorities have made themselves a wonderful Christmas present - Russia's most efficient oil company has been destroyed,"" the Interfax news agency quoted Mr Khodorkovsky as saying via his lawyers. ""We don't know if this company is linked 100% to Gazprom. Last week, Yukos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US in a last-ditch attempt to hang on to Yuganskneftegas, which accounts for 60% of its output. ""And Gazprom doesn't have this sort of money lying around."" ""It is a front for somebody but not necessarily for Gazprom,"" said Oleg Maximov, an analyst at Troika Dialog in Moscow. Yukos is not planning on letting go of its unit without a fight and has threatened legal action against any buyer.

Experts now widely expect a bidding war for Europe's biggest stock market, which lists stocks with a total capitalisation of £1.4 trillion, to break out. Further reports had suggested that Euronext could make an offer in excess of the LSE's 533p a share closing price on Friday. The offer follows widespread media speculation that Euronext would make an offer for LSE. There has been extensive speculation about a possible takeover of the company since an attempted merger with Deutsche Boerse failed in 2000."

Iraq's Trade Minister Mohammed Mustafa al-Jibouri welcomed the move, describing it as significant as November's decision by the Paris Club of creditor nations to write off 80% of the country's debts. The countries stand to reap huge benefits from membership of the group, whose purpose is to promote free trade.

Yukos will return to a US court on Wednesday to seek sanctions against Baikal Finance Group, the little-known firm which has bought its main asset. Russian newspapers have claimed that Baikal - which bought the Yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles, £4.8bn) on Sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with Surgutneftegas, Russia's fourth-biggest oil producer. On Wednesday, Yukos will also seek further legal remedies to prevent the break-up of the group. ""We believe the auction was illegal and we intend to pursue all legal recourses available to us,"" Yukos spokesman Mike Lake told Agence France Press. ""If it exports that oil, it will be marketing a stolen product,"" he added. The future ownership of Yuganksneftegas remains unclear amid widespread suggestions that Baikal was established as a front for other interests.

It has faced stinging criticism from Congressional leaders who held hearings into its finances earlier this year and from government regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO). It is America's second largest financial institution. KPMG, Fannie Mae's independent auditor, will also be replaced. Freddie Mac, the country's other largest mortgage firm, was forced to restate its earnings by $4.4bn last year and pay a $125m fine after an investigation of its books.

A former executive at the London offices of Merrill Lynch has lost her £7.5m ($14.6m) sex discrimination case against the US investment bank. Her partial victory is likely to cap her compensation to about £55,000, a tiny fraction of what she asked for. The action - the biggest claim heard by an employment tribunal in the UK - had been viewed as something of a test case. Ms Villalba, the former head of Merrill's private client business in Europe, has made no decision on whether to appeal. But in 2003 her employers told her she had no future after 17 years with the company, and she was made redundant. ""We said from the start that this case was about performance not gender,"" Merrill said in a statement. Merrill Lynch denied Ms Villalba's claims and said she was removed from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent.

Munich Re, the world's biggest reinsurer, said: ""This is primarily a human tragedy. ""India continues to post excellent results thanks to increased promotion and product development, but also to the upsurge in business travel driven by the rapid economic development of the country,"" the WTO said. It is too early for us to state what our financial burden will be."" Insurers are also struggling to assess the cost of the damage, but several big players believe the final bill is likely to be less than the $27bn cost of the hurricanes that battered the US earlier this year. In southern Asia that expansion is 23%. ""Arrivals to other destinations such as... Maldives and Sri Lanka also thrived."""

But it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense,"" said ABN Amro chief Asian strategist Eddie Wong. But Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs on Wednesday, suggesting that investors do not fear a major economic impact. Thailand's economy is now expected to grow by 5.7% in 2005, rather than 6% as forecast before tsunamis hit six tourist provinces. Thailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome. ""Our nation is in peril here,"" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. ""It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,"" he said. ""In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes."" Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m."
354,"The outlook is better than it has been for a number of years, analysts said. The economy is benefiting from a quieter period in Palestinian-Israeli violence and a pick-up in global demand for technology products. Growth did slow in the second half, but only slightly. Exports for the year rose by 14%, while tourist revenues were up by 30%. In 2003, the economy expanded by 1.3%"

The government's main problems are ""slumping consumption and a contraction in the construction industry"". In 2004, growth will be between 4.7% and 4.8%, the ministry said. Not everyone is convinced the plan will work. It aims to create 400,000 jobs and will focus on infrastructure and home building, as well as providing public firms with money to hire new workers. The problem facing South Korea is that many consumers are reeling from the effects of a credit bubble that only recently burst. ""The focus will be on job creation and economic recovery, given that unfavourable domestic and global conditions are likely to dog the Korean economy in 2005,"" the ministry said. It also pledged to look at ways of helping families on low incomes. The government voiced concern about the effect of redundancies in the building trade. It also will look at real estate tax system."

A demand for unpaid taxes and fines of $600,000 (£425,000) is politically motivated, the OSI claimed, adding that it paid the money in October.

German investment bank Deutsche Bank has challenged the right of Yukos to claim bankruptcy protection in the US. Yuganskneftegas will ultimately end up with Gazprom. Deutsche Bank contends Yukos filed for bankruptcy earlier this month in Texas in a desperate and unsuccessful bid to stave off the 19 December auction of its top unit by the Russian government, which was in a tax dispute with Yukos. ""This blatant attempt to artificially manufacture a basis for jurisdiction constitutes cause to dismiss this case,"" Deutsche Bank said in its court filing. Mike Lake, a spokesman for Yukos' lawyers, said on Tuesday that the company stands by its legal action. Yukos is confident of its right to US bankruptcy protection, and ""we are prepared to be back in court defending that position again,"" he said. In its filing, Deutsche Bank said Houston was ""a jurisdiction in which Yukos owns no real or personal property and conducts no business operations."" The next hearing in the bankruptcy is expected on 6 January. Mr Khodorkovsky is in jail, and on trial for fraud and tax evasion."

Fiat will meet car giant General Motors (GM) on Tuesday in an attempt to reach agreement over the future of the Italian firm's loss-making auto group. Press reports have speculated that Fiat may be willing to accept a cash payment in return for dropping its claim. Mr Marchionne is confident of his firm's legal position, saying in an interview with the Financial Times that GM's argument ""has no legs"". At the time, it gave the Italian firm the right, via a 'put option', to sell the remaining stake to GM. Political and public pressure may well push the two firms to reach a compromise. ""We are not expecting Fiat to exercise its put of the auto business against an unwilling GM at this point,"" brokerage Merrill Lynch said in a note to investors, adding that any legal battle would be protracted and damaging to the business. ""Fiat may be willing to cancel the 'put' in exchange for money."""

""But in less than 40 years, plastic has become our most popular way to pay, due to the added security and flexibility it offers,"" said Apacs spokeswoman Jemma Smith. Shoppers in the UK are expected to put £269bn on plastic cards during the whole of 2004, compared with £268bn paid with cash, Apacs said.

""This is one of the most important infrastructure projects for regional, EU, and Euro-Atlantic integration for the western Balkans,"" said Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano. According to Pat Ferguson, President of AMBO, work on the pipeline will begin in 2005 and it is expected to be ready in three or four years.

Australian mining firm WMC Resources has said it is worth up to 30% more than a hostile 7.4bn Australian dollar ($5.8bn; £3bn) bid by rival Xstrata. He said the valuation would put increased pressure on Xstrata to look at ""sweetening"" its offer. Marc Gonsalves, an executive at Xstrata, said: ""We will review the information contained in the target's statement over the next week or so."" Analysts said the defence documents provided more details on WMC, and may trigger a possible rival bid. ""If a bid is going to emerge it is probably likely in the next one to two weeks,"" said Daiwa Securities analyst Mark Pervan. Last month Australia's competition watchdog said it would not oppose the purchase of WMC by Zurich and London-based Xstrata. He said WMC would pursue ""value-creating options"" provided by a portfolio of ""world class assets"". In 2003 Xstrata acquired Australia's largest copper miner - MIM Holdings. WMC Resources is the world's third-largest producer of concentrated nickel, and also a miner of copper and uranium. It also has growing businesses in gold, lead and silver."

Should the offer be fully accepted, Mr Murray said he expected to pay a maximum of £1.53m for the remaining shares. Mr Murray is already Sunderland's leading shareholder, holding a 37.6% stake, and now hopes to take full control of the Championship side. ""The football sector is experiencing significant changes and uncertainty,"" Mr Murray said in a statement. Sunderland delisted its shares from the stock market in August. ""I believe that this offer will strengthen the company and remove the potential for that type of uncertainty."" However, the club's turnover dropped sharply from £42.5m to £28.5m over the same period, because of a fall in broadcast revenues. The deal expired last month."
367,"With the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) some £23bn (£12m) in deficit, the Financial Economists Roundtable (FER) wants Congress to act. The FER blames this on a 2004 law, in a statement signed by several members, who include Nobel economics laureate William Sharpe. Instead of taxpayers having to pick up the bill, the FER wants Congressmen to change the PBGC's funding rules. It said it was ""dismayed"" at the situation and wants Congress to overturn the legislation. ""With a little firmer hand on the pensions issues in the US, I think that Congress could avoid having to turn to the taxpayer and instead turn the obligations back onto the companies that deserve to pay them,"" said Professor Dennis Logue, dean of Price College of Business at the University of Oklahoma.

The deal gives Inbev, the world's biggest beermaker, near-total control over the Russian brewer. Sun Interbrew, which employs 8,000 staff, owns breweries in eight Russian cities - Klin, Ivanovo, Saransk, Kursk, Volzhsky, Omsk, Perm and Novocheboksarsk.

""This completes a strong year for manufacturing based on the ISM data,"" said chairman of the ISM's survey committee.

Blake Lee-Harwood, campaigns director at Greenpeace in the UK, said: ""It's fairly meaningless to talk about your company's direction in terms of sustainability without having detailed knowledge of your supply chain. ""It's also important to get some kind of independent assessment of your reporting."" The US seems to lag Europe in producing corporate social responsibility reports. The survey is published by corporate social responsibility firm Context and branding firm SalterBaxter. The regulation is not expected until 2005 and the first reports under this scheme will not be published before 2006. ""The corporate lexicon of homilies, generalities and soft assurances - fluff - is on its way out. There are less pictures of smiling children and butterflies."""
397,"The island state is asking for about $320m from the International Monetary Fund to help pay for relief, he said. According to Mr Mendis, half the IMF support could come from a freeze on debt repayments, which would free up resources immediately. The currency has strengthened 4% since late December, coming close to 100 rupees to the US dollar for the first time in more than six months. This estimate is preliminary, bank governor Sunil Mendis told reporters, and could rise in 2006. Sri Lanka is hoping for a wider freeze from other creditors. One side-effect of the disaster has been that the value of the rupee has risen as foreign funds have flooded into the country."
398,"At the same time, India's economy is booming and the country's thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide. ""We are in touch with the concerned Russian entities about the Yukos assets and other opportunities in Russia,"" said ONGC chairman Subir Raha. India produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. The dispute is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion. Yukos is being broken up by Russian authorities to pay a massive tax bill. India is a ""dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil"". ""By 2020, production may only be at half of today's levels."" ONGC's interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world's biggest oil producers brought to its knees. Analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without Yugansk. Should that happen, Yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets, analysts said."
399,"It said it accepted full responsibility for what it called improper activities. Monsanto fined $1.5m for bribery
The US agrochemical giant Monsanto has agreed to pay a $1.5m (£799,000) fine for bribing an Indonesian official. Despite the bribe, the official did not authorise the waiving of the environmental study requirement. Monsanto also has admitted to paying bribes to a number of other high-ranking officials between 1997 and 2002. Monsanto faced both criminal and civil charges from the Department of Justice and the SEC. Monsanto said it accepted full responsibility for its employees' actions, adding that it had taken ""remedial actions to address the activities in Indonesia"" and had been ""fully co-operative"" throughout the investigative process. ""Companies cannot bribe their way into favourable treatment by foreign officials,"" said Christopher Wray, assistant US attorney general."
400,"The offence carries a sentence of 16 months to four years in state prison. ""We are saddened by the development,"" Marsh said in a statement. Marsh executive in guilty plea
An executive at US insurance firm Marsh & McLennan has pleaded guilty to criminal charges in connection with an ongoing fraud and bid-rigging probe. The company added it would continue to co-operate in the case, adding it was ""committed to resolving the company's legal issues and to serving our clients with the highest standards of transparency and ethics"". According to a statement from Mr Spitzer's office, the Marsh executive admitted he instructed insurance companies to submit non-competitive bids for insurance business between 2002 and 2004. Through the practice, Marsh was allowed to determine which insurers won business from clients, and so control the insurance market, Mr Spitzer's office added."
401,"US interest rate rise expected
US interest rates are expected to rise for the fifth time since June following the US Federal Reserve's latest rate-setting meeting later on Tuesday. ""It's not a risk, it's actually happening."" The dollar's record-breaking decline, meanwhile, has spooked markets and along with high oil prices has raised concerns about the pace of inflation. Mr Kim added that borrowing costs could rise further. ""I think the Fed feels it has a fair amount of flexibility,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Fannie Mae. ""But if economic growth picked up and caused core inflation to rise a little more quickly, I think the Fed would be prepared to tighten more quickly as well."" ""If economic growth should subside... the Fed would feel it has the flexibility to pause in its tightening."
402,"Earlier, the New York Times had reported that the personal payments were required as part of any deal at the start of negotiations. According to the WSJ, which cites people familiar to the case, the settling directors are expected to deny wrongdoing and state they are settling the case to eliminate the uncertainties and expense of further litigations. He added that the settlement ""sends a pretty strong shockwave through the director world"". ""Directors very rarely pay,"" said Charles Elson, chairman of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. The ten former outside directors are James Allen, Judith Areen, Carl Aycock, Max Bobbitt, Clifford Alexander, Stiles Kellett, Gordon Macklin, John Porter, Lawrence Tucker and the estate of John Sidgmore, who died last year. It has not yet been determined how much each director will have to pay. Two other outside former directors, Bert Roberts and Francesco Galesi, remain defendants in the lawsuit, said the newspaper. The company emerged from Chapter 11 protection last year and changed its name to MCI Inc. Former WorldCom chief executive Bernard Ebbers is to face trial this month on criminal charges that he oversaw the fraud."
403,"Failure to make cutbacks may also push it to reduce its fleet, the group said. In a filing to US regulators the airline warned of ""inadequate liquidity"" if it fails to reduce wage costs by $500m by the end of February. ""Without the reduction in wage and benefit costs and a reasonable prospect of future profitability, we believe that our ability to raise additional money through financings would be uncertain,"" Continental said in its filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Two weeks' ago the group also announced it would be able to shave a further $48m a year from its costs with changes to wage and benefits for most of its US-based management and clerical staff. The company has been working to streamline its operations - and has managed to save $1.1bn in costs without cutting jobs."
404,"The average price of a house in the UK now stands at £162,086, Halifax said. On Tuesday, figures from the Bank of England showed that the number of mortgages approved in the UK has fallen to the lowest level for nearly a decade. Growth in unsecured lending, such as personal loans and credit cards, also slowed last month. New loans in November fell to 77,000, from 85,000 in October, the lowest rate since September 1995, the Bank of England said. Experts believe five interest rate rises since November 2003 are cutting borrowers' appetite for debt. Despite recording a price rise in December, the Halifax survey concluded that there was ""continuing signs of a genuine slowdown in the housing market."" ""The month by month volatility of the Halifax house price data should not distract from the fact that there is a clear downward trend in house prices,"" a Capital Economics statement said. In the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber, Halifax said prices rose by 3% and 1.2% in the two regions respectively during the month. If the bank's prediction of a 2% price drop comes true, it will be the first annual fall in nine years. The biggest decline was seen in Wales where prices fell by 6.2%, an area that had experienced strong house price growth during most of 2004."
405,"But Wal-Mart only saw its sales rise after it cut prices. Analysts said Wal-Mart faced a ""stand-off"" with shoppers, stepping up its discounts as the festive season wore on, as consumers waited longer to get the best bargains. Overall, December sales are forecast to rise by 4.5% to $220bn - less than the 5.1% increase seen a year earlier. Accessory vendor Claire's Stores also suffered as an expected last minute shopping rush never materialised, leaving its same store sales 5% higher, compared to a 6% rise last year. Commentators claim many have cut back on spending amid uncertainty over job security, while low and middle-income Americans have reined in spending in the face of higher gasoline prices. And for stores that have been doing well over the last several months, December was a good month."" One discount retailer to fare well in December was Costco Wholesale, which continued a recent run of upbeat results with a better-than-expected 8% jump in same store sales. However, the losers were many and varied. ""So far, we are faring better than expected, but the results are still split,"" Ken Perkins, an analyst at research firm RetailMetrics LLC, told Associated Press. ""This was not a good period for retailers or shoppers."
406,"The value of the deal has not been revealed, because of a confidentiality clause in the agreement. India's Deccan gets more planes
Air Deccan has signed a deal to acquire 36 planes from Avions de Transport Regional (ATR). Recently, India's first low-cost airline ordered 30 Airbus A320 planes for $1.8bn. In a statement, ATR has said deliveries of the aircraft will begin in 2005 and will continue over a five-year period. ""After an evaluation of both ATR and Bombardier aircraft, we have chosen the ATR aircraft as we find it most suitable for our operations and for the Indian market for short haul routes."" Filippo Bagnato, ATR's chief executive, has said that his firm will also work with Air Deccan to create a training centre in Bangalore. India's government has given its backing to cheaper and more accessible air travel."
407,"New vehicle sales jumped 22% to 449,603 from a year earlier, the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA) said. South African car demand surges
Car manufacturers with plants in South Africa, including BMW, General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen, have seen a surge in demand during 2004. NAAMSA said it expects sales to top 500,000 in 2005. Strong economic growth and low interest rates have driven demand, and analysts expect the trend to continue."
408,"Standard Chartered is believed to have gained the initiative by putting together a bid during the Christmas break. Standard Chartered said acquiring Korea First Bank (KFB) fulfilled a strategic objective of building a bigger presence in Asia's third largest economy. In London, Standard Chartered's sale of 118 million new shares to institutional investors pushed its share price down, and contributing to the FTSE 100's 0.3% decline. ""They were able to move so quickly it caught HSBC by surprise,"" the Financial Times newspaper quoted an insider in the talks as saying. Some analysts also queried whether Standard Chartered had overpaid for KFB. The deal, which requires regulatory approval, is expected to be completed by April 2005 and to be earnings accretive in 2006, Standard Chartered said. Since 1999, KFB has been restructured from a wholesale bank into a retail bank focused on mortgage lending, which makes up 45% of its loans. Rival banking giant HSBC, which is based in London and Hong Kong, was also in the running. Standard Chartered said KFB was a ""well-managed, conservatively run bank with a highly skilled workforce"" and represented a ""significant acquisition in a growth market"". South Korea's economy is expected to grow by 4.5% this year."
409,"DaimlerChrysler's 2004 sales rise
US-German carmaker DaimlerChrysler has sold 2.1% more cars in 2004 than in the previous year, as solid Chrysler sales offset a weak showing for Mercedes. A switch to new models hit luxury marque Mercedes-Benz, with sales down 3.1% at 1.06 million. In Europe, the Smart will now go on sale through regular Mercedes dealerships as well as its own dealer network, Mr Cordes said. The future of the brand - which is controlled by the Mercedes group within DaimlerChrysler - remains in question, however."
410,"The fall came as Indonesia said it expected debt repayments of up to 30 trillion rupiah ($3.2bn; £1.7bn) to be frozen to help pay for the recovery. Construction and property companies in particular have gained ground, although banks were among the main fallers on Monday. French finance minister Herve Gaymard said on Sunday that the Paris Club had already agreed to a moratorium on repayments for tsunami-hit countries ahead of its meeting on 12 January. That cost could be defrayed by temporary debt relief. ""We hope we can resume the repayments at least from 2007,"" Mr Bakrie said."
411,"Mr Khatami's second term as president ends on 1 August, making this his last budget. But opposition from members of parliament who have attacked previous privatisations could block his plans. It came not long after the Expediency Council - Iran's ultimate decision-maker - blessed Mr Khatami's policy of selling stakes in sectors protected by the constitution such as energy, transport, telecoms and banking. Late last year, they backed a law which would give parliament a veto over foreign investment. In contrast, oil revenues were expected to fall to $14.1bn from $16bn in the year to March 2005. ""Current government expenditure should come from tax revenues,"" Mr Khatami said. ""Oil revenues should be used for productive investment."" Mr Khatami has already been blocked by parliament from reducing the subsidies on many products including bread and petrol, reducing his room to manoeuvre."
412,"But, the EC did warn the two were under close scrutiny and it would act if their fiscal situations deteriorated. France and Germany will breach that this year. It will be the third year in a row that the two countries have broken the European Union's Stability and Growth Pact rules. The eurozone's two biggest economies left the pact in tatters in November 2003 when they persuaded fellow EU members to put the threat of penalties for deficit breaches on hold. The EU expects the German deficit to fall to fall to 2.9% of GDP next year from 3.9% this year, while France's is forecast to drop to 3% from an expected 3.7% this year. The commission then took the pair to the European Court of Human Justice - which ruled EU countries could not put the pact ""in abeyance"", and confirmed the EC's right to launch ""excessive debt procedures"". ""The commission concludes that the two countries appear to be on track to correct their excessive deficits by 2005,"" it said in a statement. However Paris was more subdued, with finance minister Herve Gaymard telling parliament: ""We must continue along this path of saving money."" Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said that it was a matter for next week."
413,"Under the terms of the $168m settlement - $155m of which will be covered by insurance - none of the 18 former directors will admit any wrongdoing. ""The settlement is very significant in holding these outside directors at least partially personally responsible,"" William Lerach, the lawyer leading the class action suit against Enron, said. Before its collapse, the firm was the seventh biggest public US company by revenue. The deal is the fourth major settlement negotiated by lawyers who filed a class action on behalf of Enron's shareholders almost three years ago. ""Hopefully, this will help send a message to corporate boardrooms of the importance of directors performing their legal duties,"" he added. The University of California said the trial in the case is scheduled to begin in October 2006. However, the latest deal does not include former Enron chief executives Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling. Neither does it cover Andrew Fastow, who has pleaded guilty to taking part in an illegal conspiracy while he was chief financial officer at the group."
414,"The average house price fell marginally to £180,226, from £180,444 in October. ""Overall, the housing market activity is slowing down and that is backed up by the mortgage lending and the mortgage approvals data,"" said Mark Miller, at HBOS Treasury Services. It is predicting a 2% fall in overall prices in 2005 as the market stabilises after large gains in recent years. ""The ODPM data is a fairly lagging indicator."" All areas saw a rise in annual house price inflation in November except for Northern Ireland and the West Midlands, where the rate was unchanged, the ODPM said. The Halifax, meanwhile, said last week that house prices increased by 1.1% in December - the first monthly rise since September. The UK's biggest mortgage lender said prices rose 15.1% over the whole of 2004, but by only 2.8% in the second half of the year. The ODPM attributed the monthly fall of prices in November to a drop in the value of detached houses and flats. In London, the area with the highest average house price at £262,825, annual inflation rose only slightly in November to 7.1% from 7% the previous month."
415,"According to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last month. That took 2004's total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. ""It was a respectable report,"" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities. ""Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track."" Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. ""Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case"" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York."
416,"The two banks reportedly held talks in October and November 2004. Its North American divisions focus on business banking, whereas Wells Fargo operates retail and business banking services from 6,000 branches. Wells Fargo had net income of $6.2bn in its last financial year, a 9% increase on the previous year, and revenues of $28.4bn. Barclays has declined to comment on the report in the Sunday Express, saying it does not respond to market speculation. Stock market traders were sceptical that the latest reports heralded a deal. ""The chief executive would be abandoning his duty if he didn't talk to rivals, but a deal doesn't seem likely,"" Reuters quoted one trader as saying."

A US firm has said it is in final negotiations with luxury goods group LVMH to buy the loss-making Christian Lacroix haute-couture house. LVMH refused to comment on the reports.

418,"Judy Boynton finally left the firm on 31 December, having spent the intervening time as a special advisor to chief executive Jeroen van der Veer. She was leaving ""by mutual agreement to pursue other career opportunities"", the firm said in a statement. In September, it paid £82.7m in fines to regulators on both sides of the Atlantic for violating market rules in its reporting of its reserves. In January 2004, Shell told shocked investors that its reserves were 20% smaller than previously thought. An investigation commissioned by Shell found that Ms Boynton had to share responsibility for the company's behaviour."
419,"The announcement comes as ONGC said it was in talks to buy former assets of troubled Russian oil firm Yukos. India and Iran in gas export deal
India has signed a $40bn (£21bn) deal to import millions of tonnes of liquefied natural gas from Iran. Ministers, eager to gain access to energy supplies to meet the demands of a booming economy, secured a similar deal to one between Iran and China. India's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption."
420,"LSE 'sets date for takeover deal'
The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is planning to announce a preferred takeover by the end of the month, newspaper reports claim. The newspaper also claimed Mr Seifert was becoming ""increasingly frustrated"" with the pace of negotiations since Deutsche Boerse's £1.3bn offer was rejected in mid-December, in particular the LSE's decision to suspend talks over the Christmas period. Neither has yet tabled a formal bid, but the LSE is expected to hold further talks with the two parties later this week. Despite insisting he wants to agree a recommended deal with the LSE's board, the newspaper suggested he may pull out of the process and put an offer directly to shareholders instead. Meanwhile, the German exchange's offer has come under fire recently. Others claim it will weaken the city's status as Europe's financial centre, while German politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator's promise to move its headquarters to London if a bid is successful. A further stumbling block is Deutsche Boerse's control over its Clearstream unit, the clearing house that processes securities transactions."
421,"20th Century Fox's recent film releases include I Heart Huckabees and I, Robot, while Fox puts out hit TV series 24. Under the terms of the offer, minority Fox shareholders will receive 1.90 News Corp shares in return for each Fox share they hold. The move is designed to help News Corp attract more investment from the largest US financial institutions, and make it easier to raise capital. News Corp investors voted in October to approve the transfer of the company's corporate domicile from Australia to the US state of Delaware. News Corp shares fell 25 cents to $17.65 after the share offer was announced while Fox shares were up 19 cents at $31.22."

His nomination by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon came as a surprise, and led to gains on the Tel Aviv stock market.

423,"EU-US seeking deal on air dispute
The EU and US have agreed to begin talks on ending subsidies given to aircraft makers, EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson has announced. Airbus and Boeing accuse each other of benefiting from illegal subsidies. EADS and BAE Systems, the European defence and aerospace firms which own Airbus, welcomed Mr Mandelson's announcement. ""I hope our negotiations in the next three months will lead to an agreement ending subsidies to development and production of large civil aircraft."" ""It has always been preferable that any differences between the US and Europe on this matter be overcome through constructive discussion rather than through legal recourse,"" the companies said in a joint statement. The US filed a complaint against Brussels with the WTO over state aid to Airbus, prompting a retaliatory EU complaint over US support for Boeing. Separately, the world's largest package delivery company, UPS, said it had placed an order for 10 Airbus A380 superjumbo freight-carrying jets, with an option to buy 10 more of the triple-decker aircraft. So far, Airbus has delivered 40 A300s to UPS."

The company also said 12 senior executives - none of whom were involved directly in the accounting of the revised figures - have voluntarily agreed to repay to bonuses awarded in 2003 totalling $8.6m. Securities and police authorities in both the US and Canada are still conducting inquiries into the accounts. ""With the completion of our restatements we have a solid foundation on which to move forward with our business,"" said Nortel president and chief executive Bill Owens. Nortel added: ""these members of the core executive team share the board's deep disappointment over the circumstances that led to the restatement."""
425,"On 28 December, another senior economic adviser called the sale ""the swindle of the century"". Baikal promptly passed into the hands of state-controlled firm Rosneft, itself shortly to merge with state gas giant Gazprom. Within days, he was stripped of most of his responsibilities. Mr Gref, a well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market, was keen to distance himself from Mr Iliaronov's comments. But he stressed that the government needed to get out of oil. His comments follow the sale of much of oil giant Yukos to cover back taxes - a deal which effectively took most of the firm's assets into public ownership. ""I think that Rosneft and Yuganskneftegaz, should it become a state-owned company, must be privatized,"" he said. ""We used to see street hustlers do this kind of thing,"" Andrei Illarionov - then economic adviser to President Vladimir Putin - told a press conference. ""We don't need simply to increase GDP, but to improve its structure."" Many large Russian companies, particularly in the energy sector, use complex webs of offshore companies to avoid taxes."
426,"It may also increase pressure on China to relax the peg joining its currency, the yuan, with the weakening dollar. The spurt put China's trade surplus - a sore point with some of its trading partners - at a six-year high. With imports rising a similar amount, the deficit rose to $43.4bn. According to the Ministry of Commerce, China's exports totalled $63.8bn in December, taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn. China's exporting success has made the trade deficit of the United States soar even further and made trade with China a sensitive political issue in Washington. A US report issued on Tuesday on behalf of a Congressionally-mandated panel said almost 1.5 million posts disappeared between 1989 and 2003."

Others, however, who had stayed out fearing an imminent collapse because of prices overheating, continued to warn that the ""bubble may burst any time"". ""That's rubbish,"" KSE chairman Yaseen Lakhani told the BBC News website. Analysts argue that a steady improvement in Pakistan's credit ratings by international credit rating agencies has finally begun to register in the market. Standard & Poor's upgraded Pakistan a few weeks ago. The market is abuzz with speculation that substantial investment may now start to flow in from the US, a country seen locally as deeply interested in defusing tensions between the South Asian neighbours. One leading Karachi broker said the real reasons may be political. Then, say analysts, there is corporate profitability in the current fiscal year, which has gone up by 27% from last year. ""Whenever the market reflects Pakistan's true economic reality, it is described as a bubble."" ""You can call it a peace dividend,"" smiles one broker."
428,"That pushed the 10 month deficit to $500.5bn. ""The first thing is that when the dollar goes down, it increases the price of imports. ""We are seeing improved export orders. Things seem to be going in the right direction."" Another problem highlighted by analysts was the growing trade gap with China, which has been accused of keeping its currency artificially weak in order to boost exports. ""It seems the key worry that has existed in the currency market still remains,"" said Anthony Crescenzi, a bond strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. The trade deficit and the shortfall with China ""are big issues going forward""."

Hybrids cut both petrol consumption and emissions by combining a petrol engine with an electric motor constantly kept charged by extra engine power. Toyota has led the market to date with the Prius, popularised by a number of celebrities keen to burnish their ""green"" credentials. In April it will launch a hybrid version of its Highlander SUV, with an SUV from its luxury Lexus marque due later in the year. Honda has three hybrids on the market, and between them the two Japanese carmakers sold more than 80,000 units last year. Others remain more sceptical. ""We will not be surprised by any acceleration or deceleration in the hybrid market."" ""We want to make sure we are not concentrating on one technology,"" Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn said. Volkswagen, meanwhile, says it will focus on clean-burning diesel engines instead. And some watchers point out that the price tag on a hybrid - upwards of $3,000 above that of an equivalent normal-engined car, and suspicion of the technology - may still cool its attraction."
430,"But a spokesman refused to comment on speculation that Mitsubishi could end up building cars for PSA and perhaps its Japanese rival Nissan. Mitsubishi has been hit by a recall scandal and the withdrawal of support from shareholder DaimlerChrysler. The US-German firm, once a majority shareholder, decided last April to stop providing financial backing. Mitsubishi's sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles."

The move was aimed at helping South Asian governments find budgets to rebuild devastated coastal areas, though so far only Sri Lanka, Indonesia and the Seychelles have indicated that they will take it up. ""Poverty is potentially the most important impact of this natural disaster,"" said ADB chief economist Ifzal Ali. Sri Lanka's government has estimated reconstruction costs at nearly $3bn. In the Maldives, where 43% of the population already lives on less than $2 a day, this could rise to half. At a meeting in Thailand, ABD president Thadao Chino said he was confident of the country's ""own capabilities to restore normalcy to the affected areas and meet the rehabilitation requirements"". Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and India have enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years, which should cushion them against reconstruction costs. Although Indonesia's northern province of Aceh suffered the worst death toll, the region's oil and natural gas production facilities ""have survived intact"", the report said. ""This is a profoundly tragic event for the region and for the millions who are suffering. It is one of the world's most indebted countries."

The prospect of Fosters launching a major acquisition startled investors, as the brewer said last summer that it was not looking to expand through a big buy in the near future. It has cash available, after getting A$846m from selling property business Lensworth, but it has been widely expected to return cash to shareholders.

435,"Despite signs of pick-up, labour markets and consumer demand remain sluggish, while firms are eyeing cost cutting measures such as redundancies. Borrowing costs have remained on hold amid concerns about the strength of economic growth in the 12 nations sharing the euro, analysts said. If anything, there may be greater calls for an interest rate cut, especially with the euro continuing to strengthen against the dollar. ""The euro land economy is still struggling with this recovery,"" said economist Dirk Schumacher. While Germany's economy expanded by 1.7% in 2004, growth was driven by export sales and lost some of its momentum in the last three months of the year. The ECB ""may sound rather hawkish but once the data allows them to cut again, they will."" ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has remained upbeat about prospects for the region, and inflation is expected to drop below 2% later in 2005."
436,"More young, urban woman are taking up smoking too. ""Xing's statement comes as especially bad news for British American Tobacco"", the China Daily newspaper said of the latest development. China's tobacco market is increasingly valuable as anti-smoking campaigners target public smoking in the West. In July 2004, Bat announced it had won approval for to build a $1.5bn (£800m) joint venture factory in China which would make it the first foreign cigarette maker to manufacture there. A spokeswoman for Bat declined to comment on the report. Bat told the BBC at that time that it had not negotiated with the STMC, and secured approval from ""the highest levels of government"". Bat consistently declines to comment. The STMA is trying to restructure the domestic tobacco industry, closing some factories, though such moves can be unpopular with local governments. The central government of China is the authority that approved our strategic investment."" The paper made no mention of health concerns."
437,"The BRC said Britain's retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade. ""But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. On Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. Mr Frost added: ""The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists' expectations of a 0.3% rise. ""The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,"" he said. ""So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,"" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. ""However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates."" It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain."
438,"The economy contracted in 2003. The European Central Bank (ECB) left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on Thursday. Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said. They have also warned there are more cost cutting measures on the horizon. Many German consumers have been spooked and unsettled by government attempts to reform the welfare state and corporate environment. ""If exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005."""
439,"By 1650 GMT, the dollar was trading against the euro at $1.3280, almost a cent and a half weaker than before the announcement. The dollar has fallen by 50% against the euro - as well as by 30% against the yen - in the past three years. ""The dollar's fall has been sudden, violent and appropriate given this number,"" said Brian Taylor of Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. ""Recent exchange rate movements certainly haven't had any impact yet."" Treasury Secretary John Snow put a brave face on the news, saying it was a sign of strong economic expansion. Figures from the Commerce Department for November showed exports down 2.3% to $95.6bn, while imports grew 1.3% to $155.8bn on rising consumer demand. Although the White House officially still backs the US's traditional ""strong dollar"" policy, it has tacitly indicated that it would be happy if the slide continued. The trade deficit is a large part of the latter. But the deficit with Japan was at its worst in more than four years."
440,"According to the Office for National Statistics, the difference between what the UK exported and imported was £3.1bn ($5.8bn), down from October's £3.6bn. The UK's deficit with the EU fell to £1.9bn from £2.1bn, while its non-EU shortfall dropped to £2.7bn from £2.9bn in October. EU exports rose 2%, fuelled by an increase in sales of chemicals. The country's surplus on trade-in-services remained steady at £1.5bn for the fifth month in a row. Paul Dales, UK economist for Capital Economics, said the figures represented an improvement on recent months. However, he stressed that the long-term prognosis for exports was still uncertain. ""The figures are a lot better than expected but the trend still remains poor,"" he said. ""There have been some very encouraging signs that the UK export recovery is starting to take hold. But there is a danger that this could be held back by the ongoing weakness of domestic demand on the continent."""
441,"Lesotho textile workers lose jobs
Six foreign-owned textile factories have closed in Lesotho, leaving 6,650 garment workers jobless, union officers told the AP news agency. Lesotho's currency, the maloti, is fixed to the rand. ""But we suspect that they left the country unceremoniously because of the end of quotas introduced by the World Trade Organization."" The assistance of a US law had given Lesotho's textiles duty-free access to North American markets. The owners - two from Taiwan, two from China, one from Mauritius and one from Malaysia - left over the December holiday period without informing or paying their employees, he said. Union leaders and trade campaigners have been warning that developing nations such as Lesotho, Sri Lanka, and Bangaldesh could lose thousands of jobs once the quotas were lifted. A Lesotho government news briefing is expected on Wednesday."

It was sold by the Russian authorities to recover government tax claims against Yukos totalling over $27bn. As before, I see my future in public activity to build a civil society in Russia."" Mr Khodorkovsky handed over his entire 59.5% stake in holding company Group Menatep - which controls Yukos - to Leonid Nevzlin. Yuganskneftegaz pumps around 1 million barrels of oil a day."
444,"That decision had followed an announcement by Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern - who is still considering the future of the airline - which ruled out a proposed management buy-out of Aer Lingus. ""What I do after I leave Aer Lingus is still too early to say,"" Mr Walsh told AP news agency on Wednesday. ""I have opportunities open to me. Mr Walsh denied they had been forced out early because of the reports claiming they were set to launch a competitor airline. Mr Walsh said there was no conflict of interest, and, if he was to launch a rival airline or join an existing competitor, ""this thing happens in every business"". On Wednesday Irish Transport Minister Martin Cullen said in a statement: ""A conflict of interest cannot, should not and will not be allowed to arise between their current roles at Aer Lingus and their future career intentions."" ""There's absolutely no question of a conflict of interest. I've been completely focused on my responsibilities at Aer Lingus,"" he told AP.

445,"Small and mid-sized US firms were worst-hit, it added. New EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson said on Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to reopen talks in the aircraft subsidies row, which led to tit-for-tat WTO filings in last autumn. Ten countries, mostly in Eastern Europe, joined the EU in May. ""Although the EU is a customs union, there is no single EU customs administration,"" a statement issued on behalf of Robert Zoellick, US Trade Representative, said. It could take several months for the WTO's dispute settlement panel to report its findings. Explaining why it has asked the WTO to set up a dispute settlement panel on customs barriers, the US Trade Representative's Office said that it wants to tackle the issue ""early in the EU's process of dealing with the problems of enlargement"". ""We think the US case is very weak."

And with their price tags reflecting the heavy investment by development companies, video games are proving almost as profitable as they are fun. Mr Chernin, however, told the FT that News Corp was finding it difficult to identify a suitable target. ""We are struggling with the gap between companies like Electronic Arts, which comes with a high price tag, and the next tier of companies,"" he explained during a conference in Phoenix, Arizona. ""These may be too focused on one or two product lines."""
447,"Three former Ahold top executives last year agreed to settle fraud charges. The suppliers in question are said to have inflated the amount of money they paid, providing auditors with signed letters that allowed Ahold to inflate its earnings. US Attorney David Kelley said he expects the nine vendors will plead guilty to the charges. He added that there may be more court actions in the future. Its other US businesses include Stop & Shop, and Giant Food. ""I don't want to leave you with the impression that these were the only ones involved,"" he said. Among those facing charges are John Nettle, a former employee of General Mills; Mark Bailin of Rymer International Seafood; Tim Daly of Michael Foods and Kenneth Bowman, who worked as an independent contractor for Total Foods. Food companies pay supermarkets and retailers for prime shelf space. Pasquale D'Amuro of the FBI called the nine vendors the key ingredients in ""the process of cooking the books"" at Ahold."
448,"The world's biggest retailer Wal-Mart took out more than 100 full page adverts in national newspapers. Wal-Mart kicked off the battle with adverts in newspapers like the Wall Street Journal, using an open letter from company president Lee Scott saying it was time for the public to hear the ""unfiltered truth"". ""There are lots of 'urban legends' going around these days about Wal-Mart, but facts are facts. Wal-Mart is good for consumers, good for communities and good for the US economy,"" Mr Scott said in a separate statement. Wal-Mart's average pay is almost twice the national minimum wage of $5.15 (£3.90) an hour, while employees are offered health and life insurance, company stock and a retirement plan, the adverts say. In California, the company is fighting opposition to new stores amid allegations it forces local competitors out of business. The move is in response to a British Medical Journal article that claimed ""missing"" Lilly documents linked Prozac to suicide and violent behaviour. ""I think they are going to have a tough time suddenly overcoming the perceptions of some people,"" said Larry Bevington, chairman of Save Our Community - a group fighting to prevent Wal-Mart opening a store in Rosemead, California. ""It was simply wrong to suggest that information on Prozac was missing, or that important research data on the benefits and possible side effects of the drug were not available to doctors and regulators,"" the letter added. Later, FDA medical advisors agreed the claims were based on faulty data and there was no increased risk of suicide."
449,"Sales climbed 8% for the year, the best performance since an 8.5% rise in 1999, the Commerce Department added. US retail sales surge in December
US retail sales ended the year on a high note with solid gains in December, boosted by strong car sales. But as well as hitting the shops, more US consumers were going online or using mail order for their purchases - with non-store retailers seeing sales rise by 1.9%. The increase in sales during December pushed total spending for the month to $349.4bn (£265.9bn). ""Consumers for now remain willing to spend freely, sustaining the US expansion. Given that attitude, the Fed remains likely to continue boosting the Fed funds rate at upcoming meetings,"" UBS economist Maury Harris told Reuters. Looking ahead, analysts now expect improvement in jobs growth to feed through to the High Street with consumer spending remaining strong. The belief comes despite the latest labor department report showing a surprise rise in unemployment. However, long-term claims slipped to their lowest level since 2001."

Australian winemaker Southcorp has rejected a takeover offer worth 3.1bn Australian dollars ($2.3bn; £1.8bn) from brewing giant Foster's Group. Southcorp said Foster's A$4.17-a-share takeover proposal offered a ""excellent strategic fit"" but undervalued the company. However, it said that the offer may represent an 'opening bid', opening up the possibility of Foster's returning with an improved offer. ""Southcorp's board has informed Foster's that it is not prepared to recommend the offer as it does not adequately reflect the strategic value of the company,"" said Southcorp chairman Brian Finn. A merger would create a global player with worldwide annual sales of 39m cases and revenues of A$2.6bn.

Mr Bell took over as chief executive after his predecessor as CEO, Jim Cantalupo, died suddenly of a heart attack in April. ""And remember that in his abbreviated time on this earth, Charlie lived life to the fullest."" In 2001, he took over the reins in Europe, McDonald's second most important market. Having worked closely with Mr Cantalupo, who came out of retirement to turn McDonald's around, Mr Bell focused on boosting demand at existing restaurants rather than follow a policy of rapid expansion."
452,"The US economy grew at a respectable annual rate of 3.7% in the three months between July and September, while jobs growth averaged 178,000 during the same period. ""This is very consistent with an economy growing at 3.5 to 4.0%. While the employment figures are not spectacular, experts believe they are enough to whittle away at America's 5.4% jobless rate. It is congruent with job growth and consumer optimism,"" Comerica chief economist David Littman said of the figures. The US Federal Reserve said output from factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3% - in line with forecasts - from a revised 0.6% increase in October. But utility output dropped 1.4%. ""So there is still a lot of inflation-fighting slack in the manufacturing sector,"" ""Overall I'd say manufacturing at least away from autos continues to improve and I would bet that it improves at a faster rate in coming months given how lean inventories are,"" Citigroup senior economist Steven Wieting added."

Shares in Deutsche Boerse have risen more than 3% after a shareholder fund voiced opposition to the firm's planned takeover of the London Stock Exchange. TCI has called for Deutsche Boerse to hold an emergency general meeting to discuss the bid for LSE. Opposition from TCI has fuelled speculation that the proposed takeover could fail. ""We prefer a sensible entrepreneurial solution at a price that is not too high,"" said Rolf Dress, a spokesman for Union Investment. ""If that cannot be achieved, then we would wish for a distribution of liquid assets to shareholders."" The Deutsche Boerse was prepared to pay for the LSE ""exceeds the potential benefits of this acquisition"", said TCI. It quoted a spokesman for US-based hedge fund Atticus Capital complaining that the planned takeover appeared to be motivated by ""empire-building"" rather than the best interests of shareholders. Yet under German business law, DB does not have to gain shareholder approval before making a significant acquisition."

Unions criticised the possible move - which may affect cabin and maintenance staff - saying Qantas was profitable. ""We are totally committed to continuing to grow jobs in Australia,"" Mr Dixon said. In a statement, Qantas said it was looking to build its operations overseas.

The paper added that most of the taxes claimed are linked to the company's export activity. Gazprom is set to merge with state oil firm Rosneft, the company that eventually acquired Yuganskneftegas, the main unit of embattled oil giant Yukos.

The issue will also be discussed at Tuesday's Ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all 25 EU members. ""Only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the EU."" Mr Schroeder also called for heads of government to play a larger role in shaping reforms to the pact.

Deloitte's chief economic advisor Roger Bootle said: ""The biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown. It expects a series of ""aggressive"" interest rate cuts over the next two years, with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 4.75% mark to 3.5% by the end of 2006. ""Whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth, this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace.""

Choking traffic jams in Beijing are prompting officials to look at reorganising car parking charges. ""The price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable,"" said Wang Yan, an official from the Beijing Municipal Commission for Development and Reform quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper. The trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks, making motorists reluctant to use them. Mr Wang said his review team may scrap the relatively cheap hourly fee near such places and impose a higher flat rate during matches. Indoor parking bays can cost up to 250% more than outdoor ones. Unclogging Beijing's increasingly impassable streets is a major concern for the Chinese authorities, who are building dozens of new roads to create a showcase modern city ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games. Mr Wang's team are also going to look into complaints from residents about poor service received in exchange for compulsory monthly fees of up to 400 yuan ($48; £26)."

Deregulation is expected to boost demand for accident and damage cover. However, the authorities have turned a blind eye to the many other firms selling insurance. Previously, only NCCI has been legally allowed to offer insurance products within Saudi Arabia. Policy-makers also want to make having insurance more of a requirement, but first have to take steps to boost public confidence in the system, analysts said. More than 800,000 applicants got 9 shares each for 205 riyals apiece."
476,"Citizens Bank and Canal Bank are the two lenders that were identified. The admission is part of an apology sent to JP Morgan staff after the bank researched its links to slavery in order to meet legislation in Chicago. Because of defaults by plantation owners, Citizens and Canal ended up owning about 1,250 slaves. ""We all know slavery existed in our country, but it is quite different to see how our history and the institution of slavery were intertwined,"" JP Morgan chief executive William Harrison and chief operating officer James Dimon said in the letter. ""The slavery era was a tragic time in US history and in our company's history."" The bank said that it is a ""very different company than the Citizens and Canal Banks of the 1800s""."
477,"The protocol, signed in Cairo, will establish what are called ""qualified industrial zones"" in Egypt. The protocol establishing the zones has been stalled for years.

But in recent weeks an unusual warmth has crept into relations between the two countries. Egypt and Israel seal trade deal
In a sign of a thaw in relations between Egypt and Israel, the two countries have signed a trade protocol with the US, allowing Egyptian goods made in partnership with Israeli firms free access to American markets. But there are also pressing economic reasons for Egypt's decision to enter into the trade agreement."
478,"In addition, the company said 2004 net income was affected by a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge taken to reduce the value of a receivable owed to Ford by Visteon, a former subsidiary. It also brought out a number of new models in the second half of 2004. For the full year, Ford's worldwide automotive division earned a pre-tax profit of $850m, a $697m improvement from $153m a year ago. ""In 2004, our company gained momentum, delivering...more new products, and more innovative breakthroughs, such as the Escape Hybrid, the industry's first full-hybrid sport utility vehicle,"" said chairman and chief executive officer Bill Ford."" ""We also confronted operating challenges with our Jaguar brand and high industry marketing costs,"" he added. However, Ford is working hard to revitalise its product portfolio, unveiling the Fusion and Zephyr models at the International Motor Show in Detroit. But Ford declined to provide guidance for first quarter 2005. It will do so at a presentation in New York on 26 January. Fourth-quarter vehicle unit sales totalled 1,751,000, a decline of 133,000 units."
479,"Net income in the last quarter was 4.3bn rupees ($98m; £52m), against 2.7bn a year earlier. Wipro said demand was strong, allowing it to increase the prices it charged. Wipro offers services such as call centres to foreign clients and has worked for more than half of the companies on the Fortune 500 list. ""But the guidance is positive and pricing going up is good news."" ""On the face of it, the results don't look very exciting,"" said Apurva Shah, an analyst at ASK-Raymond James. One problem identified by Wipro was the high turnover of its staff."
480,"Retail sales dropped by 1% on the month in December, after a 0.6% rise in November, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. A number of retailers have already reported poor figures for December. The last time retailers endured a tougher Christmas was 23 years previously, when sales plunged 1.7%. Investec chief economist Philip Shaw said he did not expect the poor retail figures to have any immediate effect on interest rates. However, reports from some High Street retailers highlight the weakness of the sector. Yet, other retailers - including HMV, Monsoon, Jessops, Body Shop and Tesco - reported that festive sales were well up on last year. ""The retail sales figures are very weak, but as Bank of England governor Mervyn King indicated last night, you don't really get an accurate impression of Christmas trading until about Easter,"" said Mr Shaw. ""Our view is the Bank of England will keep its powder dry and wait to see the big picture."""
481,"Nearly 9,000 business leaders in 104 countries were surveyed for Business and HIV/AIDS: Commitment and Action? Dr Taylor described the level of action taken by businesses as revealed by the report as ""too little, too late"". Most (71%) have no policies in place to address the disease. ""Too few companies are responding proactively to the social and business threats,"" said Dr Kate Taylor, head of the WEF's global Health Initiative. The finding comes in a report published on Thursday by the World Economic Forum, Harvard and the UN aids agency. The UN programme tackling Aids, UNAIDS, pointed out that having a clear strategy for dealing with HIV/Aids was a good investment as well as being socially responsible. Across sub-Saharan Africa, even in countries with an HIV prevalence of 10-19%, only around 7% of companies have formal HIV/Aids policies in place, according to the report. ""Companies should encourage all workers to know their HIV status, making it as routine as monitoring blood pressure or cholesterol,"" he said. ""Providing access to treatment is a critical part of this."" A key priority, in both high and low-prevalence settings, said the WEF is to establish a policy based on non-discrimination and confidentiality."

Despite struggling since it was opened in 1992, EuroDisney has recently made progress in turning its business around and ticket sales have picked up. EuroDisney remains Europe's largest single tourist attraction, attracting some 12.4 million visitors annually. EuroDisney will sell the new shares priced at 9 euros cents each."

It is understood that the board also considered Anil's resignation and asked him to reconsider his decision. India's Reliance family feud heats up
The ongoing public spat between the two heirs of India's biggest conglomerate, Reliance Group, has spilled over to the board meeting of a leading company within the group.

Mukesh is the company's chairman and Anil its deputy, and it is expected that both brothers will come face to face in the meeting."
486,"The Brazilian city of Porto Alegre will host the rival World Social Forum, timed to run in parallel with the WEF's ritzier event in Davos. ""Global warming"" features particularly high. The snow is piled high across the mountain village, and at night the wind chill takes temperatures down to minus 20C and less. The organisers of the Brazilian gathering, which brings together thousands of campaigners against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes, have promised to set an alternative agenda to that of the Swiss summit. But much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to Davos, not least because the agenda of this year's forum seems to lack an overarching theme. ""Taking responsibility for tough choices"" is this year's official talking point, hinting at a welter of knotty problems. The Brazilian government has plans to switch all government computers from Microsoft to Linux. Pointedly, only one senior official from President Bush's new administration is scheduled to attend. Davos itself is in deep frost. Mr Blair's appearance will be keenly watched too, as political observers in the UK claim it is a calculated snub against political rival Chancellor Gordon Brown, who was supposed to lead the UK government delegation."
487,"Past Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts said there would be a $348bn shortfall in the 2005 fiscal year. In November, the gap between US exports and imports widened to more than $60bn, a record figure. The CBO says it envisages a further ""orderly"" decline in the greenback over the next two years as the twin deficit drives dollar investors away. However, analysts say the new figures fail to take into account the potential $2-$3.8 trillion costs of the president's plan to revamp state pensions and extend tax cuts. The CBO also forecast a total shortfall of $855bn for the years from 2006 to 2015, an improvement on previous projections. The figure could also be worsened by any further military costs. One of President George W Bush's election pledges was to halve the budget deficit within five years."
488,"The move was widely criticised at the time, and now the German regulator has said it has found evidence of possible market manipulation. If the traders are found guilty, they could face a five-year jail term or a fine, Reuters reported BaFin as saying. Germany's financial watchdog BaFin told BBC News it had now transferred the investigation to the public prosecutor. ""We found clues of possible market manipulation,"" the spokeswoman said, which included signs of linked bond trading ahead of the main trades on 2 August. ""We are disappointed that the BaFin has referred to the prosecutor the question of whether action should be brought against individuals involved,"" Citigroup said. ""Germany's Securities Trading Act says that if BaFin finds such clues, it has to put the case in the hands of the prosecutor."" Its private banking operation in Japan was closed down by regulators in Tokyo after an ""aggressive sales culture"" led the bank to flout anti-money laundering rules."
489,"The Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE) said it fell to 9.6% in December from 10.6% in November and 10.9% in December 2003. The unemployment rate has been falling gradually since April 2004 when it reached a peak of 13.1%. The jobless rate average for the whole of 2004 was 11.5%, down from 12.3% in 2003, the IBGE said. Nevertheless, some analysts say that unemployment could increase in the next months. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva promised to reduce unemployment when he was elected two years ago. ""The data is favourable, but a lot of jobs are temporary for the (Christmas) holiday season, so we may see slightly higher joblessness in January and February,"" Julio Hegedus, chief economist with Lopes Filho & Associates consultancy in Rio de Janeir, told Reuters news agency. The unemployment rate is measured in the six main metropolitan areas of Brazil (Sao Paolo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Recife, Salvador and Porto Alegre), where most of the population is concentrated."
490,"This aid comes on top of a previously-pledged $3.4bn package. The 19 member countries of the Paris Club are owed about $5bn this year in debt repayments by nations affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami. ""What is true is that we are still discussing... the Paris Club decision to find out more details such as how much of our debt will be subject to a moratorium. Nevertheless, one of Mr Bakrie's deputies, Mahendra Siregar, told AFP news agency that Indonesia was still considering the offer by the Paris Club of rich creditor nations to temporarily suspend its debt payments. That's how far we are at this stage,"" said Mr Siregar. Thailand and India have however declined the offer, with Thailand prefering to keep up with its payments while India said it would prefer to rely on its own resources rather than on international aid. Putting off payments may lower a country's rating among financial organisations, making it more expensive and more difficult for them to borrow money in the future, analysts said."

And overall investment in fixed assets was still high, up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. China continues rapid growth
China's economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004, faster than predicted and well above 2003's 9.1%. The result could be higher interest rates. Despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said. China's economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, but also from soaring sales overseas. ""There is no sign of a slowdown in 2005,"" said Tim Congdon, economist at ING Barings. Despite urging to ease the peg, officials insist they are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate. ""Those who hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will not succeed in making a profit."""
493,"In a speech at the London School of Economics, William Donaldson promised ""several initiatives"". The Act comes into force in mid-2005. It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts. The 300-shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy, a delisting. Seen as particularly costly to implement, Section 404 obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm's internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts. Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would ""continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements"". ""We should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections"" without turning the US market into ""one with no exit"", he said. He revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the Act's least popular measure - Section 404 - for foreign firms. A delegation of European firms visited the SEC in December to press for change, the Financial Times reported. Air China picked the London Stock Exchange for its secondary listing in its $1.07bn (£558m) stock market debut last month."
494,"In percentage terms, an average of 44% of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse, compared to 34% who said it was improving. Those surveyed in three countries were split. The BBC's David Willey in Rome says one reason for that result is the changeover from the lira to the euro in 2001, which is widely viewed as the biggest reason why their wages and salaries are worth less than they used to be. The countries where people were most optimistic, both for the world and for their own families, were two fast-growing developing economies, China and India, followed by Indonesia. ""While the world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago, people seem to not have fully absorbed this development, though they are personally experiencing its effects,"" said Pipa director Steven Kull. ""People around the world are saying: 'I'm OK, but the world isn't'."" There may be a perception that war, terrorism and religious and political divisions are making the world a worse place, even though that has not so far been reflected in global economic performance, says the BBC's Elizabeth Blunt. Pipa conducted the poll from 15 November 2004 to 3 January 2005 across 22 countries in face-to-face or telephone interviews. The Philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents' families, but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy. The margin of error is between 2.5 and 4 points, depending on the country."

The yen, meanwhile, had strengthened to 102.975 against the dollar by 0730 GMT."
496,"The charges carry sentences of up to 20 years. One of the more bizarre aspects of the trial focused on the claims that Mr Elgindy may have had foreknowledge of the 11 September terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. Mr Elgindy was convicted of racketeering, securities fraud and extortion. He was led weeping from the court room by US marshals, AP said. ""Under the guise of protecting investors from fraud, Royer and Elgindy used the FBI's crime-fighting tools and resources actually to defraud the public,"" said US Attorney Roslynn Mauskopf. When the guilty verdict was announced by the jury foreman, Mr Elgindy dropped his face into his hands and sobbed, the Associated Press news agency reported. Defense lawyers contended that Mr Royer had been feeding information to Mr Elgindy and another trader in an attempt to expose corporate fraud. No charges were brought in relation to these allegations."
497,"The other is China Construction Bank. Both are expected to list abroad during 2005. However, a report in the China-published Economic Observer said on Monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in New York because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the Enron scandal. China's banking sector is burdened with at least $190bn of bad debt according to official data, though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. The most high-profile case involved the ex-president of Bank of China, Wang Xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003. Officially, one in five loans is not being repaid. Bank of China is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. Government policy sees the bank listings as vital economic reforms. China's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. But two problems persist."

He was returning from China, where he had headed when CAO announced its trading debacle in late-November. The firm had been betting heavily on a fall in the price of oil during October, but prices rose sharply instead. Among the creditors whose backing CAO needs for its restructuring plan are banking giants such as Barclay's Capital and Sumitomo Mitsui, as well as South Korean firm SK Energy. It cut its holding from 75% to 60% on 20 October."

500,"Planning Minister Julio De Vido has offered State help but not for ""free"". He added that the government is in discussions with Aguas Argentinas about what role it might take in the event that a State contribution is agreed. The Planning Minister didn't rule out the possibility of cancelling Aguas Argentinas water concession. Yet he added that he didn't like to do ""futurology"". The government has rejected the 60% rise and wants Aguas Argentinas to make an annual investment of 400m pesos ($136m; £72.3m) in improvements. He added that in the coming weeks the future of Aguas Argentinas would be decided. During the last financial crisis in Argentina, the firm sued the state alleging that converting its tariffs from US dollars to pesos, and then freezing them during devaluation, had affected the company and made it difficult for it to meet its contractual obligations. He has also asked for more investments to meet the growing demand for water. But last week, Argentine Economic Minister, Roberto Lavagna, told the French media in Paris that the government was considering allowing a 16% increase in tariffs and the possibility of a State contribution to Aguas Argentinas infrastructure investments. The firm agreed to invest 242m pesos."

Demonstrators took to the streets last week when the cost change was first announced, but police seemed to have restored order. Even before the hike, failing economic conditions had been fanning resentment in some of Algeria's poorest regions. The price of butane gas, a vital fuel for cooking, has risen to 200 dinars ($2.77) per canister from 170 dinars. El Watan said that a number of hot spots centred on the villages and towns close to Bouira, about 100 kilometres (60 miles) south of the capital Algiers."

India's biggest carmaker Maruti has reported a sharp increase in quarterly profit after a booming economy and low interest rates boosted demand. Figures show that only eight people per thousand are car owners. Maruti accounts for half of India's domestic car sales, luring consumers with cheap, fuel-efficient vehicles. The company, majority-owned by Japan's Suzuki, said an increase in steel and other raw material prices was partially offset by cost cutting. Demand in India also has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said."

economic power to Iraq's future after this Sunday's elections. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said 700,000 people in poor countries were on life-extending drugs - up from 440,000 six months earlier but amounting to only 12% of the 5.8 million who needed them. Showbiz figures will also put in an appearance, from U2 frontman Bono - a well-known campaigner on trade and development issues - to Angelina Jolie, a goodwill campaigner for the UN on refugees. But the political discussions, focusing on Iran, Iraq and China, are likely to dominate media attention. Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend. In contrast, the Davos forum is dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world's 500 largest companies scheduled to attend. Asian and American executives, however, were much more confident than their European counterparts."
504,"China accounted for 20.1% of Japan's trade in 2004, compared with 18.6% for the US. In 2004, Japan's imports from and exports to China (and Hong Kong) added up to 22,201bn yen ($214.6bn;£114.5bn). During 2004, Japan's trade surplus grew 17.9% to 12.011 trillion yen, with more than half the surplus, 6.962 trillion yen, accounted for by its trade with the US. This is the highest figure for Japanese trade with China since records began in 1947. In December, the surplus grew 1.8% on a year ago to 1.14 trillion yen thanks to stronger-than-expected exports. Analysts see two spurs to future growth as being China's membership of the World Trade Organisation and lower trade tariffs."
505,"In spite of the allegations against him, Mr Botin continues to lead Santander, and was instrumental in the £8.5bn takeover last November of the British bank Abbey National. However, the trial was suspended when Mr Botin's lawyer introduced a new set of documents on the day testimony was set to begin. As he arrived at Spain's High Court earlier on Wednesday, Mr Botin greeted the waiting media, saying: ""I have full faith in justice."" Santander's board of governors strongly reject the charges against their chairman, saying the payouts were legal and made with their unanimous support. But if convicted, Mr Botin could face a prison term of up to six years. Since taking over the chairmanship in 1986, he has turned Santander into one of the top ten biggest banks in the world."
506,"The figure is in line with Treasury and Bank of England forecasts. The annual figure marked out the best year since 2000, and was also well ahead of the 2.2% recorded in 2003. ""The fact that other services components are doing so well suggests to me that we are back to trend (growth) and I am not particularly concerned about any further slowdown,"" said Ross Walker, UK economist at RBS Financial Markets. However, output in the production sector contracted 0.5%, the second quarterly fall in row and a state of affairs that some economists classify as a recession. However the ONS would not comment on the definition of a recession and whether the manufacturing recovery was over. But Steve Radley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation EEF, said: ""These figures remain at odds with what is actually happening on the ground. Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Gerrard, said: ""This outturn (of 0.7%) was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the UK economy."" And he said the GDP figures may help to ""push interest rate expectations a little higher along the curve"". ""The suggestion from the money markets is that the next move is now more likely to be in an upward rather than a downward direction. This is consistent with our own thinking,"" said Mr Rubinsohn."
507,"Prosecutors said he was motivated by wealth - spending about $200m between 1996 and 2002 while earning much less. After federal agents raided HealthSouth's offices in March 2003, the company said none of its past financial statements could be relied on. ""We will present evidence that Richard Scrushy knew about the conspiracy, that he participated in the conspiracy and that he profited,"" prosecutor Alice Martin told the court. Mr Scrushy is the first chief executive to be tried for breaching the Sarbanes Oxley Act - a law introduced in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom frauds which obliges corporate bosses to vouch for the accuracy of their companies' results. Among the charges he faces are conspiracy to commit fraud, filing false statements and money laundering."
508,"Global business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. After a string of corporate scandals in the United States - from Enron to WorldCom - the Sarbanes-Oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent, but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money. Surprisingly, the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the US dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore, unlike even a year ago, when it was cited as the third-largest problem. But PwC's global chief executive, Samuel DiPiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers. Possibly as a result, the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of companies calling it a ""significant threat"" or ""one of the biggest threats"". According to Frank Brown, global advisory leader at PwC , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: ""One risk in one region - for example the Middle East - won't kill your business anymore."" - For the survey, PricewaterhouseCoopers interviewed 1,324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004."

A great deal of credible evidence proves the Biblical version of Jesus' life was true, according to the Bishop. The Da Vinci Code has been translated into 42 languages and has spawned its own cottage industry of publications, including guides on to how to read the book, rebuttals and counter claims.

Uganda's authorities have banned the play The Vagina Monologues, due to open in the capital, Kampala this weekend.

The show, which has been a controversial sell-out around the world, explores female sexuality and strength through individual women telling their stories through monologues. The Ugandan Media Council said the performance would not be put on as it promoted and glorified acts such as lesbianism and homosexuality. ""The play is obscene and pornographic although it was under the guise of women's liberation,"" MP Kefa Ssempgani told parliament. ""I'm amazed that this country Uganda gives the impression that it is progressive and supports women's rights and the notions of free speech; yet when women want to share their stories the government uses the apparatus of state to shut us up."""

She became ill with diphtheria but kept in touch, and, eventually, with a governess in tow, joined Diaghilev in Monte Carlo when she was 14. She even appeared in Hollywood movies. Her version of Giselle, all lightness and grace, is still considered to be among the finest ever. She also began working with young choreographers such as Anthony Tudor and Frederick Ashton who became huge influences on the direction of ballet in the west. She retired in 1963, an ""instant decision"" she said, ""largely because of a leg injury"". A critic once said of Dame Alicia Markova's dancing: ""She gave the illusion of moving as if she had no weight to get off the ground."""

At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet's Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata and Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos. Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich's Radio Orchestra.

It spreads like wildfire from community to community. Please speak out. The National Book Awards non-fiction prize was awarded to Kevin Boyle's for Arc of Justice, which focuses on a black family's fight to live in a white Detroit neighbourhood in the 1920s. Censors hate publicity."" But his argument that the award should help sell books instead of honouring excellence is not shared by everyone.

But Redford knows this and started the Sundance TV Channel in an effort to reach a wider audience. Educated, middle class and predominantly white Americans comes Sundance, with views from the same end of the political spectrum - anti-war and socially liberal. ""I think many voices are being shut down or accused of being unpatriotic if they want to express another point of view. Sundance isn't just one big screening.

Emma Watson is ever better as Hermione, and the young stars are joined by the usual myriad famous actors including Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson. But what seems like a long list of features can be swiftly whittled down to the few that you are going to watch. But it is laden with behind-the-scenes extras, including funny, if shallow, interviews with all the main cast. Adult viewers will ignore those and go straight to the deleted scenes."

The institute concluded the threat of regulation, which went into freefall following Janet Jackson's 'wardrobe malfunction' during a live Super Bowl performance in February, ""had a profound effect on television"". The Institute also cited the death of actor Marlon Brando and the changing landscape of TV news in the US. It its place, the AFI fears, is a news landscape where ""newscasters are more personalities than journalists"" and balance and integrity are increasingly ignored. ""Unsure of how the FCC will rule on an issue, the creative community has begun to self-censor their shows, a disturbing trend in a country founded on free expression,"" the AFI jury declared."
558,"De Niro film leads US box office
Film star Robert De Niro has returned to the top of the North American box office with his film Hide and Seek. In Hide and Seek, De Niro plays a widower whose daughter has a creepy imaginary friend. Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby led the Oscar hopefuls with $11.8m (£6.3m), coming in at number three during its first weekend of wide release. ""The element of a real actor in a psychological thriller certainly elevated it,"" said Bruce Snyder, president of domestic distribution at 20th Century Fox. It came in seventh $6.3 (£3.35m). The Aviator, a film biography of Howard Hughes that leads the Oscar field with 11 nominations, was at number six for the weekend with $7.5m (£4m)."
559,"Willis is seeking medical expenses after he said he was hit in the head by a firework during the filming of the 2002 movie, produced by the firm. ""We are not able to comment on pending litigation,"" Revolution Studios spokesman Sean Dudas said. In Tears of the Sun Willis plays a US military commander who disobeys orders to try and help save a doctor and patients trapped in the Nigerian jungle. The lawsuit said the star has endured mental and physical injuries as a result of the alleged incident. There were no specific details on the injuries. While Willis does not seek specific monetary damages, the lawsuit noted that the star ""was required to and did employ physicians and other medical personnel""."

Jamie Foxx and Hilary Swank have won the Screen Actors Guild Awards for best male and female film actors, boosting their Oscars hopes this month. ""Thank you for Ray Charles for just living so complex and so interesting, and making us all just come together,"" said Foxx, accepting his award in Los Angeles on Saturday. Taylor, you're my director of the year."" Swank, too, was full of praise for her director and co-star Clint Eastwood. ""You are a talent beyond compare. If I'm half the person you are and half the talent you are when I'm 74, I will know that I've accomplished something great."" The voting is due to end on 22 February - five days before the ceremony."
561,"He spoke as part of a discussion panel, then led a retrospective of his films. He told aspiring young film-makers in the audience not to ignore non-traditional routes to getting a movie made, including raising funds independently and releasing films straight to DVD. ""Even Denzel (Washington), he's getting $20m a movie. But when it comes time to do a movie, he has to go to one of those gatekeepers,"" Lee said. ""It's not something that should be looked upon as a stepchild."""
562,"Other new entries included The Wedding Date, a comedy starring Will and Grace's Debra Messing, at number two. The Aviator has taken $75m (£40m) so far, while Sideways has taken $46.8m (£24.8m) in a more limited release. The road-trip comedy Are We There Yet? and multiple Oscar nominee Million Dollar Baby completed the top five. ""I certainly believe it's a genre where people are going to be more moved by the marketing materials for the movie than by what the critics say,"" said Rory Bruer, head of distribution for Sony Pictures, which released the film in the US. This year, the top 12 films grossed around $91m (£48.3m), compared to 2004's Super Bowl weekend when the total box office was $73.4m (£38.9m)."

The release of a film about the Mumbai (Bombay) blasts in 1993 has been postponed following protests by those on trial for the bombings. ""If you have not gone against the book, then how can you go against the movie?"" Mr Kashyap's lawyer Mihir Desai said. Their lawyer, Majeed Memon, said: ""We had argued that how can a film say it is telling the true story when the court itself is struggling to find the truth? ""So we said they should remove the line from their promotional posters and they did give us an assurance that they would do so."" A special court was set up to hear the case and regular hearings have taken place there for the last nine years, with more than six hundred witnesses questioned."
564,"DVD review: I, Robot
Only one man recognises that robots are a threat to humanity - but that's fine because it only takes one man to save the day in the thriller I, Robot. There is a one-disc version that has commentaries and a Making Of but the two-disc adds more. Remember the National Lottery's draw machines Arthur and Guinevere? They were more accurate than this glossy Hollywood version of the tale. They're covered but there's also a general Production Diary and a Post-Production feature. Clive Owen is the brooding king, Keira Knightly rises above her costume and Ray Winstone gives it all some grit. Less flashy than a David Attenborough show and less detailed than a Simon Schama one, the BBC series British Isles nevertheless turned out to be quite engrossing."
565,"The actor repeatedly refused, throwing the book at her and saying: ""For the last time, I won't glorify the mafia"". Schulberg told the magazine that Brando's assistant realised the film star had warmed to the idea of The Godfather role when he sported a drawn-on pencil moustache and asked: ""How do I look?"" Brando 'rejected Godfather role'
Late film star Marlon Brando is said to have repeatedly turned down his Oscar-winning role in The Godfather. Brando was asked to screen test for the role in The Godfather, as studio executives were said to be reluctant for the actor to play the part following problems on the set of Brando's previous film Mutiny on the Bounty . Every time she went to see Brando from then on, she added, he was wearing a different gangster-style moustache. In fact Brando's Academy Award triumph revived his career."
566,"Dutch watch Van Gogh's last film
The last film to be made by the slain Dutch director Theo van Gogh, called 06/05, has been premiered in The Hague. The killing, and Fortuyn's death in 2002, convulsed the Netherlands. An animal rights activist was sentenced to 18 years in prison last year for killing Fortuyn. Many Dutch people have questioned their country's self-image as a peaceful, tolerant nation in the wake of the murders, which triggered heated debate about immigration. It caused outrage among Muslims and death threats were made against him. Van Gogh's movie mixes real images of the day of Fortuyn's murder with a fictional plot about Dutch intelligence services conspiring to silence the politician."
567,"Festival director Dieter Kosslick says this strong showing signals ""a new consciousness for European films"". ""They're on an incredible winning streak,"" he told the Reuters agency. ""It's just that there are more good European films."" However, Mr Kosslick refused to accept that widespread opposition to the Iraq war had turned audiences against Hollywood imports. Some 350 films will be screened at this year's festival, with a further 300 shown at the European Film Market that runs alongside it. ""This isn't to say there aren't any good American films,"" he continued."
568,"Sky said it was ""honoured to have won exclusive broadcasting rights"" and promised to cover the event ""in a way no other broadcaster could"". Sky's coverage will launch with the nominations on 25 January and will include themed programming across Sky channels including Sky News, Sky Travel and the Biography Channel. ""Sky is the natural place to see the biggest and most prestigious film event of the year, and will cover the event in a way that no other broadcaster could."" ""We are honoured to have won the live and exclusive broadcasting rights for The Academy Awards,"" said Sky Networks' Sophie Turner Laing. Sky first scooped Oscar rights from the BBC in 1999, but the BBC won them back in 2001 when Sky was forced to pull out of a bidding war due to financial constraints."
569,"A Series of Unfortunate Events also stars Scottish comedian Billy Connelly, while Carrey takes on a number of different roles in the surreal film.

They are taken in by their wicked uncle Count Olaf, played by Carrey, who schemes to get his hands on their fortune."
570,"Director Nair's Vanity project
Indian film director Mira Nair has said she was thrilled to be given the chance to make William Makepeace Thackeray's novel Vanity Fair - as the book has been a favourite through her life. Since her 1988 debut feature Salaam Bombay! ""But it was the sort of novel I somehow kept at the side of my bed for many years, and I would dip into every now and then and suddenly get completely mesmerised again. Nair also defended her decision to cast an American actress - Reese Witherspoon - as Becky Sharp, despite the fact that all the rest of the cast are British or Irish. ""As I got older and read it, I think it was Thackeray's clarity - his clear-sightedness about his own society, the fact that he was born in India but came to England as a young man - that gave him the eyes of an outsider, and yet he was an insider. It is a visceral response. ""I love the luminosity that pregnancy brings, I love the fleshiness, I love the ample bosom - it gave me much more to play with."" ""First, when I was 16, it was Becky Sharp, who is a completely memorable character, because I recognised myself in her - I recognised all the ladies who did not want to be ladies, who wanted to buck the system that they were in,"" she said. ""For me, it is intuition - I have to fall in love with an actor. But Nair said that, though this had created the need for some filming tricks, it had in fact also helped the film."
571,"Sideways is tipped to do well at Sunday's Oscars, with five nominations. Other winners included Catalina Sandino Moreno, who took best actress for her role as a drug smuggler in the Colombian drama Maria Full of Grace. Moreno is also nominated for best actress at the Oscars. Spirit awards hail Sideways
The comedy Sideways has dominated this year's Independent Spirit Awards, winning all six of the awards for which it was nominated. The best first screenplay award went to Joshua Marston for Maria Full of Grace. Scrubs star Zach Braff won the award for best first feature for Garden State, which he wrote, directed and starred in."
572,"The World War I romantic drama starring Audrey Tautou, was recently ruled ""too American"" by a Paris court as it was partially backed by Warner Bros. But the Cesar organisers modified their rules to allow the film to compete. Last November a court judged the film was too American to compete in French film festivals. Two associations of French producers challenged Jeunet's right to French government subsidies, because Warner Bros was a backer. But Alain Terzian, president of Cesar organisers, the Academie des Arts et Techniques du Cinema, said the changes in eligibility rules, which allow films ""of French expression"", were made three months prior to the court decision. Best actors are Daniel Auteuil for 36, Mathieu Amalric for Kings And Queen, Gerard Jugnot for The Chorus, Philippe Torreton for L'Equipier and Benoit Poelvoorde for Podium. The awards ceremony will be held on 26 February."
573,"If the 74-year-old does win, he will become the oldest person ever to be named best director at the ceremony. UK critics still favour The Aviator for best film, but believe the best director title will generate a close fought battle between Eastwood and Martin Scorsese. British actors in attendance include nominees Clive Owen, Imelda Staunton, Kate Winslet and director Mike Leigh. Security will also be tight, with police employing a system to detect sarin nerve gas. The 40-year-old comic has already promised not to swear live on air during the show. ""We have the bleep machine ready, but bleeps will be used as needed,"" producer Gil Cates told reporters. ""You need a movie star and someone who is a stand-up comic so they can deal with the vicissitudes of the show."" Details have also emerged of the contents of this year's gift bags, which are given to nominees and presenters on the night. The show is ""a symbol of American culture and has the potential to be a high-visibility target,"" he added. Cates said the covers would be removed if the threat of wet weather receded."

The film is about an 18-year-old girl who is trapped in an old woman's body after being put under a spell by a witch. Its two-day takings represented 1.1 million cinema admissions, Screen Daily said. The film's distributor Toho expects 40 million people to see it in total - almost one third of the country's population - it added."
575,"This year some of the biggest hits such as The Passion of the Christ and Fahrenheit 9/11 came from outside the major studios which are usually responsible for the key blockbusters. Overall figures could be dampened by the lack of a Christmas hit like last year's Oscar-winning Lord of the Rings. Sony Pictures, responsible for hits like Spiderman 2 and The Grudge, are expected to top domestic market share for the second time in three years, with $1 billion-plus in sales for the third consecutive year. ""Many of the films that did well (with audiences) are not necessarily the films that made a lot of money,"" said Mr Dergarabedian. According to Exhibitor Relations President Paul Dergarabedian, the average cost of a cinema ticket could be as high as $6.25 in 2004, compared to $5.80 in 2002. Sony Pictures Entertainment vice chairman. Jeff Blake said: ""We had a really diverse slate this year, and... certainly we pulled off one of the surprises with Grudge."""
576,"It saw off competition from big-budget French epic, A Very Long Engagement, and the box-office hit, The Chorus. Its late release in France made it a contender for this year's Cesars. The wistful romantic comedy directed by Sofia Coppola has already won several awards, including an Oscar for best screenplay in 2004. US actor Will Smith, who won an honorary award at the ceremony, thanked his family and his ""hero"", Nelson Mandela, in his speech. The actors are mostly amateurs and the action is set in the impoverished suburbs of Paris, home to thousands of immigrants from North Africa and their children. Kechiche said he made the film because he ""wanted to show people we don't normally see at the cinema""."
577,"Tautou will play Hanks' code-cracking partner, according to various newspapers. The Louvre Museum, scene of the gruesome murder at the beginning of the novel, recently gave permission for filming to take place there, showbusiness newspaper Variety reported. She also starred as the lead role in critically-acclaimed film Dirty Pretty Things in 2002. She is currently starring in A Very Long Engagement, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Oscar-winning director Ron Howard chose Tautou for the part, preferring a French actress to a big name Hollywood star."

Spacey, 45, wrote, directed and starred in the film, inspired by the life of 1950s croooner Bobby Darin. ""I knew absolutely nothing about Bobby Darin before this film, but now I'm a huge fan,"" said Bosworth, who attended the premiere with British boyfriend Orlando Bloom. ""There is darkness and tragedy in the story, and it was a dream for me to land this part."" The voice behind Mack the Knife, Dream Lover and Beyond the Sea, fought childhood illness to become one the biggest stars of the 1950s, but died aged 37 from the heart condition that had troubled him all his life.

Director Oliver Stone's historical epic Alexander has failed in its bid to conquer the box office, entering the US film charts at number six. Last week Oliver Stone's film met with scathing reviews from US critics. In particular, its portrayal of Alexander as a bisexual has met with a hostile reception and the threat of legal action from Greek lawyers. Others poured scorn on Farrell's bleached hair and Angelina Jolie's unwieldy accent, which Variety called ""a combination of Mata Hari and Count Dracula"" . ""One of the reasons I am being honoured here is Europeans tend to see me a little differently than they do in the US,"" said the director behind JFK, Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July. He added Alexander ""was not an easy movie, but then I've never made easy movies""."

Ray has been nominated in six Oscar categories including best film and best actor for Jamie Foxx. at number three."
583,"The sequel follows the master criminals as they try to pull off three major heists across Europe. It knocked last week's number one, National Treasure, into third place. The sequel narrowly beat its 2001 predecessor, Ocean's Eleven which took $38.1m (£19.8m) on its opening weekend and $184m (£95.8m) in total. A remake of the 1960s film, starring Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack, Ocean's Eleven was directed by Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh. Catherine Zeta-Jones joins the all-star cast. ""It's just a fun, good holiday movie,"" said Dan Fellman, president of distribution at Warner Bros.

Commenting on the diversity of the nominated films, he added: ""Our selection committee had a harder time than ever narrowing down the field."" Geoffrey Rush wins a best actor nomination for his role as Peter Sellers in the recent biopic The Life & Death of Peter Sellers. Shane Meadows and Kevin McDonald, both former winners of the Douglas Hickox Award (for Best Directorial Debut) won best director nominations.

""When Christmas falls on a weekend, it's bad for business,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, which compiles box office statistics. The sequel took $44.7m (£23.2m) between 24 and 26 December, according to studio estimates. Meet The Fockers knocked last week's top film, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, down to third place, with $12.5m (£6.5m)."
586,"But Spider-Man 2 breaks that rule in two. Sometimes quality comes in bulk: this set contains no less than 34 John Wayne films ranging from the Westerns and war movies to The Quiet Man. Then there are commentaries, trailers and a blooper reel. The other universal rule is that DVDs of superhero films will have Making Of features only about the effects. Now is that a Christmas present or what? Give this to someone on 24 December and you won't see them again until early in the New Year. The films look well transferred to DVD, though none has extras. But it's also a disappointment. That's particularly disappointing because originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars Gerard and Gray had agreed to do them."

""It is the most nominated film, and the most nominated movie has won best picture 18 times out of the last 20 years. ""But the reality is Million Dollar Baby is the dark horse. The Aviator has scored a best director nomination for Martin Scorsese, who has never won an Oscar, while stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett are both nominated for acting Oscars. Anne Thompson of the Hollywood Reporter said that Million Dollar Baby was ""heart-wrenching"". ""It's very emotional, it even makes grown men cry,"" she said. ""The performance is based on a real person who was a showbusiness hero with a handicap, who recently died,"" O'Neil said. Million Dollar Baby has seven nominations while The Aviator has 11.

A US TV network is editing BBC Films' Dirty War to avoid showing the front of a nude woman being scrubbed down after a fictional chemical attack. PBS said it will use extra footage for its broadcast, showing the woman ""from a more discreet angle"" instead.

590,"The only people who will know the Oscar winners before they are revealed at the ceremony will be the auditors who are in charge of looking after the ballot count. Former Academy Award winners Gwyneth Paltrow, Dustin Hoffman and Halle Berry will also present prizes. One current concern is the torrential rain which has lashed Los Angeles for the past week, flooding suburbs and causing mudslides. It is hoped the forecast for Sunday, for cool weather but no rain, will prove accurate. ""The last time it rained on Oscars night was in the mid-to-late 1980s,"" said Oscars communications director John Pavlik.

Charles Evans Jr battled over his role with the people who eventually made the film, and won a producer's credit. The Aviator's nominated producers are Michael Mann and Graham King - with Mr Evans and Sandy Climan, Mr Mann's former deputy, left off. The Oscars organisers have picked two of The Aviator's four producers to be nominated for best film. Chinese actress Ziyi Zhang, star of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero and House of Flying Daggers, is the latest name to be added to the list of presenters on the night. The decision also saw Clint Eastwood get his third personal nomination for Million Dollar Baby."
592,"Comedy Christmas with the Kranks, starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis, was in second place. Oliver Stone's big-budget epic Alexander, starring Colin Farrell, followed last week's disappointing sixth-place opening with a slump to seventh place and takings of $4.7m (£2.4m).

Mr D'Souza, who is also the vice-president of the Catholics' national body, has accused the director of the film of portraying a priest in bad light for commercial gains. The film has already been cleared by the Censor Board with an 'A' (adults only) certificate. ""It's about forbidden love.

Mike Leigh is the outsider in the best director category for Vera Drake, a position he holds jointly with Ray's Taylor Hackford at bookmakers VC Bet.

But despite the relaunch audience figures failed to rise and still remain around the three million mark. The All New Top of the Pops was fronted by newcomer Tim Kash and was put together by producer Andi Peters, who was brought back to the BBC from Channel 4 to revitalise the series. The programme will have a close relationship with the BBC Radio 1 chart show, which suggests the relaunched show may be transmitted at about 1900 on Sundays. The corporation said the new show ""aims to appeal to a diverse audience of music lovers"". BBC Two controller Roly Keating: ""It's an exciting new era for Top of the Pops. We want to make it bigger and better so that it becomes the ultimate pop music show for music lovers of every generation.""

Oscar host Chris Rock said he will steer clear of bad language when he fronts the awards on 27 February. ""I've been on TV and been funny not cursing,"" he said during an interview for CBS network's 60 Minutes show. I'm not really worried about it. The 40-year-old comedian caused a furore when he said in an interview with US magazine Entertainment Weekly recently that he hardly ever watched the Oscars and labelled awards ceremonies ""idiotic""."

""He was courteous, and understated, and he adored gardens, particularly creating them for his beautiful wife. A year after BBC Television began, he was seen reciting humorous poems, appearing in a revue, Tele-Ho, and playing the Emperor of Morocco in the first televised pantomime, Dick Whittington. As a friend, he was very kind, and generous."" ""The thing about Cyril was that he was, to use a slightly old-fashioned phrase, an English gentleman,"" she said.

BBC hits Little Britain and Strictly Come Dancing are among numerous British shows nominated for the prestigious Golden Rose television awards. Lenny Henry, who won a Golden Rose for his In Pieces series in 2001, picks up another nomination for his recent BBC show. British television music shows have picked up six nominations, with BBC Three's Flashmob - The Opera up against the UK Music Hall of Fame series, which was screened on Channel 4.

Talk show host Jerry Springer, whose programme inspired the controversial opera shown by the BBC, has said he would not have written it himself. ""If I did a show about the war in Iraq, it wouldn't make me a warmonger, I would just be doing my job to report on the war. Asked whether he thought the BBC should have screened the controversial musical he said: ""I don't know if they should have had it on television but, good Lord, if you don't like what's on television, that's why God gave us remote controls.

702,"Evidence submitted to forensic labs has shot up as a result of the programmes, at a time when many have large backlogs, science investigators claim. ""The CSI effect is basically the perception of the near-infallibility of forensic science in response to the TV show,"" said Max Houck, who runs a forensic science graduate course at West Virginia University, US. Dr McFeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most people's perceptions. ""For example, on television, the toxicology results are available almost instantaneously. But when people find out that it can take several months, they can find that very difficult."" ""My university course started with four graduates in 1999; we're now the largest major on campus - with 400 students,"" he said. ""Prosecutors fear the CSI effect with juries because, for example, they wonder: 'why wasn't everything tested?' Well, in fact, not everything needs to be tested,"" Dr Houck explained. However, he admitted the show had had positive as well as negative effects on the field. Dr Houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level: ""There's more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research."""

A US television network will screen a celebrity TV special to benefit the tsunami relief effort in South Asia. Meanwhile 70 Hong Kong music and movie stars re-recorded We Are the World in Mandarin and Cantonese to raise funds. Around 140,000 people were killed and five million left homeless or without food and water after an earthquake below the Indian Ocean sent waves crashing into coastal communities in 11 countries.

Matt Groening was also at the awards to collect the award for best international comedy for The Simpsons.

The permanent replacement for late DJ John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show goes on air on Tuesday, with three hosts chosen to fill the legendary presenter's slot. Radio 1 said the station was not trying to replace Peel, but would rise to the ""challenge"" of ""keeping his legacy alive"" with unpredictable music. Another change to the station line-up will see Sara Cox return after maternity leave. Good luck to all three of them, not one DJ could fill Peels boots so it's probably a good idea to get them all contributing. This time next year I hope we are saying how well these DJs have done, but I fear this time next year we will really realise how much John Peel will be forever missed. Also, there will surely be a wider spectrum for international music as three top radio DJs unite under the One World name. Congratulations! He played what he liked across the range of music.... this is not going to be the same, and all they seem to be doing is what they already have. Bring back Steve Lamacq. The obvious heir to John Peel is the marvellous, wonderful and talented Claire Kember from totallyradio.com."

""The BBC's spending is not subject to the full independent scrutiny, and accountability to parliament.

A BBC spokeswoman said: ""We share the committee's interest in ensuring the public money we receive is spent well. BBC 'should allow more scrutiny'
MPs have urged the BBC to give watchdogs more freedom to scrutinise how £2bn in licence fee money is spent.

The musician committed suicide in 1980 aged 23, shortly before the band were due to go on tour in the US. The Manchester-based production is called Touching From A Distance, after a book by Curtis's widow Deborah which forms the basis for the film. Mr Wilson, who was also involved with Joy Division's sucessor band New Order, as well as the Happy Mondays, said he would ""rather not"" appear in the film.

""Great songs, a good look, a touch of attitude and a cracking live band."" In last year's survey, Keane were followed by Franz Ferdinand, Razorlight and Joss Stone in the top five - all of whom were virtually unknown outside the music industry at that point. The artists could be from any country and any musical genre, but must not have had a UK top 20 single, been a contestant on a TV talent show or already be famous for doing something else, such as a soap actor.

Late R&B star Aaliyah's record company has failed in an attempt to sue the video producer who booked the ill-fated flight on which she died in 2001. Blackground Records' lawyer Frank Penski said he had yet to examine the decision and did not know whether they would pursue the case. A post-mortem carried out on the remains of the pilot showed there was cocaine and alcohol in his body. Aaliyah was a rising star in music and film before she was killed.

However they said that Busted would ""reconvene in due course"". Their singles include What I Go To School For, Year 3000, Crashed The Wedding, You Said No, and Who's David? The band, which also includes members Matt Jay and James Bourne, made the top ten with their self-titled debut album, as well as the follow-up, A Present For Everyone, in 2003. However, recent rumours have suggested that Simpson has been wanting to quit the band to focus on Fightstar. The band have capitalised on a craze for artists playing catchy pop music with rock overtones."
745,"With a cool, spiky, fun sound previously associated with bands like Talking Heads, they hit upon a style that had been out of fashion for a while and so was ripe for another airing. With their self-titled debut, Franz Ferdinand have achieved what most rock bands crave - high credibility and critical acclaim while also selling stacks of CDs. They have been nominated for three Grammy awards in the US as well as the US music industry's Shortlist award, but lost the Shortlist prize to US band TV on the Radio. Singer Alex Kapranos was studying English at university but had friends at art school, and the line-up was completed when guitarist Nick McCarthy moved from Munich, Germany, to the city. ""We want people to go away from the gigs humming the tunes that we were singing. ""Where's the fun in that?"" The band started out with a DIY ethic that saw them take over a disused art-deco warehouse in Glasgow and rename it The Chateau. The buzz about the band soon spread around the music industry and 40 record labels turned up to one gig in Glasgow - which the band thought was ""totally ridiculous"". ""I'm really glad it was almost comical because we weren't overwhelmed by the seriousness of it,"" Kapranos said. But the charges of running an illegal bar and contravening health and safety, fire hazard and noise abatement laws were dropped."

R&B star Beverley Knight said she sang on an anti-gun single after being ""haunted"" by the fatal 2003 shooting of two teenage girls in Birmingham. There were more than 10,500 firearms offences and 70 gun crime deaths in England and Wales between June 2003 and 2004, according to Home Office figures. Size said he collaborated on the single, which was released on Monday, because he has ""a bird's eye view of what's going on"". Size became involved after two friends, Donna Small and Asha Jama, were shot in his Bristol hometown in October. ""It haunted me to be honest, it haunted my sleep,"" she said."

""We've just had our heads down really, we've never actually broken up, or parted, or whatever. ""So for us it just seems, even though we haven't played for years, we still see each other and write - we just haven't released a record for a long time."" Portishead became an international success and a deeply influential band despite their scant recorded output. Barrow said he was surprised people thought the band, who won a Mercury Music Prize in 1995 for their debut album Dummy, had split up."

We had completely sold out by 4pm."" Gone were the screaming girls to which Simpson had become accustomed. Although many dedicated fans travelled to the gig from around the country, they faced a tough crowd made up chiefly of students, the average age of the audience far exceeding that of any Busted concert. ""This has been a really difficult decision,"" 19-year-old Simpson revealed, ""I hope the fans will understand."" Mike Eccleshall, the venue's Promotions Coordinator, said: ""Tickets had been selling strongly over the past few days, but sales went mad after the news broke. When they eventually got under way, Fightstar's blend of emotionally charged rock was warmly received. Far heavier and less commercial than Busted's chart-topping pop-punk, the band will undoubtedly appeal to a more mature fan-base. ""I've never heard them before, but I'm pretty impressed."""

The latest release is currently outselling the Chemical Brothers' comeback single Galvanize plus other new releases from Athlete, Ciara and Feeder.

The story of Factory records - which also owned the legendary Hacienda club in Manchester - was told in the Michael Winterbottom film 24 Hour Party People, in which Wilson was played by Steve Coogan. But it has not put him off. ""The idea of working with brilliant young musicians, and being close to the centre of popular culture, is just the biggest thrill in my life."" ""I think that is a reflection of how useful and how powerful the indie philosophy is, and how bands prefer it,"" he added. Wilson stressed that the independent music scene remained ""as important"" as it had been during the 1980s, when labels such as Factory and Rough Trade proliferated. ""They can make more money that way - it's a more generous relationship, and also it's a more understanding relationship. ""I think independents are in a wonderful position at this moment in time."""

""She obviously took a wrong step and blew out her knee,"" a Jive spokeswoman said at the time. ""It was an old dance injury.""

Angels is without doubt a great song but I really don't think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on Robbies' goodlooks than the actual song!!! Without Angels, Robbie Williams may well not be where he is now, and Britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists. Not a chance. Best song in the last 25 years? It's a mediocre, sentimental and safe song. Well done Rob. This is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye.

R&B star Jamelia had three Brit nominations to go with her triple triumph at last year's Mobo awards. While she originally planned to get back to work pretty swiftly after giving birth it was actually two years before she released another single. Her comeback song Bout featuring Rah Digga only just scrapped into the top 40. It was her next single, Superstar, that really put her back on the map as one of Britain's most popular female R&B singers, holding her own in a music scene dominated by US artists such as Beyonce and Ashanti. Despite her huge success in recent years, Jamelia remains down-to-earth about her fame and her chances of lasting in the fickle music business, partly due to motherhood. She now combines singing with modelling and supporting charities including the NSPCC and Make Trade Fair. ""When I first got into the industry, I'd be away from home for months at a time.

765,"Joss Stone is a soul artist. It's got nothing to do with what's really going on. It's just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music, because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it. Joss Stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style, just as someone from an inner city, and indeed not from the USA could sing country music. If Joss Stone can be accepted within the urban music community, I think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too. As a black man, I think I agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives. Why does music have to be put into a genre? Good on her. The word wasn't even in use, or common use five of six years ago. What if The Streets had won?"

Ms Love was originally charged with the more serious offence of assault with a deadly weapon, but that was reduced to assault. In the second, Ms Love, 40, pleaded guilty to possessing a forged prescription and painkiller oxycodone.

The Achtung Baby album in 1991 was followed by Zooropa, Pop and their corresponding stadium tours, which featured giant olives, flying cars, live phone calls to the White House and Bono's transformation into alter-egos The Fly and MacPhisto. These came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music, plus wildly extravagant stage shows, while still trying to retain their mass appeal."
772,"If James Brown was the godfather of soul, then Ray Charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. His string of 1950s Atlantic R&B successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock 'n' roll greats, including I've Got A Woman (Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley) and Hallelujah, I Love Her So (Eddie Cochran). His influence has extended to contemporary artists such as Norah Jones, with whom he recently recorded a duet. Compared in stature to Elvis Presley by some commentators, Charles' songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as Joe Cocker, Steve Winwood, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison. Along with Sam Cooke, he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south Baptist church with the ""devil's"" music of R&B to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists. Unfortunately, he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction, which led to him being arrested in 1965. In 1972, he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album A Message from the People. Former Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones, who sang on 1960s hits such as Come Tomorrow and Sha La La, said Charles was one of his heroes. ""I'm quite sure my own writing was influenced by him,"" he told BBC News Online. ""I would put money on the proposition that Ray Charles will have an influence on music forever."""

But Elvis Costello, who had four nominations, and Joss Stone and Franz Ferdinand, who were both up for three awards, got nothing. A live recording of composer John Adams' 11 September tribute, On the Transmigration of Souls, performed by the New York Philharmonic, won three classical prizes. Charles, who died in 2004, got honours including record and album of the year, while Alicia Keys and actor Jamie Foxx performed a musical tribute to him. Rod Stewart also won the first Grammy of his career, getting the best traditional pop album award for Stardust... In 2003, Stewart said he was ""astounded"" he had never won a Grammy - but ""they tend not to give it to the British unless you're Sting"". There were few other high-profile British victors this year. ""It represents triumph and achievement in music that I feel that I deserved, and I'm really glad I won,"" he said."

""We are extremely proud that fans are so excited about T in the Park that they have made absolutely sure that their place at Balado is booked for 2005, and we will deliver one of the greatest events yet for them in July."""
777,"Osbourne appears more than any other act, with two solo records featured. The top five includes Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden and Sex Pistols. A mix of heavy metal, punk, glam rock and even dance music makes up the list. Osbourne said the band's success in the Kerrang! Black Sabbath have reunited regularly in recent years while Osbourne has gone on to wider fame with his family through MTV documentary series The Osbournes. He said: ""Back then you'd hear: 'If you go to San Francisco, be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. The only flowers I ever saw were on a gravestone in our local cemetery.""

He hinted at discontent with the current state of music industry, and said: ""I don't really think that there is anyone in the modern pop business who I feel I want to spar with.""

He did, however, admit that copyright owners have ""partly lost control of their copyright"", due to piracy and copying. ""There is a widespread attitude that private copying is a hobby, it's nice, it's fun,"" he added. ""We were the first to implement a download service - back in 1997,"" he argued. Mr Renner pointed out that, because profit comes mainly from the longevity of a good-selling record, this was particularly damaging. ""It still is quite difficult for the music industry to compete with a price that is zero as far as the illegal product is concerned."" ""We have a severe problem with piracy, especially internet piracy, and we also have a severe problem of private copying. Mr Zombic said that this legal framework was a ""huge problem""."

Babyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: ""There's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back."" Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble.

The first full-scale theatrical production of the musical will make its debut in Vienna on Saturday. The film was never shown in any cinema in Austria and was not broadcast on television until the early 1990s. Many also consider the film to portray a kitsch image of Austria, including yodelling, goat-herds and lederhosen. The song was actually an invention by Rodgers and Hammerstein. Maria, the novice nun who falls in love with Baron von Trapp, will be played by Austro-Australian actress and singer Sandra Pires."

The three boys playing Billy are James Lomas, 15, George Maguire, 14, and Liam Mower, 12. He added: ""The young Billy Elliots in particular, making their professional stage debuts in the West End, will benefit from a little extra time to familiarise themselves with all aspects of the production.""

Both were nominated for Oscars, alongside Julie Walters, who played Billy's teacher."

A spokesperson for the San Francisco Police Department said he may have been detained but they could find no record of the incident. The star went off for 15 minutes before returning to finish his set. But he was released without charge and ""as far as we're aware, that's the end of it"", Mr Smernicki added.

Of the cut now due to Lee, 82, who created Spider-Man in 1962, his lawyer said: ""It could be tens of millions of dollars, that's no exaggeration."" As well as Spider-Man, Lee co-created the Incredible Hulk, X-Men, Daredevil and Fantastic Four characters. Marvel said it would appeal and did not expect the decision to impact on financial forecasts for 2004 and beyond. The ruling also means he is entitled to a slice of profits from DVD sales and certain merchandise. The New York court did not rule on Lee's claims to a share of profits from some Spider-Man and Hulk movie merchandise, which will be decided at a future trial, Marvel said."

""As much as the press argues that Sundance has completely changed, it hasn't changed that much,"" festival director Geoffrey Gilmore said. ""It's still a place for discovery.

812,"It attributed the drop to tighter tax laws and reduced funding from sources such as the National Lottery. Twenty-seven British films were made in the UK last year following a drop in funding, compared with 45 in 2003, according to the trade weekly. ""There isn't anything coming in to replace (the funds),"" said The Libertine's executive producer Marc Samuelson. ""We are in a hiatus."" In September the government introduced subsidies worth up to £4m per film for medium budget films, under new Treasury measures. The UK Film Council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for British film production, when Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Wimbledon and Thunderbirds were all filmed in the UK. The strength of the pound against the dollar is expected to have resulted in a fall in the number of US films shot in the UK during 2004, Screen International added. ""The drop was expected as there was no way 2003's record level of production could be bettered,"" the council's spokesperson said. ""The reduction in indigenous film production in 2004 was due to a variety of factors, including the continuing long-term trend towards co-production of films in more than one country and changes to financing arrangements."""

Spider-Man was born. The comic book genius of Stan Lee
Stan Lee, the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names, has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit Spider-Man movies. But Spider-Man has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (£857m) in ticket sales around the world - before DVD and merchandise sales are counted. ""Just because he's a hero and has super powers doesn't mean he doesn't have problems,"" Stan Lee told the BBC. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Stan Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers. Lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud."

WHO SITS IN JUDGEMENT? The ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous Grauman's Chinese Theatre the first to host the expanded event. Some of the criteria for admittance includes: film credits that reflect the high standards of the Academy, receipt of an Academy Award nomination, achievement of unique distinction, earning of special merit, or making an outstanding contribution to film. HOW IT ALL STARTED The first Academy Awards were handed out in 1929 at a comparatively low-key dinner held at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel - just over the road from their modern day home.

825,"Depp has become an unlikely major star, given his preference for taking dark and idiosyncratic roles instead of surefire box office hits. But it was TV that first made Depp a star. Two years later he played Hunter S Thompson in Terry Gilliam's ambitious but poorly-received big screen adaptation of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The theme of children's literature in Depp's career - and his long association with Tim Burton - are set to continue in his next role, playing Willy Wonka in a remake of Roald Dahl's classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. He has had a long-running working relationship with the equally unconventional director Tim Burton. In 1990 he began his partnership with Burton in the dark fairy tale Edward Scissorhands, about a young man with blades for hands. His performance in Pirates of the Caribbean, which earned him Golden Globe and Bafta nominations, had many critics thinking he based it upon the mannerisms of his friend, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards. He worked again with Tim Burton in the 1999 horror film Sleepy Hollow, and appeared opposite Dame Judi Dench and Juliette Binoche in Chocolat. British TV comedy fans might also remember Depp's guest role in the final episode of BBC sketch programme The Fast Show, cited as his favourite show.

Digital sales in the US in the first two months of 2005 are already more than double that of the same period in 2004.

""Hollywood doesn't tend to like foreign-language films - no-one's ever tried doing a film in a dead language,"" he said. ""If you look at past Oscar winners and nominees, the very conservative Oscar voters tend to go for very conservative, epic-style pictures. If best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches, two of the front-runners would have had to be Michael Moore's Bush-baiting documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 and Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. The film has been a hit around the world. But Mr Dams said: ""It's not an inflammatory film. ""While in Fahrenheit 9/11 there are moments of comedy, I think the way that Super Size Me is put together - the fact it's a very likeable film - means it's won through on charm."" It's a very accessible film, and it doesn't beat you over the head with its views. Dam's pick at this year's Oscars?"

As long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series. My dearest wish, however, is to see a feature length version of Noggin the Nog appear on The Big Screen!! Muffin the Mule perhaps ? Or perhaps Robbie Williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of Andy Pandy. It's all very well and good remaking these classic TV shows and films with all the latest technology for a 'new' audience, but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this, and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it. get full Hollywood remakes.

863,"Stars shine on Bafta red carpet
Hollywood stars brought a touch of glamour to London on Saturday for the biggest night in the British film calendar. Screaming built up into a crescendo as more and more big name stars appeared. Rooting for Staunton in the best actress category was Cate Blanchett, herself nominated for her supporting role as Hollywood icon Katherine Hepburn in The Aviator. Shivering in a floor-length shimmering Armani dress, the Australian-born actress stopped to sign autographs and joked: ""It's tight but I love it."" ""They give me a new energy when I see the best coming out of England and every two or three years is a whole new cycle of tough and young film-makers, and even the older ones are making good films. It's very intense and very loud."" ""To recognise me in this way is a great honour."" British actor Clive Owen, who has won a Golden Globe and a Bafta for his supporting role in Closer, said it ""meant a lot"" to be at the ceremony. He said: ""Just to be here really, at the Baftas. ""It is always surreal and when it is nice, it is nice,"" he said."
864,"She arrived at the ceremony wearing a green silk and chiffon low cut evening dress decorated with beads. British stars Imelda Staunton and Clive Owen are hoping for awards at the Odeon in London's Leicester Square. ""It's unlike anything I've ever encountered.

It's very intense and very loud,"" he told the BBC. Asked whether she was nervous about her best actress nomination she said: ""It's out of my hands, there's nothing I can do. It's crazy, I think it's bigger than the Academy Awards."" The crowed screamed when he arrived on the red carpet. ""It's the first time I've come to the Baftas because it's the first time I've been nominated...I've appreciated British cinema for a long time and to be recognised like this is a special honour.""

865,"Stars pay tribute to actor Davis
Hollywood stars including Spike Lee, Burt Reynolds and Oscar nominee Alan Alda have paid tribute to actor Ossie Davis at a funeral in New York. The 87-year-old was found dead last weekend in his hotel room in Florida, where he was making a film. Police said that he appeared to have died of natural causes. ""Like most of you here, he gave more to me than I gave to him."" Before the midday funeral, scores of Harlem residents formed a queue outside the church to pay their respects to Davis. ""Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its finest hopes,"" she said, quoting the man she knew as Uncle Ossie. ""Ditto."" ""Ossie was my hero, and he still is,"" said Aviator star Alan Alda, a family friend for over forty years. ""But how fortunate we were to have him as long as we did."""
866,"Jamie Foxx won best actor for Ray, while British actor Clive Owen took best supporting actor for Closer. Celebrating his win, the Oscar-nominated Owen told reporters: ""The whole award season is new to me because I haven't won anything before. All of that is a bit overwhelming."" I'm so thrilled and so grateful and I'm delighted that the success of Vera Drake has boosted sales of hair nets and pinnies, which is very good,"" she said on accepting her award. Blanchett, who won a Bafta in 1999 for her leading role in Elizabeth, said: ""Winning a Bafta means an enormous amount to me."" On this occasion, given the other names, it's a real surprise and an extraordinary honour. ""I'm honoured and proud to receive this Bafta. ""Thank you very much, I'm sure you're pleased, although you're not able to see this,"" she said. Aviator and Vera take Bafta glory
Hollywood blockbuster The Aviator and low-budget British movie Vera Drake have shared the main honours at the 2005 Bafta film awards. ""It's an immense privilege to have been allowed the freedom to make as uncompromising a film as I think Vera Drake is and an epic with such a small budget."""
867,"The star of film and TV hits Day of the Jackal and Edward and Mrs Simpson has joined forces with Swansea-born actor-director Terry Palmer. Before that it had been used as a nightclub for 10 years. ""To call it a jewel is not an over-estimation. He was brought on board to save the theatre by Mr Palmer, a long-standing friend of 40 years. There are not many theatres left like this. It is estimated that £500,000 is needed to buy the Grade II listed building. Fox first found fame in the 1960s. He said he was excited by the idea of running the Palace as a charity where young actors could develop, and with an annual Shakespeare festival in the summer. ""If in five years' time the theatre can function in all areas without me, I shall be well satisfied having helped to create a vital living theatre for the city,"" he added.

Super Size Me director Morgan Spurlock has won the Writers Guild of America's award for documentary feature writing. The Oscar-nominated film followed Spurlock as he ate only McDonald's fast food for an entire month. Spurlock was given his award on the same day the European Court of Human Rights ruled that two UK activists should have been given legal aid in their long fight against a McDonald's libel action. The film followed his 25lb weight gain and the health effects on his body, including his liver and cholesterol levels. But he found the leaflet was true in some aspects."

Other films at the festival in the Belgium capital, which runs from 11-26 March, include the US horror hit Boogeyman and the forthcoming sequel Ring 2, as well as a selection of films adapted from the works of Jules Verne. However Frankenheimer pulled out in 2002, a month before he died. Skarsgard then replaced Neeson in the role of Father Merrin, made famous by Max Von Sydow in the 1973 film. However, in August 2003 it emerged that producers Morgan Creek were shelving Schrader's version of the film, having complained it was not scary enough. Harlin's film, released in the UK in October 2004, received lukewarm reviews but went on to make over $76m (£40.7m) worldwide. The festival screening will be the first time that Schrader's film has been seen in public."

In the US the five nominated for best film have been seen by 50% fewer people than movies in previous years. The last time combined attendance was so low was in 1984 when Amadeus beat The Killing Fields, A Passage to India, Places in the Heart and A Soldier's Story to best picture, when 41 million saw the five films. ""People like to have a vested interest in what they're watching. ""When Titanic does $1.8bn in worldwide box office, you've got a lot of people with a vested interest."" Shrek 2 and The Incredibles took $436m (£231m) while The Incredibles took $259m (£137m). ""Eyeballs starring at the movie screen translates to eyeballs staring at the TV screen,"" said Paul Dergarabedian of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations. The biggest box office hitter among this year's nominees is The Aviator, which has taken $90m (£48m) in the US, although takings in the UK have reached only £7m so far. This is not about the public. This is about the industry bestowing awards on what they think are the best films of the year."""

Ms Mendelsohn said the production team had been trying for a while to get Tarantino to direct an episode of CSI, and added that he was a fan of the forensic drama. We had a story meeting with the writers. ""He knows everything there is to know about CSI, and he is into the whole mythology of CSI,"" Mendelsohn said. ""Quentin came in a couple of weeks ago.

A major distributor of pirated DVDs of Bollywood films has been sent to prison for three years. Buhecha, who made £26,000 per month from his illegal trade, was called ""one of the biggest Bollywood pirates in the UK"" by the sentencing judge. His home and a lock-up in Cambridge were found to contain 18,000 counterfeit DVDs and further faked inlay cards. Legitimate Bollywood film distributors have hailed the conviction as ""a major boost"". Despite being arrested and bailed, Buhecha was caught a second time at the end of 2003. The BPI welcomed the news of the prison sentence, but warned there are plenty of other active counterfeiters of Bollywood films. The organisation's anti-piracy director David Martin said: ""The problem simply will not disappear with Buhecha. Others and more will take his place, so it's vital that keep up our efforts in this field."""
876,"He came up with a colourful but unprintable description for these glitzy events, which roughly translates a ""celebrity love-in"". Recently announced changes to the ceremony include lining up all five nominees on stage before announcing the winner. Variety and the Hollywood Reporter have also kept their focus firmly on industry-related news, while in the UK bets have closed on the best actor category, with Ray star Jamie Foxx a dead cert to win. The near constant flow of US film awards, representing directors, actors and producers' guilds, also means ""few surprises"" are left by the time the Oscar ceremony is upon us, he said. ""They adored Saving Private Ryan for example - people loved it and it made a ton of money. ""As Chris Rock accurately said, they're about celebrity and fashion,"" Mr Strauss said. Mr Karger, whose favourite film of the year was Mike Leigh's abortion drama Vera Drake, stayed upbeat about the awards despite his other comments. So despite all this, did the critics have any views on who would win? ""I hope this is the year for small films to triumph,"" he said. ""Audiences don't necessarily want to see darker films such as Million Dollar Baby, Aviator and Finding Neverland, which end with casualty."""
877,"The panel also revealed which nominees they would personally prefer to win. All expect The Aviator to win best film, but many think it will be a close race between Scorsese's Howard Hughes biopic and Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby. ""Sideways should win but it doesn't have a hope,"" said Jamie Graham of Total Film, a position shared by Film 2005 presenter Jonathan Ross. But while Wendy Ide of The Times still thinks Staunton has a chance, Heat's Charles Gant believes her Bafta win will cut little ice with Academy voters. ""Everyone would be incredibly surprised if he didn't win,"" he said. ""But I'm beginning to think Eastwood will get it."" The audience voted overwhelmingly for The Shawshank Redemption, the 1994 Frank Darabont tale of hope and humanity, which received 52% of the online votes and 68% of the text messages. But while he tipped Swank to win, he predicted it would be a close contest. ""Everything has the ability to flip by one vote and go the other way,"" he told the BBC News website. - Jamie Graham, Total Film: Film - The Aviator; director - Martin Scorsese; actor - Jamie Foxx; actress - Hilary Swank."

Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said a good deal had been secured. Every arm of government seems to have had a finger in the pie. ""Delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the Millennium Village and elsewhere on the peninsula,"" he said. The process was confused and muddled."""
902,"He insisted he did not know the poll date, but it is widely expected to be 5 May. Dr Fox told BBC Radio: ""If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all."" He described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric, then struggling to live up to the expectations, and reaching the point of raised voices and ""throwing crockery"". The Tory co-chairman attacked Labour's six new pledges as ""vacuous"" and said Mr Blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. He would not discuss reports the party repaid £500,000 to Lord Ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat. The Lib Dems accuse Mr Blair of making a ""touchy-feely"" speech to Labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust. ""What we learned at the weekend is what Labour tactics are going to be and it's going to be fear and smear,"" he told BBC News. He said: ""This is three-party politics. In the northern cities, the contest is between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. ""In southern and rural seats - especially in the South West - the principal contenders are the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, who are out of the running in Scotland and Wales."""
903,"The research team, under Professor Joni Lovenduski, had set out to look at the achievements and experiences of women at Westminster. Barbara Follet, one of the so-called ""Blair Babes"" elected in 1997, told researchers: ""I remember some Conservatives - whenever a Labour woman got up to speak they would take their breasts - imaginary breasts - in their hands and wiggle them and say 'melons' as we spoke."" Some 83 MPs gave their answers in 100 hours of taped interviews for the study ""Whose Secretary are You, minister"". Harriet Harman told researchers of the sheer hostility prompted by her advancement to the Cabinet: ""Well, you've only succeeded because you're a woman."" Even after the great influx of women MPs at the 1997 general election, and greater numbers of women in the Cabinet, female MPs often say they feel stuck on the edge of a male world. ""We expected a bit of this but nothing like this extent. But she added: ""Some women, including the women who came in 1997, received extraordinary treatment and I am not convinced that if the number of women changed back to what it was before 1997 that things would not change back. We expected to find a couple of shocking episodes."" ""What I think is shocking to the general public is that these things go on in the House of Commons."" But she said there was a difference between the experiences of women before the 1997 intake and afterwards."

""Posters done by them according to our brief. For the record, first three sentences of email spot on. No row between me and trevor. I dreamt up flying pigs. But on the former spin doctor's use of language, Mr Straw said: ""I do know the odd journalist who has occasionally used the odd word that would probably be inappropriate in some circumstances. Pigs not great but okay in the circs of Tories promising tax cuts and spending rises with the same money. Maybe I mix with the wrong kind of journalists."" ""Campbell swears shock."
905,But opposition parties say that will not happen in practice. The Scottish Executive believes that the legislation should be handled by Westminster. The vote is due to be taken on Wednesday and is expected to be close. The new law will control internet gambling for the first time and is aimed at preventing children from becoming involved. A super-casino in Glasgow could be located at Ibrox or the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre.

Michael Howard's ex-model wife, Sandra, is to play a leading role in the Conservative election campaign. The Liberal Democrats also say they are planning to hold daily news conferences with Charles Kennedy. Mrs Howard will make solo visits to target seats as well as accompanying her husband on his helicopter campaign trail criss-crossing the country. ""That pattern will continue. It's worked very well up until now."" She used her speech on the fringe to highlight the work of a drugs charity, Addaction, which she supports."
907,"The families had hoped the apology would be made during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons. Mr Blair said: ""I am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice."" In a statement recorded for television, Mr Blair said the families deserved ""to be completely and publicly exonerated"". ""You could see he was moved by what people were saying. It's a day I never thought would come."" The move followed a huge campaign in Ireland for a public apology after eleven people were wrongly convicted of making and planting the IRA bombs which killed seven people. Mr Conlon's case was highlighted in the Oscar-nominated film In The Name Of The Father, starring Daniel Day-Lewis. He died while serving his sentence. She said it was a ""wonderful feeling"" to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders. ""The people who were still doubting us should now believe that we were totally innocent,"" she said."
908,"TV presenter Anne Robinson said as home secretary he gave the impression he would ""like to kick your cat"". His comments come in a BBC documentary called 'No More Mr Nasty'. He replies: ""What is the inference of that? It would certainly mean no one from immigrant parents could be prime minister."" ""That seems to me an absolutely extraordinary proposition? He says Tony Blair was not worried by his opponents' early performance in their Commons clashes because Mr Howard lacked a ""big strategy"", including on issues like Iraq. ""That if you reach the view that you need to control immigration in the interests of the country you're not allowed to put a view forward if you happen to be descended from immigrants? The film shows Mr Howard laughing at Rory Bremner's impression of him as Dracula, which he calls ""good fun"", apart from the serious falsehood of a comment suggesting he wants fewer black people in the UK. Asked if she enjoys a game of ping pong she confesses: ""Yeah, it would be more enjoyable if I could win occasionally too, but otherwise it's quite fun."" - Michael Howard: No More Mr Nasty is being shown on BBC2 on Saturday 12 February at 2005 GMT."
909,"Mr Blair's refusal to accept the Tories' sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the Lords. The Tories want judicial oversight of all control orders, not just house arrest. These would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights. Mr Blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable. The Lib Dems plan to oppose the Bill in the Lords on Thursday. The second, less stringent, type of control orders would be subject to a court appeal within 14 days and there would be a three-monthly report on their use by ""an eminent and independent person"". ""I believe (the new powers) are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that I will not put at risk,"" said Mr Blair. She added: ""Having a judge impose those punishments without a trial does not sanitise them either."" Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: ""There's a lot of talking left. I would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months."""
910,"Talks held on Gibraltar's future
Two days of talks on the future of Gibraltar begin at Jack Straw's country residence later on Wednesday. In October, Mr Straw and his Spanish counterpart Miguel Moratinos agreed to establish a body that would give Gibraltarians a voice in their future. Gibraltar's Chief Minister Peter Caruana will represent the British citizens living on the Rock, while Britain's Europe Director Dominick Chilcott will represent the UK. Gibraltarians rejected plans for the Rock's sovereignty to be shared between Britain and Spain in a referendum organised by Gibraltar government."
911,"There was an ""absolute crisis"" in the recruitment of statisticians and other social science experts, the Commons science and technology committee added. It also liaises with the government and industry over their social science needs. ""Major problems"" are expected over the next 10 years as the social science workforce continues to age, it said. In its report on the council's work the committee said: ""We are deeply concerned by the skills shortages afflicting, in particular, the qualitative branches of social sciences. ""If the government is serious about addressing skills shortages in key subjects it needs to find a more effective mechanism to achieve this."""
912,"The agreement by the G8 group of wealthy nations would save affected countries £3bn pounds a year, he said. Mr Brown first proposed the idea earlier this week. G8 ministers are also believed to have agreed to instruct the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to complete a country by country analysis of the reconstruction problems faced by all states hit by the disaster. Mr Brown has been locked in talks with finance ministers of the G8, which Britain now chairs."
913,"Shadow Foreign Secretary Michael Ancram said: ""I am glad the foreign secretary has finally been shamed into representing Britain at this important act of commemoration. In Britain, the Queen and Prince Philip will lead the nation's commemoration at a service in Westminster Hall, London. Altogether, some six million people, mainly Jews, perished in the Holocaust. ""Once again this government has shown crass insensitivity until it has been forced by public opinion into doing what it should have done in the first place."" The Tories said they were glad Mr Straw had been ""shamed"" into going, having earlier criticised the decision to send a lower-ranking official. Straw to attend Auschwitz service

914,"Drink remark 'acts as diversion'
The first minister's statement that it was okay to get drunk ""once in a while"" has diverted attention from the real issues, it has been claimed. But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were ""a recognition that people will get drunk"". Mr McConnell was speaking on Monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions. The Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon wrote to Mr McConnell on Tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his ""ill-judged comment"" and withdraw it immediately. Mr MacDonell, political editor of The Scotsman, said: ""I think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill-advised remark by the first minister. The one-sentence comment was immediately criticised by the Scottish National Party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk. ""If you come out with something like this, saying that by all means get drunk, then you will be pilloried for it."" ""We don't want to preach to young people, but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically. ""But that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence. I understand why, but I think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured."""
915,"Sir Mike Tomlinson himself was briefed only this week. His main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications. ""It will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response,"" said the chairman of the Commons education select committee, Labour MP Barry Sheerman. Concerns at school diploma plan
Final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for England's secondary schools put forward by the Tomlinson report. ""If we don't say this is a sea-change in education, we will miss a great opportunity."" The Conservative Party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top A-level grade, no matter how well the others have done. They may be content if it does not ""close too many doors"" in writing - whatever spin is put on it. The chief inspector of schools, David Bell, also said recently that GCSEs and A-levels should go. Another dissenter is Sir Mike Tomlinson's predecessor as chief schools inspector, Professor Chris Woodhead, who has said there is no need for such a ""massive upheaval"". ""One of the reasons why I'm so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it's good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system,"" he said."
916,"In a speech in Edinburgh, the prime minister said Thursday's report reinforced stability and opportunity. And that would be central to Labour's next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced. Mr Brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises. ""In every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future, much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. All of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all,"" Mr Blair said. Conservative Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: ""I can't find a single economic forecaster from the IMF to the Institute of Fiscal Studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances. Many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3% - and fear tax rises or spending cuts, saying tax receipts have been overestimated. ""It's going to take a significant turnaround in the economy to meet these targets."" Mr Blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the ""cornerstone"" of Labour's programme. ""It is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending,"" Mr Cable told MPs."
917,"Tony Blair has said he does not want higher tax rates for top earners but on Wednesday said other tax promises would be left to Labour's manifesto. The Tories have promised £4bn in tax cuts but have yet to say where they will fall. He accused ministers of wasting money on unsuccessful attempts to curb bad behaviour and truancy in schools and on slow asylum processing. Mr Blair instead hailed Labour's achievement in using a strong economy to invest in public services. The Commons questions session again saw the leaders of the two biggest parties shape up for the forthcoming election campaign. ""When we have money not only going into extra teachers and nurses but equipment in schools and hospitals, that money is not wasted,"" he said. On the tax questions, he added: ""We will make commitments on tax at the time of the manifesto."" Mr Blair said abuses would be weeded out and chain migration, where families automatically get the right to settle with immigrant workers, would end. That would probably create a fall in the migrant numbers, he said. He challenged the Tories on which country would house their processing centres - what he called a ""fantasy island""."
918,"Initial business plans forecast a quarter of a million students joining within a decade, bringing in at least £110m in profit. The Commons education select committee called this ""morally indefensible"" but the government said the e-University project had ""improved understanding"". But virtually no market research was carried out and just £4.2m was spent on worldwide sales and marketing of courses. She added: ""UK e-Universities was not the only organisation to have lost out on private sector investment in the collapse of the dotcom boom."" Some £14m went on developing the technology to make the e-University work. With no significant private investors and no direct accountability to a government minister, the e-University had had ""too much freedom to spend public money as it wished"", the report found. Committee chairman Barry Sheerman said: ""UK e-University was a terrible waste of public money."
919,"At slums in Narobi on Wednesday, he said education needs had to be tackled. Speaking outside the Olympic Primary School, Mr Brown said: ""It is simply not acceptable in the modern age for the rest of the world to stand by and have hundreds of millions of children not getting the chance at education."" Mr Brown's aides say he wants to find out more about the Kenyan Government's education policies, which included introducing free primary education in early 2003. The chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a G8 aid package which he has likened to the Marshall Plan used by the United States to rebuild Europe after World War Two. The school is on the edge of Kibera, where 800,000 live often in huts made of mud, scrap metal and cardboard."
920,"Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the organisation, says there is no need for an independent body because Office of National Statistics data are accurate. He says he opposes large-scale immigration ""both on the grounds of overcrowding and culture"". She said her proposals mean ""we wouldn't have so-called independent experts, like Migration Watch, who come into this debate from an anti-immigration point of view."" He said: ""For example, over the next 20 years one household in three will be due to immigration. Ms Roche, Labour MP for Hornsey and Wood Green, believes legal migration is something we should welcome. ""We are already more overcrowded than India and we are four times more overcrowded than France."""
921,"July's G8 summit in Gleneagles in Perthshire - chaired by the prime minister - will use the report as the basis for talks on Africa. Mr Blair told a news conference: ""It will be a report that's brutally frank about the reality, but I hope idealistic about what can be done if the will is there. ""It's an ambitious project we have set ourselves and you will have to judge on its outcome when we publish it."" As well as more aid, fairer trade and less debt, the commission is likely to demand action on corruption in Africa. Bob Geldof, in characteristically blunt style, promised that the commission would not just be a talking shop but would deliver radical new thinking to change direction for Africa."
922,"Lord Butler said the government had too much freedom to ""bring in bad Bills"" and ""to do whatever it likes"" and it relied too much on the advice of political appointees. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Menzies Campbell said he thought Lord Butler's comments were ""well justified"" and Mr Blair's style of leadership was ""corrosive of the whole system of government"". It's just not possible."" Asked why he thought the warnings were not there Lord Butler said: ""One has got to remember what the purpose of the dossier was. ""We should be breaking away from the party whip. ""All that is part of what is bad government in this country."" When asked whether he thought the country was well-governed on the whole, he replied: ""Well. I think we are a country where we suffer very badly from Parliament not having sufficient control over the executive, and that is a very grave flaw. Mr Cunningham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Taken together, Robin Butler's comments are partial, inaccurate and cannot be taken as anything other than politically biased against the Labour government."" The reason for this is that it would have weakened ministers' case for war, Lord Butler said in his Spectator interview, which was conducted by the magazine's editor, Conservative MP Boris Johnson."
923,"Lib Dems demand new inquiry
A judge should look into the David Blunkett controversy as key questions remain unanswered, the Lib Dems say. But he could not say whether Mr Blunkett had treated the nanny as a special case or had used her as an example of immigration problems. He told BBC News: ""I'm extremely concerned that 20 individuals appear to have forgotten what happened or more suspiciously are not prepared to say what happened. Mr Oaten said people would be mystified why Sir Alan's inquiry failed to uncover why processing of the visa application was speeded up. ""So we do need to understand what took place and who was involved."" It may be about something even more important than that."
924,"Honorary consuls will be appointed in some of the areas affected by the embassy closures. It has opened major new missions on Baghdad and Basra in Iraq, Kabul in Afghanistan and Pyongyang in North Korea since 1997 in response to what the government says are changing needs. In a written statement, Mr Straw said: ""The savings made will help to underpin higher priority work in line with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's strategic priorities, including counter- proliferation, counter-terrorism, energy and climate change. Mr Straw said the move would save £6m a year to free up cash for priorities such as fighting terrorism. The shake-up is aimed at helping making £86m in efficiency savings between 2005 and 2008. ""In Africa, for instance, we plan to create new jobs to cover these issues across the region, with a new post in Nairobi to help support our work on climate change, one in Nigeria to cover energy and one in Pretoria to cover regional issues more generally as well as covering Maseru and Mbabane."" The chancellor has demanded all government departments make similar savings. The Foreign Office currently has about 6,100 UK-based staff. ""But the government must give a far clearer reason for making the dramatic changes it has announced and must show that British commercial interests and the interests of Britons abroad will not be adversely affected,"" he said."
925,"Serial truants make up one in 13 pupils. Those missing classes are more likely to become involved in crime as well as failing academically. Previous initiatives brought 40,000 pupils back to school since 1997, according to official statistics. Truancy has been reduced by 5% at the 128 worst hit schools through the government's Behaviour Improvement Programme. This is the equivalent of 200 pupils back in classes since September. Measures such as parenting contracts and penalty notices were adopted by most local education authorities last term and come into force in the remainder this term. Police and education welfare officers patrol problem hotspots picking up truants and returning them to school. In almost 14,000 of those cases, the youngsters were accompanied by their parents. A Department for Education and Skills source said: ""Every day in school counts. ""It is clear form these figures that schools and local education authorities are now seizing the tools we have given them to improve school attendance and crack down hard on the very small numbers of pupils which account for almost half of the nation's truancy."""
926,"The Home Office has already said the review will begin next year. The home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a Law Commission report which branded the current murder law as ""a mess"". But the announcement never came, with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage. News of the review was released because it was thought Mr Blunkett would make the official announcement in a Commons debate on Wednesday. He said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated. But he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be ""dragged"" to face MPs. In its report, the Law Commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder. The commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence. But speaking after the report was published, Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said: ""Murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence. ""Where an offender is convicted of murder, the court must pass a life sentence."""
927,"Richard Dodd, regional director of the Countryside Alliance, said he expected between 2,000 and 4,000 supporters in Tyneside to make their protest, with hunt horns and placards. The Countryside Alliance has lodged papers seeking a judicial review on human rights grounds. Campaigners have been asked not to bring any animals or alcohol. The Court of Appeal is expected to rule early next week on whether the alliance's challenge has succeeded. Pro-hunt supporters formally launched their second legal challenge to the ban in London's High Court on Thursday. ""We are holding a static demonstration, just to remind Labour that we are not going away,"" he said. Mr Dodd said he did not believe there would be any repeat of the trouble which marred the pro-hunt demonstration outside Parliament in September. Northumbria Police said the pedestrian Millennium Bridge, by the demonstration site, will be shut if necessary. Animal welfare groups have welcomed the ban, many of whom have campaigned for a ban for decades saying hunting is cruel and unnecessary."
928,"They said this is illegal under current rules and are trying to block the government from changing legislation. BAA are also owners of the airports at Heathrow and Gatwick. The campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports, such as one planned for the Isle of Sheppey east of London. Lord Hanningfield, leader of Essex County Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are going to the High Court because we want a judge to rule there should be a proper inquiry. BAA's expansion of Stansted Airport in Essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans. ""We want a judge to say there has been inadequate preparation, consultation and thought before the government came out with its Green Paper. ""Then there could be a proper debate nationally about where this extra capacity should go."" BAA also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. He added: ""Politicians should not decide where runways should be."" At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week."
929,"The government has ruled out amending the present law, which allows ""reasonable force"" in self defence. The pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and Crown Prosecution Service would be consulted as part of a review of the law. He told MPs: ""If we get the right response from those people, we will, of course, support a change in the law."" Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens last month backed a Tory attempt to change the law so only householders using ""grossly disproportionate"" force could be prosecuted. He said: ""We've had three policy positions in three months and two U-turns. ""It's not surprising Gordon Brown told him: 'There's nothing you could say to me now that I could ever believe.'"" But the home secretary said Mr Howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars. The new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue, added Mr Clarke. The director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, says only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last 15 years. Those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar, tied him up, beat him and set him alight, he said."
930,"The Downing Street talks covered a range of other topics ahead of an EU summit in Brussels later in the week. Italy and Germany also favour an early start to talks, but there is scepticism in France and elsewhere. Mr Blair is an enthusiastic proponent of talks to bring Turkey within the recently-expanded EU. There are also issues in France and the Netherlands over the possible problems of integrating the first major Muslim nation into the EU. ""The key issue at this week's council will be that of Turkey, but they will also discuss a range of other matters."""
931,"In his New Year message the Liberal Democrat leader said Labour and the Conservatives were united in relying on fear and ""populist scares"". He said his party was the one of hope and was ready for a 2005 poll. At home he said many people were turning to the Liberal Democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties. The general election would be a three-party struggle, as the Conservative party ""fades away"" as a national force and the Liberal Democrats challenge Labour in its heartlands, he said. ""A clear division is emerging in British politics - the politics of fear versus the politics of hope. While the Conservatives are re-working their populist scares about asylum and the European 'menace',"" he said. He said while everyone had the right to be secure they also had the right to be protected against unfair discrimination. He also criticised attempts to bring in trial without jury, plans to lower the burden of proof in some criminal trials, curbing of rights to protest, increased stop and search powers and ID card plans. ""We are less deferential; more inclined to think for ourselves; more open about sexuality and equality. In our attitudes and the way we live our lives, this is in many ways a liberal Britain."""

David Miliband's rapid rise through the ranks of government continues with his promotion to Cabinet Office minister.

Prior to working for Mr Blair, David Miliband spent time at the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research. He was an eminent and influential leftwing academic. He also took an MSc in political science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."

""We are hoping that many people will join us in a march to mark the 36th anniversary of the closure of the Waverley Line,"" she said. ""Campaign for Borders Rail is the biggest independent lobby group in Scotland and we have been lobbying tirelessly for the reinstatement of rail services to the Borders and eventually to Carlisle.

""The law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Lords wrong on detainees - Straw
Jack Straw has attacked the decision by Britain's highest court that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws. The foreign secretary insisted it was for Parliament, and not judges, to decide how best Britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism. He said the Law Lords' ruling was an ""embarrassment"" for the government and major changes were needed to the law. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: ""Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law. The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office's powers to hold them without limit or charge. Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. In a statement, detainee 'A' in Woodhill Prison said: ""I hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal 'law' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones."""
936,"A Labour loyalist from a working class background Mr Blunkett, 57, had been unafraid of pushing for tough changes to Labour policy. Mr Blunkett's own comments on immigration had prompted censure - he told refugees from Afghanistan and Kosovo to ""get back home"" to start rebuilding their countries. He chaired the Labour Party nationally, and was a unifying force in the 80s and 90s, shadowing health and education. Yet in January of this year he courted further controversy over his seemingly liberal reclassification of cannabis, from a Grade B to Grade C status drug . Mr Blunkett told the Daily Telegraph in 2001 that he continued to wear his wedding ring, in spite of being a divorcee, as ""a useful way of ensuring that people don't casually think I am available"". He added: ""I am not available because I am just getting on with the job."" Mr Blunkett was schooled in Sheffield where he led the city council for seven years before entering the Commons. In the Labour Party he has been regarded as a loyal colleague, a conciliator who avoids factions, and a man whose humour and determination make him widely popular. There have been wry smiles as well. Lucy was replaced by her half-sister, Sadie, a black Labrador-curly-coated retriever cross, in 2003 after nearly a decade by Mr Blunkett's side."

The Cabinet Office has confirmed it is reviewing the current pension system, prompting unions representing 4.5m workers to threaten united action. ""Public sector pension schemes need to remain affordable and sustainable. There is already widespread anger over the chancellor's plans to get rid of more than 100,000 civil servants. Pensions officer Paul Woolstenholmes said: ""The pensions of millions of public sector workers are under threat - apart from MPs and judges who have the most generous pensions arrangements in the country."" ""Members working in the NHS or for local government have never had high pay or city bonuses, but they could look forward to a decent pension - now all that is being taken away,"" he said. Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said changes to pension provisions for workers in the public sector would mean they had to pay in more but would still face a raw deal. ""This is a position that Unison cannot accept and will oppose. It will lead to conflict between Unison and the government, if not this year then next."""
938,"A total of 3,028 adults aged 18 or over were interviewed for the study. Parties warned over 'grey vote'
Political parties cannot afford to take older UK voters for granted in the coming election, says Age Concern. He also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to ""support us all in an ageing society"". Among the over-65s, 70% said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election, compared with 39% of people under 55. ""Older people want to see manifesto commitments that will make a difference to their lives,"" Mr Lishman said. ""Political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote."""
939,"But BBC correspondent Peter Hunt said they are not responsible for how money is spent and may be unable to answer. The Duchy of Lancaster provides the Queen's private income, while the Duchy of Cornwall provides Prince Charles' annual income. It has been reported they could be questioned about Prince Charles' spending on Camilla Parker Bowles. It was set up in 1337 by King Edward III to provide income for successive heirs to the throne. The duchy last year generated almost £12m. The prince has voluntarily paid income tax - currently 40% - since 1993."
940,"He was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong. Tory leader 'cleared' over work
Scottish Conservative Party leader David McLetchie claims he has been cleared over a potential conflict of interest. BBC Scotland's political correspondent Glenn Campbell said no complaint had been made against Mr McLetchie, but questions were raised about his dual role. Mr McLetchie said: ""I'm quite clear that no conflicts of interest arise in my case, that the judgement I took has effectively been vindicated when you look at the advice that has been given to me and that these allegations are unfounded."" ""The firm and I have a very good working relationship and we have done for the last six years,"" said Mr McLetchie. ""I don't suppose I'll be working forever as a lawyer or a politician. I deserve to retire from both, but I'm not willing to put time limits on them."""
941,"He is understood to have made a series of criticisms about his Cabinet colleagues from the prime minister down. The home secretary has already admitted he was wrong to give the two first class tickets, given to him as an MP, to Mrs Quinn and has since paid the £180 back. The Tory leader went on: ""He doesn't stop there: he thinks the culture secretary's weak; he thinks the trade secretary doesn't think strategically and he thinks the education secretary hasn't developed as expected. The visit to Sheffield will be seen as a show of unity by Mr Blair. ""He says the prime minister doesn't like being told the truth and the chancellor - no doubt the prime minister will agree with this - is a bully."" The separate inquiry by ex-senior civil servant Sir Alan Budd is investigating whether the home secretary helped fast-track a bid by Mrs Quinn's nanny, Leoncia Casalme, to stay in the UK. On Wednesday during Prime Minister's Questions, Tory leader Michael Howard went on the offensive over comments Mr Blunkett is alleged to have made in a new biography. The rail tickets are meant to help MPs' spouses get between Westminster and their constituencies. Mr Blunkett declined to comment about his own position, saying the inquiry was under way and the High Court had stressed his right to privacy did not affect his job in improving security and stability."
942,"Student 'fee factor' played down
A rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in Scotland. In June last year, Mr Wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for English students studying in Scotland by £2,000 in an attempt to prevent a cross-border flood, although no figure has yet been agreed. Fears had been expressed that a flood of ""fee refugees"" would try to avoid top-up fees of up to £3,000 a year being introduced in England. Legislation to introduce the top-up fees in England is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all. Mr Wallace said: ""Accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which Scottish higher education is held, not just in Britain. Mr Wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context. He explained that when applications were translated into acceptances, the number was not huge - an additional figure of about 200. ""We want to make sure that when students are making their choice, they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to Scotland. ""However, it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from England studying here."""
943,"They raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved, MPs said. The environment select committee made 101 recommendations after hearing evidence from 51 organisations and individuals. The committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill, such as the law on abandonment of animals which ""would be significantly weakened"". Anglers 'could face prosecution'
Anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty, a committee of MPs has warned. This was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted - such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect, or unnecessary mental suffering - to go unpunished. In addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences, it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible. They called for a ""cast-iron guarantee"" that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing. ""We accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the government's intention to exempt fishing as an activity."" ""However, in exempting fishing, the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given 'carte blanche' to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity,"" the committee added. ""This draft bill is no exception."
944,"""ID cards are a means to creating a more secure society,"" he said. Earlier this week the Tories announced they would back the government's plans although Michael Howard was forced to deny the shadow cabinet was split over its decision. Mr Clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but he said legislation had already been ""significantly influenced"" by the recommendations of the Commons' home affairs committee. ""Wouldn't this be a good opportunity for a new home secretary, a new broom, to sweep clean in this respect and why do we need this legislation in the first place?"" Clarke to press on with ID cards
New Home Secretary Charles Clarke has vowed to plough on with plans for ID cards despite a call for him to ""pause for thought"" from Charles Kennedy. he asked. ""What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained."" The new bill will also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents."
945,"He told the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that a ""comprehensive ban"" on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006. ""There are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health,"" he declared. The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by parliament before Christmas. ""There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby ""tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past"". ""But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded."" The Scottish Conservative Party leader, David McLetchie, questioned what would be exempted from the ban. She said: ""The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. She believed the majority of people in Scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke. Mr McLetchie asked: ""Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister's brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals?"""
946,"Courts should be used as a last resort, but where they are, their orders should be enforced more rigorously, MPs said. The Constitutional Affairs Select Committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access. Currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount. This would ""reassert the rights of non-resident parents to contact with their children, as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety"", they said. Committee chairman Alan Beith said the five-month inquiry had been a ""complex and emotive"" one. ""At the moment, far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation,"" he said. ""This will help to reduce delays and improve the lives of many children across the country."" ""This situation has to change."
947,"Nuclear strike 'key terror risk'
The UK and US must realise they cannot prevent all terror attacks and should focus on making sure they are not nuclear strikes, says a top academic. In a report for the Foreign Policy Centre think tank, he says a nuclear terrorist attack is the main danger faced by many nations. ""We must recognise that we will be unable to stop all attacks and thus ensure terrorists will not be able to strike with weapons of mass destruction,"" Prof Etzioni continues. He suggests so-called rogue states such as Iran and North Korea are less of a problem than ""failed and failing states"", which are more likely to be a source of nuclear materials. Prof Etzioni criticises the US for overlooking those reports, suggesting it was done in return for Pakistani help in hunting Osama Bin Laden. ""This is like letting a serial killer go because he promised to catch some jay-walkers,"" he says. He names Russia as the ""failing state"" of gravest concern as it has an estimated 90% of all fissile material outside America."
948,"Other ex-Russian spies have been given civil service pensions. ""Hunger strike is a weapon of last resort. ""Since I came to this country two batches of promises have been made and broken one after the other.""

But Mr Makarov's case has been backed by David Kahn - a former Yale historian, and a leading expert on code-breaking, who has confirmed his information was valuable to the Western allies. Russian ex-spy on hunger strike
An ex-Russian intelligence officer who risked his life spying for MI6 is entering the seventh week of a hunger strike near 10 Downing Street. One of his fellow pupils at intelligence school was Vladimir Putin. At KGB headquarters in Moscow, he was posted to the secret 16th directorate - which decoded intercepted diplomatic traffic from the West. But despite a £65,000 settlement four years ago, he says he has been denied defector status and a decent pension. But after arriving in London 13 years ago, he feels this promise has not been fulfilled."
949,"Vince Cable, the party's Treasury spokesman, said raising the threshold to £150,000 would prevent over 400,000 home-buyers from paying the tax. He said first-time buyers were being ""squeezed out"" of the housing market. Under the proposals, the average saving for a new buyer would be more than £1,000, according to Mr Cable. ""First time buyers are being squeezed out of the housing market not only by higher house prices but also by being swept into the stamp duty net,"" he said. Lib Dems 'to target stamp duty'
The Liberal Democrats are promising to raise the stamp duty threshold if they win the general election, in a bid to court first-time house buyers. ""They can have no credibility until they can say how they would fund their ever growing list of tax and spending commitments."""
950,"Her links to Opus Dei, which means ""Work of God"" in Latin, have provoked controversy. ""We have made huge progress on the really difficult cases, the pupils who have severely disruptive behaviour. Ms Kelly told the BBC progress had been made against severely disruptive children but parents were still worried about lower level problems. She told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost: ""It is really important to support head teachers and teachers in tackling disruption in the classroom. But she denied her faith meant she would refuse key government jobs. Ms Kelly entered the Cabinet last month in the reshuffle forced by the resignation of the then Home Secretary David Blunkett. The government has yet to issue its official response to the Tomlinson review, which recommended absorbing existing exam qualifications into a diploma. ""But those are private spiritual matters and I'm sure you'll respect that politicians are entitled to a private life.""

Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, Charles Clarke has said. A pilot scheme based on ceremonies in Australia will start in October. The Muslim Council of Britain said Ofsted boss Mr Bell's comments were ""highly irresponsible"". The Home Office started work on its Community Cohesion and Race Equality Strategy last year and the outcome, launched on Wednesday, is called 'Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society'. Britain's young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nation's heritage as part of the government's new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. On Monday school inspection chief David Bell, accused some Islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to British society. ""It represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups,"" said a Home Office spokesman. ""It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged."" He added: ""But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing. Some 8% of the UK population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the 2001 Census."

953,"The 15-year-old ban was imposed in the aftermath of China's crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square. Mr Straw said the US government was suspicious of ""the motives of some other countries within the EU"" in wanting the ban lifted. Britain has been more cautious on the issue, but on Wednesday Mr Straw said he also wanted it to end. US Undersecretary of State John Bolton is meeting British officials this week to press the case for keeping the embargo. ""I have long understood China's argument, that to lump them in with, say, Burma and Zimbabwe is not appropriate and I don't think it is,"" he told the joint committee on Strategic Export Controls. But he said many of Washington's objections were based on a ""lack of information and understanding"" of how export control guidelines worked in EU countries. In December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. ""If it is lifted we will end up with as effective arms controls in relation to China as we have now."" US officials say they are not satisfied the mechanisms in the EU code of conduct are robust enough to prevent abuses."
954,"'Debate needed' on donations cap
A cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said. The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. There were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m. ""While we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,"" says its report. It also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning. It also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons, European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said: ""There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. ""Our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. ""The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations."" He called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system."
955,"The cardinal said 2005 should be the year for campaigning to ""make history poverty"". He added: ""If the governments of the rich countries were as ready to devote to peace the resources they are willing to commit to war, that would be to see with new eyes and speak with a new voice and perhaps then others would listen to us with new ears."" But Prime Minister Tony Blair has said he will put Africa at the top of the agenda when Britain chairs the G8 summit next year. Dr Williams has since criticised the government over its case for war, saying the failure to find weapons of mass destruction had damaged faith in the political system. ""How is it that there is war in Iraq, violence in the Holy Land, and the horror of pain and death amongst the poor and deprived who suffer from injustice and thus do not find peace?"" ""How is it that peace has not arrived?,"" the cardinal will ask. On Friday, the Cardinal will ask the congregation to search for peace. ""I also wish you peace in your homes because peace in your home is the beginning of peace in the homes of the community. "" A spokesman said Downing Street had no comment to make."
956,"Assembly ballot papers 'missing'
Hundreds of ballot papers for the regional assembly referendum in the North East have ""disappeared"". Officials at Darlington Council are now in a race against time to try and rectify the situation. ""This is affecting several hundred properties, which have failed to receive ballot papers. A spokesman for Darlington Council said: ""We have sent out the ballot papers, the problem is with Royal Mail. ""No-one will not receive their ballot paper as special hand deliveries will take place where necessary. So far a total of 569,072 ballot envelopes have been scanned by bar code at counting offices across the North East. ""We are unaware of any other problems of this kind to do with the regional assembly vote."" A spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission told BBC News Online that letters were being sent out to those homes affected."
957,"""There are issues of concern to Muslims, and Muslims generally agree on them but have not in the past been aware of how a vote can serve these issues."" But a spokesman stressed the meeting was ""not necessarily anti-Labour"". Previous election research has shown the overwhelming majority have traditionally voted Labour, but more recent studies have suggested Labour support has been falling away significantly among some Muslim voters. Representatives from a number of Muslim organisations will attend Tuesday's event. Among them will be the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). Dr Tamimi said the main issues Muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on Iraq, the Palestinian situation, the erosion of civil liberties for Muslims in the UK and economic, social and education problems. ""If the next Labour government has a reduced majority that's a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country,"" Dr Tamimi said. The constituencies where Labour was most at risk from a Muslim tactical vote were Bethnal Green, in east London, and Rochdale in Lancashire, he added. But Dr Tamimi said MAB's intention was not to ""empower"" the Tories. ""We know the next government will be Labour, but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the Muslims use their vote properly."
958,"The Usdaw trade union said shop workers should be able to enjoy a break with their families. In recent years, more stores have been opening on traditional holidays, with some starting their end-of-year sale on Christmas Day or New Year's Day. Usdaw general secretary John Hannett added: ""Christmas Day and New Year's Day are special days for everyone in Scotland and the fact that shops do not open is an important part of making them special. ""The early evidence shows quite clearly that the vast majority of people believe that shop workers should be given these two special days to spend with friends and family."" They are largely collective days of rest."
959,"Mr Blair has been a leading advocate of Turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea. Leaving a Brussels summit Mr Blair said ""the fact Turkey is a Muslim country does not mean it should be barred"". The deal to open formal talks with Ankara came despite an EU demand for Turkey to recognise Cyprus. Mr Blair said having Turkey in the EU was of ""importance to the future peace and prosperity of my country, Britain, and the wider world"". ""We are stating a fundamental principle that the fact Turkey is a Muslim country does not mean it should be barred from Europe. ""On the contrary, if it fulfils the same principles of human rights, then Muslim and Christian can work together."" If it joins, Turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens."
960,"This suggested he was likely to take part in action against UK or allied targets if he left Britain, it said. An identical letter has been sent to Feroz Abbasi, the men's solicitor says. It is only the 13th time the power has been used since 1947 - the last time was in 1976. Guantanamo pair's passport ban
The government has written to two of the British men freed from Guantanamo Bay telling them they will not be allowed passports. A letter sent to Martin Mubanga said his British passport would not be issued in the light of evidence gathered against him by the US. The letter, from the Home Office, says: ""I am writing to inform you that on the basis of the information which has come to light during your detention by the United States, the home secretary considered that there are strong grounds for believing that, on leaving the United Kingdom, you would take part in activities against the United Kingdom, or allied targets."" He said the move also raised complex questions about the use of the Royal Prerogative. ""Furthermore, we believe there should be an investigation into the role played by the UK in the detention of UK residents and nationals and possibly many others at Guantanamo Bay,"" said director Kate Allen. The men's solicitor, Louise Christian, has raised questions about whether the evidence was gathered through torture. Mr Abbasi, 23, from Croydon, south London, was taken to Guantanamo Bay after being captured in Afghanistan in 2001."
961,"""There is no offence of trespassing in the House of Commons - it is not a criminal offence,"" he said. ""If Parliament wanted to make entering the House of Commons chamber on foot a criminal offence it should have done so, but it can't do so retrospectively. They were charged under Section 5 of the Public Order Act, police said. Those charged included Otis Ferry, the 22-year-old son of rock star Bryan Ferry and Luke Tomlinson, 27, a close friend of princes William and Harry. The men's solicitor Matthew Knight, said that at no time had it occurred to the men that they were committing a criminal offence. The 15 September protest came on the same day as a huge pro-hunting demonstration in Parliament Square. ""We have done nothing wrong beyond the obvious which was to stand up for our rights and not act like a sheep like the rest of the country."" Otis Ferry, a former Eton pupil and joint leader of the South Shropshire Hunt, said: ""I have no regrets. However, many pro-hunt activists remained defiant after the law was passed, saying they would ignore the ban and continue to hunt. The five tried to confront MPs before they were bundled out of the chamber and later led away handcuffed by police."
962,"Child access laws shake-up
Parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers. Judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a ""nuclear option"" which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child's interests, a spokesman said. Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. On the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents, Lord Falconer said: ""Tagging may be going too far, but let's have a debate about that."" Theresa May, shadow secretary for the family, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government's plans were ""inadequate"" and were ""papering over the cracks of the current system"". John Ison, from the controversial group Fathers 4 Justice, said: ""It is very disappointing. What we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation."" ""We would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand, you know what the minimum access is. The Liberal Democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules, rather than having ""rigid targets"". ""We want to make courts the last resort, rather than the first resort,"" she added."
963,"The bill would give legal force to ""living wills"", where people say they want medical treatment withheld if they become severely incapacitated. It would allow people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf, which could be challenged by doctors. Ministers insist the Mental Capacity Bill - for England and Wales - would not change laws on assisted suicide and contains a presumption in favour of preserving life. The Christian Medical Fellowship (CMF) and Lawyers' Christian Fellowship (LCF) said the Mental Capacity Bill would allow euthanasia by the ""back door"". Ex-Labour minister Frank Field told BBC Two's Newsnight programme there was a danger people would feel under pressure to ""do away"" with themselves so relatives could inherit their assets. ""We are against euthanasia, we are against assisted suicide but we are in a situation now where people can make living wills and that has the force of the common law,"" he said. The British Medical Association also backs the bill, saying it just gives incapacitated people the same rights as others. ""Doctors are saying they want more clarity. Patients are saying they want more clarity."" She died two years ago after losing a legal battle to allow her husband to help her commit suicide."
964,"It is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers. Other public sector unions have pledged to follow. Five public sector unions will hold private talks with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at Labour's spring conference in Gateshead. But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April. Privately ministers believe this will be the ""less painful"" option, our correspondent added. ""For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,"" he said. ""If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. ""In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable."" Mr Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. It is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations."
965,"""I do not believe that anyone should be deprived of their liberty on the say so of a politician,"" he said. New Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair has backed the control orders, saying: ""I'm sorry. It is a dilemma, but there is only one choice."" The Liberal Democrats say they also oppose house arrests and questioned the human rights implications of the measure. Controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the UK without trial or charge since December 2001 was freed from jail. Mr Howard said he feared ""internment without trial creates martyrs"" and could be ""a very effective recruiting sergeant"" for terrorists"". But Mr Howard said: ""We have serious misgivings about both their effectiveness in protecting life and their consequences for the British way of life."" His party plans to move an amendment to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill next week that would give a judge responsibility for assessing evidence and ensuring a balanced case is presented to the court. ""We think there could be a role for some form of control order - tagging, surveillance, limitation on use of mobile phones - but not with the Home Secretary's say so. That must be done with a proper judicial process, a judge involved in making those decisions,"" said Mr Oaten."
966,"Every officer had an annual target of 8,000 applications - equivalent to 40 a day or one every 11 minutes. MPs want research into whether UK visa holders leave at the end of their stays, or vanish into the black market. Committee chairman Edward Leigh said: ""There is a worrying tension between quick processing and proper control over the visas issued. ""Entry clearance staff are expected to deal with a visa application in about 11 minutes which is surely too little time to look closely at the supporting documents. "" Committee members said the Home Office had been wrong to dismiss concerns from visa staff abroad who feared the system was being abused. The committee's report also discussed the Romanian and Bulgarian visas scandal which led to the resignation of immigration minister Beverley Hughes last year."
967,"The Bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals. Mr Clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the Lords to ensure the most controversial control order, amounting to house arrest, would be imposed by judges and not politicians. The Bill proposes ""control orders"", which as well as house arrest could impose curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. Lord Strathclyde warned ministers that they should ""prepare themselves for substantial rewriting of various aspects of the Bill"". ""I have no desire to make further so-called concessions on the Bill."" ""The scope for miscarriages of justice is enormous,"" he told BBC News. The debate is unlikely to result in a vote. Speaking after the Commons debate, shadow home secretary David Davies said the bill had been ""clearly very badly drawn-up"" and that the government was trying to rush it through too quickly. He said: ""They need to rethink the bill, and extend the power of a judge to decide on all control orders, build safeguards on evidence and create charges against suspects. It's been unravelling in the House of Commons - it may unravel further."""
968,"The legislation would have ended the right of male heirs with older sisters to succeed to the Crown. But opponents of the bill, including Tory Lord Campbell of Alloway and the Bishop of Winchester, the Rt Rev Michael Scott-Joynt, said it would separate the state from both the Church of England and the Christian faith. While we wish to remove all forms of discrimination... this isn't the proper form,"" he added. Such a ""secular"" state would be markedly ""less tolerant"", Rt Rev Scott-Joynt argued. ""It is not a simple matter that can be tinkered with lightly. ""We cannot forever say we don't want to change things because it is too difficult,"" he told peers. During the debate, the Labour peer and former minister said: ""The monarchy should symbolise the values of this country. ""We are surely all opposed to discrimination on the grounds of gender and we are surely also opposed to discrimination against Catholics."""

Seven of the men had been held variously in connection with suspected racially aggravated public order offences, conspiracy to commit criminal damage and possession of a firearm."

Boris opposes mayor apology
Ken Livingstone should ""stick to his guns"" and not apologise for his ""Nazi"" comment to a Jewish reporter, Tory MP Boris Johnson has insisted. ""I don't see why the prime minister has to get involved in this,"" The Spectator editor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""But here's old Ken - he's been crass, he's been insensitive and thuggish and brutal in his language - but I don't think actually if you read what he said, although it was extraordinary and rude, I don't think he was actually anti-Semitic.""

It also attributed blame to drunken Liverpool football fans for the 1989 Hillsborough disaster in which 96 died."
971,"A senior defence official told the BBC lessons were being learned. A National Audit Office report on the 20 biggest projects says costs have risen by £1.7bn in the past year. The NAO's annual report showed the total cost of the 20 projects covered was expected to reach £50bn - 14% higher than originally planned. ""Many problems can be traced to the fact that the MoD has not spent enough time and resources in the assessment phase,"" the report says. A senior defence official, speaking to the BBC's defence correspondent Paul Adams, said that although the figures were still not good enough, the report reflected unrealistic expectations early on in the project cycle. Lord Bach, Minister for Defence Procurement, said he was ""obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown"", but insisted that the Defence Procurement Agency had ""undertaken a huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects"". Turning around the Defence Procurement Agency ""was a little like trying to turn around a super tanker - it takes a very long time indeed"", he said. But he added some projects, such as the C-17 heavy lift aircraft and Successor Identification Friend or Foe (SIFF), were showing good performances."
972,"The annual event is when the chancellor outlines the government's taxation and broader economic predictions. The full Finance Bill, with the Budget measures in it, would then be returned to the Commons after the election, if Labour secures another term in office. If a May election is called, there could be as little as 18 days between the Budget and the announcement of a date for the election. As Mr Brown announced the Budget date in a short ministerial statement, accountancy firm Ernst & Young urged him to put politics aside and focus on the long-term requirements of the economy. ""In the Budgets that were given immediately before the last six elections, taxes were cut by the incumbent chancellor and, in many cases, taxes were increased soon after the election result,"" said Aidan O'Carroll, E&Y's UK head of tax."
973,"But the Home Office says it may be in the children's best interests if it reunites them with their communities. Children's charities have reacted with alarm, saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected. The pilot, included in the government's five-year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Albania who have failed in their asylum claims. ""If children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis,"" she said. The spokesman stressed the UK would abide by its international human rights obligations. A spokesman for the Home Office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children ""and leave them to rot"". ""We have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it's possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable. ""We do not believe that it is right, or in keeping with children's legislation, that children who can return should remain in the UK indefinitely separated from their families and communities."" ""From what is so far known, we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account,"" said Mr Hogg. Only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned, he said."
974,"The Electoral Commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud. Voters need to register by 11 March if the next poll is on 5 May as expected. But any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in Britain before that general election. There have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll, the MPs heard. The proposed scheme would mean voters using individual ""identifiers"" when they vote - such as their own voting number, date of birth and signature. There have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form. Mr Younger suggested the re-registration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were up-to-date. The MPs on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Constitutional Affairs select committees pressed Mr Younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover. He said it might also help register students in halls of residences, where the hall warden often has to do the job for everybody. He said the Northern Ireland example illustrated real difficulties to be confronted."
975,"Normally adults are defined as being aged over 19. The government and its partners would ""need to be creative and responsive"". 'More to do' on adult literacy
The government will only hit its target for improving adult maths and literacy skills if courses are made more attractive, a report says. An estimated 5.2 million adults have worse literacy than that expected of 11 year olds, while 14.9 million have numeracy skills below this level. The Department for Education and Skills could also use more ""personalised learning"" and work with voluntary groups, councils and employers. Sir John said ""substantial progress"" had been made since, adding that this was ""only the beginning"". Auditor General Sir John Bourn said: ""Higher levels of literacy and numeracy will benefit England both socially and economically. The report recommends gathering more details on the educational needs of areas, so courses can be set to meet local demand. ""More people will have the opportunity to live richer lives."" Education minister Ivan Lewis said: ""We will continue to use creative ways of involving people with the lowest skill levels and the report shows that our efforts are gathering pace."""
976,"Tory backing for ID cards
The Tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce ID cards. The party has been ""agnostic"" on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence, the Tory source said. The new chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the ""margins of society"" would be driven into the hands of extremists. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. ""It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,"" a spokesman said. They have said the scheme is ""deeply flawed"" and a waste of money. ""It will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration."" ""What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained."""
977,"Security, stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the UK took over the chairmanship of the EU in July, said Mr Straw. Africa and climate change would also feature highly. Mr Straw argued cooperation with European partners could bring a ""level playing field"" on immigration and asylum controls. Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram told MPs a new White Paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the EU constitution. EU cooperation would help get better UK immigration controls, he argued. ""We, like all other countries, have a veto on any changes proposed in this area,"" he said. ""Who are they trying to kid?"" The proposed question for the constitution referendum is: ""Should the United Kingdom approve the Treaty establishing a Constitution for the European Union?"" The Electoral Commission on Thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand. Mr Straw said no decisions had been taken - Chinese human rights had improved but not by enough."

Former Conservative leader William Hague says he will not stand for the leadership again, having given up his ambition to be prime minister. Asked if he would stand for the leadership again, Mr Hague replied: ""No. Definitely not."" He said: ""I feel fortunate that, by the age of 40, I had crammed in an entire political career. ""I had been in the Cabinet and been leader of the party, so now I can branch out into other things...it is a very liberating feeling.""

979,"General secretary Brendan Barber warned the ""costs could easily outweigh the benefits"". ""The government's big boost to public spending is now showing results,"" said Mr Barber. ""They may shoot a Tory fox, but cutting thousands of civil service jobs will hit the morale and capabilities of the public servants expected to implement government reforms. Next Friday's strike action by the PCS is the biggest in the civil service since 1993, hitting Jobcentres, benefit agencies, pensions offices, customs and driving tests. The costs could easily outweigh the benefits."" Last month it was announced that a total of 37 social security offices and Jobcentres across the UK would close in the first wave of plans to shed civil service jobs."
980,"The quango guide follows last year's government-commissioned Gershon Report which recommended significant cuts in bureaucracy across the public sector. ""For over two decades, under both Tory and Labour governments, these unaccountable agencies have mushroomed. Mr Lewis branded the existence of the 60-employee Potato Council, set up in 1997 to research and promote overseas potato markets, ""surprising"". Labour representatives were unavailable for comment. He urged a limit on the number of quangos that could be set up by any individual government department. ""A Conservative government will axe 162 quangos, as part of its drive for more efficient and more accountable government."" As well as a departmental limit on quangos he also wants a statutory five-year limit on any such body with executive powers. He also listed what he dubbed the nine ""most useless quangos"". They were the British Potato Council, the Milk Development Council, the Energy Savings Trust, Agricultural Wages Committees, the Wine Standards Board, the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, the Football Licensing Authority, Investors in People UK and the Economic and Social Research Council. Mr Lewis asked."
981,"""I believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses,"" he said. Stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body's tissue types. Mr Howard made his remarks during a speech in Westminster to the Conservative National Women's Committee on ambitions and values. ""Politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind. Former Superman actor the late Christopher Reeve was an advocate for the research after he was paralysed in a horse riding accident. The use of embryonic stem cells in the UK is already allowed. He added: ""Of course, stem cells are still a recent discovery. ""I know many people are concerned about stem-cell research. They are fearful of meddling with what they see as the stuff of souls. But I also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, Motor Neurone Disease, Alzheimer's and - as we saw in the papers today - now possibly heart problems."""
982,"There would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas. The Tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an Australian-style points system and those wanting to join families in the UK. ""By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse,"" said Mr Blair. And a spokesman for European Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Franco Frattini said the plans would contravene EU asylum policy, which meant the UK could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case. Lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled, she warned. ""By breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling."" Mr Howard said nearly 160,000 people were settling in the UK every year - the size of a city like Peterborough. He said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that ""firm but fair"" immigration controls were essential for good community relations. Commission for Racial Equality chairman Trevor Phillips said asylum applications were down 40% and economic migration down about 10%. Mr Howard called that suggestion ""disgraceful""."
983,"Both schemes are run by the Direct Marketing Association and backed by EU directives on privacy and electronic communications. He says evidence from local Lib Dem parties around the country suggests there are ""significant"" numbers of such calls. ""So it is not covered by the Telephone Preference Service."" ""If a political party was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing,"" he said. But that does not mean Labour and the Tories are not calling people signed up to the TPS. A spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them. He added: ""If someone complained, then we would investigate that. At the last by-elections, we reminded them."" The spokesman said there was ""no yes or no"" answer and the area was ""pretty grey"". ""I hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases,"" he tells the commissioner."
984,"A Tory spokesman ""totally refuted"" any wrongdoing. Labour MSP Christine May had said Mr McLetchie was ""very clever"" to ask the clerk to consider his conduct in respect of section 5 of the code. He was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong. But a letter from Holyrood's Chamber Office chief Ken Hughes also made clear that Mr McLetchie did not need to list any of the clients for whom he worked as a solicitor. ""However, I have no wish to see a similar situation arise again. Explaining his reason for quitting the post, Mr McLetchie said: ""I have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with Tods Murray. ""He was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section 6, the section on paid advocacy,"" she said. He added: ""David has decided that this announcement should be made now and we fully understand and appreciate his reasons for doing so."" ""However it doesn't change the fact that there should be a full investigation into whether he has done this in the past."" Section 5 of the members interest order legally obliges MSPs to declare registrable interests before taking part in related parliamentary proceedings ""where the interest would prejudice or give the appearance of prejudicing their ability to participate in a disinterested manner""."
985,"Experts are giving evidence on the subject to the Scottish Parliament's environment committee. Officials believe nuclear energy and wind farms may be better options than trying to tackle global warming. Sepa predict that the two methods will remain as energy sources until climate change is under control. They predicted that damaging storms will become more frequent. Researchers from the University of the Highlands and Islands and Southampton have been looking at wave heights in the Atlantic over the last nine years. The project was conducted jointly by the Environmental Research Institute in Thurso, which is part of the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) Millennium Institute network, and the Southampton Oceanography Centre. Scientists carried out a series of studies, including the use of satellites to assess wave heights in the seas around the west coast and the Hebrides."
986,"Vouchers 'to cut winter deaths'
Pensioners are being promised energy savings by the Liberal Democrats, as snow and cold temperatures continue. The Tories promise to keep the payments. The vouchers are designed to let pensioners choose from a list of approved energy supplies who would compete for business by offering discounts on home insulation schemes. Shadow local government secretary Ed Davey said: ""The current scheme has helped some older people, but this new Liberal Democrat approach will go much further to end the scandal of tens of thousands of old people dying from the winter cold every year."""
987,"New 'yob' targets to be unveiled
Fifty new areas getting special help to fight anti-social behaviour in England and Wales will be named on Thursday. A year ago, ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and Thursday's figures offer a progress check. Prime Minister Tony Blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of Asbos and fixed penalty notices. He is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed. Ministers also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25,000 community support officers (CSOs). ""We have not defeated this problem by any means, but shown together what can be done,"" he will say. Critics of the government say it has announced more than 20 initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing. But researchers from Leeds University warned that CSOs could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. Home Office Minister Hazel Blears also revealed this week that ""about a third"" of Asbos were breached - with some people jailed and others not."
988,"He wants to see a phased withdrawal of UK troops ""as soon as the situation allows"", he said in London. ""Next week the prime minister should make a statement regarding the elections in Iraq,"" Mr Kennedy said during his City of London speech.

Mr Kennedy pointed out that the Netherlands, Portugal and the Czech Republic, which all have troops operating in the southern sector of Iraq, have announced their imminent withdrawal ""regardless of the situation on the ground"". ""There is some truth in that, especially after the initial mistakes that were made - the heavy-handedness of operations like Fallujah, and the well-publicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces."""
989,"McConnell in 'drunk' remark row
Scotland's first minister has told a group of high school pupils that it is okay to get drunk ""once in a while"". He has been criticised by the SNP for encouraging young people to get drunk. The first minister's comments came in a question and answer session at Glenurquhart High School in Inverness, attended by pupils from a number of secondary schools. Jack McConnell was speaking to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions. He said: ""I hope I'm not going to be seen as preaching to anybody here but the really serious problem at the moment is binge drinking and the impact it has on people's health and their ability to control what's happening round about them."" A Highland councillor who was at the event has also defended Mr McConnell. Margaret Davidson, the independent member for the Loch Ness West, said the first minister was speaking in a very general way and she was sure he was speaking about adults at the time. ""We all know that under-age drinking is an issue in Scotland but it is quite staggering that any politician, particularly the First Minister, should encourage young people to get drunk. ""The one thing we are going to do something really serious about is binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions that can help lead to that,"" he said. ""We are go to clamp down on that and make those promotions illegal in the hope that people can enjoy a drink sensibly over the course of an evening."""
990,"Brown hits back in Blair rift row
Gordon Brown has criticised a union leader who said conflict between himself and Tony Blair was harming the workings of government. But the chancellor said Mr Baume was never at meetings between himself and the prime minister so could not judge. Mr Brown said: ""To be honest I don't think you can rely on his [Mr Baume's] judgement on this matter when it comes to the decisions that the government are making. Jonathan Baume, of the top civil servants' union, spoke of ""competing agendas"" between Mr Brown and Mr Blair. We are determined to go on with the Gershon reforms."" ""Government departments get their money from the Treasury on the basis of public service agreements they sign up to, but at the same time the prime minister also has an agenda and that's not necessarily the same as the Treasury's and the prime minister is of course a very powerful figure in any government. What the chancellor wanted was ""not by any means what Alan Milburn and the prime minister want to see"", Mr Baume said. Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: ""The battle Royal that the top civil servants are now reporting on between the chancellor and Tony Blair is preventing them both from getting on with the business of getting taxpayers value for money."""
991,"The plan forms part of the party's ""smaller government bill"", to be unveiled later this week. Mr Howard said the plan would also even out the ""great unfairness"" of there being proportionately more Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster than those from England. The average size of an English constituency was 70,000 people, Mr Howard said. ""It is all very well saying government departments should be reduced, but what about ministers, Parliament and special advisers?"" The precise number of MPs to go would depend on the result of the Welsh referendum, but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659. he said. Shadow leader of the Commons Oliver Heald said: ""This will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people's lives by reducing the size and role of the State"". ""You have got to have a big bang. We don't want this like the House of Lords reform, getting to one stage and then not having the next stage."""

Deals are being sought to allow the UK to deport terror suspects to their home countries without risk of them being tortured or sentenced to death. However, he added: ""I do not think the solution to the Law Lords' judgement for this government is in deportations, but they will help. The BBC's home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford, said it appeared Mr Clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor, David Blunkett. ""There are other strands that we have to do."" ""Deportation may tackle this initial problem but I want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country."" ""The critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle, to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future,"" he told BBC News. But he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees' home countries could be difficult."
993,"Deputy Health Minister Rhona Brankin has pledged to study the research. Ministers deny care sums 'wrong'
Ministers have insisted they are committed to free personal care for the elderly despite research suggesting the cost of the policy was under-estimated. The rise in costs stems from a series of mistakes in the research used by the ""care development group"" of Scottish Executive experts who prepared the original costings, according to findings published in the Quarterly Economic Commentary of Strathclyde University's Fraser of Allander Institute. ""Dubious"" assumptions about improving health expectancy could drive the cost of the policy up by another £130m by 2022, the report warned. ""Obviously we will examine the findings of this new report, along with figures from our own research that we have already commissioned. But Ms Brankin told BBC Radio Scotland: ""We don't think we got our sums wrong.

Tony Blair says his party's next manifesto will be ""unremittingly New Labour"" and aimed at producing ""personal prosperity for all"". Labour made low inflation, unemployment and mortgage rates the centrepiece of a new poster campaign this week. ""By prosperity I mean both the income and wealth of individuals and theirfamilies, and the opportunity and security available to them through radicallyimproved public services and a reformed welfare state."" The Liberal Democrats have also claimed infighting its obstructing good government. With the election widely predicted for May, angry Labour MPs this week warned Mr Blair and Mr Brown about the dangers of disunity. On Wednesday they unveiled a poster which pictured the prime minister and Mr Brown under the words ""How can they fight crime when they are fighting each other?"" In it he alleges that Mr Blair told Mr Brown in 2003 he would step down as prime minister before the coming general election. Mr Peston's book claimed that Mr Brown told Mr Blair: ""There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe."""

He claimed he was stripped of his clothes and mattress and forced to remain in an empty metal box, naked except for boxer shorts.

The settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a 16.4% rise in capital expenditure support. ""It is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase."" She said where spending rises were kept to around 5% she was ""confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels."" Ms Essex said: ""This is a good deal for local government, which will allow the well-managed councils of Wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax. Conservative local government spokesman Glyn Davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in Wales should see very little change ""is taking spin to the very verge of deception"".

Earlier, Mr Howard said: ""There does need to be another inquiry, a judge-led inquiry. But he could not find evidence to show whether Mr Blunkett's intervention was intended to give special help for his then lover's nanny - or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance.

""There is just no logic to a system which values children differently depending on where they live. Minister for Children, Young People and Families Margaret Hodge said new plans will ensure fosterers' allowances would be as fair as possible. Fostering Network executive director Robert Tapsfield criticised the existing system. Ms Hodge said: ""Foster carers must not be out of pocket when meeting the costs of caring for a looked after child - a crucial role in society. ""Our proposal for a national minimum rate shows we are serious about creating a better deal for foster carers and about encouraging more people to come forward and consider fostering as a worthwhile and rewarding opportunity.""

Mrs Parker Bowles said the prince went down on one knee to propose and added: ""I'm just coming down to earth."" Tony Blair said he was ""delighted"" for the couple and offered his congratulations, as did Conservative leader Michael Howard and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy.

""It is not aimed at a particular community, it is not police policy to aim these powers at a particular community,"" he added. IHRC chairman Massoud Shadjareh accused Ms Blears of ""playing an Islamophobia card"" in the run-up to a general election. Last July, the police were accused of Islamophobia by Muslim groups after stop and search figures showed the numbers of Asians targeted had risen by 300% since the introduction of anti-terror laws. ""It is a legitimisation for a backlash and for racists to have an onslaught on our community. The minister had been saying she understood there was a perception that stop and search was aimed at one community, but that was not what was happening, the spokesman said.

1005,"UK heading wrong way - Howard
Tony Blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing Britain and has failed, Michael Howard has said. Mr Blair's government was a ""bossy, interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals,"" he added. The scale, the speed, the ferocity of what happened on Boxing Day is difficult to grasp. ""How much tax do people want to pay? But Labour's campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp responded: ""Britain is working, don't let the Tories wreck it again"". Rather than alluding to false promises Michael Howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the British people for the misery that the government, of which he was a member, inflicted upon the country. The last week has shown that the warm, caring heart of Britain beats as strong as ever."" This is the record Mr Blair will have to defend in the coming months, he said, urging voters to hold him to account. ""Worst of all, it is a government that has wasted people's money and failed to tackle the problems families face today."" ""The result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives, undermining enterprise and denying people choice."
1006,"Mr Kilroy-Silk promised a ""firm but fair"" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. ""I will be standing at the next general election. A spokesman for UKIP called on Mr Hockney to quit the London Assembly. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been ""straightforward"" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead. ""While UKIP has turned its back on the British people, I shall not,"" he said. Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. It is very sad to see the cause of Britain regaining its proper relationship with Europe damaged by this split within UKIP. Kilroy-Silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue. Thank goodness that Kilroy-Silk has gone - now UKIP at least has a chance in the election! Veritas?"
1007,"Blair 'damaged' by Blunkett row
A majority of voters (68%) believe the prime minister has been damaged by the row over David Blunkett's involvement in a visa application, a poll suggests. YouGov polled a weighted sample of 1,981 voters online on 16-18 December. Sir Alan Budd's inquiry also found Mr Blunkett's account of events had been wrong. Almost a quarter (21%) of those polled for the Sunday Times said he should return to the Cabinet straight after the election. Some 82% said Mr Blunkett had set a good example by wanting to take responsibility for the child he says is his, but 42% backed his legal action compared to 45% who thought it was unbecoming. Meantime, 32% said Mr Blair was a good prime minister and 38% disagreed. A second poll for the Independent on Sunday found that support for all political parties remained largely unchanged after the Blunkett controversy. Labour lead the Conservatives by 39% to 34% with the Liberal Democrats on 19%. CommunicateResearch interviewed 401 people before David Blunkett's resignation and 601 afterwards."

I felt guilt in the marrow of my bones,"" said the Ealing North MP. I was pretty much out of control. ""I don't blame Lucy's mother. Mr Pound says he rang Lucy as soon as he got her letter, they met up and have been in contact ever since. I was 18 when she was conceived. It was a different time - it was pretty wild.""

1010,"University College London research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year. He estimates that this would save the country £119m a year. These have been criticised by road safety campaigners, including Labour backbencher Gwyneth Dunwoody, who says it will reduce the incentive for drivers to stay within the limits in residential areas, leading to more road casualties. ""Only about one in 50 of those driving during weekend evenings and nights will need to moderate their drinking to achieve this and fewer still at other times."" The findings are based on the assumption that drivers who currently keep below the legal limit would continue to do so were it to be lowered and that those who tend to exceed the limit slightly would also lower their drinking. They believe educating drivers is more important. ""Parliamentarians need to consider this carefully. He said there had been a 29% drop in the number of drivers being breathalysed since 1997, which he said the government needed to address if it wanted to reduce the danger caused by drink-driving. Professor Allsop said: ""Reducing the limit from 80mg to 50mg can be expected to save around 65 lives a year or around half of those who die in accidents where the driver's BAC [blood alcohol content] is within 30mg of the current limit. Britons police themselves by consensus much more effectively than they do by weight of enforcement alone."""
1011,"The committee reached its conclusions after it found that nearly 250,000 cases have yet to be processed. And responding to calls for the agency to be scrapped, Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I certainly wouldn't rule out the nuclear option of moving to a completely new system. It is currently chasing outstanding payments of more than £720m, while a further £947m has been designated as ""unrecoverable"". Chairman Sir Archy Kirkwood said: ""If the agency cannot be rescued, then it must be replaced."" The report urged the CSA to draw up contingency plans, including the ""abandonment option"", to be presented to Parliament by Easter, in case the CS2 computer system could not be made to work. The CSA has been surrounded in controversy since its introduction in 1993 to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents. Michelle, a mother of twins, said she had not received a penny of the £57 a week she should be receiving from her ex-partner and had faced an ""on-going battle"" with the CSA. Her forms have twice been lost in the post, she said. ""I don't receive correspondence, I don't receive phone calls, I have to chase them all the time,"" she said. The agency's former chief executive Doug Smith quit last autumn claiming he was ""seriously disappointed"" with its performance."
1012,"""I think we need to look very carefully at the relationship between the Lords and the Commons,"" Lord Falconer told BBC1's Breakfast With Frost. The lord chancellor hinted further reforms could be unveiled in the next Labour manifesto. Baroness Boothroyd, who was the first woman to be Commons Speaker, said she believed Tony Blair initiated reforms without a clear outcome in mind. Boothroyd calls for Lords speaker
Betty Boothroyd has said the House of Lords needs its own Speaker and that peers should lead the way on reforming the upper chamber. ""We need to address the issue in the manifesto, but you will have to wait for when the manifesto comes."" ""I don't go for the idea of somebody - a lord chancellor - who is head of the judiciary, a senior Cabinet minister and Speaker of the Lords. ""I would really like to see a Speaker of the House of Lords,"" she said."
1013,"""The needs and safety of victims will be at the heart of the way trials are managed. Ministers say the strategy is aimed at re-balancing the court system towards victims, and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice. Launching the Department for Constitutional Affairs' plan, Lord Falconer said: ""One of the top priorities will be a better deal for victims. Another feature of the strategy is constitutional reform, with a government bill to set up a supreme court and a judicial appointments commission returning to the House of Lords on Tuesday. ""Yet with a will and with support it can be done."" Other witnesses could be intimidated by sitting alongside defendants outside courts. ""You are never going to get rid of some element of the trauma of giving evidence,"" he said. Lord Falconer said it was right for the highest court to be completely distinct from Parliament. Ministers had proposed getting rid of the title of lord chancellor, but the Lords have over-ruled this. What they did, not what they were called, was the critical issue, he added."
1014,"""His work in the wake of the Brixton riots and his commitment to the vulnerable and dispossessed was second to none. Lord Scarman will be remembered for the public inquiry he led into a string of race riots which began in Brixton when racial tensions rose after a police crackdown on street robbery. The peer enjoyed a celebrated judicial career, serving as Law Commission chairman in its first seven years. Paying tribute, the Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer said Lord Scarman was one of the ""great advocates of our generation"". ""He was a lawyer and a judge who had a remarkable insight into human nature, and an exceptional sensitivity to the needs of a healthy society,"" he said. ""He never lost the special combination of wisdom, humanity and the spark of radicalism that marked his watershed report into the Brixton riots."" The inquiry famously settled on the so-called ""rotten apples"" theory, which argued that only a few police officers were racist, saying most were not. He said: ""When Lord Scarman toured the streets of Brixton his presence was electrifying. ""A community which had been systematically ignored by everyone else was suddenly embraced by the epitome of the English establishment. ""His great quality was the ability to listen to young people of all backgrounds, many of whose language he could barely understand, genuinely to hear what they had to say and to talk to them as human beings."

Prince Harry should personally make clear how sorry he is about wearing a Nazi uniform to a friend's fancy dress party, says Tory leader Michael Howard. He added that Sandhurst would probably be good for Harry as it would teach him some self discipline. But Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy said Harry was in a privileged position and said he should apologise in person. He told ITV: ""The time has come for him to make a public apology. It is about common decency, of respect to the people who fought the Nazis, to the families of those who were killed by the Nazis and to people who suffered during the Holocaust."" A photograph of Prince Harry wearing a swastika armband and German desert uniform at the party appears in Thursday's Sun newspaper under the headline: ""Harry the Nazi."" Mr Howard acknowledged the prince's apology and said he had no doubt the prince's father and family would have much to say to him privately about the incident. I hope that would teach him not to behave like that."" But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It might be appropriate to tell us himself just how contrite he is."""
1016,"Welsh Health Minister Jane Hutt said no patient would wait more than 12 months for an outpatient appointment by March 2006, against a current target of 18 months. This current inpatient target was set when the assembly government extended its second offer guarantee scheme, which gives patients the option of having their treatment outside Wales. Now we need to see those reductions in long waiters being improved again,"" she said. ""We are turning the corner on long waits in Wales. Health analyst Tony Beddow, from the Welsh Institute for Health and Social Care, called the new targets ""reasonably impressive"". Details about funding to resource the new targets are expected in the New Year. ""But let us not forget two thirds of those waiting for treatment now are waiting less than six months, and these targets affect the small minority of patients in Wales that are waiting far too long."" Statistics to the end of November showed a decline since October from 785 to 708. It's a failed target, from a failed minister..with a failed policy."" Conservative health spokesman Jonathan Morgan said: ""We're spending more money but waiting lists have gone through the roof."
1017,"Labour said many tests were already done. ""Nearly two thirds of people with TB are born abroad,"" said Mr Howard. Tories plan migrant health checks
Non-European Union citizens wanting to work in the UK will have to undergo tests for Tuberculosis and HIV, under plans unveiled by the Conservatives. Only the discovery of TB will mean people will be automatically denied a visa, other conditions will be dealt with on a ""case by case basis"". Leader Michael Howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the NHS. - They will also have to show they are unlikely to be a danger to public health and are unlikely to ""impose significant costs or demands"" on the NHS. ""In fact, it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their EU status,"" she said. There is already some screening in place. ""Michael Howard knows perfectly well what bigger game he is playing, and history proves it is a very dangerous one."" Meanwhile Mark Oaten, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: ""This is another worrying step in the war of words over asylum and immigration between Labour and the Conservatives."
1018,"Mr Martin revealed some MPs had been using their Blackberries during debates and he also cautioned members against using hidden earpieces. The £200 handheld computers can be used as a phone, pager or to send e-mails. The use of electronic devices in the Commons chamber has long been frowned on. The Speaker chairs debates in the Commons and is charged with ensuring order in the chamber and enforcing rules and conventions of the House."
1019,"One of the biggest problems which had faced Ms Hutt during her five-and-a-half years as the assembly's first health minister was the length of waiting lists in Wales. Dr Gibbons, who was a GP in Blaengwynfi, in the Upper Afan Valley, before becoming AM for Aberavon, said NHS staff wanted a period of consolidation after ""tremendous change and reform"". Dr Gibbons said he accepted there was a problem, but his job now was to build on the foundations put in place by his predecessor. But he said the NHS in Wales also needed to create a healthier population rather than respond only to ill health, and a balanced view of priorities was important. Later, Dr Gibbons praised the work of Ms Hutt, saying he ""agreed with everything she's done"" to change the health service in Wales. Meanwhile Ms Hutt said she hoped ""that the people of Wales would benefit from my investment of the past five years and eight months"" Asked about waiting lists, she said that waiting times and lists were ""only 10% of the health agenda"" and that the Welsh Assembly Government had ""turned the corner"" on the issue. Dr Gibbons told Radio Wales: ""There is no doubt that, in managing waiting lists, England has done a lot of very very useful work, and we do need to learn from that."" ""We do need a consistent across-the-board approach, recognising the patients' experience of how they use the service is going to be, at the end of the day, the main test of how the service is working."" He also acknowledged that until the waiting list issue was sorted out, the rest of the assembly government's health policy would be overshadowed. Kisrty Williams, for the Lib Dems, added: ""If the underlying policy is going to continue, then changing the minister will serve no purpose, other than to deflect flak from Labour's MPs,"" she said."

The episode comes at a difficult time for UKIP, soon after the high-profile departure of MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk. He told BBC News: ""He appears to have said these things. Mr Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr Houston's reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not. We have suspended him as a member and as a candidate. ""The problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the English-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do.""

""The fact is that President Bush is there for four years. America needed to listen to the world too, he said. He is there because the American people have chosen him,"" he argued. Mr Chirac denied there was any snub - he is going to a memorial service for the United Arab Emirates' late leader and says he would be happy to meet Mr Allawi. Mr Chirac will miss an address to the summit from Iraqi interim leader Iyad Allawi, who this week criticised nations which took a ""spectator"" role to Iraq's reconstruction. The communiqu&#233; congratulated President Bush on his victory and stressed the importance of good transatlantic relations. ""That is the goal of the constitution in a world that is more multi-polar than ever."" The meeting will also assess progress on the economic reform plans agreed in Lisbon in 2000 to make Europe more competitive."
1022,"The chancellor is travelling to America next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue. Cafod wants Britain to use its influence to pressure countries like the US to make firm commitments to tackle global poverty. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need more resources allied to progress on trade and progress on debt relief if we are going to make an impact on the problems of ill health, of illiteracy, of poverty, particularly in Africa but right through the developing countries."" ""If after five years of making promises the world is not prepared to honour them, then people will be justified in saying they promised but they did not produce results."" The report said the G8 of top industrialised nations had agreed in 1970 to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid. Agreement in the Doha development talks could also give developing nations the trading ability they needed, he argued. Mr Brown said America too needed to take more action but defended President George Bush for guaranteeing resources to countries which introduced reforms to tackle corruption. ""That is why next year is a test,"" he said. But Band Aid founder Bob Geldof in July said he was sick of hearing ""guff"" about scars on the world. ""There's no point in him demanding praise and adulation for setting a whole new raft of targets when he has so woefully failed to meet the ones he already has,"" added Mr Duncan."
1023,"The shadow chancellor said Mr Brown's ""golden rule"" had ""turned to dross in his hands"" and said he was borrowing to spend, not invest, with predicted debt over the coming years totalling £170bn. He is spending, borrowing and taxing so much because he is not getting value for taxpayer's money."" In his speech, he set out a 10-year childcare strategy for if Labour wins the next election. Mr Brown rejected the Lib Dem's call to open up the government's books to the National Audit Office, saying decisions on tax and spending should be made by ministers. It includes a £285m cash injection to extend paid maternity leave from six months to nine, with parents able to transfer leave from the mother to the father. He said: ""Last week the prime minister gave us the politics of fear; this week the chancellor has offered the economics of complacency. Some economists say his forecasts on public finances are wishful thinking. He also pledged an extra £105m for security and counter-terrorism. Taken together, the measures would create a ""welfare state that is truly family-friendly for the first time in its history"", said Mr Brown. Borrowing figures for 2003/4 are £35bn - £2.5bn less than the £37.5bn predicted in March's budget, as already announced by the Office for National Statistics."

""New threats to the peace and security of rich nations arise from poverty and gross inequalities.

It argues that the price of not investing in poor countries' sustainable development will be felt across the world. Mr Brown has also pledged to write off the debt owed to Britain by the world's poor nations. A spokeswoman for the Department for International Development said: ""The government had made a clear commitment to reaching 0.7% of gross national income for overseas development aid by 2013. ""These additional resources will be used to increase UK bilateral aid to Africa to at least £1.25bn a year by 2008 and spend at least £1.5bn on HIV/Aids related work over the next three years."""

He said no one on the coaches accepted responsibility for items found on the coaches including body armour, a smoke bomb and five shields. ""From day one we have vigorously defended this decision, which was made out of a genuine concern that if the coaches were allowed to proceed it would have resulted in disorder and criminal damage at RAF Fairford.""

This would involve an extra one million older people joining the work force, he said. Mr Johnson told Age Concern's Age Agenda in London the government was ""seriously considering"" introducing pensions based on residency rather than national insurance contributions. The government wanted to tackle this by moving to a culture where retirement ages were ""increasingly consigned to the past"". ""We're sweeping them away entirely for people under 65, and we're giving those above that age a right to request to work past 65 which their employers will have to engage with seriously.

Fox hunting with dogs is now illegal in England and Wales after a ban on the activity came into force overnight. ""The definitions of legal and illegal hunting are so blurred that the police are being asked to make impossible judgements. The Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, has so far issued no instructions to police on how they should deal with hunters who violate the law. Chief police officers spokesman Nigel Yeo said he expected most people would obey the law - by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them. He said police had ""acknowledged their duty to investigate allegations of hunting offences"". ""You can hunt a rat, but not a mouse, a rabbit but not a hare, an artificial scent, but not a real one,"" he said. As well as being able to mount a hunt for an artificial scent, it will still be legal for the hunts to ""flush out"" foxes, as long as they shoot their quarry rather than set the hounds on them. ""We are not going away. We will keep these hounds going, we will keep this community going and in the end we will come back and hunt when hunting is legal again,"" hunt master, Captain Ian Farquhar, said. But Tony Banks, Labour MP for West Ham, said the issue would soon disappear, and that ""people in a few years time will be wondering what it was all about""."

He was speaking before the UK joins a three-minute silence at noon across the EU for the estimated 150,000 dead. It would become easier in the coming weeks to assess just how much money would have to be put in.

1031,"UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who will hold talks in Beijing on Thursday, said an EU arms code was more effective than the current ban. The scope of the embargo was very narrow and did not have any force of law behind it, he told BBC Radio 4's World At One. The decision could undermine Nato as it severely damaged relations with the US, which is opposed to ending the ban. ""There are still thousands of people who are unaccounted for."" Straw attacked on China arms
Moves to lift the European Union's ban on arms exports to China have been condemned by human rights groups and the Conservatives. Mr Straw said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma. And only two of the licences denied under the embargo would have been granted under the code. The level of human rights was a key criteria under the EU arms exports code, he said. Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the move would be ""profoundly wrong"". Mr Ancram argued: ""What the British Government is doing is giving in to French and German pressure, especially the French, who see vast contracts available to them if the embargo is lifted... ""It gives the wrong signals to China, who are simply not prepared to accept that what happened at Tiananmen Square was wrong."""

The man suffered facial injuries after an incident involving a group of men at the end of the East Kent Hunt, near Ashford. In Wiltshire, police arrested four men under the new law suspected of hunting with dogs. The Countryside Alliance called on hunt supporters to meet as normal, but vowed to stay within the law. ""Our evidence suggests that most hunts did operate within the law, many meeting and promptly going home and others peacefully exercising their hounds or drag hunting. And while there was big turnout in support of the hunts on Saturday, he said it remains to be seen if the level of backing can be maintained. Suffolk Chief Constable Alastair McWhirter, the Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on rural policing, told the BBC the law would be enforced, although the police would not break up hunts. ""However, we have received reports of what we believe is clearly illegal activity by a number of hunts across Britain."" The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith has so far not issued any instructions to police on how they should deal with any hunters who do violate the law.

Edward Leigh, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said Britain had to set an example when it assumed the EU presidency. The National Audit Office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling, the EU still had no common definition of fraud. EU fraud clampdown urged
EU member states are failing to report fraud and irregularities in EU funds on a consistent basis, the UK's public spending watchdog has said. At the same time, reported fraud throughout the EU dropped from 10,276 cases worth £808m to 8,177 cases worth £644m. ""The government must take the opportunity afforded by the UK presidency of the EU to press the Commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity, and raise overall standards of financial management.""

Britain is to give a £4m grant to help women survivors of the Rwandan genocide who were raped and often deliberately infected with HIV/Aids. The plight of the infected women was overshadowed for a long time. But many of the women were widowed and they now not only have their own children to care for but, in many cases, orphans too. As the women die, the number of Rwanda's orphans rises. Until recently, very few of the women have had access to anti-retroviral treatment. That is now starting to change."

""I don't pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken."" Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a ""regressive"" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them.

Jack Straw, who argues the constitution reflected a ""British vision for Europe"" and gives ""national governments a stronger grip"", has said the referendum could be held in spring 2006. Neil O'Brien, director of anti-constitution group Vote No, said: ""The reality is that the government doesn't want to discuss the EU constitution ahead of the election because they know it is extremely unpopular with voters and with business."" Then we can be out of it and better off much sooner."" But in an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Blair refused to be pinned down to that date, saying Britain would hold a poll ""some time in 2006 but when, I don't know"". He said the question sounded ""very neutral"" and ""balanced,"" adding it would enable the argument ""to be enjoined fairly and squarely on both sides"". Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, who backs the constitution, said he expected the referendum would come in the first half of next year. That promise came after sustained pressure from opposition parties."
1038,"Just 13 of Britain's 659 MPs are from ethnic minority groups, he added. Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Malik, who is himself running for the seat of Dewsbury, acknowledged that so far women-only shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates. For example in West Ham, this might allow only women and minorities to seek to be candidates. On Tuesday Labour chairman Ian McCartney said his party was ""ambitious"" to improve black and Asian representation. But he argued: ""I do think that there currently things that parties can do and which they aren't doing... for example setting targets to ensure that existing democratic structures are more reflective."" Labour MP Diane Abbot, who backs Mr Phillips' proposal of shortlists, said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority MPs - Keith Vaz, Paul Boateng and Bernie Grant - in 1987 but it took another 10 years before another black woman was able to win a seat. ""If we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented, we have to say that after 20 or 30 years of talking about this, we cannot go on the same way,"" he said. That was a rate of progress Ms Abbott described as ""painful""."
1039,"He was not hurt in the mugging on Saturday evening. Several people are being questioned over the attack. Quentin Davies, the MP for Grantham and Stamford, was attacked in a notoriously dangerous park in the capital, Nairobi. He said in a statement: ""It was a frightening experience. ""I knew I had to stay very calm and passive - you cannot fight six men"". ""Two of them held me from behind and two others held my legs and another one expertly rifled all my pockets."""
1040,"The former teacher confirmed he had attended the meeting but said that was the only contact he had with the group. A UKIP spokesman said Mr Betts-Green's resignation followed disclosures in the East Anglian Daily Times last month about his attendance at a BNP meeting. ""He did once attend a BNP meeting. He did not like what he saw and heard and will take no further part of it,"" the spokesman added."
1041,"But Lib Dem Norman Baker accused ministers of turning Britain into a ""nuclear dumpsite"". The government has confirmed intermediate level waste (ILW) that was to have been shipped back to its home countries will now be stored in the UK. Trade Secretary Patricia Hewitt said the new arrangements, revealed in a Commons written statement, would raise up to £680m for Britain's nuclear clean-up programme, under the new Nuclear Decommissioning Agency. And it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner, ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity. But the move has been criticised by environmental groups and the Liberal Democrats. Mr Baker, the Lib Dem environment spokesman, said: ""I have been warning for months that this would happen and raised it with government several times. But now our worst fears have been confirmed. ""Once again Britain's environmental and health needs are being ignored in policies driven by the Treasury and DTI. ""The nuclear industry is an economic, social and environmental millstone that hangs around Britain's neck."""
1042,"Home Secretary Charles Clarke has been quoted as telling Labour members he wants more migrants to come to the UK. ""We want more migration, more people come to study and to work. On Monday, Dr Fox told reporters: ""The prime minister has broken his word so many times in the past but now his promises do not even last a week. London's Evening Standard quoted Mr Clarke telling Labour activists at a question and answer session in Gateshead that he wanted Britain to offer refuge for those fleeing tyranny. ""The Tories are purposely mixing together two separate issues of immigration and asylum."" ""This is simply a scurrilous attempt by the Tories to score cheap political points,"" he said. Mr Clarke dismissed the latest Tory attack. The prime minister told MPs: ""The abusers will be weeded out, and as a result of the end of chain migration [where families have an automatic right to settle], the numbers will probably fall."" And only asylum seekers genuinely fleeing death or persecution would be admitted.

Deputy High Court Judge Richard Mawrey, QC told the hearing at the Birmingham and Midlands Institute the case could have potentially serious consequences for any forthcoming General Election. Police found the trio handling unsealed postal ballots in a deserted warehouse in the city during a late-night raid in June 2004, the hearing was told. Mr Sukul said: ""When (the officers) arrived there, in the middle of the night, they saw a large room with a 10ft long table and six Asian men present. The house was in order."" ""When the officers left, all the envelopes and papers were scattered,"" Mr Sukul said. ""(When they went) back to make the seizure, every one of these 275 yellow ballot papers were placed neatly in envelope A and sealed. Interrupting Mr Sukul in his opening, Mr Mawrey said: ""What you are saying is, these men were operating a vote-forging factory on an industrial estate."" The case continues."
1044,"Mr Blair also made a surprise trip to Iraq this week. Blair returns from peace mission
Prime Minister Tony Blair has arrived back from his diplomatic mission to the Middle East to try to resurrect the peace process. He nodded briefly towards the tomb, rather than lay a wreath, in what Palestinian officials said was a compromise gesture agreed at the last minute. Mr Blair briefly visited the tomb of Yasser Arafat in Ramallah - the first world leader to do so. At a news conference following talks with Mr Blair, Mr Abbas said the British prime minister was ""in a unique position to help us progress in our peaceful pursuit"". He added: ""Your endeavour to hold a conference in London is another example of your deep commitment to this purpose."" Earlier, Mr Sharon again said he had not seen ""the slightest step"" the Palestinians were working to end terror attacks - though he acknowledged Palestinian leaders were in the middle of an election campaign that could be hampering their efforts. He was briefed on preparations for the national poll, which is scheduled for next month but is threatened by a deadly campaign of insurgent violence."
1045,"Speaking in London on Saturday at the first annual delegate conference of his newly-founded party, the Respect Coalition, he said: ""I have deliberately not involved myself before in any of these situations. Galloway plea for hostage release
Ex-Labour MP George Galloway has appealed for the release of aid worker Margaret Hassan, kidnapped in Iraq. ""But this woman has been a prominent opponent of both the war and the preceding years of sanctions. ""I am prepared to do anything I can to help save her life."" The latest footage showed Mrs Hassan asking for British troops to be pulled out of Iraq. Care has since closed down all its operations in Iraq."
1046,"Mr Begg's father, Azmat, said he had been told he could see his son for 20 minutes and would say he was ""a hero"". But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens said evidence obtained by MI5 while the four were in Cuba was ""absolutely"" inadmissible in UK courts. The men are being held at London's Paddington Green police station, where they are expected to be questioned by UK anti-terror officers. ""The options are: if there is enough evidence they will be charged. But Louise Christian, the lawyer representing Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the families would be reunited with the men away from the station. The Pentagon says they were freed after the UK government promised they would not be a threat to the national security of the US or any of its allies. The men have been allowed to meet their lawyers. They are innocent people."" Massoud Shadjareh, from the Muslim Safety Forum, said: ""What sort of homecoming is this? ""We want these men to be returned into the arms of their waiting family,"" said Iqbal Sacranie, secretary general of the council."
1047,"People had turned out ""to show en masse that the Hunting Act was a bad law"", he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed ""legally"" as far as he was aware. Countryside Alliance chairman John Jackson said that Saturday had been a ""massive demonstration by the rural community of support for hunting"". You can't chase wild mammals with a pack of dogs, whether the wild mammal is a fox or a deer. ""The reality is that the law is very clear. You can't hunt accidentally."" Although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence, exercising hounds, chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. But the League Against Cruel Sports claimed the new act had been broken even though the numbers of foxes killed had fallen. He said intimidation seemed to have been widespread and called on hunts to do more to stop their supporters intimidating anti-hunt activists videoing hunts. Mr Michael also denied the hunting ban had led to a breakdown of trust between the government and rural communities. If people tried to ""run circles around this law"" the only outcome would be that it was tightened up, she said."
1048,"The prime minister on Sunday said immigration would be ""toughened up"" to ensure only those immigrants with skills the UK really needs will be granted work permits. Instead, they say the plans are part of an ""evolving"" process aimed at winning public confidence. Tony Blair has said people are right to be concerned about abuses of the system but there is no ""magic bullet"". The Tories say Labour is acting too late while the Lib Dems say the plans may not produce an efficient system. But he rejected the Tories' call for a quota on economic migrants, saying no ""arbitrary figure"" could reflect the UK's needs. He said: ""We will not be... pretending there is some simple easy way of processing Britain's asylum seekers in some other country, because no such other country exists."" Tory proposals to cap the number of asylum seekers and process all claims abroad would not work, argued Mr Blair. ""What we are seeing today is a rather panicky response from the government after eight years of failure,"" he said. But he said it was yet to be seen if Mr Clarke could deliver ""a fair and efficient asylum system""."
1049,"At his weekly press conference on Tuesday he said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise. ""I think it is important that the IOC (International Olympic Committee) members realise that when we get the games...they have a mayor who is not going to panic, change course or get in a great flap but will deliver the games on time and to budget,"" he said. An official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, demanding an investigation by the Standards Board of England. The mayor said his comments would not affect the 2012 Olympic bid and added that his determination to stand up for what he believed in may impress bid chiefs, who arrived in London on Tuesday. Labour's Mr Livingstone, who says he is ""standing by"" his remarks, had accused an Evening Standard journalist of being like a ""concentration camp guard"". ""I have never in response to any of that modified a policy I believed to be right or modified a position I believed to be right and I don't intend to now. The mayor then says: ""Ah right, well you might be, but actually you are just like a concentration camp guard, you are just doing it because you are paid to, aren't you?"" ""Because if I do that effectively you hand power over your policies and position to the editors of papers."" Mr Finegold replies: ""No, I'm Jewish, I wasn't a German war criminal. I'm quite offended by that."""

The Mirror newspaper said on Tuesday it had been handed a sensitive dossier outling the details of Gen Musharraf's visit to Britain. She is very religious but she is very moderate,"" said General Musharraf. ""In respect of Iraq, we agreed that whatever the issues of the past, the important thing now is to see the strategy through and ensure that Iraq is capable of becoming a stable and democratic state."" It said the dossier contained details about his movements and also confidential police radio channels, call signs and codes.

1051,"The Liberal Democrats said it ""beggared belief"" he and fellow officials could not remember how Leoncia Casalme's application for indefinite leave to remain went from Mr Blunkett's office to the head of the Immigration and Nationality Department. Both men were giving evidence to a Commons committee on the computer difficulties facing the agency, which left thousands of single parents without any maintenance payments, when the announcement was made. The knighting of Sir John, 54, will be received with astonishment by opposition politicians. But Sir Alan Budd, who led an inquiry into the affair, said he had no reason to believe anyone involved had deliberately withheld information. Visa row mandarin made Sir John

Downing Street defended the decision to honour both men, with a spokesperson saying: ""You have to look at their whole career.""

Mr Kilroy-Silk had already been taken off air by BBC bosses for the comments, in which he also described Arabs as ""limb-amputators, women repressors"". He told reporters he was ""very angry"" and planned to press charges if his attacker was caught. ""As I started to turn round a guy tipped a bucket of farmyard muck over me and then threw the rest of it over me and the car,"" Mr Kilroy-Silk said. Police say the suspect ran off after towards Wilmslow Road after committing the offence but is believed to have been driving a red Vauxhall Corsa earlier. ""I was totally covered, it was all through my clothes, and it stank to high heaven. Fortunately someone at the school had a change of clothes to let him have."" They are treating the incident as assault. Mr Kilroy-Silk, an MEP for the East Midlands, resigned the UK Independence Party whip in the European Parliament in October, after criticising UKIP and stating his ambition to be leader. ""I think that is sufficient time for us to put in process what is necessary... in time for us to fight and have a significant impact upon the General Election."""
1053,"But this financial year, because of ""volatility in the oil market"", he said the duty would be frozen. Petrol duties frozen, Brown says
Chancellor Gordon Brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his pre-budget speech to the Commons on Thursday. ""But this financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market I propose to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze on the main road fuel duties."" In 2000 the People's Fuel Lobby caused chaos by blocking roads with slow-moving convoys after Mr Brown threatened to raise fuel taxes. But the organisation urged drivers to continue to shop around to get the best price for petrol. ""We are concerned that although Britain leads the world in rhetoric about climate change it often fails in practical action,"" said a spokesman."
1054,"Campaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for May but could be any time before June 2006. The Liberal Democrats say the Conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest. They were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement, working hard and accepting their responsibilities. Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain. Saying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue ""down the path of ever rising taxes"". And he says the Tories would get a grip on crime, immigration and disorder. He says in the manifesto foreword: ""They have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by Mr Blair."" He was asked if Tory support for the government on Iraq and identity cards had given the Lib Dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to Labour. ""The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder,"" he says. It had nothing to do with putting ""clear blue water"" between himself and his opponents."

""The current legal system is certainly having a very adverse effect on the Muslim community in Britain and the whole Asian community. ""I think it is giving Britain a bad name internationally"". he added. They are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of Special Advocates who represent detainees before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) - a secure court without a jury, which tries terror suspects. ""They are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in, the right to trial by jury, has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights.""

""I can assure that there is a distinct possibilty that more lawyers may be resigning,"" he said."
1056,"The deal, struck at the European Council last week, also proved claims of a clash between Muslims and Christians were ""wrong"", Mr Blair said. It represented the achievement of an ""historic British objective"", he added. Mr Blair has been a leading advocate of Turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea. Tory leader Michael Howard said the deal laid to rest any suggestion the EU was ""anti-Islamic"". But the Tory leader argued that the EU constitution was not designed to take in a country as large as Turkey. It could take up to 15 years before Turkey is able to join, and entry cannot be guaranteed. The EU has also announced that it will start accession talks with Croatia in April 2005."
1057,"Safety representatives were often ignored when raising concerns because there was no legal duty to respond, claimed the union organisation. Protect whistleblowers, TUC says
The government should change the law to give more protection to employees who raise health and safety concerns about their workplaces, the TUC has said. Rory O' Neill, editor of union-backed Hazards magazine, which conducted the research, said: ""Giving union safety reps more rights in more workplaces is the ultimate win-win. The Health and Safety Executive had said that it had launched an initiative to make factories and offices safer, with more worker involvement. He added that workers who are not in a union, as well as casual and migrant workers, ""stand little chance of redress."" ""It would be a fatal mistake not to take full advantage of the union safety effect."" ""Death and injuries at work increased last year, for the second time since the turn of the century."

But the outgoing European Commissioner said his comments - made some 26 years ago - needed to be put in context. He said advocates for reform needed to be inside the Lords to vote for it. ""History demonstrates that it's immensely useful for the British Council to have its chairman in the House of Lords and that was a conclusive factor."" Mr Kinnock added that the second factor behind his acceptance of the peerage was his appointment as chairman of the British Council."

Association of Chief Police Officers president Chris Fox said the current 24-hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords. The licensing changes have sparked concern among some MPs, councils and some senior police officers who fear they could exacerbate drinking problems. ""It's making money at the cost of human misery and the public purse, and the strategic planning process has been less than useless,"" he said. The police's job against alcohol-related crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time, she added. Mr Fox said the new laws, due to start being phased in next month, could help if food outlets, public transport and public toilets could cope with late-night drinkers.

In an apparent reference to his court action to gain access to her son, he says he was a great believer in responsibility and consequences, even when they were painful.

Regulations designed to ensure energy-efficient buildings are too lax, and builders routinely flout them anyway, it said. The report said there was far too little attention paid to many environmental issues, including water, even though supplies in parts of the South East are already too low. Housing plans criticised by MPs
""Irreversible environmental damage"" will be caused by government plans to build more than one million homes in south-east England, MPs have warned. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said the report was completed before new initiatives were announced. Financing for improving transport was around one-twentieth of what would be required. Chairman of the Environmental Audit Committee Peter Ainsworth MP, said: ""The government's housing policy is an alarming example of disjointed thinking in an areas where joined-up policy is crucial. He said: ""We are working across government, especially with our colleagues at Defra, to create cleaner, safer and greener communities, while protecting and enhancing the environment."" - Measures to encourage improved energy efficiency for existing homes should be considered - including reduced stamp duty for homes that achieve set standards and a clear timetable for achieving zero-emissions homes."

It is also calling on the senior judge in England and Wales, Lord Woolf, to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in September to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty. Lord Woolf's Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC) caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime. ""The committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor."" He said: ""By making express provision for murder tariffs in the Criminal Justice Act, Parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences. Shadow home secretary David Davis echoed criticisms of the way Mr Blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules. ""The danger of having a prescriptive approach is that whilst every murder is awful, it is also different,"" he told BBC News."
1064,"'No-one can define new hunt ban'
The new law banning hunting with dogs is ""so poorly drafted"" no-one can define the offence, pro-hunt MPs say. Because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting. The Middle Way group also said Mr Bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animals that would have previously gone free. Mr Bradshaw was initially told it was an offence - prompting him to complain. In a later conversation Mr Bradshaw was told that according to Defra's lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was ""not in fact hunting as described in the Hunting Act 2004 therefore you would not be committing an offence"". Mr Opik said: ""Hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the Hunting Act. ""However, all these activities involve the use of dogs to chase wild mammals. ""How is the village bobby who sees a group of people with dogs supposed to distinguish between illegal hunting, exempt hunting, drag hunting, unintentional hunting, a hunt exercising hounds or simply chasing away?""

Mr Williams had said he did not think it was a Welsh-English issue, but said Hereford hospital was ""struggling financially and trying to pass the problem back to Powys"". He said the problem had been caused by the difference in waiting time targets between England and Wales. ""But Powys Local Health Board is committed to ensuring our patients receive the care that is appropriate,"" said the assembly government. They will be contacted by their GPs in the next week."" Earlier, David Rose, Chief Executive of Hereford Hospitals NHS Trust, had said: ""It is with real regret that we have taken this step. ""In 2005 our waiting time will fall to a maximum of 6-months and we want Powys people to ask to be referred to our modern hospital. ""We appeal to Powys Local Health Board to allow Powys people to choose Hereford for their treatment."""

The Tories also claim that of the £750m the prime minister pledged in 2000 to invest on school sports facilities, only £41m had been spent. Shadow sports minister Lord Moynihan said the policy would empower local clubs and create a lasting legacy. ""We aim to shift the emphasis on after-school sport provision away from our overstretched teachers and schools directly in to the 151,000 sports clubs in the UK."" Government figures show that in England in 2002 only a third of schools at Key Stages 1, 3 and 4 and two-fifths of schools at Key Stage 2, met that target."

Schools must improve the quality of citizenship lessons - or social cohesion and democracy will suffer, says the education watchdog. Diversity ""certainly must not mean segregated or separate"", he said. Mr Bell said Muslim, Jewish and Evangelical Christian schools must be ""intolerant of intolerance"". Mr Bell expressed concern about schools which did not teach children enough about a ""common heritage"" and needed to do more to promote principles of mutual tolerance and social inclusion. The Ofsted chief said his forthcoming annual report would make particular reference to Muslim schools. ""I would go further and say that an awareness of our common heritage as British citizens, equal under the law, should enable us to assert with confidence that we are intolerant of intolerance, illiberalism and attitudes and values that demean the place of certain sections of our community, be they women or people living in non-traditional relationships,"" said Mr Bell.

The Scottish Executive has lost an appeal against an inmate's compensation for being forced to slop out in prison. The executive faces more than 1,000 similar claims for damages from prisoners and former inmates. On Thursday, the Court of Session threw out a move by the executive to apply a more rigorous standard of proof. More than 310 actions have already been raised in the Court of Session and sheriff courts in Scotland. Napier, a remand prisoner at the time, raised a legal challenge in 2001 under the European Convention on Human Rights, in which he sought £5,000. He said: ""Ministers were fully aware of the state of Scotland's jails. Executive ministers raised an appeal arguing that the standard of proof to be applied in cases alleging a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights through degrading and inhumane treatment should ""be beyond reasonable doubt"". ""A short term executive saving has resulted in a long term public cost."" Mr Kelly said: ""There are hundreds of people still undergoing slopping out, overcrowding and poor regime and those people will certainly be heartened by today's judgement."" Funds were available but they chose to ignore the problem and after this ruling I suspect we will be faced with even more claims and no doubt more payouts."
1069,"Ms Sturgeon has written to Mr McConnell asking for clarification on the move to allow the prisoner out. She said questions must be answered about his escape, if the public is to be reassured about safety. Michael Ferguson, 36, escaped after being allowed out of the high-security Carstairs unit. The executive spokeswoman said the recommendation for leave was agreed by a psychiatric advisor ""in conjunction with officials on behalf of ministers"". ""But at that stage presumably ministers can ask hard questions and can ask for reassurances that the patient is not a serious danger to the public or that any risk has been minimised."" BBC Scotland political correspondent Glenn Campbell said the first minister had ordered an urgent report into the situation. He said: ""We understand from the executive that in this case no individual minister signed off the approval for Michael Ferguson to be released unescorted from Carstairs. Police are still searching for Ferguson, who failed to return after a trip to East Kilbride on Monday. He is described as being 5ft 9ins tall, slim, with blond hair, blue eyes and a fair complexion. Ferguson was wearing a black jacket, grey jeans, black jumper and black shoes when he was last seen."

""Never again Tory boom and bust. He said Tory plans to cut £35bn tax would ""cut deep into public service"". The prime minister is to take part later on Saturday in an interactive question and answer session, fielding queries sent in by e-mail, text message and telephone as part of Labour's attempt to engage the public in their campaign. ""This will be the central dividing line at the election, between a Conservative Party taking Britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services, and a Labour government taking Britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, I am proud to say, spend by 2008 £60bn more."" In the speech - which prompted a standing ovation from an audience clearly ""warm"" to Mr Brown - he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years. It was now a ""party not just of employees, but of employers and managers"", he said."

""There are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning Gypsy and traveller sites,"" said Ms Cooper. In November, MPs urged ministers to make councils create sites because 3,500 travellers have no place to stop. Many MPs with rural constituencies, particularly in eastern England, have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers, saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments. ""The result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites, causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the Gypsies and travellers. ""Living on the side of the road or being worn down by planning appeals, legal action and eviction is no one's idea of fun."" Andrew Ryder, of the Traveller Law Reform Coalition, said: ""We welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for Gypsies and travellers, so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored. Numerous communities and councils were paying for lengthy and expensive evictions against travelling communities, said the MPs. Two of the most controversial traveller sites - Cottenham in Cambridgeshire and Minety in Wiltshire - remain embroiled in an ongoing legal battle."

A Plaid Cymru MP believes UK security services were involved in some arson attacks blamed on Welsh extremists. F&#244;n was released without charge . Mr Llwyd's theory has also been questioned by Plaid Cymru's former President, Dafydd Wigley. In March this year, North Wales Police reopened the case, saying materials kept during their investigations would be examined to find whether it would yield DNA evidence. He said: ""What I'm saying is that the role that they took wasn't the appropriate one, i.e. like an

Engineering firm Balfour Beatty and five railway managers are to go on trial for manslaughter over the Hatfield rail crash in 2000. The accident, on 17 October 2000, happened when the London to Leeds express came off the tracks at 115 mph, when it was derailed by a cracked section of rail. It is expected the trial could last as long as a year.

Mike Hobday, of the League Against Cruel Sports, told BBC News: ""We've long urged them to go drag hunting - to follow an artificial scent - and that is what we hope they do. ""But if they continue to chase foxes, to chase wild mammals around the countryside, that's against the law and we're confident they'll be brought to justice."" At the Court of Appeal on Wednesday, the Countryside Alliance failed in its attempt to have the Hunting Act ruled invalid. BBC correspondent Sarah Mukherjee said hunt supporters were in tears. But the group says hunting will continue in some form after the ban comes in, with hunts expected to test the new law to its limits. Farmer Geoff Brooks, a senior member of the Quorn hunt, told BBC News people's lives ""revolved around hunting"". The Association of Chief Police Officers has issued guidance to forces on how to deal with the new rules. He described the ban as ""ridiculous"" and ""badly thought out"" but said it would be hard for most people to defy it as they would not want to risk their incomes by getting a criminal record. A spokesman said: ""Basically, it's not going to be police officers chasing about in cars across fields, it will be based on intelligence and information received as well."""
1075,"Lord Falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer. On Tuesday, the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by 297 votes to 203, despite rebellion by 34 Labour MPs. He said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some MPs argue the situation is still unclear. He denied the concessions were a ""political manoeuvre"" forced by panic about the rebellion. Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, one of the chief critics of the plans, condemned the debate as a ""charade"" and complained the promises of changes to the bill were vague. It was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through Parliament but the result was a ""sensible solution"", he said. ""The motive has got to be to end suffering."" ""I don't think it is something to be embarrassed about. These issues are not easy to deal with,"" he went on. But Lord Falconer praised his minister for an ""excellent job""."

Tony Blair has promised that ""sport is back"" as a priority for schools. ""It's an important part of education and it's an important part of health,"" Mr Blair said. The prime minister launched a £500m initiative to allow school sports clubs in England to provide up to three hours of extra activity a week by 2010. He said: ""You've got to bring back school sport. It's got to be done differently than it was 30 or 40 years ago. It's still very, very important."" But the Conservatives warned of rising obesity levels and said that since only a third of children do two hours of sport a week currently, the government is promising something it cannot guarantee. The £500m move will also increase the number of specialist sport colleges from 350 to 400. He added the government had originally pledged ""for every pupil to get at least two hours of high-quality physical education"" a week."

Anti-terror plan faces first test
Plans to allow Home Secretary Charles Clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in Parliament. Mr Clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats. The new powers, designed to replace the existing laws and meet the Law Lords' concerns, would apply to British as well as foreign terror suspects. He also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days. Mr Davis told Today: ""It gives a minister, for the first time in modern history, the right to detain without trial, without showing the evidence and indeed, in some respects, almost the allegation against the individual concerned."" He questioned why there was ""such a rush"" to introduce the legislation when Mr Clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away. Nobody should doubt that terrorists at home and abroad wanted to attack the UK and its interests, he argued."

The 71-year-old served in Northern Ireland from 1981 to 1987 during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher. After leaving Northern Ireland in a reshuffle, he became a UK disability minister. But he experienced hostility from unionists some of whom dubbed him ""Minister of Discord"". Sir Nicholas was replaced as the member for Kensington and Chelsea by the flamboyant Alan Clark, after being deselected by his constituency in December 1996. Sir Nicholas claimed strong painkillers he was taking for a back problem had reacted badly with a small amount of alcohol.

He has dealt with this time and time and time again,"" Mr Blair told his monthly news conference in Downing Street. The government refuses to publish his advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential. The government could not pick and choose when to use the convention, he said. But a short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action. This is argument was rejected by Mr Blair, who said: ""Firstly, we haven't broken the precedent, and secondly Peter Goldsmith has made his statement and I have got absolutely nothing to add to it."" On Thursday, Lord Goldsmith said his statement had not been ""written by or at Number 10"". The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General. ""My view is we need the House of Lords to set up a special committee, summon the attorney, get all the papers out, look at exactly what happened,"" she said."

Police are investigating a British National Party leaflet posted to homes in south Wales opposing plans for a new mosque.

""It is a landmark building in Swansea and would otherwise just crumble,"" he said. The BNP has denied it is trying to stir up hatred of any race or religion, but argues that they should be able to debate this without fear of arrest. Swansea's Muslim community bought the former church, just across the road from the existing mosque on St Helen's Road, in the late 1990s.

""I think it's a matter of sadness that we are not seeing that from the Labour Party. We had what Ken Livingstone said, we had what Alastair Campbell has said and we have what others have said.

But British British Casino Association Chairman Penny Cobham said her members were ""outraged"" by the decision, which followed a campaign in the Daily Mail newspaper. ""Limiting the number of regional casinos to eight in the first phase is a cautious move that will allow us to test the impact of a new kind of casino on the levels of problem gambling,"" he said. ""Instead of the initial intention of the gambling bill, to liberalise the rules governing gambling, the bill now imposes a more restrictive regime than exists at present.""

On Monday Tony Blair insisted closer co-operation did not mean losing control of British borders. ""There is no question of Britain giving up our veto on our border controls,"" he said. The EU has opted to adopt qualified majority voting in this area - previously measures needed unanimous agreement from all member states. Tory spokesman David Davis told MPs the UK was losing its power of veto over who was allowed to come to Britain. ""The government is employing the politics of confusion - I think, deliberately,"" argued Mr Davis.

Within the next few weeks a clearer picture would emerge of the long-term costs of reconstruction, he added. But the exact allocation could not be clarified until the World Bank had completed its assessment of the needs of the countries affected. ""It is just an immensely difficult job to get absolutely accurate figures, all countries are struggling with this.""

Labour peer Baroness Kennedy, who is chairing the Power Inquiry into political disengagement, said people already thought politicians engaged in dirty tricks. Mr Campbell is acting as an adviser for Labour, which denies engaging in personal campaigning. ""I suggest the BBC concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics, the trivialisation of the campaign.

Prime Minister Tony Blair has defended the Licensing Act, saying it is wrong to deny people the relaxed hours enjoyed elsewhere in Europe because of a ""tiny minority"" of violent binge drinkers. But he is confident problems in the early days can be ""ironed out"". A six-month transitional period starts on 7 February during which time venues can apply for extended licences. Lib Dem Home Affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: ""It would clearly be prudent to allow the police and local authorities more time to prepare for flexible drinking hours."" But aspects such as transport, and basic things such as making sure public toilets are open all night had to be taken into account. On Monday, the Lib Dems also called for a delay.

Roger Bennett, head of gaming industry body ELSPA, said banning violent games would be wrong. He said: ""We don't want to go down that route.

Minister Richard Caborn said the government was tackling the causes and the symptoms of the problem by allowing more powers to close down problem premises. Tories opposing 24-hour drinking
The Tories say plans to extend pub opening times should be put on hold until binge drinking is under control, despite backing a law change last year. ""To take away that ability for all the population - even the vast majority who are law abiding - is not, in my view, sensible."" Earlier this year the Royal College of Physicians said it opposed the plan to extend drinking hours when there was already an ""epidemic"" of binge drinking.

""Four years after the outbreak, Defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors' costs, and £40m of invoices remain unpaid,"" Mr Leigh said. He also said Defra had been ""dreadfully slow"" in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis. In November it emerged European Commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the UK government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis. Mr Leigh said being ""better prepared"" would also help avoid the need for ""mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak"".

Plans to create a single correctional agency for Scotland have been scrapped. Scotland's reoffending rate is high, with more than 60% of prisoners reconvicted within two years of release from jail. Ministers thought merging the prison service with the council-controlled criminal justice social work departments, which provide community sentences, might have provided an answer. However, following a consultation on the idea, Justice Minister Cathy Jamieson has decided to drop the plans. A national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise Ms Jamieson on the SPS's role and performance in reducing reoffending. She will announce the move in her Criminal Justice Plan on Monday, aiming to ""break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community"". The minister said: ""Better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there. ""It costs the taxpayer £35,000 a year to provide each prison place and that cost is increasing. ""Therefore, as we continue to invest in the service, it is only right that we seek to ensure that that service becomes more accountable to the public it serves, to ministers and to parliament."""

But that strategy could prompt criticism he was seeking to ""cut and run"" after less then four years of a parliamentary term.

The action follows Chancellor Gordon Brown's announcement in July that 104,000 jobs would be cut, with around 6,000 of those expected in Wales. ""We will provide help with information, relocation and retraining to help staff move into frontline work within the public sector, but we will not be diverted from these necessary changes so that we can make this essential investment.""

But that situation could change with new legal reforms. ""In addition, the question of whether there should be an inquiry at all may be highly controversial and if a judge is appointed, the judiciary, as a result of the appointment, may be seen as siding inappropriately with the government."" ""What I am asking for is a situation where if the lord chancellor cannot obtain my agreement [on appointing a judge], it doesn't happen,"" he said. ""As Lord Woolf also acknowledged, it is highly unlikely that the lord chancellor would appoint a judge against the wishes of the lord chief justice."

1108,"Lib Dems target the student vote
Students can decide the fate of MPs in some seats at the next election, Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy has claimed. In fact, some may vote where the parents live. The Conservatives say they would abolish university tuition fees and instead offer large student loans at commercial rates of interest. Labour has pushed through plans to let universities charge fees of up to £3,000 a year, with the poorest students eligible for non-repayable support of up to £3,000. He said: ""Top-up fees put students off university, especially those from a poorer background. ""And is it really right that so many young people are starting out in life with mortgage-style debts hanging round their necks?"" Launching his campaign to win students' votes at the London School of Economics, Mr Kennedy urged students to ""make their mark"". Although the expected 5 May election would be during term time, students can vote by post. Some hall wardens are reluctant to register students because of data protection fears - but students can get themselves registered. - The seats where the Lib Dems say student votes can swing the election for them are: Bristol West, Cardiff Central, Leeds North West, Cambridge, Manchester Gorton, Sheffield Central, Oxford East, Newcastle-upon-Tyne Central, Liverpool Riverside, Holborn and St Pancras, Oldham East and Saddleworth, Manchester Withington, Islington South and Finsbury, Birmingham Yardley, Surrey South West, Taunton, Orpington, Haltemprice and Howden, Eastbourne, Isle of Wight, Dorset West, Bournemouth East, Wells, Canterbury, Cities of London and Westminster, Bournemouth West, Westmorland and Lonsdale."
1109,"Members urged the government to set up a task force to tackle deaths in prisons, police cells, detention centres and special hospitals. Many of those who ended up taking their own lives had ""presented themselves"" to the authorities with these problems before they even offended, the report said. It questioned whether prison was the most appropriate place for them to be kept and whether earlier intervention would have meant custody could have been avoided. Committee chairman Labour MP Jean Corston said: ""Each and every death in custody is a death too many, regardless of the circumstances. The committee also highlighted ""deeply worrying"" cases of children and young people taking their own lives. ""Crime levels are falling but we are holding more people in custody than ever before. ""Yet throughout our inquiry we have seen time and time again that extremely vulnerable people are entering custody with a history of mental illness, drug and alcohol problems and potential for taking their own lives."" The misplaced over-reliance on the prison system for some of the most vulnerable people in the country is at the heart of the problems that we encountered.

Once they have the necessary documentation, those subject to immigration controls wishing to get married in England or Wales must register their intention to marry at one of 76 specially-designated register offices. Over the last year immigration service operations against marriages of convenience have been stepped up resulting in a growing number of convictions. In a report published last July the cross-party committee stated there was a ""significant risk"" the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were ""disproportionate"". ""We're currently taking a legal opinion on this. ""It may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly it's still not as difficult to marry in the UK than it is to marry, for example, in Holland, Germany or France. And last November Samuel Amoah, a Belgian national who set up two sham weddings for couples who wanted to remain in the UK, was jailed for three years. Several other cases are currently going through the courts. Mr Rimmer, the service director for registrations of marriages at Brent Council in north-west London, said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties. Certainly those who are illegals in this country, of which we had quite a few, will no longer be getting married,"" Mr Rimmer said."

The government is being naive by refusing to allow phone-tap evidence in court, a senior EU politician says. Mr Solana told ITV1's Jonathan Dimbleby programme: ""[Phone-tap evidence in court] works, it is normal that it is done, it would be naive not to do it. ""It would be naive not to use this technological thing that we have at our disposal."" The home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance. Some of this evidence is believed to be telephone intercepts. He has opted for a system of ""control orders"" whereby suspects, both British and foreign, can be held under house arrest or surveillance. Human Rights group Liberty has argued that if intercept evidence could be heard, these detainees could be brought to trial. While accepting that people ""have to be prepared"" for a possible terrorist attack, Mr Solana said he had ""qualms"" about the home secretary's new plans. ""We have to fight terrorism with all our means, but not so far as to change our way of life,"" he said."

Last week Ms Jamieson and First Minister Jack McConnell met supporters' representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue. They plan to hold an anti-sectarian summit next month with officials from the clubs, church leaders, senior police officers and local authority chiefs among those to be invited. Ms Jamieson said the executive should have a role in tackling the soccer troublemakers. Ms Jamieson praised the police for their action and said: ""The police do want to identify whether there are particular individuals who are going over the top and inciting hatred or violence - they will crack down very effectively on them. ""That is the kind of thing we want to stop and that's the kind of thing supporters' groups are very clear they don't want to be part of either, and they will work with us to try and deal with that.""

Belmarsh prison has been dubbed Britain's Guantanamo Bay by civil rights campaigners opposed to the use of emergency anti-terror laws. However those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. The law lords said the measures were incompatible with European human rights laws. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: ""Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.

Tony Blair faces his first prime minister's questions of 2005 after a week of renewed speculation about his relationship with Gordon Brown. Meanwhile, the chancellor is leaving Britain on a high-profile tour of Africa to highlight poverty issues. The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Labour's Paul Flynn said the pair had had a ""scorching"" from MPs.

On Sunday, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy repeated his call for a ""pause"" in considering the legislation. Mr Clarke is expected to try and win over opponents to the scheme by saying officials who secretly accessed information they were not allowed to see would face up to two years in jail. But opponents say that similar schemes in other countries have not prevented attacks like the Madrid rail bombing. But former shadow attorney general Bill Cash said there was still ""very deep"" disquiet about the plan among senior Tories. He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration.

There was an outcry three months ago when the Sentencing Guidelines Council - led by Lord Woolf - published its proposals for England and Wales. The guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible, by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co-operation, he said. ""I am confident, as a result, that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending.""

It said, despite four years of preparations, some local authorities and parts of the health sector were still not ready.

As well as the growth of internet and mobile phone betting, there has been the creation of betting exchanges which allow punters to fix odds between themselves. The report recommended the governing bodies of sports have a say in the type of bets offered to punters, and for bookmakers to set up ""audit trails"" - something the new betting exchanges already do - to allow suspicious betting patterns to be traced. Betting exchanges allow punters to back (to win) but also lay (to lose) a horse."

Scottish Finance Minister, Tom McCabe MSP, said: ""Last week in parliament I announced an additional £419m for core expenditure to local government in Scotland. ""However, most of the increase is targeted to new initiatives and councils will experience difficulties in maintaining core services,"" a Cosla spokesman said.

Under their vision, it would be one of five in the new super regiment. The Save the Scottish Regiments campaigners were so angered they threatened to stand against Labour at the next general election. ""They are very much not for the good and will destroy Scotland's regiments by moulding them into a single super regiment which will lead to severe recruitment problems, a loss of local connections to those regiments and a loss to Scotland of an important part of her heritage and, most importantly, her future - the regiments are the envy of armies around the world."" For a brief time, there was speculation the prime minister might consider the plan, but that now seems unlikely. The prime minister said he hoped campaigners' concerns would be taken into account but the need for effective change had to be paramount."
1141,"Student 'inequality' exposed
Teenagers from well-off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas, a report says. Increasingly more women than men went to university, while tuition fees and student loans made no major difference. But the percentage of poorer students ""hardly changed at all"", said its chief executive, Sir Howard Newby. In fact surprisingly more go into postgraduate study than those from more affluent backgrounds. He said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils, between the ages of 16 and 18, it was too late. But while the report revealed stark inequalities and exposed the extent of the challenge, there were some encouraging findings, he added. He told BBC News: ""We know, once children from deprived backgrounds get into university, they do very well. The group which represents university vice-chancellors, Universities UK, said the new system of deferred fees in England, due to start in 2006, with grants and bursaries for poorer students, would encourage more of them to go into higher education. ""Tackling these must be the top priority for any government looking to improve university access."" The tables below show the participation rate for each Parliamentary constituency in Britain:"
1142,"Kennedy to make temple address
Charles Kennedy is set to address 2,000 people at a Hindu temple as part of an appeal to ethnic minority voters. Mr Kennedy is to tell the audience: ""Many people in Britain, of all races, cultures and religions, were angry about the way we were taken to war in Iraq. He will also say that the Lib Dems want to ""restore Britain's reputation on the world stage"" by fighting international poverty and climate change, and protecting human rights. ""And they saw the principled stand the Liberal Democrats took at the time."" He said afterwards that the Prime Minister had offered some ""movement"" to address his concerns. The plans face trouble in the Lords if Conservative and Lib Dem opposition continues."
1143,"David Blunkett in quotes
David Blunkett - who has resigned as home secretary - built his reputation as a plain-speaking Yorkshire man. I fell in love with someone and they wouldn't go public and things started to go very badly wrong in the summer, and then the News of the World picked up the story. ""I tried for three years to make something work."" ""Our work with the French government...has been hugely successful,"" said Mr Blunkett. ""None of us believe countering terrorism is about party politics."" ""You wake up and you receive a phone call - Shipman's topped himself. You have just got to think for a minute: is it too early to open a bottle?"""
1144,"""We answer this every election campaign and, for the reasons I have given before, the answer is no,"" he said at his monthly news conference. Televised debates have become the high point of the US presidential election campaigns. In October Tory leader Michael Howard said Mr Blair would be running scared if he refused calls to go head-to-head."
1145,What the election should really be about? In 1997 and 2001 they voted Labour. We are challenging the use of the Parliament Act 1949 in a High Court action. We would like the support of political parties but I think a general election is very much to do with pledges MPs make to their electors. He wanted the issue off the table until after the election. That the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment. It is hard to say whether we will be successful. Regrettably it's one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press. I think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda. There will be a huge effect throughout the industry and I would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations.
1146,"As he told journalists: ""I am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers. So why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with Mr Brown's long-arranged keynote speech on aid and debt, he was asked? By now Mr Blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting. Although in the next breath he declared: ""I get increasingly alarmed by what I read in the newspapers"" before catching himself on and quickly adding: ""In so far as I read them of course."" Well, not really, as it happens. As far as the timing of the prime minister's press conference is concerned, there are two options. All this came amid fresh claims that Mr Brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had, as a result, started to set out his own platform. The second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence, which would suggest the government has lost its once-famed ability to strictly co-ordinate announcements - through the infamous Downing Street grid - to avert just such allegations. Brown and Blair face new rift claims
For the umpteenth time, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are said to have declared all out war on each other. He probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men."
1147,"But he changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, the book claims. ""At that stage he saw Gordon Brown and said, 'look you are the next most influential member of the government, I need your help to get through the next year,"" Mr Peston said. The book, serialised in the Sunday Telegraph, alleges that Mr Blair told the chancellor at a dinner hosted by deputy PM John Prescott in November 2003 of his intention to stand down. ""What the book says is there now a pretty profound mutual mistrust, mutual animosity. There has been fresh speculation of a rift recently, following their separate responses to the Asian tsunami. There was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other's response to the disaster. ""I think in public you see this double act pretending everything is alright but in private I don't think the relationship is good because Brown, understandably, feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership."" Conservative policy co-ordinator David Cameron, MP for Witney, added: ""If it wasn't so serious it would be funny. the Labour MP for Birkenhead asked. He said the prime minister should sack Mr Brown, but did not believe Mr Blair was strong enough to do so."
1148,"It claims Tony Blair felt by November 2003 he had lost voters' trust because of the Iraq war and that he was no longer an asset to the Labour Party. I said then you don't do deals over jobs like this - you don't. Mr Peston told BBC News: ""My understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were. ""Either they need to grow up and put their squabbles to one side or they cannot expect the electorate to support a divided government at the next election."" Former welfare minister Frank Field MP said the prime minister should sack Mr Brown, but did not believe Mr Blair was strong enough to do so. There has been fresh speculation of a rift recently, following their separate responses to the Asian tsunami. The Liberal Democrat parliamentary chairman Matthew Taylor said the personal ambition of Mr Blair and Mr Brown was ""getting in the way of good government"". He told Sky News' Sunday with Adam Boulton: ""This is the politics of the playground and Britain really does deserve better."" But the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a ""load of nonsense"". There was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other's response to the disaster."
1149,"Could rivalry overshadow election? Ian Gibson, for example, urged the two men to stop squabbling, declaring: ""For goodness sake, sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can."" Meanwhile large numbers of backbench MPs insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter, which they believe is a media-only obsession, or that they fear for the efficient running of a government beset by such rivalry. For example, the weekend's attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick. Tony Blair will seek to reassure Labour MPs on Monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at Westminster - a behind-closed doors meeting which Gordon Brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity. That claim was repeated in Robert Peston's book, a book which amply demonstrates this corrosive Downing Street soap opera is nowhere near its final act. But it is not just public pronouncements from ex-aides. So they have both been accused of actually making matters worse by feeding the speculation with their own behaviour. They started with and are sustained by ""friends"" of the two men. The trouble is, both men have fallen short of offering simple, straightforward denials of the central claims."
1150,"His only ""motivation"" was to ensure Labour was re-elected, he insisted. I said then you don't do deals over jobs like this - you don't. Brown in appeal for Labour unity
Gordon Brown has made an appeal for unity after reports claimed Mr Blair went back on a pledge to stand down before the next general election. In a separate interview with BBC political editor Andrew Marr, Mr Brown said: ""It's very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a Labour government. ""I think it is very important to stress that that is the motivation that I have. ""The only reason why we are in government is to get on with the job in a unified way to deal with the challenges facing this country."" And I am not going to be diverted or distracted, nor is Tony Blair, by newspaper stories or books or rumours or gossip. Things are very difficult."" There was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other's response to the disaster. Liberal Democrat parliamentary chairman Matthew Taylor said the personal ambition of Mr Blair and Mr Brown was ""getting in the way of good government""."
1151,"It has caused a new wave of concern among Labour MPs gearing up to defend their seats in an election, widely expected to be held in May, and several members are understood to have lined up to express their discontent at the PLP meeting. The prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other and seemingly in good spirits at the start of the meeting which lasted around an hour. A new book, Brown's Britain by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston, says Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet allies intervened in June 2004. Mr Blair told the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) on Monday: ""I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need."" Mr Blair on Sunday dismissed claims of broken promises, saying: ""I've dealt with this six months ago. I said then you don't do deals over jobs like this - you don't."" ""It's very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a Labour government,"" he said. Ex-Labour leader Neil Kinnock said Mr Blair and Mr Brown could only deal with the media frenzy by continuing to say they would not allow a row to damage Labour or British interests. Liberal Democrat parliamentary chairman Matthew Taylor said their personal ambition was ""getting in the way of good government"". Mr Blair had decided in November 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters' trust because of the Iraq war."
1152,"Relations between Mr Brown and Mr Milburn are widely reported to be cool ever since Mr Blair brought the latter back into the Cabinet to run Labour's election campaign, a role successfully carried out by Mr Brown in both 1997 and 2001. The prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other for the meeting of the PLP and were seemingly in good spirits as it started. Labour's Paul Flynn said Mr Blair and Mr Brown had a ""scorching"" from MPs adding: ""It was a Parliamentary Labour Party meeting like no other."" The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Backbencher Stephen Pound said some MPs had threatend to expose those fuelling the reports if Mr Blair and Mr Brown did not ""stop this nonsense, this poisonous briefing"". Mr Blair has insisted he has done no deals over the premiership while Mr Brown says he will not let ""gossip"" distract him from helping a unified election campaign. ""They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today on Tuesday. Mr Prescott said there were occasional disagreements in any government. But he argued Mr Blair and Mr Brown could work successfully together and had produced a strong economy and better public services. ""Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,"" he joked."
1153,"As Paul Flynn said: ""What has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times, when we wanted to come together, we wanted to lead on the global issues, to change politics for the next decade, the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party, two people we greatly respect."" And it was largely that fear that led to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown being read the riot act during a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party. Stephen Pound echoed the message, saying: ""We know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve, not for the Labour Party but for this country, is the appearance of division. We remember the 1980s"". They backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped, the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be ""named and shamed"". The views expressed by both backbenchers and Labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely-held view within the Labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election. What all seem agreed on, however, is that this sniping simply cannot be allowed to go on through the election campaign. Similarly, some were pointing out that the chancellor, during the election poster launch, once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said. For example, will those Brownite briefers suggest their man is unhappy at the prime minister's timing or subject matter, as may have been the case in the past? Mind you, we have heard similar pledges before."
1154,"ITV will not fund the election campaign for the eventual winner, but the publicity could give the winner a flying start over other candidates. The show follows the time-honoured Pop Idol format, with queues of nervous hopefuls and a panel of three experts judging their performance. ""Any of them would make competent MPs,"" former independent MP Martin Bell insisted on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. But Sir Bernard Ingham, Margaret Thatcher's former press secretary, took a less charitable view, accusing the programme of ""corrupting politics"". Wheelchair user Kevin Donnellon was asked: ""Why on earth do you want our elected representatives to be disabled?"" ""If it gets more people voting and more people interested in politics there is no harm in that,"" he said. Among the more eccentric policy proposals was a public holiday on Bruce Forsyth's birthday and Bill Oddie for prime minister. ""Don't you care about the Inuit? I just couldn't seem to think of things to say,"" a crestfallen Mr Lim confided in the show's presenter, Jonathan Maitland. ""That was an total disaster."
1155,"It follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor. But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Labour's new posters say Britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. Downing Street cited that comment when reporters' suggested Mr Brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told Mr Blair: ""There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe"". They urge voters not to let the Tories take things backwards. Mr Brown later told reporters: ""Of course I trust the prime minister."" Labour's Paul Flynn said the pair had had a ""scorching"" from MPs. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. ""Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,"" he joked."
1156,"And the surest sign yet that we are heading for a general election in the next few months. It was also one of the most bizarre photo opportunities of recent years. The first inkling something slightly odd was afoot was when - in place of the soft rock music normally chosen for such occasions - Labour's speakers crackled to life with the sound of Booker T and the MGs. If press reports are to be believed, Alan Milburn and Gordon Brown have been at each other's throats over the contents of Labour's next election manifesto. Two were dressed as Regency dandies - to unveil a poster trumpeting ""the longest period of economic growth for 200 years"". The event was carefully stage-managed to underline Cabinet unity. There was much forced smiling for the cameras, but only Mr Prescott, who revels in such occasions, seemed to be truly enjoying himself. The chancellor walked side-by-side with Mr Milburn, pointedly exchanging chit chat, as they approached the microphone. Mr Milburn made a point of turning to face the chancellor, as he spoke, nodding thoughtfully. Thanks for dropping by Gordon, he might have been saying."
1157,"That question was later unveiled as the headline for new Tory campaign posters. ""He can stick up whatever he likes on billboards about something in a book but what the public will concentrate on are the low mortgages, low inflation, low unemployment that we delivered and that he failed to,"" he said. Brown's Britain, by Robert Peston, says there is mutual animosity between the two men. Mr Howard asked: ""How can they fight crime when they are fighting each other?"" He again insisted there could be no deals about the premiership but twice declined directly to say whether or not he had offered to quit. Mr Blair directly denied that quote on Wednesday. Labour staged a show of unity at its own poster launch on Tuesday, where Mr Brown was joined by Alan Milburn, who Mr Blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor. Later this week Mr Blair is expected to outline the direction of his party's next election manifesto. He declared: ""He is the deals on meals prime minister. No wonder the chancellor is not a happy eater."""
1158,"Each participant genuinely wants the row to stop, but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard. (In the case of Mr Blair and Mr Brown, successive books are published, ensuring the issues never die.) In the case of the Labour Party, if you believe the rift between Blair and Brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest, Solomon's wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem. The result is of course, both prisoners confess, so the sheriff does not have to let either one off. Now this isn't because the participants are stupid - it's actually each individual behaving entirely rationally, given the incentives facing them. If your partner doesn't confess, you'll get off completely. He tells each prisoner separately, that if they confess - and they are the only one to confess - they'll be let off their crime. It is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively, but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly. Both prisoners' individual logic was to behave that way, even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up. A cold war arms race for example - a classic case where both Russia and America would be better off with just a few arms, rather than a lot of arms."
1159,"And there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly ""New"" Labour - although that may continue to irritate his chancellor. And, for some, that means showing that New Labour actually does stand for something - that it is, as he said, more than ""an electoral device"". Under what is to be the general election slogan ""Britain is working"", the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly New Labour. ""For the first time ever a whole generation growing up with unbroken economic stability. ""Home ownership extended to its highest ever level and to families who have never before been able to afford it. Every adult - including those who missed out at school - able to get the skills then need to advance. And for many in Westminster, Mr Blair's performance has only succeeded in hardening the belief that will be on 5 May. Probably the greatest ideological divide between the two men, in so far as there is one, is about the degree of private finance allowed into the public services. ""The highest ever level of employment with everyone in work guaranteed a decent wage and decent conditions"". But for now, all eyes have been focused on the next general election."
1160,"The plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies, such as boards tackling industrial development and housing. His party leader, Michael Howard, argued a change in direction was needed to get a grip on spending. Announcing the plans, Mr Redwood said: ""Mr Blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers, and has broken the pledges he made. The Liberal Democrats have said they would cut the number of Whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services. ""In the real world, people are working harder just to stand still. They've seen their pensions knocked for six. ""They're being squeezed by extra taxes. ""Far from improving public services, spending taxpayers' money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats, more regulation and higher taxes."" ""Labour are creating Two Britains: the Britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic Britain,"" he said. But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Paul Boateng attacked the Tory plans."
1161,"The private member's bill would also abolish the ban on heirs to the throne marrying Roman Catholics. Labour peer Lord Dubs' Succession to the Crown Bill aims to end the right of male heirs to succeed to the crown even if they have an older sister. ""In 1998 the government said in principle it supported the idea of ending gender discrimination and that it would consult on how to come forward with its own measures. The Fabian Society's Sundar Katwala said the change was ""long overdue"" and that he expected a ""warm response"". Parliament will have to do it eventually, the government, and I hope all of the political parties, might think this is a very simple thing to have in their manifestos."" Mr Katwala added: ""This is long overdue. But he acknowledged that even if the bill did win support, it was unlikely to become law because the legislative programme is likely to be squeezed by the coming general election."
1162,"Now he is back in London as the UK Independence Party's not-so-secret electoral weapon after returning from the Ukraine where he helped - you guessed it - opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko. And he is scathing of the Tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable. So is UKIP's job to destroy the Tories, as former member Robert Kilroy-Silk once notoriously declared? Possibly a very American analogy, but another great soundbite. By any measure, New Yorker Dick Morris is that thing Americans love over everything else - a winner. ""The basic point is that the EU seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from Britain - and we oppose that and the Tories cannot be trusted to oppose it"". ""Anything can happen in the next general election. The aim of UKIP is to withdraw from the EU and if it has any relation to the Tories it is to stiffen the Tories' spine on the issue by having a large enough UKIP vote so that we move the Tories in the direction they are refusing to move. Many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art, irrespective of the politics. ""The internet was a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election - through blogs (individuals posting their views in online diaries)."
1163,"Mr Milburn gave more details of planned reforms in a speech to Labour's Fabian Society, in which he also praised Mr Brown as one of the leaders of the party's reform process. She told the Today programme: ""If the policy is seen as being about how do you make the feckless poor go back to work then it is not going to work, on the one hand. ""What we want is for more people to earn and own,"" Mr Milburn told BBC Radio 4's Today show. For the Lib Dems, Simon Hughes said many pensioners are means tested for the money they needed and students who were told there wouldn't be tuition fees and more debt ""have been given exactly the opposite"". Mr Milburn told Today that Labour wanted policies which encouraged increased social mobility in Britain. In the speech, he backed choice in schools and hospitals, wider home ownership and changes to the welfare system. In our third term we have to break it."" He added: ""Under New Labour, all households are still paying unfair council tax rather than a fairer alternative."" ""There is a glass ceiling on opportunity in this country. In our first two terms we have raised it."
1164,"Teens 'know little' of politics
Teenagers questioned for a survey have shown little interest in politics - and have little knowledge. The ICM survey interviewed 110 pupils for education watchdog Ofsted. And 4% of those questioned thought the Conservatives were in power - while 2% of them believed the Lib Dems were. It found the Union flag and fish and chips topped the list of symbols and foods associated with being British."
1165,"But Mr Howard announced that, of the £35bn he has earmarked from savings, £12bn will be used to plug Labour's claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in Mr Letwin's first budget. But he did, for the first time, say there would be such tax cuts. The big idea is his £35bn savings on waste and bureaucracy which Mr Howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts. Mr Howard, however, was dismissive. ""These things happen from time to time. There are disagreements between Robert Jackson and me. The election will be decided on ""the economy stupid"". ""The election is not going to be decided on what Robert Jackson did,"" he added. And that is certainly true. Whether this will finally be enough to shift those polls remains to be seen."
1166,"However, the remainder would deal with some of the ""unfair taxes"". ""Almost every independent expert says if you get another Labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes,"" Mr Howard insisted. The £12bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing, he added. Mr Howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election. ""Because borrowing is going up, it is out of control, that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both. Mr Howard is expected to say that around £6bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on Monday. A poll for the News of the World newspaper suggests the Conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in a century. However the defection on Saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the Conservatives' spending plans. Savings of £153m at the Foreign Office and £336m at the Department for Culture Media and Sport, have also been identified. However, Chief Treasury Secretary Paul Boateng said: ""None of the Tories' figures add up so they can't make these savings and can't pay for any tax cuts, which means the only guaranteed cut from the Tories is £35bn of cuts, hitting frontline public services hard."""
1167,"And he insisted there was ""no limit"" to his party's ambitions in the coming poll. Sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test. And Mr Kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the party's Westminster HQ. They would argue that, by the time of the election after next, the Liberal Democrats may genuinely have replaced the Tories as the party challenging Labour for power. He was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than £100,000 a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees, the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax. He will not talk about the big breakthrough, although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold. But the Liberal Democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they, not the Tories, who are now the real threat to Labour. There was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self-delusion. That is no longer the case with the Liberal Democrats. But Mr Kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that."
1168,"""The lord chancellor...no more needs to be a lawyer than the Secretary of Health needs to be a doctor,"" said courts minister Christopher Leslie. Under the reforms, the Law Lords will also be replaced as the UK's highest legal authority by a Supreme Court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers. ""It is no longer appropriate for a government minister to have such unfettered discretion in the appointment of judges."" The debate was carried over from the last Parliamentary session, but with an impending general election time is crucial for the government to get the Bill passed. Mr Leslie said it was irrelevant whether the post was called Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs or Lord Chancellor. He said: ""What matters most is...whether it is reformed so that the post holder no longer has those conflicting duties. The government had initially proposed to take this institution and ""smash it to pieces,"" Mr Grieve said. Convention should be ""nurtured and celebrated,"" but the government distrusted and disliked it instead. Shadow attorney general Dominic Grieve criticised the government on its plans to change what he said was an ""exceptional institution,"" providing a ""champion of the independence of the judiciary""."
1169,"Mr Brown seems haunted by her eyes, desolate of all hope. His answer, in part, is because of the missionaries that used to come to his father's church. Ever since, he says, Africa has been important to him. I've absolutely no doubt whatsoever this is heartfelt. Not the dull, reassuring bank manager but a man driven by a moral passion - and it just so happens the Labour Party feels an awful lot happier ridding the world of debt than ridding the world of dictators. But he also believes it is time for the world to see a new Gordon Brown. There's also a sense of liberation. If he can help the world's poor just a little, then it shows politics isn't worthless. But is his vision for Africa too grand?"
1170,"He defended the package, saying it was a plan for the Tories' first Budget and he hoped to be able to go further. The Tory tax plan follows complaints from some of the party's MPs that Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin have taken too long to unveil the proposals. Tory backbencher Edward Leigh said the proposals were a step in the right direction but he told the Financial Times: ""I would come up sooner with much greater tax cuts."" ""On the other side, there are people who say we won't be able to achieve these tax cuts. Interviewed on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show, Mr Howard said: ""It is perfectly true that I am being attacked on one side by people who think we ought to be promising much, much bigger tax cuts and spending cuts. ""I think we have got it about right."" The party on Tuesday challenged the Tories to publish the full report from David James, the trouble-shooter they asked to identify possible savings. Now they have promised a figure but have yet to reveal which taxes would be targeted. Labour hit back at the Tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator Alan Milburn accusing Mr Howard of producing a ""fraudulent prospectus""."
1171,"He made his fortune from care homes and health clubs. The businessman, whose latest venture is a casino in Newcastle, also voiced concern about the ongoing violence in Iraq. Donor attacks Blair-Brown 'feud'
The reported feud between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown has prompted a Labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds. Mr Bannatyne said: ""Disunity in the Cabinet has a corrosive effect on the country. His spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give Labour more money, although he would remain a supporter and not fund the Conservatives. Mr Bannatyne is due to host a new television programme and is also appearing on BBC2 business start-up programme Dragon's Den. ""The US has forces helping on the ground - we can do more."" ""The people there need practical help not just pledges of money,"" he said. In a separate development, Robin Cook gave his support to Mr Brown's prime ministerial ambitions but told a lunch for political journalists winning the election had to be Labour's election. Mr Cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was ""not an alternative source of opposition to the government""."
1172,"The premier was responding to a challenge from Tory leader Michael Howard who said Labour would raise taxes in its post-election Budget. The Tories on Monday highlighted their plans for tax cuts worth £4bn, although the specific taxes to be cut have not been announced. Mr Blair replied: ""I think they are wrong for this very simple reason: that the Treasury forecasts on the economy have been proven right."" Howard and Blair tax pledge clash
Tony Blair has said voters will have to wait for Labour's manifesto to see if the party has plans to increase tax. They also spelled out their plans for reduced government borrowing and more spending on key services. Labour hit back at the Tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator Alan Milburn accusing Mr Howard of producing a ""fraudulent prospectus""."
1173,"What really divides the parties
So what is the gap between Labour and the Tories nowadays? One Starbucks, one Rymans and one small Greek cafe as it happens. These figures, based on the two parties' own detailed studies, will be battered to within an inch of their lives during the campaign. And they ridiculed the claims made on Monday by Michael Howard that he could save £35 billion of Labour waste and inefficiency to spend on public services while also offering £4 billion of tax cuts. ""Welcome to the unremittingly New Labour media centre,"" he said. And I'll bet he hadn't checked that one with Gordon Brown. Wednesday was just the start."
1174,"In a lecture at the London School of Economics, Irene Khan said human rights had been flouted in the name of security since 11 September, 2001. She said the human rights movement had to use simpler language both to prevent scepticism and spread a moral message. ""By using the language of war, human rights are being sidelined because we know human rights do not apply in times of war."" And it had to fight poverty, not just focus on political rights for elites. Amnesty International members voted in 2001 to extend the organisation's work from political and civil rights to cover social and economic rights too. ""Public passivity on the war against terror is the single most powerful indictment on the failures of human rights groups,"" she said. Such efforts could make the issues more relevant to people across the world, she said. Ms Khan said the human rights movement would make itself irrelevant if it turned away from the suffering caused by economic strife. The human rights groups also had to recognise there were new groups which had to be tackled in new ways as power dripped away from state governments. Al-Qaeda, for example, was not going to be impressed by a traditional Amnesty letter writing campaign."
1175,"Blair sees greater Bush consensus
George W Bush will display a more consensual approach to world politics as he begins his second term as US President, Tony Blair has said. He understood that ""the best prospect of peaceful co-existence lies in the spread of democracy and human rights"", Mr Blair told the Guardian newspaper. Mr Blair had personally seen the change over time in conversations with Mr Bush. The prime minister conceded that the US had ""what appears to be a harder position"" towards the state than Europe. Turning to critics' fears that the US was poised for further military action, Mr Blair refused to give succour to suggestions it was preparing for strikes against Iran. Mr Bush was sworn in at a ceremony in Washington DC on Thursday. ""We never answer questions about special forces, but do not take that as indicating an affirmative,"" said Mr Blair."
1176,"The MEP said he was ashamed to have joined the party, which he labelled as a ""joke"". He plans to stand in the next general election but refused to confirm he is setting up a new political party called Veritas - Latin for truth. UKIP leader Roger Knapman said he would ""break open the champagne"", adding: ""It was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye'."" It marks the end of his membership of UKIP after just nine months. It began with a flood of publicity which helped UKIP into third place in last June's European elections but became dominated by rancour as he tried to take over the party leadership. UKIP won 12 seats and 16.1% of the vote at the European elections on the back of its call for the UK to leave the European Union In his speech, Mr Kilroy-Silk says the result offered UKIP an ""amazing opportunity"" but the party's leadership had done nothing and ""gone AWOL"". Mr Kilroy-Silk explained his reasons to his East Midlands constituents at a meeting in Hinckley, Leicestershire. There were no policies, no energy, no vision and no spokespeople, he said. ""The party is going nowhere and I'm embarrassed with its allies in Europe and I'm ashamed to be a member of the party,"" said Mr Kilroy-Silk. He said his conviction in Britain's right to govern itself had not changed."
1177,"Mr Blair said: ""The Conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services. By contrast, he said, New Labour had listened to its electorate and changed. Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of ""misrepresenting"" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans. ""So now we have a choice, we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. And I say we have to fight."" Mr Brown warned that the Tories were planning ""the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto"". According to an advance text released by officials, he told delegates: ""We must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them."" ""The public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government, less waste and lower taxes with a Tory government,"" he concluded. ""Once again Mr Blair and his Chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the £8bn shortfall in their plans?"" Gordon Brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors."
1178,"With his party's previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government, he has switched tack. Similarly there is a different tone to the Lib Dem approach to asylum and immigration, with Mr Kennedy stressing politicians should not ""foment an artificial debate"" about immigration and attacking Michael Howard's proposals for quotas. They are to scrap student fees, finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. Labour and the Tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed. But, unlike the old Tory-Labour debate, he believes voters are ready to see ""modest"" tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services. In many ways the argument between the Lib Dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between Labour and the Tories in the 1980s and early 1990s. With the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes, Mr Kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation. He repeated his pledge not to do post-election deals with either party after the election. Mr Kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party's election chances, declaring the Tories were not going to be ""significant players"" in the poll. It is a dream the third party has dreamed many times before."
1179,"But even his caution cannot hide the fact that this is a party and a leader that believes it may well be on the way to something special in a few months' time. Kennedy's cautious optimism
Charles Kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general election. Won't voters looking for an alternative to Labour still naturally gravitate to the Conservatives? ""The problem is that, geographically, the Conservative party has melted away in about a third of Britain. ""Look, I have already said I am not going to put any artificial limits on our ambitions this time around,"" he said. He still seems to accept that the most likely outcome is another Labour victory of some sort. If, as expected, his party increases its showing at the election, he intends to go into the next parliament ""on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because I see that as the decisive opportunity for us"". He insists his three headline commitments, to be financed from a 1% tax increase on those earning over £100,000 a year, will appeal right across the political spectrum. ""This is really going to be the first modern three party UK election that we have all experienced"". As to his own future, he is clear."
1180,"He told the newspaper: ""I don't know whether I will ever go back on to the front, but don't rush me."" Hague 'given up' his PM ambition
Former Conservative leader William Hague says he will not stand for the leadership again, having given up his ambition to be prime minister. Asked if he would stand for the leadership again, Mr Hague replied: ""No. Definitely not."" He said: ""I feel fortunate that, by the age of 40, I had crammed in an entire political career. ""I had been in the Cabinet and been leader of the party, so now I can branch out into other things...it is a very liberating feeling."" ""Maybe I wasn't as driven by politics as I thought I was,"" he said."
1181,"But he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the British Empire, were sent to two Scottish newspapers. Mr Houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be ""made available to law-abiding members of the community"" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. The episode comes at a difficult time for UKIP, soon after the high-profile departure of MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk. He told BBC News: ""He appears to have said these things. Mr Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr Houston's reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not. We have suspended him as a member and as a candidate. ""The problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the English-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do."" ""By all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting. Mr Houston was quoted in the Herald newspaper saying: ""I feel UKIP have over-reacted and overshot the runway."""
1182,"""I think we need to look very carefully at the relationship between the Lords and the Commons,"" Lord Falconer told BBC1's Breakfast With Frost. The lord chancellor hinted further reforms could be unveiled in the next Labour manifesto. Baroness Boothroyd, who was the first woman to be Commons Speaker, said she believed Tony Blair initiated reforms without a clear outcome in mind. Boothroyd calls for Lords speaker
Betty Boothroyd has said the House of Lords needs its own Speaker and that peers should lead the way on reforming the upper chamber. ""We need to address the issue in the manifesto, but you will have to wait for when the manifesto comes."" ""I don't go for the idea of somebody - a lord chancellor - who is head of the judiciary, a senior Cabinet minister and Speaker of the Lords. ""I would really like to see a Speaker of the House of Lords,"" she said."
1183,"Details of the coming week's events were hammered out at a meeting at Mr Kilroy-Silk's Buckinghamshire home on Sunday, the BBC News Website was told. He said Mr Kilroy-Silk had made him deputy party leader of Veritas, Latin for truth. John Houston, 54, was due to stand in the East Kilbride seat in Lanarkshire at the next election. Mr Houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be ""made available to law-abiding members of the community"" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. A spokesman for UKIP called on Mr Hockney to quit the London Assembly. ""The problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the English-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do."" The document reportedly said: ""We're looking for the resurrection of the British Empire."
1184,"It has been a long journey for the new Lord Kinnock from his earliest days as a rebellious youngster in the south Wales valleys. ""I accepted the kind invitation to enter the House of Lords as a working peer for practical political reasons,"" he said when his peerage was first announced. ""It is a good base for campaigning on national issues like education, sustainable transport, industrial change and the ageing society and global concerns, particularly poverty and oppression."" Lord Kinnock - who led Labour from 1983 until 1992 - was until recently one of Britain's EU commissioners. Born in 1942 in Tredegar to a miner father and nurse mother, he attended Lewis Boys' School in nearby Pengam, known then as the ""Eton of the valleys"". He was not expected to win the 1987 election, when Margaret Thatcher was still riding high, but was bitterly disappointed to lose the next one in 1992 to John Major, and stepped down. A former critic of the House of Lords, he has said he will use the Upper House to advocate its reform and to talk on issues like higher education. But he joined the shadow cabinet in 1980, and after Labour's heavy defeat in the 1983 he was elected leader. He remained an MP until 1995, when he resigned to become European commission for transport."
1185,"Civil rights were infringed as little as humanly possible. Now the Blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism. An interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat: 1) If these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they WILL use them without fear of Mutually Assured Destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance. Notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempts on Prime Minister Thatcher in Brighton and on later occupants of 10 Downing Street, there was no retaliatory blitz on Belfast or Dublin as there has been on Afghanistan and Iraq. I agree in many ways with what Mr Forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent, it is hypocrisy of the highest order. I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth. We can have no moral justification for imposing our system of government on anyone while we are systematically depriving our own citizens of basic individual and collective freedoms. But as Forsythe criticises this government, Hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians. What of those falsely accused who will lose their careers? However it appears that he has misunderstood the term ""Islamic fundamentalism""."
1186,"'Super union' merger plan touted
Two of Britain's big trade unions could merge to form a ""super union"" of two million members. It is understood meetings will be held on Wednesday about the proposal. Amicus has 1.2 million members and the TGWU has 800,000. Both unions are remaining tight-lipped about the merger rumours, but one insider pointed out to the BBC News website that ""nobody is denying suggestions a merger could be on the agenda"" when the two unions' executives hold their meetings on Wednesday."
1187,"UKIP MEP attacked German 'empire'
A UK Independence Party MEP suggested Germany saw the EU as an 'empire' and was cheaper than using tanks, a new documentary has revealed. ""I was trying to be helpful to the party and it was the wrong thing to do, I should have told the truth."" Pointing to Germany's trade interests as a country in the centre of Europe, Mr Nattrass said: ""The fact is that the EU benefits Germany but it does not benefit Britain. The film also included footage of a row between Mr Kilroy-Silk, MEP Nigel Farage and party leader Roger Knapman about rumours that he was about to resign the UKIP whip in the European Parliament. He argued that peace was the only reason for having the ""outdated"" EU as there was no economic justification. Most of the trouble had been caused by you."" ""I'm not at all German-bashing. He told Mr Farage: ""Don't tell lies Nigel, now you've told too many. A UKIP spokesman said: ""Mike has some passionate beliefs and sometimes uses excessively colourful language with which to express them."" Mr Kilroy-Silk is to launch his own parry, Veritas, in Westminster on Wednesday."
1188,"He told a London news conference that Veritas - Latin for ""truth"" - would avoid the old parties' ""lies and spin"". ""While UKIP has turned its back on the British people, I shall not,"" he said. A clown. Mr Kilroy-Silk promised a ""firm but fair"" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been ""straightforward"" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead. The Conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid-1990s, and the extreme anti-Europeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local, European and general elections. Veritas? England needs Europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better, we can't rely on the USA forever! I shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes I believe in. Oh please!"
1189,"Unions have already earmarked 23 March for a one-day strike which could involve up to 1.4 million UK workers. ""For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,"" he said. ""If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. ""In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable."" BBC correspondent Stephen Cape said the combined unions represented ""a formidable force"" which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the General Election. Opposition to raising the retirement age is ""one thing all the unions are agreed on"", our correspondent added. A stoppage involving civil servants, in particular, could seriously disrupt or close government departments, agencies and museums, he said."
1190,"The 51-year-old premier has marked his 2,838th day in the post, overtaking the combined length of Harold Wilson's two terms during the 1960s and 1970s. Mr Blair's other political firsts include becoming the first Labour leader to win two successive full terms in power after the 2001 Labour landslide. The last prime minister to be installed at a younger age was Lord Liverpool, who was a year his junior in 1812. The war in Iraq and reforms of the health service and education system have provoked dissent from backbenchers. Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said the chancellor would be best placed to take over from Mr Blair. When asked about the future leadership of the party, he told ITV Wales' Waterfront programme: ""That contest is a long way away and it will occur only when the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, decides he's subscribed all he can and then wants to go. ""I think that the main contender will be Gordon Brown, who is a man of virtually unmatched capability and now great experience."""
1191,"The former Tory deputy chairman's five-year suspension from the party has just elapsed. Lord Archer spent two years in prison after being convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice. Meanwhile, senior Conservative MP Sir Teddy Taylor warned that moves bring Lord Archer back into the fold could be controversial. ""I'm sure that in line with people having served their sentence and having done some reparations for what they did wrong, we would look at that sympathetically. Lord Archer, who was not available for comment, remains a popular figure among constituency Tory parties and is a successful fundraiser. ""After all, he is far from being the worst perjurer in the world,"" he added. ""I don't believe in vindictiveness, I don't think that has any place in politics, unlike the prime minister and Alastair Campbell."" He said: ""I suppose, on a Sunday in particular, we should always make provision for forgiving sinners."
1192,"He warned the BBC that attacking Mr Campbell had brought it trouble before. The European commissioner and former Labour minister was speaking amid claims that Mr Campbell is part of a Labour ""dirty tricks"" campaign. The affair prompted the resignation of BBC chairman Gavyn Davies, director-general Greg Dyke and reporter Andrew Gilligan. Labour peer Baroness Kennedy, who is chairing the Power Inquiry into political disengagement, said people already thought politicians engaged in dirty tricks. Mr Campbell is acting as an adviser for Labour, which denies engaging in personal campaigning. ""I suggest the BBC concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics, the trivialisation of the campaign. ""I think the BBC would be much better advised to leave all this stuff well alone, concentrate on the issues as I say, not resume their demonisation of Alastair Campbell - we all know where that led before."" ""The government, despite the fact that they would say want to go forward, not back, seem intent on talking about history rather than their own record or even more importantly, about the future,"" he said on Sunday."
1193,"'Debate needed' on donations cap
A cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said. The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. There were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m. ""While we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,"" says its report. It also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning. It also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons, European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said: ""There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. ""Our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. ""The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations."" He called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system."
1194,"Conservative backing for ID cards
The Tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce ID cards. They have said the scheme is ""deeply flawed"" and a waste of money. They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would deliver them. The decision follows a ""tough meeting"" where some senior Tories argued vociferously against the move, party sources told the BBC. ""It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,"" a spokesman said. ""It will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration."" ""What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained."""
1195,"Sources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. The Conservatives announced their support for the government plans on Monday evening. The Tory leader said his front bench team had reached a ""collective view"" after holding a ""good discussion"", but admitted it was ""not an easy issue"". ""I don't pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken."" Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a ""regressive"" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them. ""It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,"" a spokesman said. ""What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? He said: ""This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards."" They are going to be stopped."
1196,"Mr Kennedy made it clear he was determined to counter that accusation. He said the current level of taxation was about right, although he would put a new 50% tax on top earners. He said. ""Budgets have to add up. Tough choices are needed in public spending."" The Lib Dems say the Tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while Labour has hidden most of its tax rises. Speaking at the Commonwealth Club, Mr Kennedy said it was critical for a political party to have economic credibility, both on what it promised and what it was expected to deliver. ""With the stealth tax strategy of Gordon Brown, the obvious unfairness of our current tax system - especially the council tax, and the empty promises of the Conservative party on this issue - it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down."" Mr Kennedy said: ""That contract with the people - that the government will only tax fairly and will spend their money wisely - can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about their plans. ""The reality is, the Lib Dems lack the courage to tackle waste and bureaucracy, and the only people who would face 'tough choices' would be the families who would be £630 worse off a year. """
1197,"The Glasgow Kelvin MP, who was expelled from Labour over his anti Iraq war stance, accused Ms King of being a ""New Labour stooge"". Ms King said she was ""delighted"" at the chance to take on Mr Galloway. Ms King has represented the constituency since 1997. He added: ""Here in this constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow there is a New Labour stooge MP. The Telegraph was sued for libel by Mr Galloway after the newspaper claimed he received money from Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. ""A stooge who will sing any song, make any speech, do any dance, do anything she is told to by Tony Blair - irrespective of how her constituents are adversely affected or how strongly they feel to the contrary."" She said: ""I'm delighted I've been given the chance to finish him (Mr Galloway) off, and believe me I will. Both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have chosen prospective parliamentary candidates for Bethnal Green and Bow from the Bangladeshi population, which makes up almost half the electorate. Speaking from a cafe in Brick Lane, east London, Mr Galloway said he had accepted the party's invitation to stand with ""great honour and pride"". A month later it gained a council seat in a by-election in St Dunstan's and Stepney Green ward, Tower Hamlets."
1198,"Sir Edward had gone to the country for a fresh mandate amid the spiralling economic crisis, a miners' strike and the subsequent three-day week. Sir Edward, who had received more votes but had fewer MPs, believed he had the authority to remain at Number 10 providing the 14 Liberal MPs would support his government. He also argued for a grand coalition of all three main parties. The following day, the stickling points had clearly become two-fold: Mr Thorpe's colleagues wanted electoral reform and Sir Edward's resignation. Within hours of his final talks with Mr Thorpe, Sir Edward told the nation he was resigning and the Queen invited Mr Wilson to form a new minority government. Mr Thorpe told Sir Edward: ""I am sorry this is obviously hell - a nightmare on stilts for you. ""The PM said he was bound to tell Mr Thorpe that his colleagues had told him that they would not agree to serve under any other prime minister. ""Somehow I personally hope that we can work something out."" ""Asked if this was his own view he said - no it was not, I am very close to Ted and thought he was by far the most able man we had and he would be perfectly happy to serve - it was only some of his colleagues who were being difficult."" The minutes of the meeting show how the chance of a coalition government quickly evaporated."
1199,"UKIP outspent Labour on EU poll
The UK Independence Party outspent both Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the European elections, new figures show. Labour's campaign cost £1.7m, the Lib Dems' £1.19m and the Greens' £404,000, according to figures revealed by the Electoral Commission on Wednesday. Critics have accused the party of effectively buying votes. ""With the advantages of public money the others have, the only way the smaller parties can get their message across is by buying the advertising space,"" he added."
1200,"Instead Mr Blair will travel to key cities and marginal seats to deliver the party's message. ""At a time when the British people are looking for more accountability and openness, this government turns its back on them; abandoning plans to tour the country and scared to face journalists in a press conference - it does rather beg the question, 'What have they got to hide?'"" Mr Milburn said the economy would take centre stage in Labour's campaign in what would be a ""watershed"" election and the ""last stand of the Thatcherites"". Mr Milburn said Labour's slogan would be ""Britain is working - Don't let the Tories wreck it."" The tone of the campaign, said Mr Milburn, would be more conversational than rhetorical; more spontaneous less scripted; less national more local and less based on issues and more concentrated on people. Labour battle plan 'hides Blair'
The Tories have accused Tony Blair of being ""terrified"" of scrutiny after Labour unveiled details of how it will fight the next general election. The approach is particularly designed to appeal to women voters, he said. ""I'm not privy to everybody's diary,"" he said. Mr Milburn said no decision had been taken yet over whether David Blunkett would have a prominent role in the election. ""In contrast Charles Kennedy will feature prominently in the Liberal Democrat campaign right across the country."""
1201,"Labour have refused to discuss his exact new position and have not said how it would affect his Downing Street replacement David Hill. ""Of course Alastair's going to be part of the election campaign and I think that all of us who will also be part of the election campaign are very pleased about that,"" Ms Jowell told Sky News. But she said his return would not put anybody else's ""nose out of joint"". ""There's room for everybody. Since leaving Downing Street, he has toured the country with his one man show, An Audience With Alastair Campbell and presented a number of interview programmes for Channel 4. We serve the country better if we make room for all the talent."" Labour strategists told the paper he would be ""set loose"" on Conservative leader Michael Howard in attacking his party's economic record when it was in power. ""They used pictures from the 1970s in the 1992 campaign to remind people of the winter of discontent - and now it's our turn,"" the source told the paper. ""Making Michael Howard leader gives us an unmissable opportunity to remind people what it was like to pay mortgage rates of 15% even if it was more than a decade ago."""
1202,"In a letter to his constituency chairman he wrote: ""It is in the country's best interest that Tony Blair rather than Michael Howard should form the next government."" Prime Minister Tony Blair declared himself ""delighted"", saying Mr Jackson would be warmly welcomed by Labour MPs. While saying he admired Mr Blair's ""courageous"" leadership of the country, he bitterly criticised the Conservatives stance on Europe. Conservative MP defects to Labour
A Conservative MP and former minister has defected to Labour. ""The Conservative Party's hostility to Europe has now hardened to the point at which it advocates the unilateral denunciation of Britain's treaty obligations,"" he wrote. He added that it was not surprising Mr Jackson had chosen to leave the Conservatives. Mr Jackson is due to stand down at the next election."
1203,"That in turn paved the way for John Major to move into 10 Downing Street, after the second ballot. Educated at Eton, and at New College, Oxford, he served in the Scots Guards from 1941 to 1945 and was wounded in tanks in Normandy. He worked under Edward Heath on Europe at the Foreign Office and subsequently won the Eton and Slough seat for the Tories in 1964 - by 11 votes. Labour regained the seat two years later, and Meyer had to wait until 1970 before he could re-enter Parliament. His prospects of a front bench slot remained remote because he tended to defy the party line."
1204,"The Y Vote initiative is being run jointly by the Electoral Commission, the Hansard Society and the Department for Education and Skills in the run-up to local elections and the general election, possibly on 5 May. UK youth 'interested' in politics
The majority of young people are interested in politics, holding ""strong opinions"" on policies and have a ""keen appetite"" for direct action. ""Mock elections can play an extremely valuable role in helping young people understand how the democratic process works and why it matters,"" he said. Michael Rafferty, who is mock elections project manager at the Hansard Society, said he looked forward to seeing schools and colleges across the UK participating in the mock votes."
1205,"Mr Martin revealed some MPs had been using their Blackberries during debates and he also cautioned members against using hidden earpieces. The £200 handheld computers can be used as a phone, pager or to send e-mails. The use of electronic devices in the Commons chamber has long been frowned on. The Speaker chairs debates in the Commons and is charged with ensuring order in the chamber and enforcing rules and conventions of the House."
1206,"It is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers. Other public sector unions have pledged to follow. Five public sector unions will hold private talks with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at Labour's spring conference in Gateshead. But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April. Privately ministers believe this will be the ""less painful"" option, our correspondent added. ""For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,"" he said. ""If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. ""In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable."" Mr Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. It is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations."
1207,"Five public sector unions met Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at the Labour spring conference in Gateshead. A spokesman for Unison, Britain's biggest union, said after Saturday's meeting: ""At least we are still talking."" In four days, Unison will start balloting 800,000 local government workers on strikes. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. Privately ministers believe this will be the ""less painful"" option, our correspondent added. The five unions which met Mr Prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. ""For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,"" he said. ""If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. ""In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable."" Mr Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week."
1208,"A total of 3,028 adults aged 18 or over were interviewed for the study. Mr Lishman urged the next government to boost state pension. He also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to ""support us all in an ageing society"". Charity boss Gordon Lishman said if a ""decisive blow"" was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out. Among the over-65s, 70% said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election, compared with 39% of people under 55. ""Older people want to see manifesto commitments that will make a difference to their lives,"" Mr Lishman said. ""Labour's continued refusal to admit the true extent of the pensions crisis will be one of the monumental failures of this government."" Labour has said it wants to use savings reforms to Incapacity Benefit to improve the basic state pension and has set up a review of the council tax system. The report was welcomed by Conservative shadow pensions secretary David Willetts."
1209,"Mr Blair also faced questions about British policy on Iran and its alleged nuclear weapons programme. In answer to a question from 22-year-old Liverpool student David Dunne about concerns over the prime minister's personal integrity, Mr Blair said talking was the only answer. ""You've just got to confront it and say to people let's have a discussion on the things that worry you, the things that make you say 'I can't trust you' or 'I am against you on this.'"" The ""worst thing in politics"" was that the electorate only got ""little snatches of policy"" from things like Prime Minister's Questions and the news headlines. This was why he wanted to ""get out of the 30 seconds on the news,"" he added. He was not ""forcing"" anyone to go to university, but places should be there for those who wanted them, he said."
1210,"Officials now say he did not resign but will move on under civil service rules. CSA chief who 'quit' still in job
The head of the ""failing"" Child Support Agency widely reported to have resigned three months ago is still at the helm of the troubled organisation. He replied: ""The chief executive decided it was time to move on, there is a new chief executive coming in."" ""No date was ever given for Doug Smith's departure,"" she said adding that the post had been advertised. On that day's Today programme Mr Johnson was asked why Mr Smith had been allowed to resign rather than be sacked. ""Doug has exceeded the four years that senior civil servants are now expected to remain in a particular post. In January the MPs who make up the Commons Work and Pensions Committee published a highly critical report into the ""failing"" agency noting the chief executive ""has now left"" and hoping ""the new leadership will bring a fresh approach to what is a failing organisation"". ""So Doug believes that we have reached the natural breakpoint at which he can hand over the reins."" ""Even if he was working out three months notice, he should have been clearing his desk by now."" ""The major issue is have we got a new chief executive coming into this very important agency as quickly as possible and have we gone through the right selection process to make sure we've got the right people,"" he added."
1211,"One poster depicted Mr Howard and his shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin, who is also Jewish, as flying pigs. The prime minister told the Jewish Chronicle: ""If you look at what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically."" Pressed on whether he would draw attention to Mr Howard's Jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract Muslim support, he replied: ""The idea that I would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous. It's untrue. These were ""not intended to cause any offence to anyone on the Jewish community,"" Mr Blair insisted. He added that Labour also aggressively fought all forms of racism. ""If you look what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically. Mr Blair also defended his party's attitude towards the Jewish community, pointing out that it was his government that had introduced the Holocaust Memorial Day. Well, he should do it."" ""I'm sure that is what in truth he wants to do."
1212,"Parties' plans for council tax
Anger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in 2003, when the average English bill rose 12.9%. Pensioners' protests spread - some marched, others simply refused to pay the increase. Some, such as 83-year-old Elizabeth Winkfield, said they would rather go to jail. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be ""radical reform"". The party says this year's increases will be the lowest in a decade. The Tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners, who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax. They say they can save £4bn on ""government waste"", of which £1.3bn could be used to cut pensioners' bills by an average of £340. It would not be means tested, say the Tories, because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for their retirement. The rate would be set locally, but administered by the Inland Revenue which they say would save at least £300m. After that income would be taxed up to £100,000."
1213,"Labour in constituency race row
Labour's choice of a white candidate for one of the UK's most multi-racial seats proves the need for all-black short lists, says a race group. Mr McCartney recently announced party consultation on all-black shortlists. A CRE spokesman said the organisation had nothing to add on the shortlist issue specifically but would be working with all the political parties to address the under-representation of ethnic minorities in Parliament. ""I think all-black shortlists are the only way to cut to the chase and address the lack of minority candidates,"" Mr Vishwanathan said. Ethnic minorities make up 8% of the United Kingdom population but only 2% of MPs - 13 out of 659 - are from a visible minority group. Twelve of them represent Labour, and one is a Liberal Democrat."
1214,"Tony Blair has argued. there needs to be consensus on reforms. MPs tout Lords replacement plan
A group of MPs has tried to raise the pressure on Tony Blair over reform to the House of Lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change. There would be 385 MSCPs, including 270 elected members, 87 appointed members and 16 bishops. The group believes pressure is growing for change and the government's current position is unsustainable. The government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the Lords. Mr Clarke said the issue ""went to the heart of reforming the health of the British political system"". ""What could be more important than a choice of the people who sit in our Parliament?"" ""We are providing a consensus"". ""The problem, I think, in the prime minister's mind is there doesn't appear to be a consensus that includes him,"" he said."
1215,"Hague's six-figure earnings shown
The rewards of leaving front-bench politics are shown in the latest annual register of members' interests. Mr Hague was also paid an undisclosed amount for the newspaper serialisation of his biography of William Pitt the Younger and up to £135,00 for work as an adviser to various companies. His time out of office will, however, have lost him his £71,433 minister's salary. She also received up to £30,000 for acting as the Guardian's agony aunt and between £5,001 and £10,000 for appearing on ITV's Celebrity Fit Club. He is to stand down as an MP at the next election. Former Defence Secretary Michael Portillo makes some of his money as a non-executive director of BAE Systems. His declared interests include £20,000 from newspaper articles and fees of up to £35,000 for four speeches. He also declares a trip to Mexico last year to address executives of News International, and helicopter and private jet travel paid for by supporters. Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy registered donations to his office from supporters, a free ticket to last year's Bafta awards and rent from a single-bedroom flat in London. He earns between £5,001and £10,000 for the work."
1216,"Schools Minister Stephen Twigg said engaging young people's interest was ""essential"" to the future of democracy. Schools to take part in mock poll
Record numbers of schools across the UK are to take part in a mock general election backed by the government. Pupils will stand as party candidates, speech writers and canvassers. ""The mock elections initiative provides an opportunity for pupils to develop their own understanding of how the democratic process works and why it matters. ""By experiencing the election process first hand - from running a campaign to the declaration of the final result - we hope that young people will develop the enthusiasm to take part in the future."" Information packs, including ballot papers and manifesto guides, with elections happening in early May were sent out to the 3,000 schools invited to take part."
1217,"There were also large sums from individuals. The Conservatives were in second place with donations totalling £4,610,849, while the Liberal Democrats received just over £1m. This followed an earlier donation of the same amount earlier in 2004. He was made a lord by Tony Blair last year. This company is controlled by the party's former treasurer Lord Ashcroft which has directed almost £300,000 to specific marginal constituencies over the past two years. Other significant donations came from retired millionaire businessman and philanthropist Sir Christopher Ondaatje who gave the party a sum of £500,000, and refrigerator magnate William Haughey OBE who gave £330,000. Also among the gifts to the Tories were 24 donations totalling £161,840 from Bearwood Corporate Services. And fast food giants McDonald's are listed as donating a sum of £10,575. Just £8,170 of this was cash and the remainder came in gifts in kind, such as office space and printing. It is an offence for a person to knowingly or recklessly make a false declaration about party donations."
1218,"Kennedy predicts bigger turnout
Voters' ""pent up passion"" could confound predictions of a low turnout in the coming general election, Charles Kennedy has said. Mr Cook, who is giving evidence to the Power inquiry into voter turnout rates, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme it was not fair to blame the public who were ""more interested in politics than ever before"". ""They are turned off by the way we do politics in Britain. The government has tried a number of things in an attempt to boost voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001. There's a message there for politicians."" He also criticised the cult of personality politics: ""There's far too much interest in celebrities. ""Politics are in danger of becoming another branch of the celebrity industry."""
1219,"Downing Street has denied the claims, made in a new book about the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith's advice. He said the claims suggested Parliament had only received a pr&#233;cis of Lord Goldsmith's second opinion - and that it was actually drafted in No 10. According to Mr Sands, Lord Goldsmith had warned Tony Blair in a document on 7 March 2003 that the use of force against Iraq could be illegal and that it would have been safer to seek a second UN resolution sanctioning military action. The book, being serialised in the Guardian newspaper, says on 13 March Lord Goldsmith met then Home Office Minister Lord Falconer and Downing Street adviser Baroness Morgan. ""After that Downing Street proceeded to set out his [Lord Goldsmith's] view in a parliamentary answer which was then published on 17 March,"" said Mr Sands. Lord Goldsmith also denied them, saying he was not ""leaned on"" in any way. In a statement to Newsnight, Lord Goldsmith said: ""In my parliamentary answer on March 17 2003, I explained my genuinely held independent view, that military action was lawful under the existing Security Council resolutions. The prime minister's official spokesman also rejected the claims, saying: ""The attorney general made it clear the words and the judgement were his."" ""The public interest, which the government claims justifies non-publication of the whole of the advice, can only be served now by the fullest disclosure."" But ex-foreign secretary Robin Cook says all the advice should now be published."
1220,"Damian Hockney, now Veritas deputy leader, and Peter Hulme-Cross were elected in 2004 on the list system. UKIP chairman Petrina Holdsworth urged the men to step down from the GLA in a letter. She said: ""The party has taken legal advice and it is clear that we could take legal proceedings against you which could result in the return of our seats and/or damages against you. ""The Greater London Act is clear that if someone resigns who was elected on a list, their party whip the seat belongs to them and not the party."" He said Mr Hulme-Cross and himself had no intention of resigning and added that they felt that it was UKIP who were not being true to the electorate. But the claim was denied by UKIP spokesman, who said: ""Mr Hockney's accusations are like his sense of political morals - empty."""
1221,"Prime minister's questions
So who, if anyone, is playing politics with the security of the nation? Is not the opposition against to the proposed laws ""in principle"", in which case delaying a decision for further debate would be pointless? And that is more important to them than national security. The prime minister claims this is the clearest indication that it is the Tories who are playing politics with the issue by attempting to score cheap political points in parliament. This was not the appropriate place to announce election day, he stammered. Apart from all that, it was electioneering as usual. Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy avoided suggesting anyone was playing politics with the issue. The prime minister almost blushed. And perhaps that simple fact alone means everyone is seen to be playing politics with just about everything at the moment."
1222,"Goldsmith denies war advice claim
The attorney general has denied his statement to Parliament about the legality of the Iraq war was drafted by Downing Street officials. He suggested the claim that Lord Falconer and Lady Morgan had drafted the answer were the result of a mis-transcription of his evidence to the Butler Inquiry into pre-war intelligence. He said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of Solicitor General Harriet Harman, two of his own officials, three Foreign Office officials, a QC, Christopher Greenwood and the then Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg. ""That's what he (Lord Goldsmith) said and that's what I say. ""The answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government."" He has dealt with this time and time and time again,"" Mr Blair told his monthly news conference in Downing Street. He refused to answer further questions on the issue. Former foreign secretary Robin Cook said Lord Goldsmith's admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested Parliament may have been misled. ""The attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary, but others certainly did,"" he said. Mr Mates added: ""This may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister."""
1223,"Goldsmith: 'I was not leant on'
The attorney general has again denied being ""leant on"" by Downing Street to make the legal case for invading Iraq. He said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of Solicitor General Harriet Harman, two of his own officials, three Foreign Office officials, a QC, Christopher Greenwood and the then Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg. The text was released on the eve of a crucial Commons vote in which MPs backed the invasion of Iraq. Former foreign secretary Robin Cook said Lord Goldsmith's admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested Parliament may have been misled. ""The answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government."" ""The attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary, but others certainly did,"" he said. Last week Lord Goldsmith said in a statement: ""I was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised, and of course approved, the answer."" ""That's what he [Lord Goldsmith] said and that's what I say. He has dealt with this time and time and time again,"" Mr Blair told his monthly news conference in Downing Street. He refused to answer further questions on the issue."
1224,"But Mr Crosby said in a statement: ""I have never had any such conversation... and I do not hold that view."" The strategist helped Australia's PM, John Howard, win four elections.

It added: ""The Labour Party will be wanting to do all they can to distract attention away from the issues that really matter to people."""
1225,"And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference. Colin Asplin, Blackpool Hotel Association said: ""We have tried very hard to make sure they come back to Blackpool. ""Obviously we have failed in that. I just hope Manchester can handle the crowds. ""It amazes me that the Labour Party, which is a working class party, doesn't want to come to the main working class resort in the country."""
1226,"Labour later took the image off its website, saying an alternative idea had proved more popular with party members. Labour attacked on Howard poster
Labour has been accused of using anti-Semitic images in posters which critics claim depict Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin. Instead, he pointed to how Tony Blair had in 1997 complained about ""personalised abusive campaigning"". Mr Howard told Greater Manchester Radio: ""It is such a pity that Mr Blair doesn't practise what he preaches."" Labour MP Louise Ellman said the hypnotism image was insensitive but urged people not to rush to call things anti-Semitic when they only challenged Tory economic policies. ""Shylock and Fagin are inextricably linked to notions of centuries-old prejudice,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World At One. A Labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the party's website was not affected by the row. ""Whatever the idea is, I think it's a difficult exercise to use images like that and to argue that you can divorce them from their historical context or meaning."" The image simply portrayed Mr Howard as a hypnotist, he argued. ""This has been up on the website for two weeks and there has only been a fuss in the last four days so a substantial number of people voted before there was any fuss,"" he said."
1227,"In the Commons, Tory spokesman Mr Lewis suggested the posters were part of a wider trend and reminded MPs that Labour chairman Ian McCartney last year described shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin as a ""21st Century Fagin"". Labour has taken them off its website, saying members preferred other posters. The posters were among a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election. A row was sparked after the party published posters appearing to depict Michael Howard, who is Jewish, as Fagin, and as a flying pig, amid claims they were anti-Semitic. Mr Milburn replied that they were not anti-Semitic. ""Given the outrage that that smear caused then, how could you have thought anything other than the fact that what you were doing in reviving it in your poster advertisements was nothing more and nothing less than a calculated campaign of sly anti-Semitism?"" ""What they were was anti-Tory and I make no apologies at all for making clear to the British public exactly what the Conservative plans would mean,"" he said. A Labour spokesman later said their removal from the party's website was not affected by the row."
1228,"Labour's Elizabeth Blackman won the seat in 1997 and has a 6,932 majority. Until 1997, Erewash had been held by the Tories since 1970. Ms Blackman said she was proud of the government's achievements in the area. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been ""straightforward"" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead. She declined to give her view of Mr Kilroy-Silk at this point. UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash in last June's European elections - with Mr Kilroy-Silk among their candidates for the region. On Thursday, he told a London news conference that Veritas would avoid the old parties' ""lies and spin"". He said ""our country"" was being ""stolen from us"" by mass immigration and promised a ""firm but fair"" policy on immigration. UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. ""He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',"" he said."
1229,"Immigration to be election issue
Immigration and asylum have normally been issues politicians from the big parties have tiptoed around at election time. But no longer. That was also true at the last general election and the issue did briefly become a campaigning issue. But it sparked the probably predictable furore with claims politicians were either stoking up xenophobia or, alternatively, running scared of addressing the problem. But this time around it looks set to be one of the core battlegrounds with both the big parties competing to set out tough policies. The Tories are already committed to imposing annual limits on immigration, with a quota for asylum seekers and with applications processed outside the UK. ""My concern is that, whilst the Labour Party and the Conservative Party will take a constructive approach to the debate, right-wing political parties, picking up on statements like `burden to Britain' will exploit this and create a lot of fear and uncertainty"". But, while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue, there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before."
1230,"Later he will visit places, such as Liverpool, where Labour is targeted. Mr Kennedy is visiting constituencies in Somerset and Hampshire on Monday - rural seats where his party is hoping to make gains from the Conservatives. Mr Kennedy said the British public felt let down by Labour on issues from Iraq to top-up fees and the Conservatives were not ""asking the critical questions"". But he brushed off Labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the Tories in ""by the back door"". Asked whether it was realistic to assume the Liberal Democrats could win the general election, he said: ""There's no limit to the ambitions we have as a party. And he said people were ""highly sceptical"" about Labour and Conservative promises on tax. ""That's going to be the story, I think, of this coming general election."" ""If you look at the four previous parliamentary by-elections, the Liberal Democrats have demonstrated that, not only can we leapfrog the Conservatives where we start in a third place position, but we can go on to defeat the government."
1231,"""You cannot underestimate the impact of the war in Iraq. The guy still has it."" Stephen Douglas, 26, from Wales, said after the PM's speech on Sunday: ""I think it was a bit of a turning point, given the roasting he has had on some issues. A group of shop stewards from the Swan Hunter shipyard, who said they were facing redundancy, could barely suppress their anger at Mr Blair's failure to, as they saw it, shake off his Tory leanings and stand up for manufacturing in the North East. ""It is no good having the Sage or Baltic if you haven't got the money for the entrance fee,"" said Terry Telford. Katrina Bull, a prospective parliamentary candidate said Mr Blair had shown he could rouse the party's grassroots: ""I think if every voter was able to spend time in a room with Tony, the way we have today, we will have no problem with turnout."" Iraq, they insisted, would not be a factor for most voters. ""If you are not fired up about the election, then what's the point? We are fired up. ""I have had doors slammed in my face,"" he said."
1232,"But seven million telephone numbers are on the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. But that did not happen for ""voter identification"" calls. Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them. ""So it is not covered by the Telephone Preference Service."" Assistant information commissioner Phil Jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them. She said: ""We do apply TPS but in line with the law. We would not do things that are not allowed in the law."" But ""classic market research"", such as a poll of voter intentions, did not constitute direct marketing, he said. ""When we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not,"" he said. Earlier, Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor wrote to the watchdog saying: ""The advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal."""
1233,"Vincent Cable says one in eight households already struggle with debt and that will worsen if there is a hike in interest rates or unemployment. He wants to see ""proper health checks"" when loans are marketed so people know to take out payment protection. ""Were economic conditions to deteriorate at all, large numbers of people could be affected because they have borrowed to the limit,"" Mr Cable told BBC News. Mr Cable added that the Office of Fair Trading should investigate the market. Mr Kennedy is visiting a mixture of rural seats, where his party is hoping to make gains from the Conservatives, and urban areas traditionally associated with Labour. Mr Cable said the government's Consumer Credit Bill would target some of the ""extreme problems"" such as loan sharking, but ministers had been ""a bit complacent"" about the wider issue of debt levels. ""Banks are very aggressively promoting debt in many cases there is a bigger problem ahead."" Labour say a Lib Dem vote could ""let the Tories in"", while the Tories say the Lib Dems would mean ""higher taxes, soft crime laws, more power to Europe"". ""If you look at the four previous parliamentary by-elections, the Liberal Democrats have demonstrated that, not only can we leapfrog the Conservatives where we start in a third place position, but we can go on to defeat the government."
1234,"The Lib Dems say their ""mutual homes"" would let people buy a share of a property, usually worth about 5% of the building costs. People would also only have to pay for the cost of the building and not the land, he added. They would spend about 30% of their monthly salary on rent and buying extra shares in the property. Labour has already announced plans to help first-time buyers and the Tories would extend right-to-buy schemes. The kind of ""golden share"" used by the Lib Dems in South Shropshire could be rolled out more widely. The flagship Tory proposal on housing policy is to give a million more housing association tenants the right to buy their homes. ""They claim that they want to help people on to the property ladder, but the small print of their policies reveal how they intend to price even more people out of the housing market."" ""This is typical of Lib Dem hypocrisy,"" said Tory shadow local government secretary Caroline Spelman. Housing Minister Keith Hill said much of the Lib Dem plans mimicked the government's strategy. ""However, as usual, the Lib Dems' proposals are completely uncosted,"" he said."
1235,"""Two million pensioners in Britain currently live below the government's own poverty line - two-thirds of whom are women,"" he said. He says that pensions based on the number of years worked ignore the contribution women make caring for children. The Lib Dem's Citizen's Pension, based on length of residency not on national insurance contributions, would address that imbalance, Mr Kennedy argues. He also thinks women will back plans to end university tuition fees and for free long-term care for the elderly. Mr Kennedy also points to the fact that 40% of the party's candidates set to stand in winnable or target seats are women. Mr Kennedy began the pitch for female support with an interview on BBC Radio 4's Women's Hour on Monday. Party strategists claim that where women candidates replace men turnout rises by 4%. The Labour party has committed itself to ""universal, affordable and flexible"" childcare for parents of all 3 to 14 year-olds, including childcare centred on schools to be available from 8am to 6pm. The baby and his wife Sarah would be ""priority number one"" even if it arrived in the middle of the election campaign, he said. In September, Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt said she would like to see longer paid maternity leave, higher paternity pay and the extension of flexible working rights to carers, if Labour won a third term."
1236,"Questions from callers, a studio audience and the show's presenter covered Lib Dem tax plans, anti-terror laws and immigration. ""We don't actually hear the argument any longer: 'Lib Dems, good people, reasonable ideas but only if we thought they could win around here - it's a wasted vote'. Mr Kennedy said during his nearly 22 years in Parliament he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of British politics. Kennedy questions trust of Blair
Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said voters now have a ""fundamental lack of trust"" of Tony Blair as prime minister. ""1983 was when I was first elected as an MP - so Tony Blair, Michael Howard and myself were all class of '83 - and over that nearly quarter of a century the world has changed out of recognition,"" he said. He said the extra revenue would allow his party to get rid of tuition and top-up fees, introduce free personal care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. ""You don't hear that because the evidence of people's senses demonstrates that it isn't a wasted vote."""
1237,"Brown outlines third term vision
Gordon Brown has outlined what he thinks should be the key themes of New Labour's next general election bid. Writing in the Guardian newspaper, Mr Brown outlined his view of the direction New Labour should be taking. ""As our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear, Labour's ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment; not just attacking ignorance, disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education, good health and sustainable communities."" He said ensuring every child in Britain had the best start in life could be a legacy to match the NHS's creation. ""It was, as always, coded and careful... but entirely deliberate,"" was Mr Marr's assessment. The prime minister was asked about Mr Brown's article and about his election role when he appeared on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Blair argued that under New Labour the country had changed for the better and that was ""in part"" because of Mr Brown's management of the economy."
1238,"Mr Blair said he was a ""huge figure"" in Labour and a ""valued, personal friend"". He quit the government in 1999 and in recent years has served as the chairman of the all-party committee on Lords reform and has been a loyal supporter of the government from the backbenches. One of the few Blair-era ministers to serve under Jim Callaghan, he was given the agriculture portfolio when Labour regained power in 1997. During Labour's long period in opposition, Mr Cunningham held a number of shadow roles including foreign affairs, the environment and as trade spokesman."
1239,"Will Tory tax cuts lift spirits? This was the pre-election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters, he believes, will warm to. At its simplest, it is saying: ""Vote Tory and you can have it both ways"". And even after that was done, it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax. As the Tory leader declared, the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between Labour and the Tories. It is a move back towards an almost traditional Tory message which previously suggested Labour was the party of tax rises and the Conservatives the party of tax cuts. ""At this election, people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair who will waste more and tax more and the Conservative party which will give value for money and tax less,"" he said. One of New Labour's greatest successes before the historic 1997 election was to persuade voters, business and the City that it could be trusted to run the economy. And, while other issues like the Iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign, it is likely - and the prime minister probably hopes - that the economy will be the deciding factor. So, Mr Howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor."
1240,"Teenagers to be allowed to be MPs
Teenagers will be able to become MPs under plans unveiled by ministers. Even if the move does go ahead it is unlikely it will be in place before the next general election, widely predicted for May. The voting age affects millions of younger people,"" said spokesman Alex Folkes. Last April's report by the Electoral Commission said there was no strong argument for leaving the age for standing for election at 21. ""Candidacy affects only politicians. ""We would hope that the government will table a bill that is broad enough to allow for amendments to be brought to test support for a reduction in the voting age."" That is because the age of majority was reduced to 18 in 1969 but laws dating from 1695 which determine the current voting age stayed in place. Irish republican Bernadette Devlin was one of just a handful of 21-year-olds elected to Parliament in the 20th century winning a seat in 1969."
1241,"The word ""Britain"" is cast on a red background - a nod to Old Labour. Labour's four little words
Labour has unveiled the four little words that will form the heart of its general election campaign which, for those just returned from the planet Galifray, is ""looming"". As one of the journalists assembled at the unveiling declared, it was all very post modern, or something. Great use of colour. It would be an aggressive campaign because things would inevitably boil down to a choice between Labour and the Tories. ""Not many people talk about the years before 1997 as the good old days,"" he declared. Nobody, he claimed, could picture Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy walking up Downing Street the day after polling. ""He will be leading the domestic debate from the front, listening, taking the flak."" So, let's get on with it then."
1242,"He said the new office would not supersede the job of a chief constable. Jan Berry said: ""It is a service, not a political football to be kicked around every time an election approaches. ""These plans could result in those with extreme political views dictating what actually happens on the ground,"" she warned. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said the plan was dangerous and ""could create conflict between chief constables and elected officials"". Outlining his crime manifesto, Mr Howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates. ""The trouble is, and it's no reflection on the people who are on the police authority - they are good people - but hardly anyone knows who they are."" ""The commissioner will have the powers which existing police authorities have,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Critics fear the move could hand control of the police to single-issue campaigners who would ignore the needs of the wider community. A Labour Party spokesman criticised Michael Howard's record, saying police numbers had fallen by 1,132 when he was home secretary. He said: ""Today the Tories are making more extravagant promises on the police without making clear how they would pay for them, other than through fantasy savings to the asylum system."""
1243,"TV debate urged for party chiefs
Broadcasters should fix a date for a pre-election televised debate between the three main political leaders, according to the Hansard Society. It would then be up to Tony Blair, Michael Howard and Charles Kennedy to decide whether to take part, the non-partisan charity said. ""The broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead,"" he said. Chairman Lord Holme argued that prime ministers should not have the right of veto on a matter ""of public interest"". An independent third-party body such as the Hansard Society or Electoral Commission could work out the ground rules so they were fair to participants and informative to the public, he said. ""It has been left to nudges and winks, hints and briefings from his aides and campaign managers to imply that Mr Blair doesn't want one, but we haven't heard from the prime minister himself."" ""It would be up to each party leader to accept or refuse,"" said Lord Holme. ""The broadcasters would then have the option of cancelling the event for obvious and well-understood reasons, or going ahead with an empty chair. The Hansard Society has long campaigned for televised debates and has published reports on the issue in 1997 and 2001. Last month he said: ""We answer this every election campaign and, for the reasons I have given before, the answer is no,"" he said at his monthly news conference."""
1244,"""Never again Tory boom and bust. Also in Gateshead, the prime minister took questions sent in by e-mail, text message and telephone as part of Labour's attempt to engage the public in their campaign. In the speech, which prompted a standing ovation, he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years. He also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world's poorest countries, a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds, the creation of a network of children's centres and flexibility in maternity leave. Instead of talking about the future he kept on talking about the past. Responding to the speech, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, George Osborne, said: ""This was more talk from Gordon Brown. ""There will be a simple choice at the election - value for money and lower taxes with the Conservatives, or more waste and higher taxes under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown."" ""My message to the thousands of young couples waiting to obtain their first home is that housing is rightly now at the centre of our coming manifesto,"" he said. ""We've heard it all before. ""He completely failed to say which taxes he would put up to fill the black hole in his spending plans."
1245,"And the chancellor vowed to continue the fight against child poverty. Mr Blair is thought to be deliberately putting himself on the line in a bid to engage the electorate ahead of an expected May election. He would contrast Labour's plan to invest £60bn in services with a Tory plan to cut spending by £35bn. Capital Radio DJ Margherita Taylor will select questions to put to him from thousands e-mailed and sent by text. Analysing Mr Brown's position before the speech, BBC correspondent James Hardy said Mr Brown would draw ""sharp dividing lines"" with the Conservatives for the forthcoming election campaign. Starting in London, he visited marginal constituencies pledging to build on what he said were Labour's achievements on the economy, crime, education and public services. ""Mr Brown will lay out his credentials as a reforming chancellor determined to take on and beat the Asian tiger economies which increasingly dominate world trade,"" our correspondent said. And he confirmed Mr Blair's insistence that no poll date had yet been set. He said: ""I'm the General Election co-ordinator and I don't know, and Tony has not made up his mind."" The Conservatives and Lib Dems said the pledges - set to underpin Labour's election campaign - were ""worthless""."
1246,"He insisted he did not know the poll date, but it is widely expected to be 5 May. Dr Fox told BBC Radio: ""If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all."" He described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric, then struggling to live up to the expectations, and reaching the point of raised voices and ""throwing crockery"". The Tory co-chairman attacked Labour's six new pledges as ""vacuous"" and said Mr Blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. He would not discuss reports the party repaid £500,000 to Lord Ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat. The Lib Dems accuse Mr Blair of making a ""touchy-feely"" speech to Labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust. ""What we learned at the weekend is what Labour tactics are going to be and it's going to be fear and smear,"" he told BBC News. He said: ""This is three-party politics. In the northern cities, the contest is between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. ""In southern and rural seats - especially in the South West - the principal contenders are the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, who are out of the running in Scotland and Wales."""
1247,"The Conservatives and Lib Dems both say his pledges are ""worthless"". Tony Blair sailed across the lake in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, while on a visit with Education Secretary Ruth Kelly to back school outings. All the parties are stepping up campaigning ahead of a General Election widely expected to be held on 5 May. ""What we're doing is introducing some simple guidelines so if teachers follow those they are not going to be at risk of legal action,"" Mr Blair said. ""When you are doing these types of activities you've got to exercise some common sense there obviously. ""You can't have a situation where parents or teachers end up being worried that they're going to be subject to all sorts of legal action if they take children sailing or doing outdoor activity that is actually good for the kids and good for their health and their character."" If it wins a third term in the general election expected this year, Labour is committed to giving parents more choice between schools; allowing all secondary schools to take on specialist status; opening 200 city academies and creating 100,000 more sixth-form places. For the Conservatives, shadow education secretary Tim Collins said: ""Mr Blair&#191;s government is all talk. It is the latest in a series of events designed to show the prime minister is speaking directly to voters in the run-up to the election - and that he has not lost touch. That judgment will be damning."""
1248,"Analysis: No pain, no gain? Labour strategists believe more of the sessions will mean the hecklers no longer become a story and the real issues take prominence. ""All you do is walk around and make yourself known, you don't do anything to help anybody,"" she told Mr Blair before stomping off, refusing his pleas to discuss the issue privately. John Major reaped the benefits of street campaigning during the 1992 election campaign with his famous soapbox. There are risks but the prize is tackling the trend of lower turnouts at the polls, he argues. Mr Blair recalls how Bill Clinton once advised him: ""Always remember that what people see of you in the news in the evening is how they think you spend your day."" Mr Blair told prospective Labour MPs on Thursday that taking part in phone-ins and public meetings could ""enthuse and engage and give the public a sense of empowerment"". He must remember with gritted teeth his confrontation with Sharron Storer, the Birmingham woman who harangued him over the state of her local hospital in the 2001 election campaign. ""He wanted to look like a prime minister. I
was
prime minister and I wanted a flesh and blood fight,"" says Mr Major."
1249,"The annual event is when the chancellor outlines the government's taxation and broader economic predictions. Next month's Budget will be Mr Brown's ninth since Labour came to power in 1997. If a May election is called, there could be as little as 18 days between the Budget and the announcement of a date for the election. As Mr Brown announced the Budget date in a short ministerial statement, accountancy firm Ernst & Young urged him to put politics aside and focus on the long-term requirements of the economy. Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: ""We can be sure of two things: the Budget will contain measures to attract votes, and it will not contain the £8 billion of tax rises which independent experts say are inevitable if Labour wins the election."" ""In the Budgets that were given immediately before the last six elections, taxes were cut by the incumbent chancellor and, in many cases, taxes were increased soon after the election result,"" said Aidan O'Carroll, E&Y's UK head of tax."
1250,"Lib Dem spokesman Vince Cable said the public did not know who to believe and the National Audit Office should judge. ""There is an issue of credibility and trust,"" he said. ""What we need is the equivalent of a thorough Ofsted inspection of the government's accounts."" He asked what the government had to hide. He argued: ""There are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the UK housing market and rising personal debt. But they have not been confronted."" Mr Cable compared that new cost with the £500m needed for Britain's role in the entire first Gulf War - when 80% of the bill had been met through help from European and Arab nations. In response, Mr Brown stressed the Iraq money came from a reserve funds. Instead, what was needed was simple and fair taxation rather than the ""complete mess"" produced by Mr Brown's endless tinkering. And one-and-a-half million hard working families were paying 60% marginal tax rates."
1251,"In a speech in Edinburgh, the prime minister said Thursday's report reinforced stability and opportunity. And that would be central to Labour's next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced. Mr Brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises. ""In every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future, much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. All of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all,"" Mr Blair said. Conservative Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: ""I can't find a single economic forecaster from the IMF to the Institute of Fiscal Studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances. Many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3% - and fear tax rises or spending cuts, saying tax receipts have been overestimated. ""It's going to take a significant turnaround in the economy to meet these targets."" Mr Blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the ""cornerstone"" of Labour's programme. ""It is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending,"" Mr Cable told MPs."
1252,"Mr Raynsford dismissed a suggestion the move was designed to keep council taxes down ahead of an expected general election. And he confirmed rows over the issue with ministerial colleagues. ""Obviously we had some pretty frank discussions about this,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. Cabinet anger at Brown cash raid
Ministers are unhappy about plans to use Whitehall cash to keep council tax bills down, local government minister Nick Raynsford has acknowledged. Ministers had to be sure local government could deliver without ""unreasonable council tax increases"", he added. But he said there was a recognition that ""a good settlement for local government"" was important to health, education and ""other government departments"". These would raise the age from which retiring workers could claim their pensions and limit how much they received if they retired early. ""This is a response to the concerns that have been voiced by local government about the pressures they face."""
1253,"'UK will stand firm on EU rebate'
Britain's £3bn EU rebate is not up for renegotiation at next week's European Council summit, Jack Straw said. But the foreign secretary told the Commons foreign affairs committee: ""Our position is very clear: it is entirely justified and it is not for negotiation."" He added that he did not think there would be a political price to pay for the UK's stance - Britain contributed more and received less than other EU states. The two-day European Council summit in Brussels begins on 16 December and is widely expected to mark the beginning of a lengthy negotiating period over the EU's budget for 2007-13. The wrangling could stretch into 2005, even 2006. ""I don't know of any national government thinking of increasing its budget by that amount,"" he added."
1254,"He was speaking as Sir Digby Jones, CBI director general, warned Mr Brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May. His message to the chancellor was: ""Please don't give it away in any form of electioneering."" ""If the MPC (the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I'm not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,"" he told a Parliamentary lunch. ""That would be a good way to spend any excess."" Sir Digby added: ""I don't think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. ""We would say to him 'don't increase your public spending, don't give it away. But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people'."
1255,"Will the Budget bring out smiling voters? As Tory spokesman Oliver Letwin said - any chancellor would use his pre-election budget to offer some vote winning sweeteners, wouldn't he. There will be plenty of talk about taking no risks with the economy or handing out irresponsible giveaways. And, needless to say, there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the Budget will have on Mr Brown's own ambitions to replace Mr Blair as prime minister at some point after a third win. And there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this week's Budget. But there is a shadow hanging over this pre-election performance - in the shape of £11 billion or thereabouts. It was immediately denied, but the Tories remain suspicious, claiming that, as Mr Letwin said, if the money does not come from there, where will it come from. The Liberal Democrats will also promise to run a sound economy, but based on increased taxes to fund spending and, amongst other things, abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax. But probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years."
1256,"- Increase in the stamp duty threshold from £60,000 
 - A freeze on petrol duty 
 - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families 
 - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Treasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about £2bn to spare. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than £60,000. The Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a ""classic Labour stealth tax"". For the Lib Dems David Laws said: ""The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,"" he said. ""If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around £10bn."" He added: ""I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments."" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a £2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing."
1257,"In a relatively short speech he kept the best for last and was clearly out to give exactly that pre-election boost everyone had been predicting. So if you are a couple with children, a pensioner, a patient or a youngster, there was something pulled from Mr Brown's red box in an attempt to persuade you to stick with or switch to a New Labour government. They obviously believed he had done that for them and, coincidentally, given his own image as a prime minister-in-waiting another little boost. Like a surgeon, he attempted to target his handouts with absolute precision onto exactly the groups the government needs to appeal to in the election campaign. But Gordon Brown is never going to put on a show and even as he was out to cast himself as the man who will win Labour an historic third term, his demeanour remained quiet, confident and reassuring. Prudence made an appearance, albeit towards the end of his address, as he assured voters he would do nothing to mess up the economic stability he had brought to Britain and which, he claimed, would be thrown away by anyone else. Brown comes out shooting
Labour may have abolished hunting - but that didn't stop Chancellor Gordon Brown using his Budget to fire both barrels at some of the opposition parties' core election foxes. According to the opposition parties, however, it is all one big con trick. And in Labour circles there will undoubtedly be an argument over just how good a prime minister Gordon Brown will make at some point after the next election. As ever, there will now be a period of frantic activity by the opposition parties' treasury specialists as they pore over the chancellor's red book, which sets out the fine detail of his budget, in an attempt to spot the flaws."
1258,"How was it right that the poorest 20% of society were still paying more as a proportion of their income than the richest 20%, the Lib Dem leader asked. The new £200 council tax rebate for pensioners did nothing to fix the ""unfair tax"", he added. But he criticised both the chancellor and the Tories for failing to address the ""ticking bomb"" of council tax revaluation. Speaking in the Commons after Mr Brown had delivered what is widely thought to be the last Budget before the general election, Mr Kennedy acknowledged that the UK was one of the most successful economies in the world. Mr Kennedy added his party's priorities of free long-term care for the elderly, abolishing top-up fees and replacing the council tax would be funded by charging 50% income tax to those earning more than £100,000 per annum. He said a residency criteria would end ""at a stroke this fundamental iniquity"". ""For most individuals, most families, most households, it adds up to exactly the same thing,"" said Mr Kennedy. ""And they wonder why people get cynical about their politicians when they give one impression before an election and do exactly the opposite after that election."""
1259,"He also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems Britain faced. Mr Brown's council tax rebate for pensioners was £300 less than what the Tories were offering, Mr Howard said. Mr Brown's Budget was not about what was good for the country, but ""all about the interests of the Labour party,"" the Tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign. Everyone could see the chancellor's ""sweeteners"", but these hid tax rises for hard working families, he said. ""We can all see the sweeteners, but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard-working families that are inevitable if Labour wins."" ""This dodgy government that brought us the dodgy dossier is now publishing a dodgy Budget based on dodgy numbers,"" he said. ""You now propose to borrow, over the next six years, no less than £168 billion; so much for prudence. There was nothing in the Budget that would put more police on the streets, make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools. ""That's the battleground of this election."
1260,"He plans to axe 104,000 jobs to free up money for education, health, defence, housing and overseas aid. At the Department for Work and Pensions, 30,000 jobs are to go, 560 will be lost by the end of the month at the Department of Trade and Industry and 400 are to go at the Inland Revenue and Customs. A further 200 jobs at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have been earmarked to be cut. Unions oppose the plans but Mr Brown said £2bn savings had already been made and more jobs had been cut than had been expected at this stage. Mark Serwotka, the leader of the Public and Commercial Services Union said: ""In last year's budget we had the day of the long knifes as the chancellor kicked off the crude game of who could cut the most civil service jobs between the government and the Tories. He said Mr Brown had made welcome announcements on closing tax loopholes and extending the New Deal, while cutting ""the very people who deliver them."" ""There was a time when the only worry thousands of hard working civil and public servants had on budget day was whether petrol or taxes would go up, nowadays the worry is whether they will have a job by the end of it."""
1261,"He hopes to use the UK's G8 presidency to push the issue forward. ""I believe that the generation that provided the finance to combat, cure and eradicate the world's deadliest disease of today - and today the world's least curable disease - HIV/Aids - will rightly earn the title 'the great generation',"" Mr Brown said in a speech during his African tour. On the fourth day of his six-day tour of Africa, the UK chancellor predicted a vaccine could be found by 2012 if the world stepped up its funding pledges. Currently the private sector was only spending £60m a year on seeking an inoculation and the market needed boosting, Mr Brown said. A doubling of world aid to halve world poverty."" The problems of HIV/Aids were inseparable from poverty, he added. ""At least $10 billion per annum (£5.5bn) is needed to address the HIV/Aids crisis in low and middle income countries. An HIV vaccine is probably at least 10 years away. Treatments are needed now."" The chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a G8 aid package which he has likened to the Marshall Plan used by the United States to rebuild Europe after World War Two."
1262,"The scale, the speed, the ferocity of what happened on Boxing Day is difficult to grasp. But Labour's campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp responded: ""Britain is working, don't let the Tories wreck it again"". He went on to reflect on the values that ""most Britons hold dear"". This is the record Mr Blair will have to defend in the coming months, he said, urging voters to hold him to account. ""How much tax do people want to pay? ""We watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. Rather than alluding to false promises Michael Howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the British people for the misery that the government, of which he was a member, inflicted upon the country. The last week has shown that the warm, caring heart of Britain beats as strong as ever."" ""Worst of all, it is a government that has wasted people's money and failed to tackle the problems families face today."" ""The result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives, undermining enterprise and denying people choice."
1263,"Act on detention ruling, UK urged
The government must act quickly on the Law Lords' ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial is unlawful, Mary Robinson has said. Speaking to Parliament on his first day in office as home secretary following David Blunkett's resignation, Mr Clarke said: ""I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year. ""What the Law Lords did was acknowledge the role of the government, but say that there had been a disproportionate use, that it amounted to executive detention and it was discriminatory because it didn't apply to British citizens,"" she said. ""If the government were not to accept this ruling then there is further redress, including possible damages for the individuals who could claim that the government either was tardy or was resisting the implications of the judgement of the Law Lords."" Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US. She said a meeting of the Club of Madrid - a group of former world leaders - to be held in the Spanish capital on the March anniversary of the train bombings there would probably discuss the ruling and its implications. The Law Lords said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions ""in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status""."
1264,"The judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports. BAA support ahead of court battle
UK airport operator BAA has reiterated its support for the government's aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country. The company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. ""We are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations,"" a BAA spokesman said. Stop Stansted Expansion said the White Paper, published in December 2003, was ""fundamentally flawed"" and did not follow the proper consultation process. ""It hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation. ""Yet, a year later the protesters are still here, and stronger than ever. "" A judgement from Mr Justice Sullivan is expected early in February."
1265,"UK 'discriminated against Roma'
The government's immigration rules racially discriminated against Roma (Gypsies) seeking entry into the UK, the Law Lords have ruled. The Home Office said it had not meant to discriminate against anyone. It said it would look at the implications of the ruling, but pointed out the controls were no longer in place because Czechs are now entitled to free movement across Europe. But she said they were treated more sceptically than non-Roma passengers by immigration officers ""acting on racial grounds"". It took up the case of six unnamed Roma Czechs refused entry to Britain, and that of the European Roma Rights Centre, which said the measures unfairly penalised Roma people. Lady Hale said immigration officers should have treated all would-be passengers in the same way, only using more intrusive questioning if there was a specific reason. He ruled there was no obligation on Britain not to take steps to prevent a potential refugee from approaching its border to claim asylum. Civil rights group Liberty said it exposed ""racism at the heart of the government's asylum policy"". Immigration law allows officials to discriminate against citizens from named countries, but it does not allow officers to go further than that. Amnesty International's Jan Shaw said: ""That the government's own asylum policy was being operated discriminatorily is bleakly ironic given that discrimination often lies at the heart of serious human rights abuse, not least in the Czech Republic."""
1266,"And that he wants to build a ""better Britain"" where everyone, whatever the colour of their skin or religion, can ""make the most of their talents"". But the Tory leader will argue against positive discrimination saying it is ""outdated and unjust"". He will attack Labour's record in government over issues such as tax and he will set out Tory plans for an immigration quota to be set by MPs. Howard pitches for UK ethnic vote
Michael Howard is to make a pitch for Britain's ethnic vote urging people who feel ""taken for granted"" by Tony Blair to vote Conservative. ""So I say to all those people from ethnic minorities who feel Mr Blair and the Liberal Democrats take their votes for granted - come join us,"" he will say. Mr Howard will also attack the Lib Dems for wanting to abolish faith schools, introduce compulsory sex education from the age of seven, and ""give contraceptives out in schools from the age of 11"". ""Given the Tories' considerably reduced support in urban areas, where many black and Asian Britons live, during their time in power, the evidence simply does not support his claims that the Conservatives are the party for these communities,"" he said."
1267,"The government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001. Thursday's report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA). But his counterpart on the DCA committee, Alan Beith, said it should be delayed ""until measures likely to increase registration have been put in place and proved effective."" The report said the government should consider fines for unregistered voters, but accepted many experts said it would be an expensive system that would be hard to enforce. It also said about three million people eligible to vote are not registered to do so. ODPM committee chairman Andrew Bennett said individual voter registration, as opposed to registration by household, should be quickly introduced as it could ""dramatically reduce the chances of fraud"". Young people in shared accommodation are thought to miss out because no one acts as head of the household to fill in the form. ""It is vital that we move ahead with the Northern Ireland system of individual electoral registration to safeguard the integrity of the Britain's electoral system,"" he said. It said incentives to register, such as £20 council tax rebate, were likely to be seen as ""gimmicks"" and risked undermining the integrity of the system, MPs said. Instead they called for ""imaginative campaigns"" to boost interest."
1268,"It can no longer be justified. Shadow Europe minister Mr Brady said: ""I believe it is essential that Britain keeps the rebate and I think it's a crucial test of how firmly the British government is prepared to stand up for Britain internationally in Europe. Earlier Conservative Graham Brady said the rebate was a ""crucial test"" of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for Britain. The UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden want the EU budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes - the European Commission has urged an increase to 1.26%. Mr Straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the UK wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions. ""There can be no deal on future financing which does not protect the rebate."" If we lose our rebate as well, the British taxpayer is going to be bled at such a rate that I think everyone will go off the European project."" ""We have one of the lowest net receipts of any EU country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency. Critics - including Germany and France - believe liberalisation could result in companies shifting staff to cheaper bases in Eastern Europe, undercutting large EU economies and undermining social protections. ""European countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods,"" he said."
1269,"Oliver Letwin said the UK could not compete with other countries without the £4bn tax cuts he was promising. he said. ""Can this country compete, can this country prosper, unless we do something about the burden of regulation and tax on our economy?"" ""If we are going to take on the great challenges, the challenges like those posed by the Chinese and the Indians, we have got to do something about getting down the burden of regulation and getting down the burden of tax,"" he said. Mr Howard is likely to defend his party's handling of the bill, which was only passed after the Conservatives accepted Prime Minister Tony Blair's promise that MPs would be able to review it within a year. A Tory government would sort out the ""shambles"" of immigration, put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools, he said. Michael Howard, who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on Friday, will address them in a lunchtime speech. The bill was finally passed on Friday evening, after more than 30 hours of debate."
1270,"The Tories called it a ""vote now, pay later"" Budget. ""Their only answer is to tax, to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later."" he asked. Despite his giveaways, Budget documents show Mr Brown clawed back £265m through a clampdown on tax avoidance and increased revenue from a windfall tax on oil companies. He rejected across-the-board tax cuts in favour of targeted help for families. Mr Kennedy criticised Mr Brown for failing to mention the ""ticking bomb"" of council tax revaluation, saying it was ""high time"" the system was replaced by a ""local tax based on the ability to pay"". The first £2bn of value-for-money savings identified in the Gershon Review have been achieved, the chancellor said. In contrast, the personal income tax allowance will rise only in line with inflation from £4,745 to £4,895 next month. During his 49 minute speech Mr Brown told MPs he had defied the pundits by hitting his growth target of 3.1% for 2004. Some 12,500 civil servant posts have been axed, and 7,800 relocated out of the south east of England, he added."
1271,"The Tories said a large chunk of the Budget appeared to have been leaked in what they describe as a ""serious breach of Treasury confidentiality"". MPs demand 'Budget leak' answers
Ministers have been asked to explain how Budget details were printed in a London newspaper half an hour before Gordon Brown made his speech. He said: ""I can only hope it is unintentional. If it were planned it would be a very grave matter indeed. Deputy Speaker Sylvia Heal agreed it was ""of concern"" but said nothing could be done immediately but the issue would be brought to Mr Martin's attention. A previous Labour chancellor resigned after he leaked the Budget."""
1272,"In America, pheromones have reportedly been released from machines to encourage aggressive gambling and clocks are often removed from walls. She told The Times: ""British casinos will be quite different to those overseas. Ms Jowell said the legislation would ban psychological trickery. ""They will have to act in a socially responsible way and will be tightly regulated. A spokesman for the British Casino Association, which represents the UK industry, said the government was trying to allay fears over a ""UK Las Vegas"". ""The UK gambling industry is being totally frozen in time, and the foreign companies will take over."" ""The UK industry is one of the world's most respected,"" he said. ""We certainly don't use pheremones."
1273,"But Tony Blair said there could be no concession on the ""basic principle"". Mr Blair told the BBC the ""control orders"" would only be used in the most limited circumstances. The government is facing opposition from Tory and Lib Dem MPs and its own backbenchers as it prepares for the final Commons debate on the changes. Critics in the opposition and civil rights activists are worried that the home secretary will have the power to issue the detention orders. And Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy said some concessions had already been offered by the government during last-minute negotiations. Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: ""We are being advised by the police and the security services... ""What they say is you have got to give us powers in between mere surveillance of these people - there are several hundred of them in this country who we believe are engaged in plotting or trying to commit terrorist acts - you have got to give us power in between just surveying them and being able, being sure enough of the proof, to prosecute them beyond reasonable doubt. ""I very much hope it would be possible to reach a compromise on this."" He said after meeting Tony Blair he had been left with the impression that ""he really wasn't interested in any of the various proposals we have put forward"". A YouGov poll in the Daily Telegraph suggested 75% of respondents thought action was sometimes necessary against people who had not committed an offence but who had been found by intelligence services to be planning a terrorist attack. Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil liberties pressure group Liberty, said who was able to issue the control orders was not the main issue."
1274,"No 10 was similarly cautious but said the threat was real. Sir Ian Blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the Madrid bomb on Spain's general election last year. Election 'could be terror target'
Terrorists might try to target the UK in the run-up to the election, London's most senior police officer has said. But he said: ""Terrorists have long memories. The spokesman declined to comment on whether the security services had received specific intelligence relating to a possible attack during the election campaign. ""There are obvious and enormous targets which we have to deal with."" Asked about Sir Ian's comments, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We believe the threat is real."" Tory leader Michael Howard has accused Mr Blair of steamrolling the house arrest plans and of ""using national security for political point scoring"". But critics are concerned that it would be the home secretary and not judges who decided to impose control orders. The plans face further Commons scrutiny on Monday before passing to the Lords."
1275,"""Too often, people were told to make a choice between the indignity of unemployment or the humiliation of poverty pay."" ""There are people on very low salaries, very low incomes indeed who really shouldn't be paying income tax,"" he said. But the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) called for a ""pause year"" to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in October. I can't believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage! This was only 2 years ago and I was getting paid £2.75 an hour, and working as hard as any of the older staff, maybe it's about time 16 - 21 year olds got a fair wage! Businesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay, shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firm. Who do they think will be carrying out these public service jobs if contractors are allowed to pay as little as their consciences allow? This latest increase of 20p an hour will cause even more financial hardship. We can't afford not to pay a decent wage. I came from a very much working class background and started work 20 years ago on a Youth Opportunity Program earning £25 per week."
1276,"Hunt ban support is 'in decline'
Support for a ban on hunting has fallen in the past six years, a poll suggests. Polling company Mori carried out both surveys. But the programme makers suggest the British public are becoming ""increasingly neutral"" to the issue because around one quarter said they ""neither support nor oppose"" a ban. In the Countryfile survey, 47% said they supported the legislation, with 26% against. For Countryfile they asked 2,234 adults across the country the same question."
1277,"Here's a guide to the plan:
People coming to live and work in Britain from outside the EU. Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and HIV. All other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis. Children and pregnant women wanting to live in Britain permanently would not have to have a chest X-ray for TB. People coming to Britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care, childcare or teaching. Under 16s would not face tests for hepatitis and HIV. Those who are diagnosed with the disease would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK. The Tories say people fleeing persecution will not be denied sanctuary in Britain because of poor health. Labour claims the policy is little more than a ""desperate attempt to catch up with Labour's five-year plan"" for immigration and asylum, which was published last week. They claim government figures show that TB in England has increased by 25% over the last 10 years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas."
1278,"Security, stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the UK took over the chairmanship of the EU in July, said Mr Straw. Africa and climate change would also feature highly. Mr Ancram condemned the document, which the Foreign Office says has cost about £2,500 to design, print and deliver. For the Liberal Democrats, Sir Menzies Campbell said the UK should not ignore the need to reform the EU Common Agricultural Policy. He said the UK was trying to ensure future EU budgets were limited to 1% of Europe's economic output and were spent ""where it adds most value"". EU cooperation would help get better UK immigration controls, he argued. ""We, like all other countries, have a veto on any changes proposed in this area,"" he said. Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram told MPs a new White Paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the EU constitution. ""Who are they trying to kid?"" The Electoral Commission on Thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand."
1279,"Under the proposed changes - prompted by the House of Lords ruling - the home secretary could order British citizens or foreign suspects who could not be deported, to face house arrest or other measures such as restrictions on their movements or limits on their use of telephones and the internet. Human rights lawyer Clive Stafford-Smith said the plans were a ""further abuse of human rights in Britain"". British citizens are being included in the changes after the law lords said the current powers were discriminatory because they could only be used on foreign suspects. Most of the terror suspects are being held indefinitely at Belmarsh prison, in London. Mr Clarke said prosecutions were the government's first preference and promised the powers would only be used in ""serious"" cases, with independent scrutiny from judges. He told MPs: ""There remains a public emergency threatening the life of the nation."" He suggested changing the law to let security-cleared judges view evidence gathered by phone-tapping could allow more terror cases to come to court. Shami Chakrabarti, from human rights group Liberty, joined calls for intercept evidence to be allowed in trials. She said: ""Adherence to the rule of law should not be a game of cat and mouse. The government should not swap one human rights 'opt out' for another."""
1280,"Britain, France, Gavi and the Gates Foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the International Finance Facility (IFF) to the area of immunisation. The £1bn commitment is part of a five-point plan on debt relief, trade, aid, education and health. Campaign groups including Friends of the Earth, the World Development Movement, and War on Want said UK government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty. If Gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra £4bn ($7.4bn) over 10 years, then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter, Mr Brown argued. War on Want's John Hilary said: ""Compassionate rhetoric cannot disguise the reality of the government's neo-liberal policies. ""As long as Mr Blair and Mr Brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries, more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty, not lifted out of it."""
1281,"Mr Straw also signed a deal on China-UK tourism. Straw backs ending China embargo
UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has defended plans to end the European Union's arms embargo on China, despite opposition from the US and Japan. Mr Straw, speaking at a joint news conference with Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing, stressed this point. Earlier this week he said he expected the embargo to be lifted within six months. But Mr Straw faces tough opposition to the move. When he was in Tokyo earlier this week, Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura told the British minister that his plan to remove the embargo was "" a worrying issue that concerns the security and environment of not only Japan, but also East Asia overall"". Washington argues that if the embargo is lifted, it could lead to a buying spree for arms that China could use to threaten its diplomatic rival Taiwan. The French want the embargo lifted because they want to sell arms to China; the Chinese want it lifted because they want to buy arms and battlefield technology from Europe."" He said Mr Straw was ""naive beyond belief"" if he accepted China's claim it does not want the ban lifted in order to buy weapons. It is an issue raised by human rights groups too."
1282,"Tony Blair claimed a Tory government would ""cut"" £35bn from public services hitting schools, hospitals and police. For the Lib Dems, Vince Cable said the chancellor had failed to deal with the ""looming problems"" of revaluation of council tax bands which he argued would result in ""massive increases"" for some. But they say not a single doctor, teacher or nurse will be cut. In Wednesday's Budget, Mr Brown doubled the level at which homebuyers pay stamp duty, unveiled a rise in child tax credit and a £200 council tax refund for over-65s. The Tories said they would not cut spending but agreed public spending would increase more slowly under their plans - leading to a total of £33.5bn less spending than that anticipated by Labour by 2011. Appearing together at a Labour poster launch, the prime minister hailed his chancellor's ""brilliant"" performance. ""And to call that a cut is at best a misrepresentation, at worst a downright lie."" Dr Fox said: ""We have said we will be spending more, year on year over and above inflation. ""All our spending plans announced yesterday [Wednesday], including what we can do for pensioners, as well as for young families and on stamp duty and inheritance tax, all these are costed and affordable."" Mr Blair has yet to name the day - but it is widely expected to be 5 May."
1283,"But the government shunned opponents' calls for free long-term care. They also plan a supremo for adult services in each English area to get different agencies working together. The Lib Dems say they would fund free personal care by a new 50% tax rate on incomes over £100,000. Ministers say elderly and disabled people themselves, not social workers, should be able to decide on their care and stay in their own homes. The government has already allowed local councils to give people money so they can pay for their services directly but take-up of the scheme has been ""disappointing"". But Age Concern argued social care was chronically under-funded and older people were being offered choice in principle, but not in practice. Health Minister Stephen Ladyman said: ""This document is the antithesis of the nanny state. ""It's about taking power away from the state and giving it to individuals and saying that we will help you make these decisions but we are not going to make them for you any more."" And Tony Hunter, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said the plans could improve dignity and well-being for thousands of people. ""After eight years of persistent change, dogmatic enforcement of regulation, and overbearing government initiatives - we need action, not a vision,"" said Mr Burns."
1284,"Otherwise it would be overtaken by the likes of China, he told MPs. The chancellor said that the EU's planned changes in the growth and stability pact - designed to ensure that countries in the euro zone do not borrow too much - would force Britain to run a budget surplus of 1% over the economic cycle. He told the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee that the EU rules ""make it difficult for a low debt country to run the investment programmes that are necessary to improve its infrastructure"". In March the Office of National Statistics (ONS) reclassified £3.4bn of spending on road repairs as public investment - shortly before the chancellor announced in the Budget that he would meet his own fiscal budget rule by only £6bn. Conservative Michael Fallon asked Mr Brown whether the Treasury had leaned on ONS to make this change, and said that the ONS had received a written paper from the Treasury on this matter. He told the Treasury Select Committee that a growing economy meant more people in work and more profits for companies which would boost Treasury coffers. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Clarke said political give and take would replace more ""rigid"" rules. ""The warning is about the European constitution, which we are going to have a vote on in a year or two, and that centralises and entrenches these rules in a constitution. ""The conditions for euro entry are unchanged by this new decision about the stability and growth pact,"" Mr. Brown said. It gives more powers to Brussels to co-ordinate things like employment and economic policy."""
1285,"Child access law shake-up planned
Parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers. Judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a ""nuclear option"" which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child's interests, a spokesman said. Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. On the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents, Lord Falconer said: ""Tagging may be going too far, but let's have a debate about that."" Theresa May, shadow secretary for the family, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government's plans were ""inadequate"" and were ""papering over the cracks of the current system"". John Ison, from the controversial group Fathers 4 Justice, said: ""It is very disappointing. What we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation."" ""We would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand, you know what the minimum access is. The Liberal Democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules, rather than having ""rigid targets"". ""We want to make courts the last resort, rather than the first resort,"" she added."
1286,"No date for the vote has been set but Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has suggested it is unlikely to be held until early 2006 - after the predicted date for the next election. Labour MP John Cryer, whose question revealed the price estimate, said the cost surprised him but was not a central factor as it was important people had their say. But he said it would have been better to have rejected the constitution so avoiding the need for a referendum. The 2001 election cost £80m."
1287,"'No UK apology' for colonial past
The days of Britain having to apologise for its colonial past are over, Gordon Brown has said. South African president Thabo Mbeki has attacked British imperialists, saying they treated Africans like savages. Mr Brown said that missionairies had come to Africa because of their sense of duty. BBC political correspondent Mark Mardell said Britishness had long been a theme of the chancellor's but ""never before has he been so outspoken in defending Britain's past history"". The UK has already cancelled its bilateral debts - money the UK alone is owed - with the world's poorest nations including Tanzania. On top of the relief deal with Tanzania Mr Brown said the UK would make similar offers to 70 poorer nations around the world. ""We make this offer unilaterally but we are now asking other countries to join us,"" the chancellor said. There he is expected to strike a similar debt relief pact."
1288,"This gives them the chance. Until 1857, the only way in England to get a full divorce which allowed re-marriage was to obtain an Act of Parliament by proving adultery or life-threatening cruelty. Among the records is the story of Jane Campbell, the first woman ever to divorce her husband. But divorces are by no means the only documents in the archives which hold personal details of people often far removed from politics and Parliament. A transcript of evidence from Jessy's maid, Amelia Laugher, shows her telling how Addison frequently passed by her on the way to the room where she had just put her mistress naked to bed. But now five years of work has produced an online catalogue. The archives do, of course, hold records of high (and low) politics too for both Houses of Parliament, including copies of all acts passed since 1497 - the oldest dealing with the employment of workers in the woollen industry in Norfolk. David Prior, assistant clerk of the archives, says the catalogue opens up new possibilities for research. ""Before, you just could not do it, you faced trawling through pages and pages of printed material,"" he says. As Mr Prior remarks as we walk by shelf after shelf of vellum (parchment made from goat's skin): ""All human life is here."""
1289,"Economy focus for election battle
Britain's economic future will be at the heart of Labour's poll campaign, Chancellor Gordon Brown has said. Earlier the Archbishop of Canterbury wrote to all three parties urging them not to fight the election by exploiting people's fears. He said they should concentrate instead on issues such as the environment, international development and the arms trade, family policy, and the reform of the criminal justice system. In a speech to the Foreign Policy Centre Mr Straw said of the Tory leader: ""He is clever, fluent and tactical, but he is not wise. I think he will want to look quite carefully at what Jack Straw said about Michael Howard."" ""He lacks strategy and good judgment, and his quick temper and impetuosity too often get the better of him."" Labour's focus on the economy as their key message - came on the day a new report was published by the Institute of Fiscal Studies, suggesting that household incomes have fallen for the first time in more than a decade. Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said: ""People are already really turned off by the kind of campaign the others are fighting and you will see us putting emphasis on some of these huge issues facing the world, particularly the environment."" The Treasury dismissed the research as ""complete rubbish""."
1290,"During the phoney campaign, Labour got into trouble over its central claim that Michael Howard was planning £35 bn cuts in public services. A second central argument will be over taxation, with the Tories claiming the Chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if Labour wins again. The prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller, slower increase in spending planned by the Tories compared to Labour's plans was a cut. Then deputy Conservative Chairman Howard Flight was reported to have suggested Mr Howard was secretly planning even bigger ""cuts"". But, as ever, it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome. But leader Charles Kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax. He was sacked for his gaffe, but the damage had been done and the faltering Labour campaign was back on track. And it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties' tax and spend policies. As usual, the Liberal Democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties."
1291,"He says the initial call may not be marketing but it identifies voters to whom the party can send promotional material in the future. Labour faces 'cold calls' inquiry
Labour is to be investigated by a watchdog over claims its election campaign has broken the rules on ""cold calling"" householders. The Lib Dems say Labour is telephoning people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing calls. Labour denies breaking rules. ""For example, we could send the target (Conservative) people a letter from someone who had defected from the Tories to Labour explaining the reasons why voting Tory is a bad idea or we could send Labour (weak) people a letter encouraging them to sign up for a postal vote."" ""We are investigating one of the complaints where some evidence has been given to us,"" she said. Mr Taylor tells the commissioner: ""It is clear beyond peradventure from the above that the Labour Party is engaging in a large-scale voter ID project for subsequent promotional purposes through targeted and segmented mailings. ""Insofar as this project is directed at TPS subscribers, it is equally clear that it is unlawful."" If the appeal fails and it continues breaking the rules, it could be fined up to £5,000. However, we are absolutely clear that we haven't broken any rules."
1292,"Blunkett hints at election call
Ex-Home Secretary David Blunkett has given fresh clues that the general election will be announced on Monday. He clarified that he meant he would be in his Sheffield seat this weekend, not that he expected an election call then."
1293,"The flagship pledge is to replace council tax with a local income tax. Looking to the coming elections, which are all expected to be held on 5 May, Mr Davey said: ""We are going to be winning more votes and winning more seats. ""I couldn't think of a stronger endorsement of a leader."""
1294,"""The association is in the process of selecting a new candidate."" But the local Tory chairman made similar comments on Friday and dissent continues. Mr Flight says he will not stand down as a candidate unless his local party instructs him to do so at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). Tories reject rethink on axed MP
Sacked MP Howard Flight's local Conservative association has insisted he will not be its candidate at the general election. The news comes despite Mr Flight's allies saying they had enough support to hold a meeting to discuss his fate. Adrian Hilton was abandoned after suggesting the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, under John Major's government, was an act of treason. The Tory leader, who argues he is ensuring honesty, said: ""We do not say one thing in private and another thing in public."" The comments were not a ""one-off"", he said, claiming Mr Howard and other senior Tories were obsessively committed to cutting public spending. Mr Flight's supporters also say they have the 50 signatures needed to trigger the EGM. ""There are people at Central Office who are behaving like little dictators and seemingly people who are ordinary members are being treated with contempt,"" he said."
1295,"Tory leader Michael Howard said he would be remembered with ""affection and respect"". ""You don't get to the premiership unless you have a streak of determination,"" he said. ""It was a commitment to public service that brought Jim Callaghan into Parliament in 1945, and while Jim rose to the top he never forgot his roots."" He held each of the major offices of chancellor, home secretary, foreign secretary and prime minister during his career and became Lord Callaghan of Cardiff in 1987. He once travelled to Idi Amin's Uganda in 1975 to plead for the life of a British lecturer, Dennis Hills, who was under a death sentence for treason. He enlisted in the Royal Navy in 1942 and rose to the rank of lieutenant. With sterling under pressure, he resisted devaluation for three years, before being forced into it in 1967. When he refused to support prime minister Harold Wilson and Dame Barbara Castle over the latter's trade union manifesto, In Place of Strife, in 1968, he said: ""I am not going to resign. They will have to throw me out"". His political life was often tempered by battles against the hard left of the party."
1296,"Downing Street would not be drawn on the claim, saying election timing was a matter for the prime minister. The Labour government officially has until June 2006 to hold general election, but in recent years governments have favoured four-year terms. Andrew Marr says Mr Blair will ask the Queen on 4 or 5 April to dissolve Parliament at the end of that week. ""As soon as the Commons is back after the short Easter recess, Tony Blair whips up to the Palace, asks the Queen to dissolve Parliament ... and we're going."" But it will also seek to push through its Serious and Organised Crime Bill and ID cards Bill."
1297,"Work and pensions minister Alan Johnson said it was wrong to suggest the chancellor would usurp Mr Milburn, adding they would ""work as a team"". A report in the Sunday Business claimed Mr Brown has been asked to take charge of media strategy, while Mr Milburn would move to a behind-the-scenes role. But many Labour backbenchers are said to be dissatisfied with the way election campaigning has gone and have said they wanted to see the chancellor take a bigger role. Mr Johnson told BBC News: ""Gordon Brown will play a central role in any election campaign. ""They were wrong when they said Milburn was ousting Brown and they're wrong now if they are saying Brown is ousting Milburn. We work as a team."" Neither Downing Street nor the Labour Party would comment directly on the reports."
1298,"But according to the BBC poll, 61% said the issue of trust made no difference to whether or not they would vote at the next election, widely expected on 5 May. Both the Tories and the Lib Dems are keen to emphasise a perceived lack of trust in Tony Blair, following his claims over Iraqi weapons. Mr Straw told activists in Blackburn on Thursday that voters would have to decide at the next election which party ""best deserves"" their ""future trust"". Just under three-quarters of respondents (73%) said politicians had shown themselves to be dishonest too often. Former education secretary Estelle Morris told BBC News 24 that there was a ""real problem of trust"" between the public and the politicians. He acknowledged that the public had lost faith in Labour, but suggested it could persuade people to ""reinvest their trust with us"" if the party could overcome Tory attempts to spread cynicism in politics. And the Green Party unveiled a billboard opposite the Palace of Westminster accusing the government of lying over the Iraq war. ""We need public figures we trust to tell the truth and who can see themselves as others see them."" The public was often turned off by sitting on the sidelines in ""the battle of words"" between the politician and the journalist, she added. ""Issues of war and peace, life and death do have a very damaging effect on the credibility of politicians""."
1299,"Tory candidate quits over remark
A Conservative election challenger is quitting after being quoted as wanting a ""period of creative destruction in the public services"". Labour election coordinator Alan Milburn claimed Mr Kruger had exposed the Tory agenda for £35bn of cuts to public services. Mr Kruger is continuing in his job at the Tory campaign headquarters. ""However, in order to avoid any further misrepresentation of his views and any damage to the Party, he has decided not to stand in the Sedgefield constituency at the next election."" In a statement, the party said the comment had been taken out of context. Mr Milburn said: ""He is not some unknown hopeful fighting an unwinnable seat. It reveals the true picture of what they would do."""
1300,"The prime minister has made it clear he has no plans to the change the law. All three main parties say the issue is one for each MP's conscience, rather than one where there is a party-wide policy. Mr Blair's spokesman said: ""The Catholic church has a well-known position on this issue and it was one of many issues the Cardinal mentioned and therefore it should be seen in that context."" In the Cosmopolitan interview Mr Howard said: ""I believe abortion should be available to everyone, but the law should be changed. Shadow home secretary David Davis said he understood Mr Howard had been signalling that a Conservative government would allow a Commons vote on the issue. The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cardiff, the Most Reverend Peter Smith, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the church merely wanted people to ""reflect on issues in light of the gospel"" before voting. The Tory leader supports a reduction in the legal limit from 24 weeks to 20 and has said current rules are ""tantamount to abortion on demand"". ""Obviously there is a time beyond which you can't have an abortion, and we have no plans to change that although the debate will continue."" ""However much I dislike the idea of abortion, you should not criminalise a woman who, in very difficult circumstances, makes that choice. Anti-abortion group the Pro-Life Alliance ""congratulated"" Mr Howard on his new stance, but said it did not go far enough."
1301,"Profile: Gordon Brown
The ultimate prize of 10 Downing Street may continue to elude him but, as he prepares to deliver a record-breaking ninth budget, Gordon Brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times. How much longer Mr Brown will continue in the job is not clear (he once said there are two types of chancellor: ""those who fail and those who get out in time."") He reached that milestone last June, when he overtook David Lloyd George, who served for seven years and 43 days between 1908 and 1915. Gordon Brown was born in Glasgow on 20 February 1951, the son of a Church of Scotland Minister in the small Fife town of Kirkcaldy. At 12, he was canvassing for Labour and by his 20s he was a leading political activist in Scotland. But if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in 1994, Mr Brown continued his devotion to politics. A year later, in October 2003, the couple had a son - John - an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side. But with the Tories having appeared to get the better of the pre-election campaign thus far there are reports that Mr Brown - using the Budget as a springboard - is to revitalise Labour's campaign. The chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the NHS and is seen as being more ""Old Labour"" than Mr Blair in his approach to wealth redistribution. How much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question."
1302,"Boateng to step down at election
Paul Boateng, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is to step down as a Labour MP at the forthcoming general election. The appointment is dependent on Labour's re-election. Chancellor Gordon Brown said: ""Over the past eight years Paul's contribution to the Treasury and the government has been exceptional - and it has been my privilege to have worked closely with him closely at the Treasury. ""I congratulate Paul on his new appointment. Mr Boateng also laughed off suggestions that his re-election in Brent South seat had been in danger saying it was ""one of the safest Labour seats in the country"". He was the UK's first black cabinet minister when appointed to his post in 2002, promoted from the Home Office, where he had been prisons minister. Asked if he was appointed as the result of a ""fair and open"" competition, he replied: ""I have been appointed as a result of a process that's been used before by Labour and Conservative governments to appoint people of all parties who have relevant experience."" ""I look forward to continuing to work with Paul on this vital agenda."" ""Mr Blair's appointment of Paul Boateng is the latest example of a worrying trend of failed Tony's cronies being appointed to senior diplomatic posts,"" he said."
1303,"Mr Hain, Leader of the Commons, told BBC Radio Four's Today programme that Mr Howard's stance on the government's anti-terrorism legislation was putting the country at risk. This morning Peter Hain even called me a mongrel. Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett rejected Mr Howard's comment, telling Radio 4's PM programme that Labour was not ""rattled"". ""Since the beginning of this year - election year - we've been making the political weather,"" he told the party conference. ""We have a very real duty to try to get people to focus on Michael Howard's record, what the proposals are that he is trying to put forward to the country and also the many examples we are seeing now of what we believe is really poor judgement on his behalf."" ""I come from an ordinary family. And he stressed his party's commitment to cut taxes and red tape and increase the basic state pension in line with earnings. Labour election co-ordinator Alan Milburn said: ""Michael Howard's speech today confirms what we have always said - that his only strategy is opportunism but he has no forward vision for the country. I helped to win that famous election - the election that transformed our country for the better'."" I did my bit."
1304,"The party goes into its spring forum trying to highlight what it sees as a clear choice between it and Labour. Labour's rule has been characterised by ""lost trust and failure to deliver"", he told the Brighton conference. Tory co-chairman Liam Fox has opened proceedings with a speech criticising Tony Blair's record in government. Dr Fox also underlined Tory promises to cut tax by £4bn. Mr Howard is likely to defend his party's handling of the bill, which was only passed after the Conservatives accepted Prime Minister Tony Blair's promise that MPs would be able to review it within a year. The bill was finally passed on Friday evening, after more than 30 hours of debate."
1305,"Conservative leader Michael Howard has now accepted the MP's resignation, it has been announced. The Conservative Party had already been withdrawn the whip for a month. The decision comes after Mr Sayeed survived an attempt to de-select him in a row over allegations he had profited from private tours of Parliament. Mr Sayeed has been MP for Mid-Bedfordshire since 1997. But his constituency association voted against a move to deselect him, with Mr Sayeed winning 173 of the 299 votes. He insisted that the committee's report had contained a ""few errors of fact"". He represented Bristol East from 1983 to 1992."
1306,"I did my bit. ""One day you will be able to tell your children and grandchildren as I will tell mine, 'I was there. Some delegates even spoke of the next election being like 1970, when Ted Heath, behind in the polls and written off by the pundits, snatched victory from Harold Wilson's Labour Party. Their latest poster campaign flags up a range of policies from better school discipline, cleaner hospitals (""I mean, how hard is it to keep a hospital clean?"") They all insisted it was not going to be a re-run of 2001. ""We thought in 2001 we were going to dent that massive majority but it just didn't happen,"" said John Murray, of Aldridge Browhills Conservatives. They have had Labour on the back foot over immigration, with Tony Blair hastily adding a sixth promise on the issue to his latest pledge card, and have even managed to score points in traditional Labour territory such as health and education. The Labour machine appears to be in some kind of state of shock, it doesn't seem to know what to do."" ""Our policies have been getting in the media and there is a sense that we can win. ""It was very disappointing."
1307,"'Last chance' warning for voters
People in England, Scotland and Wales must have registered by 1700 GMT to be able to vote in the general election if it is held, as expected, on 5 May. Completed registration forms can be handed into local authorities throughout the day on Friday, and some will accept them by fax. The deadline for voters to register in Northern Ireland expired on Thursday. An Electoral Commission spokeswoman said: ""Political decisions are made on your behalf every day but only by using your right to vote at an election can you really have a say on the issues you care about. ""If you want your voice to be heard on 5 May you will need to have registered by Friday 11 March."""
1308,"The 64-year-old latest donation follows a £2.5m gift to the party in 2003. David Sainsbury said he was pleased to give cash to a party that had the ""vision"" to deliver economic prosperity and better public services for Britain. ""Through the generosity of David Sainsbury and other Labour supporters, Labour will be campaigning hard to take Britain forward and to stop the Tories taking us back,"" Mr Carter said. Lord Sainsbury added: ""I am pleased to be able to make this contribution to the general election funds of the Labour Party because I believe that they are the only party that has the vision to deliver both economic prosperity and better public services for Britain."""
1309,"He told The Observer government life was a ""constant barrage of attack"" but said he would not stay in charge if he felt unable to contribute. Speaking amid a flurry of pre-election campaigning, the prime minister said: ""I am an issue, I always will be. He added: ""If you are afraid to take criticism, you should go and do another job."" Mr Blair said he had learned from a series of at times tough encounters with members of the public, during question and answer sessions across the country in recent weeks. Whether he still had something to offer, he said, was a judgement for people to make. Meanwhile, Commons leader Peter Hain has warned that on the campaign trail he has seen ""dangerous complacency"" being displayed by Labour voters convinced of a general election victory. He pledged to clamp down on Britain's growing compensation culture, which has brought concerns that doctors, teachers and other professionals are being hampered in their work by the fear of frivolous lawsuits. ""We are in danger of - depending on whatever is the media campaign of the day - ending up spending literally hundreds, sometimes millions of pounds meeting quite a small risk."" And there should be ""real debate"" about the risk posed by public safety threats, he said. If Labour voters ""stayed at home"" in marginal seats they could see Tory leader Michael Howard ""coming in the back door to Number 10 with the tradesman's key to Number 10, getting into power"", he added."
1310,"But Mr Wyatt argued: ""By some way, he is currently the figure in all of the polls that people trust and see that has delivered over eight years an economy unmatched anywhere in the world. He wants a greater campaigning role for Chancellor Gordon Brown. The MP for Sittingbourne and Sheppey said Prime Minister Tony Blair had been ""trying very hard"" to improve his own standing with the electorate through a ""sort of campaign of trust"". A Labour party spokesman played down differences with Mr Wyatt and said Mr Brown already had a prominent campaign role. ""This election is a choice between Labour taking Britain forward and the Conservatives taking us back."" But Mr Blair had been ""hurt"" by the Iraq controversy, he added."
1311,"Mr Howard's seat is at the top of the Liberal Democrats' list. He said it was ""nothing personal"" but that ""very many of the prominent Conservatives"" had slender leads in seats where the Lib Dems were second. Top Tories on Lib Dem 'hit list'
The Liberal Democrats are aiming to unseat a string of top Tories - including leader Michael Howard - at the next general election. But he urged Labour supporters to vote tactically to remove prominent Conservatives. ""We will be pointing out how they are soft on crime, how they support higher taxes, their opposition to controlled immigration and support for giving Europe more control over our lives"". A Conservative spokesperson said: ""The Liberal Democrats can talk all they like about strategy."
1312,"Your vote was wasted. Responding to the claims Tory Party co-chairman Liam Fox said: ""Like Labour, the Lib Dems are soft on crime, support higher taxes, oppose controlled immigration and support giving Europe more control over our lives."" Mr Kennedy said: ""Britain is the fourth-largest economy in the world. He told delegates that Labour had abused the public's trust and that the Tories had failed to oppose them. The money would be used to help pay for key policies such as abolishing university tuition fees, scrapping council tax in favour of local income tax, and providing free care for the elderly, he said. Mr Kennedy has been under fire in recent days for missing Monday's Commons vote on the government's controversial anti-terrorism laws, along with 16 other Lib Dem MPs. Earlier, Mr Kennedy told Radio 4's Today programme there was no possibility of forming a coalition with Labour in the event of a hung Parliament. Labour and the Tories claim the sums do not add up, and that working families would be hardest hit. We have world class businesses and a world class workforce. ""We go into the election as an independent party and we come out as an independent party,"" he said."
1313,"""I am quite confident,"" said Claxton. ""But I take each race as it comes. ""As long as I keep up my training but not do too much I think there is a chance of a medal."" Claxton has won the national 60m hurdles title for the past three years but has struggled to translate her domestic success to the international stage. And at last week's Birmingham Grand Prix, Claxton left European medal favourite Russian Irina Shevchenko trailing in sixth spot."
1314,"Athletics Ireland have hinted that the 35-year-old Cobh runner may be included in the official line-up for the event in France on 19-20 March. The first three at Santry last Saturday, Jolene Byrne, Maria McCambridge and Fionnualla Britton, are automatic selections and will most likely form part of the long-course team. The participation of O'Sullivan, currentily training at her base in Australia, would boost the Ireland team who won the bronze three years agio."
1315,"It was my mistake. My goal - I'm going to win the worlds."" Greene was also denied Olympic gold in the 4x100m men's relay when he could not catch Britain's Mark Lewis-Francis on the final leg. ""It's never going to happen again. ""I just felt like I was running all alone. ""That's when Francis Obikwelu came up and I took third because I didn't know he was there. He then has another indoor meeting in France before resuming training for the outdoor season and the task of recapturing his world title in Helsinki in August. I think when I was coming up I would say there was me and Ato (Boldon) in the young crowd,"" Greene said. Greene believes Gatlin will again prove the biggest threat to his ambitions in Finland. ""I believe if I was in the middle of the race I would have been able to react to people that came ahead of me."""
1316,"It was also agreed that a programme to ""de-mystify"" the issue to athletes, the public and the media was a priority. The two task forces will report back to the IAAF Council, at its April meeting in Qatar. ""I am very happy to see you all, members of the athletics family, respond positively to the IAAF call to sit together and discuss what more we can do in the fight against doping,"" said Diack. ""We are the leading Federation in this field and it is our duty to keep our sport clean."""
1317,"But compatriot Kenenisa Bekele's record hopes were dashed when he miscounted his laps in the men's 3,000m and staged his sprint finish a lap too soon. ""I didn't want to sit back and get out-kicked,"" said Cragg. Ireland's Alistair Cragg won in 7:39.89 as Bekele battled to second in 7:41.42. ""So I kept on the pace. The race was mine."""
1318,"Isinbayeva claims new world best
Pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva broke her own indoor world record by clearing 4.89 metres in Lievin on Saturday. ""I ran my race perfectly,"" said Scott, who won in 6.46secs, his best time indoors. ""I am happy even if I know that Maurice is a long way from being at his peak at the start of the season."""

British triple jumper Ashia Hansen has ruled out a comeback this year after a setback in her recovery from a bad knee injury, according to reports. Her coach Aston Moore told the Times: ""We're not looking at any sooner than 2006, not as a triple jumper."" ""There was a problem with the wound healing and it set back her rehabilitation by about two months, but that has been solved and we can push ahead now,"" he said."
1321,"I almost went home. ""I felt a little better Sunday morning but decided I'd only run in the main race. ""It's just a case of chipping away as I have done in previous years and the results will come."" ""Given I am still off-colour I know there is plenty more in the tank and I expect to get faster in the next few weeks,"" he said. Gardener clocked 6.56 seconds to equal the meeting record and finished well ahead of Germany's Marc Blume, who crossed the line in 6.67 secs. Promising 60m hurdler
clocked a new UK record of 7.98 seconds at a meeting in Norway. That leap - 37cm short of Brazilian winner Jadel Gregorio's effort - was good enough to qualify for the European Indoor Championships. Britain's Joice Maduaka finished fifth in 7.35. At the same meeting,
finished third in 7.27 seconds in a high-class women's 60m. The 28-year-old cleared 1.76m to win the high jump and threw 13.86m in the women's shot put."

World and Commonwealth 100m champion Kim Collins will compete in the 60m at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham on 18 February. ""I'm looking forward to competing against such a strong field,"" he said. The world champion says he's in good shape but he isn't underestimating the home competition. Collins ran in Birmingham at the 2003 World Indoor Championships. ""I'm looking forward to competing against Britain's best sprinters and I'm sure the 60 metres will be one of the most exciting races of the evening."" ""This will be a big year for me and I plan to defend my 100m world title in Helsinki in August."
1323,"""But she is working out whether she can accommodate the worlds without too much compromise in her marathon training."" Radcliffe yet to answer GB call
Paula Radcliffe has been granted extra time to decide whether to compete in the World Cross-Country Championships. ""It would be fantastic to have Paula in the team,"" said the European cross-country champion. Radcliffe was world cross-country champion in 2001 and 2002 but missed last year's event because of injury. ""But you have to remember that athletics is basically an individual sport and anything achieved for the team is a bonus. We all understand the problem."""
1324,"Idowu landed 17.30m at the British trials in Sheffield last month to lead the world triple jump rankings. Idowu made his breakthrough five years ago but so far has only a Commonwealth silver medal to his name. ""He has to start producing at international level and here is the beginning,"" said Edwards. I'm sure a victory in Madrid will build up his confidence and self-belief that he can be best in the world."" ""Phillips still needs to be much more consistent. Olympic champion Christian Olsson will not be taking part as he is out for the entire indoor season with an ankle injury."
1325,"Athletics Kenya (AK) had suspended the two-time London Marathon runner-up for failing to turn up to a cross-country team training camp in Embu. ""We have withdrawn the ban. ""She explained she had a contract with the organisers of the race in Puerto Rice and we have accepted her apology."" The Kenyan coaching team will now decide whether Chepkemei can be included in the team for this month's world cross country championships. ""Subject to our doctor's confirmation, we have decided to clear Masai,"" added Kiplagat. But the organisation came under intense international and domestic pressure to reverse its decision. AK had insisted it was making an example of Chepkemei by banning her from competition until the end of 2005. AK also dropped its harsh stance on three-time world cross country 4km champion Edith Masai."
1326,"""I believe after my wins abroad and in our trial race in Sheffield, I can run my race from the front, back or middle,"" said McIlroy. Lester is better known for his work with 400m runners Roger Black and Mark Richardson in the past but under his guidance McIlroy has secured five wins this indoor season. ""That was my last decent year,"" said McIlroy, who temporarily retired last August before returning to the sport under Lester's shrewd guidance. The 28-year-old 800 metres runner has not always matched his promise with performances but believes his decision to change coaches and move base will bring the rewards. ""Before, every race was like trying to climb Mount Everest and I now know you can't do it on your own. ""Trying to succeed saw me sometimes standing half-dead and terrified on the starting line, which became a bit too much."" He admitted: ""He looked quite good in his win and fair enough everyone has the right to their own opinion. ""Ultimately of course, this weekend is a means to an end and that is getting prepared for the summer's world championships. ""That ambition has meant that I've had only two nights out since last August. The rest of my time has seen me just concentrating on rebuilding my career."""

UK Athletics has agreed a new deal with adidas to supply Great Britain squads of all ages with their kit for the next four years. UK Athletics chief David Moorcroft said: ""The Athens experience can now be extended to more major championships. We are delighted."""
1328,"The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests. The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic's governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry. They were set to learn their fate by the end of February, but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. ""I am confident and optimistic,"" Thanou had said at the time. ""We presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of."" It was not clear what this new evidence was."
1329,"Gregory Ioannidis has submitted new evidence to a Greek athletics tribunal which he claims proves the former Olympic champion has no case to answer. The Greek tribunal is expected to give its verdict early next week. Kenteris and compatriot Katerina Thanou were given provisional suspensions in December for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics. They were also alleged to have avoided tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago before the Games. But Ioannidis said: ""Everything overwhelmingly shows that the charges should be dropped."" Nick Davies, spokesman for athletics' ruling body the IAAF, which handed out the provisional bans, said: ""We can't comment because we were not present at the hearing and don't know what was said behind closed doors."
1330,"The world junior champion clocked 44.93 seconds to finish well clear of fellow American Bershawn Jackson in Arkansas. Kenyan Bernard Lagat missed out on the world record by 1.45secs as he ran the third quickest indoor mile ever to beat Canada's Nate Brannen by almost 10secs. Ireland's
continued his excellent form by winning a tight 3,000m in 7:40.53. World indoor 60m hurdles champion

Kenya's athletics body has suspended two-time London Marathon runner-up Susan Chepkemei from all competition until the end of the year. ""We are taking this action in order to salvage our pride,"" said Kiplagat. ""We shall communicate this decision to the IAAF and all meet directors all over the world."" Masai missed the national trials in early February, but was included in the provisional team on the proviso that she ran in a regional competition. She failed to run in the event, citing a leg injury."
1334,"I was nervous about whether I would actually be able to get round. ""It was nice to get that out of the way. I just had to relax and use my racing knowledge,"" said Holmes. The time is irrelevant. The Olympic 800m and 1500m champion's time was inside the qualifying mark for the European Indoor Championships in Madrid in March. Now it's about going forward. ""The reception I've had since the Olympics has been amazing and that's why I wanted to keep running this year, because I get a buzz from the crowd."""
1335,"Whatever the ruling, all parties will have the right to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. ""I believe the tribunal will reach a decision that will uphold the standing of the institution,"" said Papadoyiannakis. The pair arrived with former coach Christos Tzekos to give evidence at the Hellenic Olympic Committee's offices. A trial date has not been set. They were given provisional suspensions by athletics' ruling body the IAAF in December for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics. Kenteris won 200m gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, while Thanou won silver in the 100m. The pair spent four days in a hospital, claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. ""Whatever the athletes have done, we must not forget that they have offered us great moments."" ""We refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical,"" he said. ""There have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials, and these procedural breaches have also violated my client's rights."
1336,"The Kenyan was initially unsure if she would have recovered from her gruelling tussle with Paula Radcliffe in the New York Marathon in time to compete. Race director Matthew Turnbull said: ""Susan will add even more strength in depth to the world-class line up."" Recently-crowned European cross country champion Briton Hayley Yelling also competes in Edinburgh on 15 January, as does in-form Scot Kathy Butler."
1337,"""If I am to compete in it, it is only if I feel I can win,"" said the 30-year-old, who is retiring in 2006. The 30-year-old has set his sights on clinching the world 5,000m crown in Helsinki this summer. El Guerrouj could meet Bekele in March as the Ethiopian is the defending world cross country champion over both the long and short courses. - Britain's Paula Radcliffe has also not ruled out competing in the World Cross Country Championships. ""I am almost a month behind but I am on the right track."" And he is aiming to break 10,000m Olympic champion Kenenisa Bekele's 5,000m and 10,000m world records. ""The return to training was very difficult because I accepted a lot of invitations these past few months,"" said El Guerrouj."
1338,"Collins appeals against drugs ban
Sprinter Michelle Collins has lodged an appeal against her eight-year doping ban with the North American Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). She is the first athlete to be banned without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use. Collins was suspended by the US Anti-Doping Agency based on patterns observed in her blood and urine tests as well as evidence in the Balco investigation. The company has been accused of distributing illegal performance-enhancing drugs to elite athletes."
1339,"Holmes feted with further honour
Double Olympic champion Kelly Holmes has been voted European Athletics (EAA) woman athlete of 2004 in the governing body's annual poll. Swedish triple jumper Christian Olsson was voted male athlete of the year. In addition to becoming a dame, she was also named the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in December. And she scooped two awards at the British Athletics Writers' Association annual dinner in October."
1340,"Campbell to extend sprint career
Darren Campbell has set his sights on running quicker than ever after deciding not to retire from sprinting. ""I've started back and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. I've got to run under 10 seconds (for 100m) and under 20 seconds (for 200m)."" Campbell was part of the British quartet who shocked the Americans to win relay gold in Athens in August. ""Every season I go and challenge for the medals so why would last season have been any different? ""To go to Athens and finally get the gold I've been trying to get for 24 years was a big relief,"" said Campbell. ""It's just unfortunate that I picked up that injury just before the Olympics."" And he ran 20.13secs in the quarter-finals of the 200m in Sydney on the way to Olympic silver."
1341,"""Everybody knows how much I enjoy competing in Britain. I always seem to break records there,"" said Isinbayeva. ""As Olympic champion there will be more attention on me this year, but hopefully I can respond with another record in Birmingham."" The organisers are hoping that Isinbayeva's main rival, fellow Russian Svetlana Feofanova, will also take part in the event."
1342,"But come late August, a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in Athens told us of the true strength of Irish athletics - or to be more accurate, the lack of it. But after the disastrous build-up to the games, we shouldn't have been surprised. The Corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a two-year ban from the sport. Once the track and field action began in Athens, a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although Alistair Cragg's performance in being the only athlete from a European nation to qualify for the 5,000m final did offer hope for the future. As it happened, she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner Meseret Defar. Amazingly, she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world-class field at the Flora Lite 5K road race in London and while her major championship days may be over, it's unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition. James McIlroy, Gareth Turnbull, Zoe Brown and Paul McKee all had to be content with watching the Athens action on their television screens. At the start of the year, several Northern Ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the Games but come August, an out-of-form and injured Paul Brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province. A lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked McKee's Athens ambitions and both he and Turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in 2005. McKiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injury-ravaged years."
1343,"Sprinter Walker quits athletics
Former European 200m champion Dougie Walker is to retire from athletics after a series of six operations left him struggling for fitness. ""I had intended to race but I'm running like a goon,"" said Walker. ""I missed a big chunk of speed work over about three weeks, and then another week working in America. ""I still enjoy training, but feel it's time to move on, and concentrate on a career."""
1344,"""I am still as hungry to do as much as I can in this sport,"" said Bekele. ""And aiming for the two mile world record in Birmingham is the next of those targets."" Gebrselassie's current record stands at eight minutes, 04.69 seconds. Bekele sets sights on world mark
Olympic 10,000m champion Kenenisa Bekele is determined to add the world indoor two mile record at February's Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham. The meet has already attracted a crop of Olympic talent. While men's 4x100m relay gold medallists Jason Gardener and Mark Lewis-Francis will go head-to-head in the 60m."
1345,"Athletics' ruling body the IAAF said explanations from the pair and their former coach as to why they missed the tests were ""unacceptable"". Greek sprinters suspended by IAAF
Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have been suspended after failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics. Wednesday's statement said the Greek Federation (SEGAS) would convene a disciplinary hearing for the trio to determine whether there had been doping violations. Some medical staff have been charged with writing false medical reports. ""The IAAF's decision means nothing,"" he said. Tzekos insisted he and the runners had nothing to hide. ""We'll be presenting all our arguments to SEGAS - we're innocent."""
1346,"Kelly had been full of ""should I, shouldn't I?"" thoughts about going for the double in Athens. Winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality. Hicham El Guerrouj's Olympic double is a much bigger achievement than Kelly's on a global scale. The lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake. I thought why wouldn't you do the 800m, it's your best event? Purely as a race, Paula's victory in the New York Marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling. The only individual men's finalist on the track was Michael East in the 1500m. What happened to Paula in Athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well. And one of the positive things to come out of Balco is people are starting to blow the whistle."
1347,"The 33-year-old was found guilty of using performance-enhancing drugs. World record holder Tim Montgomery is also facing a lifetime ban after being charged by the USADA. ""Collins used these substances to enhance her performance and elude the drug testing that was available at the time."" Collins' ban is a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the Balco doping scandal. USADA chief executive officer Terry Madden said the action taken against Collins was further proof of that. ""The USADA has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Collins took EPO, the testosterone/epitestosterone cream and THG,"" said a CAS statement. Drug enforcement chiefs in the US have vowed to crack down on cheats. His hearing before the CSA has been rescheduled for June next year."
1348,"IOC president Jacques Rogge has set up a disciplinary body to look into claims by Victor Conte, of Balco Laboratories. But Rogge said it was too early to speculate about that, hoping only that ""the truth will emerge"". ""Victor Conte's allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward,"" she said. In a statement released through her attorney Rich Nichols, Jones repeated her innocence and vowed she would be cleared. ""Conte is someone who is under federal indictment and has a record of issuing contradictory, inconsistent statements."""
1349,"""At the moment, the biggest factor on the mind of British sprinters is to be number one in Britain,"" the world 200m and 400m record holder told Five Live. However, Linford Christie countered: ""It's easy to criticise when you haven't gone through the system here."" Speaking at an elite coaches' conference in Birmingham, Johnson also argued that although there has been more investment in the sport in Britain, it had not necessarily reaped the rewards. And the American remains highly critical of aspects of British sprinting. ""Athletics at the moment is all about international competitions and they need to show a little more pride."" ""The only time you see British sprinters getting upset or riled is when there is a debate as to which one is better than the other,"" he claimed. ""Those who aren't funded might be hungrier and more motivated because their road to success is a lot more difficult and challenging."
1350,"She knows she can dig deep if she needs to. Even if she'd lost this race, there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it. But as a test of character, it was the toughest race she's ever taken part in. A win in the New York marathon doesn't make up for the disappointment of Athens in any shape or form, but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year. And a lot of people were wondering what would happen if Paula was forced to drop out of this race, as she did in the marathon and 10,000m in Athens. She thought that if she won, people would say ""why couldn't she do that in Athens?"" And if she lost, people would say her career was over. And although two hours 23 minutes wasn't one of Paula's best times, it wasn't far off the record on a difficult course. But that was never on the cards. She might have been beaten, but she would have kept running."
1351,"""If she is found guilty she should be stripped of all her medals and banned for two years,"" said Pound. Victor Conte, of Balco Laboratories, claims the American sprinter regularly used drugs to enhance her performance. However, under International Olympic Committee (IOC) rules, athletes can only be stripped of their medals if caught within three years of the event. Pound continued: ""If she has indeed taken drugs it is going to be a big disappointment for a lot of people."""
1352,"And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. ""She just thought, 'well, they can't think any worse of me now,'"" Yelling told BBC Sport. ""She must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. And Yelling says: ""I think this will probably make Paula."" ""How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,"" argues Richards. ""She wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment."" It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs' final reserves. So physically it is possible for Paula."" ""The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in Athens,"" he said."
1353,"Gatlin, 22, won the closest 100m final in Games history with a career-best time of 9.85 seconds in Athens. Established in 1981, the Jesse Owens Awards - named in honour of the late Olympic great who won four gold medals at the 1936 Berlin Games - are presented annually to the outstanding US male and female track and field performers. ""It is one of the biggest honours in track and field and it is a great end to a great year. "" ""It is such a great honour to win the Jesse Owens Award,"" said Gatlin."
1354,"""It's a good way to end the year,"" she said. The Kenyan put in several bursts of speed to throw off Radcliffe but the Briton managed to hang in. ""I'm ready for a good rest now."" Radcliffe decided only recently to run in the race and many had doubted whether she had sufficiently recovered from her Olympic ordeal just 11 weeks ago. Just Chepkemei and Radcliffe were left in contention as the race came into the final few miles."
1355,"""We have thoroughly tested the candidates. Collins has played rugby at regional level, was captain of the Great Britain American Football team, and competed at national level in judo and karate. I believe David will make a great leader and I have great faith in what he will achieve."" Collins said: ""It's a great challenge. ""The appointment of David Collins, with his strong mix of leadership skills and managerial experience, is testament to the professional and detailed recruitment process,"" he said. Van Commenee dropped out of the selection process to take on the same role with the Dutch Olympic Committee, while Connor's application was rejected after an arduous interview process. He arrives with British athletics at a crossroads. Despite Kelly Holmes' golden double and the success of the sprint relay squad, the GB team failed to live up to expectations in Athens. Many older competitors have retired or are coming to the end of their careers, and Britain failed to win a single medal at the world junior championships in Italy this year. Foster, however, declared himself satisfied with how the appointment was made."
1356,"White failed a drugs test after winning the 100m and 200m titles at the 2003 world athletics championships. But she added: ""It was my decision to go to him, not anybody else's."" White said Conte at first told her the substance was flaxseed oil, only to change his story later. ""My whole belief about Victor is that he was selling a product,"" White said in the LA Times. At first, White claimed she took the drug to combat narcolepsy but she now takes full responsibility for her actions. ""Whether it be a good product or a bad product, he was selling a product."" ""I would say I made a mistake and I would never, ever go back."
1357,"And she set a March date for the case of the four men accused of distributing illegal performance-enhancing drugs to elite athletes to be heard. The judge said that she may conduct hearings in January into whether federal agents illegally searched the Balco headquarters and wrongfully obtained statements from the company's founder Victor Conte and its vice-president James Valente. The outcome of those hearings could result in some or all of the charges being dismissed. The two men - along with personal trainer Greg Anderson and athletics coach Remy Korchemny - were all indicted earlier this year but have pleaded their innocence. Conte said that he would be telling his side of the story on an American TV show on Friday. ""The world deserves to know the truth about performance-enhancing drugs,"" he said. The company has been accused by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) of being the source of the banned steroid THG and modafinil."
1358,"Radcliffe's comments come at a time when several American sports stars are under suspicion of steroid use. ""Doping in sport is a criminal offence and should be treated as such,"" the 30-year-old told the Sunday Times. ""Being caught in possession of a performance-enhancing drugs should carry a penalty,"" she added. ""Having been on the receiving end of accusations like this I can testify as to how much this hurts."" ""This means that often athletes do not know if they are competing on a level playing field, if their hard work and sacrifice is being trumped by an easier scientific route."
1359,"Kenteris insisted: ""The accident happened. Kenteris and fellow sprinter Katerina Thanou are set to learn if they will face criminal charges this week. Kenteris, a Greek hero after winning gold in the 200m at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, also confirmed that he was due to light the flame at the Athens opening ceremony. I went crazy when I found out I had supposedly missed a test and I wanted to rush to the Olympic village."" ""If a decision is taken to have charges filed against me, I will accept it gladly. ""A prosecution means that the case will be cleared... ""I had even rehearsed lighting the cauldron,"" he said."
1360,"Kenteris' lawyer Gregory Ioannidis told BBC Sport: ""We refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical. ""There have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials, and these procedural breaches have also violated my client's rights. ""There is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted."" The panel will also decide on the two-year ban imposed on the athletes' controversial coach Christos Tzekos by the IAAF. Kenteris, the 2000 Olympic 200m champion, and Thanou, the women's 100m silver medallist from the same Games in Sydney, quit the Olympics on 18 August after failing to give samples on the eve of the opening ceremony. An independent tribunal of the Greek Track and Field Federation will meet to decide whether to ratify the sanction. They also missed tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens before the Games. Kenteris and Thanou also face criminal charges in Greece for allegedly faking the motorcycle accident. The tribunal hearing will take place at the Hellenic Olympic Committee building. But there has been speculation that the charges could be dropped."
1361,"In an email to the Associated Press on Wednesday, Conte said: ""I stand by everything I said"". After the ABC television program earlier this month, Jones' lawyer Richard Nicholls said: ""Marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never, ever used performance-enhancing drugs. Jones files Conte lawsuit
Marion Jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against Balco boss Victor Conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs. Her lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in San Francisco, said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she ""has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs"". ""Mr Conte is simply not credible. Conte, whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation, made the claims in a US television programme. ""Victor Conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment, while Marion Jones is one of America's most decorated female athletes. We challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that Marion Jones passed."" ""If it is felt there is case to answer, it would be for its national governing body (USA Track and Field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action,"" he added. ""And I am sure, like ourselves, they will be watching the television programme with great interest."""
1362,"They have until midnight on 16 December and an IAAF spokesman said: ""We're sure their responses are on their way."" Their former coach Christos Tzekos has also been charged with distributing banned substances. All athletes must inform their national federations where they are at all times, so they can be available for out-of-competition drugs tests. Kenteris and Thanou already face a criminal trial after being charged with avoiding a drug test on the eve of the Athens Olympics and then faking a motorcyle crash. The Greek pair were charged after missing a series of routine drugs tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens. But Kenteris and Thanou then went on to skip tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago, when they decided to fly back to Greece early."
1363,"Kenteris and Thanou could be suspended for up to two years. The Greek authorities have also brought criminal charges against the sprinters for avoiding a drugs test and faking an accident. However, the IAAF will determine the sprinters' future on the track after carefully considering all the evidence. The duo withdrew from the Olympics after missing a test but claimed they had suffered a motorcycle crash. Kenteris and Thanou can appeal against any decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. But Kenteris and Thanou then went on to skip tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago, when they decided to fly back to Greece early. The IAAF sent an official warning to the sprinters and coach Tzekos after they were discovered training in Qatar rather than in Crete, where they had said they would be."
1364,"The Glasgow meeting will see Holmes compete over 1500m in a five-way match against Sweden, France, Russia and Italy. ""I am still competitive and still want to win,"" she said. ""I'm an athlete and I can't wait to get back on the track."""
1365,"Gebrselassie in London triple bid
Double Olympic 10,000m champion Haile Gebrselassie will race in the London Marathon for the next three years. ""It is a coup for us to secure Haile's presence for the next three years and it guarantees a quality race,"" said race director David Bedford. ""There are a lot of fantastic runners in the race but I shall be doing my utmost to upset them."""
1366,"""After five months we finally had the chance to give explanations. I am confident and optimistic,"" said Thanou. The Greek pair appeared at a hearing on Saturday which will determine whether their provisional bans from athletics' ruling body the IAAF should stand. ""We presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of."" Thanou, the 2000 Olympic women's 100m silver medallist, and Sydney 200m champion Kenteris were suspended by the IAAF for missing three drugs tests. They were later taken to hospital after claiming to have been involved in a motorcycle accident. ""We were asked [by the disciplinary committee] all kinds of questions about the night of 12 August,"" said Tzekos. ""We did not leave any gaps. As far as I am concerned there is no such issue [of refusing to be tested], and I am very optimistic."""
1367,"The double Olympic champion said: ""I am very disappointed that I have been forced to withdraw. ""I saw the doctor here and he has said it is not serious but it's frustrating missing Madrid when I knew I was in great shape."" Holmes has now been advised by her coach Margot Jennings not to rush back into training and it is unlikely she will compete again until the summer. ""On Saturday night I pulled my hamstring running the last bend on my final 200m of the night,"" said Holmes. ""I was going really, really well when I felt a massive spasm in my left leg and my hamstring blew."
1368,"Kluft impressed by Sotherton form
Olympic heptathlon champion Carolina Kluft was full of admiration for Britain's Kelly Sotherton as the pair prepared to clash in Birmingham. ""She looked very good early in the season and was competing really well."" Both will be in action on Friday in the 60m hurdles and long jump ahead of the European Indoor Championships later this month in Madrid."
1369,"What now for Kelly Holmes? Unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race, she will not step onto the track. Last April, Kelly Holmes spoke to the BBC Sport website about her loneliness, her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the 800m and 1500m at the Olympics. There is just one small truth which could gnaw away at Holmes' motivation - the realisation that no matter how hard she trains, nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in Athens. ""You have to have a real strong desire to carry on doing it even if you're very talented."" So, why is Holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where, when or whether to even bother competing again? ""You don't get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double Olympic champion,"" agreed Cram. The physical demands of the day-to-day grind will only get harder for Holmes, who has already admitted she ""doesn't like the training anymore."" ""I think deep down Kelly wants to run. ""She enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next."
1370,"""I've not jumped indoors before and I just wanted the qualifying mark. ""I'm starting to thrive on the pressure but if I don't perform then it's not the end of the world."" ""I had to go out and go through all the gears before the Europeans and I won't run again until then,"" said McIlroy. could not reach the European mark in the women's race as she crossed the line to win in 2:04.45. Her time of 4:19.11 was not good enough to qualify for Madrid but Ovens had already opted out of the championships. The 25-year-old set a new British record for the second time in seven days, clocking 7.96 seconds to finish ahead of rival Diane Allahgreen. In the men's 3,000m,
powered to a new personal best of seven minutes, 56.86 seconds to defend his AAAs title in style. The world 60m champion got off to a rolling start and had to dig deep to dip ahead of Mark Findlay and Darren Chin, who both set personal bests. The Trafford athlete, who has served a two-year ban after testing positive for anabolic steroids, clinched the title with a championship record 4.25m. cleared the required 1.90m to qualify for the European championships and claim the AAAs title in the women's high jump."
1371,"European medal chances improve
What have the European Indoor trials told us? But what was great about Sunday's performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted. In the men's race on Saturday, Allan Scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him. And knowing that she got the better of Diane in a head-to-head race will give Sarah confidence. I had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there. The event has moved on immensely since Janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition I think that would help her. Janine Whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a two-year drugs ban. It wasn't all good news in Sheffield. He is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency - and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further. Findlay is a Londoner who has chosen to represent Trinidad and Tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for Great Britain."
1372,"The Larne athlete dominated the race from start to finish although he had to hold off a late challenge from Welshman Jimmy Watkins in the final 100 metres. ""I had to go out and go through all the gears before the Europeans and I won't run again until then,"" said McIlroy. ''I though if I got lucky I'd get close to the British record but I blew up in the end.'' David Gillick showed that he is a genuine medal contender in the European Indoor Championships by claiming an impressive 400m victory. Gillick was more than half-a-second clear when taking gold in 46.45 - .02 outside his personal best set in Saturday's semi-finals. The Irishman is now the fastest European this season. Derval O'Rourke broke her own Irish 60m hurdles record by clocking 8.06 which left her third behind new British record holder Sarah Claxton (7.96). Meanwhile, Paul Brizzel and Anna Boyle reached the semi-finals of the 60m hurdles with Boyle setting a season's best of 7.48. Lisburn's Kelly McNeice Reid (4:31.34) was seventh in the women's 1500m while Gary Murray (8:11.22) was 11th in the men's 3000m."
1373,"Johnson edges out rival Sotherton
Jade Johnson edged out rival Kelly Sotherton with her last effort to claim the AAAs long jump title at the Norwich Union European Indoor trials. Helen Clitheroe was agonisingly close to the 9:05.00 qualifying mark as she claimed the runners-up spot in a personal best of 9:05.73. Scott, 22, smashed his personal best on the way to the final, where he broke it again to win the AAAs title in 7.58 seconds. The trio of athletes have reached the European qualifying mark this season though one of them is set to miss out on a call-up to the British squad. There was plenty of hot action in the men's 60m hurdles where Scotland's
was vying for top spot with Olympian Andy Turner. In the absence of injured British number one Carl Myerscough,
claimed the men's shot put title with a throw of 17.64m, which was below the qualifying mark. There was some consolation for Lambert as he set a personal best of 20.94 in the first round - good enough to qualify for Europe. Sale's Robert Mitchell climbed to a season's best of 2.20m - just 3cm short of the European standard - to claim the British indoor high jump title. But that mark was not good enough for the 39-year-old to book her place at next month's European Indoor Championships in Madrid. Sotherton finished fifth after producing two throws of 13.77m."
1374,"In-form James McIlroy will hope to confirm his place in the British team for Madrid by winning the 800m title. McIlroy has been in tremendous form on the European circuit in recent weeks. Meanwhile, nine-times champion Dermot Donnelly will not be coming out of retirement to compete in the Northern Ireland Cross Country Championships in Coleraine on Saturday. Carroll is ranked number three in the world 3000m ranking at the moment with Cragg occupying top spot. An injury crisis in the Annadale Striders squad led to Donnelly being entered by coach John McLaughlin but the athlete told BBC Sport on Friday evening that he would not be running."
1375,"There is only excitement at what might happen. Ceplak added: ""I like running against her - you know the race is always going to be fast. ""That is the sort of competition that I like. But the controversy has since been forgotten, with Ceplak acting as pacemaker for Holmes' failed attempt on the British Indoor 1500m record at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham in 2003. Gardener's decision means Scotland's 400m man Ian Mackie will carry British hopes in what looks sure to be a tough preparation for next weekend's Norwich Union European trials in Sheffield. She was like my idol from the beginning of my career."" She is special to me."
1376,"""I'm qualified now and that's what matters most,"" said the 28-year-old. McIlroy continues winning streak
James McIlroy stormed to his second international victory in less than a week, claiming the men's 800m at the TEAG indoor meeting in Erfurt. After three successive wins over the past fortnight, McIlroy is brimming with confidence. ""I've been waiting over six years for this to happen and now I'm certain my career has turned the corner."" McIlroy set a world-leading mark for 1,000m at the Sparkassen Cup in Stuttgart last weekend."
1377,"Radcliffe will compete in London
Paula Radcliffe will compete in the Flora London Marathon this year after deciding her schedule for 2005. ""It doesn't get any better than this for the 25th anniversary,"" said race director David Bedford. But the 31-year-old bounced back to win the New York Marathon in November. Radcliffe, however, passed up the chance to go for the ""Big City"" marathon grand slam. ""It is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion."" ""I don't pick races thinking about things like pressure. I pick the ones in my heart I really want to do."
1378,"Her decision to enter the 10,000m five days later also backfired as she again pulled out with eight laps remaining. But Radcliffe helped put her Olympic trauma behind her with a thrilling win in November's New York Marathon. The 4x100m team grabbed some last-gasp glory for the British men's Olympic squad after a poor start to the Games. The quartet held off favourites the USA to win Britain's first relay medal since 1912 in 38.07 seconds. Kelly Sotherton completed Team GB's athletics medal haul in Athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon. The Athens Olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for Steve Backley, who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin. While Holmes left Athens as the star of Team GB, it was Radcliffe who carried expectations before the August Games. Lewis, who was troubled by injury, has ruled out retiring while Sotherton is tipped to build on her success. Britain's 4x100m team took gold without the services of Dwain Chambers, who was handed a two-year ban in February after testing positive for steroid THG. Rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier."
1379,"But individually, the Birchfield Harrier has yet to build on his World Junior Championship win four years ago. It can happen, I don't see why not,"" he said. He added: ""It's a bit too early to make any predictions for Helsinki, but I have my eyes open and I know I can be the best in the world."" Lewis-Francis has still to decided what events will feature in his build-up to the worlds - with one exception."
1380,"He said: ""It's worth a punt, isn't it? She's gone back to training. ""I am inclined to think she will (compete). It could depend on how training goes and she will have to be close to top form."" Jones added: ""She was pleased with her run in Birmingham (at last weekend's Grand Prix). Kelly Sotherton has been invited by championship organisers to compete against Carolina Kluft in the pentathlon. ""She is a very good team member and is very good to have there,"" he added. Meanwhile, there is no surprises in the rest of the Great Britain team announced on Tuesday. ""The European Indoor Championships always provide a chance for the young and inexperienced to make a name for themselves and the current indoor season has produced some exciting new talent. J Crane (Sale Harriers Manchester), S Jones (Trafford AC)."
1381,"""I felt very good here but with the crowd behind you, you feel like you can do anything."" Jason Gardener's unbeaten run came to an end as he came fifth and he will need to improve if he is to defend his European title in Madrid. ""But I'm pleased and hopefully I'll get a bit better for the Europeans. ""I'm so happy and I will do my best to break the 5m barrier soon,"" the 22-year-old told BBC Sport. The Olympic champion set a new indoor personal best of 22.38 seconds - the fastest time in the world this season. fought off fellow Briton Tim Abeyie to take the men's 200m in a personal best of 20.88.
continued her outstanding start to the season, beating a strong international field, which included two-time Olympic 100m hurdles bronze medallist Melissa Morrison, to claim the women's 60m hurdles. World indoor champion, Alleyne Francique, faded badly and finished in fourth while American duo Jerry Harris and James Davis took second and third respectively. Lagat settled for silver behind El Guerrouj in Athens and was almost four seconds short of the Moroccan's world best, clocking 3:35.27 in Birmingham. Swede
showed her class in the long jump as she stole top spot from Jade Johnson with the very last jump of the competition. I really want to win a medal."""
1382,"AAAs champion Kim Wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad going to the European Championships. And if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false-start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again. She had a go but just could not hang in there. On the other hand, I think Jason Gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men's 60m in Madrid. He was blatantly playing the false-start game to his advantage, but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly. My gut feeling is that Kelly would like to run in the European Indoor Championships, but she just hasn't convinced herself she is fit enough to do so. World records aside, I thought it was a very encouraging evening's work for Kelly Holmes. Something else that probably went unnoticed was Melanie Purkiss winning the women's national 400m race in a new personal best of 52.98 seconds. But he has only just come over from the USA, so he may not be that sharp and I still think he is in great shape. But we only had half expectations for Bekele as he has been struggling this season."
1383,"""It's nothing serious,"" said his coach Peter Stanley. ""He strained a muscle in his abdomen at the Birmingham meeting but is back in full training."" Tomlinson stays focused on Europe
Long jumper Chris Tomlinson has cut his schedule to ensure he is fully fit for the European Indoor Championships. The Middlesbrough athlete jumped a season's best of 7.95m at the Birmingham Grand Prix - good enough to push world indoor champion Savante Stringfellow into second."
1384,"You'd have thought all these athletes, who have been running for most of their lives, wouldn't think it would be that bad. But the only person who was positive about my intentions was Tanni Grey Thompson, who has won the London Marathon wheelchair race six times. But I still managed to do all my marathon training. Even though it was a very busy week entertaining the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) Evaluation Commission, I actually found my running schedule easier to follow. On Wednesday, the presentations to the IOC team did not finish until the early evening, so I just managed to squeeze in a 45-minute run. Kelly Holmes, former hurdler Alan Pascoe and former sprinter Frankie Fredericks - who is now an IOC member - all wanted to know why anyone would want to run that far. Anyway, I managed to do another quick run on Saturday ahead of the final IOC presentations, before heading home for my daughter's birthday. When I was in London I did all of my runs on the treadmill, which isn't the same as exercising outdoors. We talked about the Sydney Olympics and that made the time go past more quickly. But I coped with it very well and, even though it was bitterly cold, I put in 15-and-a-half miles - only another 11 to go then."
1385,"And the Commonwealth and European silver medallist believes her lack of experience in the early part of the season has knocked her confidence. ""It's the stress,"" said Johnson. Johnson uncertain about Euro bid
Jade Johnson is undecided about whether to contest next month's European Indoor Championships in Madrid despite winning the AAAs long jump title on Saturday. ""I will have to see how I am jumping in the next competition and I'll have to have a conversation with my coach."" I am just used to training."
1386,"""It was great winning bronze but I'm wary of injuries and must concentrate on the indoor season,"" she said. Pavey focuses on indoor success
Jo Pavey will miss January's View From Great Edinburgh International Cross Country to focus on preparing for the European Indoor Championships in March. ""Because of previous injuries I don't even run up hills in training."""
1387,"""It's a very hard record to break, but I believe I've trained very well,"" said the world indoor champion, who hopes to get closer to the mark this season. My last race was the Olympic final and there was a lot of expectation. ""This was just what I needed to sharpen up and get some race fitness. Gardener cruised home ahead of Scot Nick Smith to win the invitational race at the Norwich Union International. I'm very excited about the next couple of months."" There was a setback for Jade Johnson as she suffered a recurrence of her back injury in the long jump. Italy grabbed their first victory in the men's 1500m as
kicked over the last 200 metres to hold off Britain's James Thie and France's Alexis Abraham. And the 31-year-old also missed out on a podium place in the 4x200m relay as the British quartet came in fourth, with Russia setting a new world indoor record. won the men's pole vault competition with a clearance of 5.65m, with Britain's Nick Buckfield 51cm adrift of his personal best in third. Russia won the meeting with a final total of 63 points, with Britain second on 48 and France one point behind in third."
1388,"In the women's race, Ethiopia's Tirunesh Dibaba won a battle with world cross country champion Benita Johnson to retain her title. The Kenyan, who was second when Newcastle hosted the race last year, was in front from the outset. The Morpeth Harrier led from the end of the first lap and ended Mike Skinner and Andrew Baddeley's hopes with a surge in the lasp lap. ""My training has gone so well I wasn't really worried about the opposition asI knew I was in great shape,"" said McCormick, who now hopes to earn a 1,500m place in the British team for the World Championships in Helsinki. But world 5000m champion Dibaba make a telling strike for the finishing line in the final 20 metres."
1389,"Another Great Britain international, Louise Damen, finished third as part of the contingent representing England. Glynn Tromans - the reigning UK Inter-Countries and England Cross-Country champion - came in third place as he continues his comeback from a five-month injury lay-off. Peter Riley, who secured bronze for the GB men's team at last month's European Championships, won the men's 9km race."
1390,"She then shrugged off her Portuguese rival to win in 20 minutes 38 seconds. Elsewhere, Abebe Dinkessa of Ethiopia won the Brussels IAAF cross-country race on Sunday, completing the 10,500m course in 33.22. Butler said of her success: ""I felt great throughout the race and hope this is a good beginning for a marvellous 2005 season for me."" Gelete Burka then crowned a great day for Ethiopia by claiming victory in the women's race."
1391,"Wada chairman Dick Pound said: ""I am convinced the IAAF will appeal against the decision, and we will support them. Kenteris's lawyer, Gregory Ioannidis, reacted angrily to Pound's comments. They withdrew from the Athens Games after missing a drugs test at the Olympic village on 12 August. ""But if they accept the federation's ruling we will go before the Court of Arbitration for Sport,"" he added. Kenteris, 31, and Thanou, 30, had been charged with avoiding drugs tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the Olympics."
1392,"""We were given the task of getting the snake out if its hole but we were not given any evidence to do it with,"" he said. Athletics bosses are considering its reponse to the ruling, while the athletes face a trial in a Greek court. But Sevastis said: ""It does not matter if they are found guilty at the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the current decision is reversed."" ""So how can you as a Greek with your hand on your heart try the athletes?"" he added."
1393,"IAAF will contest Greek decision
The International Association of Athletics Federations will appeal against the acquittal of Greek athletes Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou. Segas said the IAAF appeal was ""expected"" and ""understandable."" The decision in both cases will be final and binding."" ""The IAAF has not yet received the complete file of proceedings which include statements, testimonies, the closing speeches of defence counsel... and nine audio tapes. ""Now we are going to await the final result, which we cannot prejudge,"" said Segas chairman Vassilis Sevastis.

Marion Jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against Balco boss Victor Conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs. Her lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in San Francisco, said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she ""has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs"". Mr Conte's statements have been wildly contradictory. Conte, whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation, made the claims in a US television programme.

United dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances, and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half-time.

Manchester United reduced Chelsea's Premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over Manchester City. Wayne Rooney met Gary Neville's cross to the near post with a low shot, which went in via a deflection off Richard Dunne, to put United ahead. After the break, United poured forward and there was a renewed urgency about their play. Rooney was being well marshalled by Dunne - but that was all about to change. And United keeper Roy Carroll saved well from Kiki Musampa. - Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan: ""We had a great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial.

Steven Gerrard has admitted that Liverpool have little chance of winning the Champions League this season. ""We are confident we can upset Chelsea in the Carling Cup final and get to the last eight of the Champions League because, financially, it is big for the club and, personally for myself, it is very good."" And Blues boss Jose Mourinho backed Gerrard's view that Rafael Benitez's team could struggle to progress this season. ""It's big couple of months for Liverpool,"" he added. ""We're fighting for the fourth spot for the Champions League for next season but we are still involved in two cup competitions, which are very important."

1416,"And the Blues' increasingly adventurous approach saw Liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as Paulo Ferreira denied Gerrard with a last-ditch tackle. There was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the Reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute. The Blues' attacking chances were limited, and Jerzy Dudek was equal to Frank Lampard's powerfully-struck drive and Drogba's low shot. The Blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged Liverpool back. But Gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected Ferrerira's free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring Chelsea level. There was still drama as Nunez beat Cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level, but despite Liverpool's desperate attacks, Chelsea clung on to win. Riise could not have connected any better with Morientes' cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past Petr Cech. Subs Not Used: Pidgeley, Tiago.

Bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the Magpies. But the home side survived, and they should have re-taken the lead with the first meaningful attack of the second half. - Newcastle boss Graeme Souness ""We deserved the win. ""I thought it would lift us and that they might be tired after playing a lot of games, but unfortunately we were not up for the battle in the second half.

The scoring was completed by Grady just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1.

Celtic brushed aside Clyde to secure their place in the Scottish Cup semi-final, but only after a nervy and testing first half. Alan Thompson scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after Shaun Maloney had been fouled. Back at the other end, Halliwell did well to come off his line and block Bellamy's effort to lift the ball over him. The keeper misjudged a corner that Stephane Henchoz headed wide, but a similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal. Sheridan and Bellamy were involved in something of a flare-up that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee. Celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and Bellamy opened his scoring account for the club after a fine move involving Aiden McGeady, Jackie McNamara and Maloney culminated in the Welshman hammering the ball into the net. But Petrov and Juninho combined brilliantly to allow the Bulgarian to make it 3-0 on the hour mark - a quick one-two giving him the time and space to steer the ball past Halliwell from 12 yards.

BBC Sport understands Morgan is still ready and willing to invest in Liverpool, and Parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere. Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. As for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really?

The more you play together, the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like World Cup quarter-finals against Brazil. He will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance, but the public wants results. But international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing. The new Scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing Berti Vogts. If he had sent them out on Wednesday and they had been badly beaten, it would have done them no good whatsoever. England's game against Holland is a good example.

""However, the continuing speculation is doing no one any good, especially as we have several crucial games coming up. ""I think all the boys are behind Ian McCall,"" he added. ""All that matters at the present time - is us all having a total focus on the games ahead and a positive series of results being achieved."" Keeper Tony Bullock echoed McIntyre's sentiments. ""I can appreciate the rumours because I've emphasised my thoughts and ambitions to go back to Dundee United. ""The important thing now is I've come here to do a job and I'm going to try to finish it.""

Brian Kerr said: ""China have made great progress over the last few years and will provide difficult opposition.

""In Basel we did not play great football, but when you to go to these places the other teams are going to have the majority of the game. ""Automatic qualification is there.

Chelsea were now looking more like Premiership leaders and James kept out Kezman's fierce drive before Bosvelt and James combined to clear Gallas' header from Duff's corner. Shaun Wright-Phillips - watched by England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson - showed his customary trickery to burst into the right of the area and deliver a dangerous ball, which was blocked by John Terry.

""I am not in a hurry to take the wrong job, but I am ready to take the right job and I feel there is another job in me,"" he added. ""They are in a good position and I would expect them to go on and win it, which is a wonderful achievement. If he is intelligent, he will take it on board - and he is very intelligent.

Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan has praised striker Robbie Fowler for his landmark return to form. ""He can get better if we can supply him better,"" added Keegan. Fowler's double strike helped City come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at Carrow Road and Keegan sympathised with Norwich boss Nigel Worthington afterwards. And Keegan believes there is still more to come from the former England forward. ""People want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face."" ""I feel a bit for Nigel Worthington,"" he said. ""I know it is a killer blow for Norwich but I really think they have brought something to the Premiership."

""I hope he's hardening to the fact he will have big decisions to make but I hope it is to the benefit of Steven Gerrard and I hope it is worthwhile for Liverpool.""

They first won their Nationwide Division One trip to Turf Moor 0-2 four seasons ago, and then thrashed the Clarets on home soil 5-0. - Steve Cotterills' Clarets have been knocked out in the fifth round four times in the last seven years, and have made only one appearance in the sixth round in 21 years.

Some 65 years ago Bernardo Gandulla left Boca Juniors in his native Argentina and headed for Brazil. Corinthians - or the London-based company who have just entered into partnership with them - appear to have paid well above the odds for Tevez. But that world now lies buried under skyscrapers. And off the pitch he gave the press plenty to report - Atletico Madrid gave up on him after declaring his private life to be 'disorganized.' It is the most passionately supported club in Brazil. He can also say farewell to the Copa Libertadores, South America's Champions League. There will be matches in small towns on poor pitches with plenty of defenders keen to kick him all the way back to Argentina. Like so many of the top South American players, Tevez has the gift of being able to surprise - to feint right and go left, to pass when he was expected to dribble, to shoot and catch the goalkeeper unawares. But his choice of destination is the biggest surprise of all."

And the Fifa rankings see Scotland listed at an all time low of 77th, below the likes of Estonia, Ghana, Angola and Thailand. Smith's track record make impressive reading and he is widely respected within the game. But it should be remembered Vogts came to Scotland with an impressive curriculum vitae - a World Cup winner as a player and a European Championships winner as a manager. Scotland have not reached a major finals since the World Cup in 1998 and reaching Germany 2006 looks near impossible, having picked up just two points from the opening three games in the qualifying race. Characters like Souness, Ferguson and current Ibrox manager Alex McLeish all cite Smith's experience and his expansive knowledge of the Scottish game. That will certainly not be the case with Smith. And it remains to be seen if Smith will experience the rash of call-offs that blighted so much of Vogts' preparation work.

""Perhaps it was because their team had played so poorly and they wanted to divert attention towards this muddled issue,"" the paper says. Journalist Guillem Balague writes: ""In our country, where multi-culturalism is a new thing, we are in nappies dealing with these things, and have a naivety which makes the English nervous.""

1530,"One thing is certain - they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed. I've also found him to be very realistic whenever I've heard him. Mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all, the Champions League, and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players. They beat a very tough Everton at Stamford Bridge, won at Newcastle in the Carling Cup, and then won 4-1 at Fulham, which was a great result given that they had been showing good form. Mourinho plots impressive course
Chelsea's win at Fulham - confirming their position at the Premiership summit - proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season. You cannot win titles early on in the season, but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital. The buys are now integrating, and in Arjen Robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension. ""So to get a result like that in a game of 11 against 11 is disgraceful."" You think ""oh no"" - then find your worst fears confirmed. But the return of Campbell is key."

Hearts of Oak set up an all Ghanaian Confederation Cup final with a 3-2 win over Cameroon's Cotonsport Garoua in Accra on Sunday. Hearts looked set for a comfortable win but Cotonsport staged a late fight back scoring twice late on. But it was too little too late for the Cameroonians and Hearts held on to win the game and a place in the final. In the other Group B game Cameroon's Sable Batie took the lead in the 35th minute through Kemadjou before Santos equalised on the hour mark thanks to Thokozani Xaba . Ruben Cloete scored the South African sides consolation with just three minutes left on the clock."

1533,"Lennon concedes Rangers are in good form at the moment, but they have failed to beat Celtic in their last seven meetings. ""But it's a game we believe we're capable of winning if we play our best,"" he told the Evening Times. ""At the minute, we are at the top of the league and still in with a chance of staying in Europe, so I don't think it is the crisis people have been trying to make out. ""Considering we lost Henrik Larsson at the end of last season, we have still been scoring a lot of goals, which is pleasing."""

Middlesbrough boss Steve McClaren has praised the way his side have got to grips with European football after the 2-0 Uefa Cup win against Lazio. For the team to give the fans a performance like that was the icing on the cake. ""There have been many good performances but this was something special. ""We can also score goals, and again that is something you can see from the performances we have had, so we have good balance. ""It should have been more convincing,"" said McClaren. ""But I had watched Lazio in recent weeks and I saw them score a late equaliser against Inter Milan on Saturday so I knew we needed a second goal. McClaren's only criticism of his side was that their dominance should have been resulted in more goals. ""I think we played quite well and it was a very good game, especially in the first half."""
1535,"Jorge Andrade's early own goal gave Liverpool a 1-0 win. It is a very important win for us and we could have scored more goals. ""We were very good defensively and also good on the counter attack. We are pleased but move on to the next game."" Deportivo coach Javier Irureta said: ""Liverpool played very well and we just could not break them down. ""I want to see us win away matches in the Champions League, that it was in Spain was not my first consideration. ""But in the end because of the way that (Dietmar) Hamann and (Igor) Biscan performed, we did not need to change things until right at the end of the match. ""It is important to have all the players ready and a good squad so you can play more games at a high level."" ""But this time we did not play well and we lacked imagination. Players who usually want the ball at that stage did not want it."

1538,The club have confirmed that the former England coach will be unveiled as the successor to Dave Jones at a news conference at Molineux at 1100 GMT. His spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the 1998 World Cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in a newspaper interview. He engineered an upturn in Saints' fortunes before being lured to White Hart Lane by Tottenham - the club where he made his name as a player. Since then he has applied unsuccessfully for the post of France manager and had also been linked with a return to Southampton. That relationship turned sour at the start of the last campaign and he left the London club early last season.
1539,"I don't do that. I think he's a great keeper, as is Almunia. ""If you look at my career, you will see that I have left many big players out for a long time. It's just that I don't want to make this story bigger than it is."" Meanwhile, Thierry Henry believes he will be blamed if Arsenal fail to qualify for the next stage of the Champions League. We want to carry on in this competition. Campbell said: ""It means a lot to me to go through, it's everything. It's a usual situation for me. ""It puts a lot of pressure on them but it's a good learning process,"" said Wenger. ""If the team don't win I know I will be criticised, no matter how I play."""

He has been working for Uefa, covering the Premiership for French television and also coaching in Brazil with national coach Carlos Alberto Perreira. Houllier has been impressed with the quality in the Premiership after watching as a pundit - particularly with Jose Mourinho's work at leaders Chelsea. But Houllier told BBC Sport: ""In private and in public, I have stressed I believe Rafa is doing a good job. ""I have been involved in football since leaving Liverpool and my batteries are recharged."" ""It has been interesting to watch games from a different perspective and I have learned things. It is entertaining, goals are scored and teams are always trying to win. It is a very good product."""
1541,"McClaren also praised winger Stewart Downing and strikers Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Mark Viduka, who both ended barren runs in front of goal. After their 3-2 win over Manchester City, McClaren said: ""We are playing exciting football, it's a magnificent result to keep us in the top five. ""And the strikers scored great goals, the combination play between them shows they want to play with each other and they are trying."""
1542,"O'Leary has been in talks over a new deal and he said: ""I had a message from Thomas' agent asking me what the news was on myself. ""He wants to find out before he goes into discussions over Thomas. ""The reason Thomas is not speaking to the club is because the agent wants to see the outcome of what happens to me."" Hitzlsperger's current deal expires in the summer and he has been offered a new deal by the Midlands club."
1543,"But an FA spokesman told BBC Sport: ""We are not taking action over Mourinho. Mourinho intimated that United boss Sir Alex Ferguson influenced referee Neale Barry after the duo walked down the tunnel together at half-time. What I saw and felt made it easier to understand a few things. ""But I know the referee did not walk to the dressing rooms alone at half-time. It was fault after fault, dive after dive. He should only have had his two assistants and the fourth official with him, but there was also someone else."" ""I see one referee in the first half and another in the second,"" said Mourinho. ""We are confident of getting a result but we know what Manchester United is, a footballing power. That is the end of it."" For the second leg we have an experienced referee, and we should be talking about the quality of that game rather than the refereeing."

""Stuart Gray has done a fantastic job as caretaker manager. Gray, who has been caretaker manager, was assistant boss when Hoddle was manager at Southampton. ""I saw the massive potential that Wolves have got and their desire and amibition to get back into the Premiership parallels my ambitions. ""We hope it will work out for both parties and we extend it for the long term,"" he said. ""Five weeks later we're back on track and this a tremendous opportunity for Wolves."" The ex-England coach has been given a six-month contract to succeed Dave Jones, who was sacked after the club's poor start to the season.

""I said to Harry 'I hope you don't go to Southampton', and he told me 'absolutely not',"" he said. Redknapp's first game in charge will be at home to Middlesbrough on Saturday. Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe was desperate to give former academy director Wigley, who replaced Paul Sturrock just two games into the season, every chance to succeed at St Mary's. But results under Wigley have been poor and Southampton are deep in trouble near the foot of the table."
1546,"During the match at Millwall's new Den Stadium, seats were ripped up and four people were ejected from the ground. A disabled fan was injured at the perimeter of the pitch and riot police were needed to control the situation. But Lions chairman Theo Paphitis has denied the claims. Liverpool have been charged with one breach for failing to prevent their fans conducting themselves in threatening and/or violent and/or provocative behaviour. Both clubs have until 23 December to respond."
1547,"It's a disgrace, but I don't expect Wenger to ever apologise, he's that type of person."" ""To not apologise for the behaviour of the players to another manager is unthinkable. Those allegations were put to Wenger after Saturday's game at Bolton, which Arsenal lost to slip 10 points behind Chelsea in the title race. ""In the tunnel Wenger was criticising my players, calling them cheats, so I told him to leave them alone and behave himself,"" Ferguson said on Saturday. Meanwhile, the League Managers Association have offered to act as peacemakers in the hope of resolving the on-going row. But Ferguson added: ""In the ensuing weeks all you got was a diatribe from Arsenal about being kicked off the pitch and all that nonsense. But in England you are only punished for what you say after the game. ""He does what he likes in England anyway. I don't go into that game.

The Reds beat Olympiakos 3-1 with a late Steven Gerrard strike and Benitez said: ""It was a really great night. Benitez hailed Gerrard for his match-winning strike four minutes from time and also the Anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval. ""I felt that the difference between the sides was really our supporters, I cannot thank them enough. It was a massive night for me and the team."""

1550,"Ferguson admitted his side were well-beaten by the Turks, a result which meant they finished second in Group D behind Lyon. He added: ""They'll know not to play like that again. We showed a lack of strength. ""But we didn't do that, so the game just petered out for us. All we can do is let fate decide how it works out."" But I have no complaints about the scoreline.

1552,"Man Utd through after Exeter test
Manchester United avoided an FA Cup upset by edging past Exeter City in their third round replay. United wasted a host of chances to make it safe as Jones made some great saves, but Wayne Rooney put the tie beyond doubt late on with a cool finish. United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was taking few chances after their 0-0 draw in the first game and he handed starts to Paul Scholes and Ryan as well as Ronaldo and Rooney. The visitors' pressure by now was incessant and Rooney had another shot blocked while Ronaldo slammed well over the bar again from a good position. Moments later Devine had the chance to make himself a hero, but he could only volley Jeannin's brilliant cross wide of Howard's goal after being left unmarked six yards out. The persistent Rooney eventually rounded Jones with three minutes to go and slotted into an empty net to book a home tie with Middlesbrough in the fourth round. Ampadu, Clay.

And he would not be drawn on whether Lehmann would return for the top-of-the table clash with Chelsea on Sunday. But Wenger said earlier this week that his indifferent form was down to pressure caused by being under scrutiny from the media. ""The debate has gone on too long. Everyone has an opinion and I do not have to add to it,"" Wenger added."

""The main point I have made is I want to be in a Liverpool side which challenges for the Champions League and the title all the time,"" he said afterwards. ""We firmly believe that if we can satisfy his ambition he will remain a Liverpool player. I think he likes and wants the responsibility of leading this team.""

Arsenal ended the match the stronger and worked a excellent chance for Henry who put a left-foot shot high from eight yards.

Newcastle boss Graeme Souness is said to have been impressed enough by Dunne's turnaround in form to be ready to make a bid for the big stopper in the January transfer window.

""We will meet with the player's representative to finalise the contract and decide when he will sign,"" said Atletico sporting director Toni Munoz. He added: ""I'm not going to say the decision to let him go is down to the fans' reaction towards him. ""He has had a tough time since the summer with the loss of his mother and finding it difficult to adjust to a new club and a different area. But we'd like to get back most of what we spent."""
1578,"""If there is an attractive propostition it could be I would be keen to leave,"" admitted the 28-year-old Morientes. The Real Madrid striker has been linked with a move to Anfield since the summer and is currently behind Raul, Ronaldo and Michael Owen at the Bernabeu.

Hearts manager John Robertson hopes a place in the knock-out stages of the Uefa Cup could help keep some of his out-of-contract players at the club. If we get through and have another European tie it may encourage players to stay at least until the end of the season,"" he said. ""It's very much the player's prerogative but the fact that we've been playing European football for the last three or four years is obviously an incentive,"" added Robertson. ""But we want players who want to play for the football club, who are committed and a run in Europe always helps a little bit."" ""The pitch is not in the greatest condition. ""There will be a good atmosphere and the Hearts fans have an important role to play. That's the most important thing."""
1580,"In the first half he blasted wide when clear, and his control let him down in the second half when well placed. Campbell rescues Arsenal
Sol Campbell proved to be an unlikely match-winner to earn Arsenal a hard-fought win at Portsmouth. But their marking was slack at a corner and Patrick Vieira should have done better when the ball fell to him 16 yards out. Ashdown caused hearts to flutter on 28 minutes when he missed his punch at a corner and Kolo Toure headed just wide and, as Arsenal began to press, Van Persie blasted over a good opportunity after Henry had set him up. After playing second fiddle, Portsmouth should have taken the lead on 34 minutes. The England defender needed little invitation as Pompey backed off to stride forward and lash a ferocious shot past Ashdown. But it needed alert reflexes and safe handling from Ashdown to cling on to Van Persie's shot as Henry sniffed for scraps. Subs not used: Lehmann, Fabregas, Senderos, Hoyte.

Former Southampton manager Gordon Strachan has rejected the chance to become Portsmouth's new boss. The Scot was Pompey chairman Milan Mandaric's first choice to replace Harry Redknapp, who left Fratton Park for rivals Saints earlier in December. ""Everything's right - it's 10 minutes away, there are good players there, a good set-up, a good atmosphere at the ground.

Birmingham have confirmed Blackburn made a bid for Robbie Savage - but managing director Karen Brady has called it ""derisory"". They've got into Robbie's head. She added: ""The way things are going all this could affect the relationship between the clubs. Rovers have reportedly offered £500,000 up front for the Wales star, 30, with the fee rising to £2.2m. ""I haven't created the speculation myself, I haven't phoned every national newspaper saying, 'Blackburn are trying to buy me'.

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has reiterated his desire to stay at Anfield and win trophies with the club. He raised doubts about his Reds future when he said he wanted the club to prove they were title challengers in the very near future or he might leave. He said: ""I'm signed here for this season and another two so there is no situation. ""I then said to him 'Look, if you want to win titles, you want medals and you want Liverpool to have these things then I am going to need your help'. ""As club captain all I want to do is help us get back up the table and into the Champions League again."" Morientes, 28, has already expressed a willingness to come to England. He scores goals in the league, in cup competitions and also in the Champions League. ""He'd have Spanish coaches, a Spanish manager and we have got three or four Spanish players here now so they'll help him settle in."
1587,"""I am not interested in being a coach but I would like to have football schools,"" the England captain said on television station Canal Plus. I'm going to open one in London and one in LA.

""My second passion is charity work - I am an ambassador for Unicef and it gives me great pride."" Beckham admitted: ""It's disappointing and frustrating to see the results, considering the team we have."

Sanchez is bullish about his hopes of prising Juninho from the Scottish champions, although Hassell believes Mexico would not be his preferred destination. ""The onus is on Juninho to force his way into the team,"" he said. Juninho deserves respect. ""He wants to play for Martin O'Neill, but does Martin O'Neill want to play him?

Cheslea salvaged a win against a battling Portsmouth side just as it looked like the Premiership leaders would have to settle for a point. But, just like against Arsenal, Portsmouth let in a late goal when Robben's shot took a deflection off Matthew Taylor on its way past a wrong-footed Hislop. Drogba spun to get a sight of goal and struck a fierce shot which rocked keeper Hislop back as he blocked before Arjan de Zeeuw cleared the danger. The home side were also left breathing a sigh of relief when a Glen Johnson header fell to Gudjohnsen who had his back to goal in a crowded Pompey goalmouth.

1592,"Mourinho takes swipe at Arsenal
Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has attempted to pile the pressure on title rivals Arsenal ahead of the Gunners facing Newcastle on Wednesday. Perhaps it's something to do with the television schedule. He added: ""We have had to play two matches in three days which is foreign to many of my players and, although I understand the traditions of football here at this time of year, it is not good for your health to do it. ""Playing so many games is certainly not healthy, especially for teams who still have European commitment."""
1593,"Arsenal go into the game on the back of a 2-0 victory over Fulham on Sunday. And Wenger added: ""The best way to prepare for a game is to win the previous one. ""We are playing as a team and that is important because there were some games when we maybe were not there as a team and suffered for that. ""We do not play a season with 11 players and I believe that all of our squad deserve a chance in the team."" Those were games we lost.""

Manchester United's Alex Ferguson has praised his players' gutsy performance in the 1-0 win at Aston Villa. ""We showed lots of character and guts and we weren't going to lose. ""I look at that fixture and think we've been there and won, while Arsenal and Chelsea have yet to come and Villa may have some players back when they do."" ""Giggs was a tremendous threat and he brings tremendous penetration."
1595,"He said: ""My reaction on the pitch was to celebrate. ""It was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - I've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson sympathised with Tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology. What can you do but laugh about it? ""It's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal."" It's a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn't count. ""When the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at Old Trafford, that just reinforces what I feel - there should be video evidence,"" said Wenger. ""But I read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on. ""I think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. I think that would be an opening into a new area of football."""
1596,"Andy Robinson said he would ""keep working on the kicking"" with his squad. Hodgson failed to convert three penalties and also missed a relatively easy drop goal attempt which would have given England a late win. ""We took the ball into contact, and you know when you do that it is a lottery whether the referee is going to give the penalty to your side or the other side. ""We controlled the game in the first half but we knew that they would come out and try everything after half-time,"" he said. ""We went out to play and played some very good rugby and what have France done?"" he said. There is a fine line between winning and losing, and for the second week we've been on the wrong side of that line and it hurts."" ""They won the game from kicking penalties from our 10m line. They took their chances when they came. ""It's very disappointing."

Vickery has broken the radius, a large bone in his forearm. Vickery out of Six Nations
England tight-head prop Phil Vickery has been ruled out of the rest of the 2005 RBS Six Nations after breaking a bone in his right forearm. Vickery was injured as his club side, Gloucester, beat Bath 17-16 in the West country derby on Saturday. Bath prop Matt Stevens is the only remaining tight-head in England's training squad and could be involved against Ireland. But he has to play second fiddle at club level to Duncan Bell, who excelled for England A against France and may now be called into the squad.

When you miss some it's very hard mentally, but it went well for us,"" he said. ""We know we have to play better to defend the title,"" he said. France were 17-6 down at half-time, but Pelous said: ""No-one was down at half-time, we were still confident.

1601,"""I think Mark Cueto scored a perfectly legal try and I think he should have gone to the video referee on Josh Lewsey,"" said Robinson. ""I am still trying to work out the Cueto try. South African referee Jonathan Kaplan ruled that Cueto was ahead of Charlie Hodgson when the fly-half hoisted his cross-field kick for the Sale wing to gather. I am very proud of my players and, with a couple of decisions, this could have been a very famous victory. It is there, and it should be used. ""We've got to go back to technology. I have looked at both, and they both looked tries. They defended magnificently and they've got every chance of winning this Six Nations."" ""We are upset now, but the referee is in charge and he has called it his way and we have got to be able to cope with that. Given the pressure we were under, credit must go to all the players."

Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll, who scored his side's only try, said: ""We are delighted, we felt if we performed well then we would win but with England also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter. ""We just had to stick to our defensive pattern, trust ourselves and trust those around us. O'Driscoll also insisted Ireland were happy to handle the pressure of being considered favourites to win the Six Nations title. All round it was fantastic."" ""Andy was sitting two yards from me and I couldn't see whether he was offside or not so I don't know how Andy could have known,"" said O'Sullivan. ""We did get the bounce of the ball and some days that happens and you've just got to jump on the back of it.""

Thomas was replaced at half-time by Williams as his side turned around a 15-6 deficit in Paris. ""It was a great game and a magnificent result for Wales,"" Bennett told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme. He has been vice-captain all along throughout the championship."" ""The way this young team are blending, the glory days are on their way back. ""Had they been ruthless, Wales could have gone into the interval 30 points down. But they didn't take their chances.

Newcastle had a couple of chances at the start of the second half with line-outs in the corner. The Falcons were 22-6 down at the break before Tait, recently axed by England after just one Six Nations outing, inspired his side to a 27-22 lead. The former All Black broke clear and popped the ball up for Tait on halfway. He chipped ahead for Michael Stephenson to scorch through for the try, which Walder converted to give Newcastle a lifeline.

Wales hooker Mefin Davies is likely to stay with English side Gloucester despite reported interest from the Neath-Swansea Ospreys. But the hooker has proved his worth to the Zurich Premiership side and is likely to get a new deal next season. ""The WRU didn't give me any help off the field, it was very disappointing,"" Davies said at the time. ""It was a hard time throughout the summer, then deciding whether to accept an offer from Stade Francais which would have ended my Wales career."""

Tait, given little opportunity to shine in attack, received praise from Robinson afterwards, even if the coach admitted Cardiff was an ""unforgiving place"" for the teenage prodigy. Robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line, after just one outing, a player he regards as central to England's future. ""I want more of that definitely,"" he said. ""Hopefully I can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we'll have to look at the video and wait and see. The Bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against France, with either Tait or Noon dropping out. ""We were playing on our own 22 for a lot of the first half so it was quite difficult. I thought we defended reasonably well but we've just got to pick it up for France."" Olly Barkley immediately allowed England to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant Tait just before the hour."
1612,"England coach Andy Robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced Sale Sharks prop Andrew Sheridan into his front row. Bell, 30, had set his sights on an international career with Wales. But Sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped Bell - who was among the tryscorers when England A beat France A 30-20 nine days ago - to be drafted in. Uncapped fly-half Andy Goode has been named in a 30-man training squad for the Ireland game, and he strengthened his selection claims by kicking 28 points during Leicester's record 83-10 win against Newcastle on Sunday. Despite Barkley's three missed penalties in the 18-17 defeat against France, he is expected to retain his place at inside centre, although Leicester's in-form prospect Ollie Smith would be an obvious replacement. England's players are due to meet at their Surrey training base on Monday."

Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan heaped praise on Italy after seeing his side stutter to a 28-17 victory in Rome. ""We had our first attack in the Italian half after 22 minutes,"" said O'Sullivan. ""Italy played really well. ""They had a lot of ball in the first half but we got a few scores when we got into their 22."" They always give us a tough game here and they showed a lot of spirit."
1614,"The hosts cut the gap to 18-12 with 10 minutes left and nearly scored through Ludovico Nitoglia, but Denis Hickie's try ensured an Irish victory. When they finally did, just before the half-hour mark, O'Driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for Murphy. Roland de Marigny took over the kicking duties for Italy from the hapless Orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge Italy into a 9-8 lead. An O'Gara penalty put Ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when Hickie latched onto an inside pass from Murphy and crossed for a converted try. Shane Horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and Stringer scooted over, with O'Gara landing the tricky conversion. The only Ireland player offering a real threat was O'Driscoll, and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors. Winger Nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and Italy nearly rumbled over from a driving maul. O'Driscoll limped off late on, joining centre partner Gordon D'Arcy on the sidelines, and the final word went to Italy.

It was out of my range and obviously Gavin is phenomenal when it comes to distance. He had a superb game."" ""There were no questions that he'd miss it the way he was playing. ""I knew the percentages of Gavin reaching it were far higher than me,"" Jones said. ""We have got to be professional and keep focused on facing Italy."" The confident 23-year-old is undaunted by the prospect of dealing with such weighty expectations however. But they now face three away fixtures in Italy, France and Scotland before completing their campaign against Ireland in Cardiff. ""But we are not there yet.

Wales centre Sonny Parker and number eight Ryan Jones will miss Saturday's game with Italy because of injury. ""Our first aim was to get Gavin settled into the team, but giving him the kicks is something we'll talk about in selection this week,"" Wales coach Mike Ruddock told BBC Sport Wales. ""I thrive on it and think it makes me perform better,"" he said. ""I'm glad it's a short week before the Italy game. There was so much build-up before England, but we fly out to Rome on Thursday and we'll be back playing again."""

Italy coach John Kirwan has challenged his side to match the performance they produced in pushing Ireland close when they meet Wales on Saturday. ""Our goal is to match every side we face and against Ireland we showed we could do that,"" said Kirwan. ""Orquera's kicking was off but he showed great courage in defence. ""But the most important thing is that we build on that performance when we play Wales on Saturday."" ""He also followed the game plan."

The trio have been called up after Pieter de Villiers, Ludovic Valbon and Aurelien Rougerie all picked up injuries in France's 16-9 win on Saturday. Laporte said he was confident that Betsen would be cleared by the panel investigating his alleged trip that broke Wasps centre Stuart Abbott's leg. ""We missed Serge badly against Scotland.

In the forthcoming games, Ruddock may use penalty hero Gavin Henson as his first-choice kicker in place of Stephen Jones. ""The boy himself should look at his actions, it was a clumsy piece of footwork,"" he said. The player himself and his captain Jason Robinson have both said that the clash with Peel was accidental. ""He's a great player and I don't want to knock him, we won't be calling for the match commissioner to review the incident. ""Our first aim was to get Gavin settled into the team, but it's something we'll talk about in selection this week,"" said Ruddock. ""I'm not saying it's deliberate, but Grewcock did a similar thing for Bath against Leinster."" ""I'm not going to go too far with the lad. It could just be a clumsy action and Dwayne had just a minor cut."
1620,"He's very confident. You just had to listen to his interview afterwards - he beamed with confidence - but although there's an element of arrogance it's good arrogance. And that's without even mentioning his majestic match-winning penalty. The star of Ireland's win over Italy in Rome looks like a certainty to make the starting XV against New Zealand. But I think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test. He gave good direction, he was very confident and he was a nice general for his side. One player who didn't impress me was Wales scrum-half Dwayne Peel. With Jonny Wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number 10 shirt could be up for grabs and Jones, or maybe even Henson, could make the Lions team at fly-half. Paul O'Connell just needs to add a hard edge to his game and Malcolm O'Kelly keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up, while Shane Byrne seems to be a lively character. Some of the Wales forwards surprised me because I thought they would be out-muscled in the tight five."
1621,"Murphy: That was a bruising battle
That's what I call a tough game. I'm not too bad, but there are one or two others who will be feeling it a bit on Monday morning. It was very physical and fair play to the Italians they made us work very hard for our victory. It was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it. But we managed to get the ball in our hands and I got a try near the end of the first half. Eddie (O'Sullivan) was very calm at half-time even though we were only 8-6 ahead. It was great work by Brian and I always knew I had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee. It is by far the strongest Italian team that we have faced. It's a big ask after such a bruising encounter. In the meantime, when in Rome ... ."
1622,"Kevin Morgan takes over from his injured Newport-Gwent Dragons colleague Hal Luscombe on the right wing. And in the pack Neath-Swansea Ospreys forward Ryan Jones is preferred at blindside flanker to Jonathan Thomas. Wales make two changes for France
Wales coach Mike Ruddock has made two changes from the team that beat Italy 38-8 for Saturday's trip to France. However, the experienced and in-form Morgan was already pushing hard for a start at Stade de France. ""For this particular game, we felt we might not always be afforded the open spaces out wide we were able to exploit against Italy, so an extra big ball-carrier in the back-row is thought to be necessary on this occasion. ""Due to his impressive performances from the bench, Kevin was very much in the selection mix anyway, and the unfortunate injury to Hal gives him the chance to start,"" said Ruddock. ""Obviously, it's a 22-man game these days, and there is every chance that Jonathan will be making an impact from the bench."" Replacements: R McBryde (Llanelli), J Yapp (Cardiff), J Thomas (Neath-Swansea), R Sowden-Taylor (Cardiff), G Cooper (Newport-Gwent), C Sweeney Newport-Gwent), R Williams (Cardiff)."
1623,"A third try from wing Denis Hickie and third penalty from Ronan O'Gara, who kicked 13 points, extended the lead. Ireland surge past Scots
Ireland maintained their Six Nations Grand Slam ambitions with an impressive victory over Scotland at Murrayfield. Scotland suffered a further blow on the resumption when Ireland flanker Johnny O'Connor won another vital turnover, and O'Gara's basketball pass sent Hickie over in the left corner. The home side started with tremendous intensity and dominated territory and possession in the opening 10 minutes. But Ireland still delivered a hammer blow to Scotland's hopes just before the interval. Ireland got themselves on the scoreboard with an O'Gara penalty and by the 24th minute the visitors were ahead. O'Connell - skipper in the absence of Brian O'Driscoll - powered through Parks' weak tackle after a free-kick from a scrummage to burrow over. Scotland looked bereft of ideas but a half-break from Paterson sparked them back to life just before the hour. R Russell, B Douglas, N Hines, J Dunbar, M Blair, G Ross, B Hinshelwood.

1624,"Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Wales win in Rome
Wales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. Wales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. With Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. G Thomas (capt); H Luscombe, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; J Thomas, M Williams, M Owen. Andrew Cole (Australia)."
1625,"White is also impressed with the Welsh pack's strength in depth. White prepared for battle
Tough-scrummaging prop Julian White is expecting a resurgent Wales to give him a rough ride in England's Six Nations opener in Cardiff on Saturday. ""But my form is helped by the people I play with at Leicester - people like Martin Johnson and Graham Rowntree. ""I don't know how much experience a tight-head can give a centre but you are there to give them a pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way,"" he added. ""I am pleased with my form,"" he said. But he knows Wales will put his technique under immense scrutiny. Injuries have taken their toll and coach Andy Robinson has been deprived of Richard Hill, Jonny Wilkinson, Martin Corry, Mike Tindall, Will Greenwood and Stuart Abbott. ""I am delighted with the way things have gone but we have to get it right this weekend."" ""This is probably the most even Six Nations for a long time. ""To go down there and hear the shouting and the singing - it's one of my favourite places to play."
1626,"A pair of classic outside breaks from the Ireland captain set up tries for Geordan Murphy and Peter Stringer. O'Driscoll saves Irish blushes
Two moments of magic from Brian O'Driscoll guided Ireland to a workmanlike victory against Italy. When they finally did, just before the half-hour mark, O'Driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for Murphy. Roland de Marigny took over the kicking duties for Italy from the hapless Orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge Italy into a 9-8 lead. O'Gara missed the twice-taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again. An O'Gara penalty put Ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when Hickie latched onto an inside pass from Murphy and crossed for a converted try. Shane Horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and Stringer scooted over, with O'Gara landing the tricky conversion. O'Driscoll limped off late on, joining centre partner Gordon D'Arcy on the sidelines, and the final word went to Italy.

England centre Olly Barkley has been passed fit for Sunday's Six Nations clash with Ireland at Lansdowne Road. With Vickery sidelined for at least six weeks and Julian White out with a neck injury, Bell could make his England debut. ""I thought I'd burned all my bridges with England when I expressed an interest in wanting to play for Wales, so it's fantastic to get this opportunity,"" he said. Bell, who featured in the England A side which beat France 30-20 10 days ago, added: ""I recognise that I got into the England A squad because of injuries. ""And it's the same again in getting into the senior squad. But now that I have this opportunity I intend to take it fully if selected and play my heart out for my country."""
1628,"""I'm sure the guys would want to come back to get some game time,"" Forster told BBC Wales Sport. Ruddock says the players will benefit from the rest, and their absence will give youngsters a chance to impress. ""Once we're in the Six Nations, the players will only be released in his and the WRU's best interests."" ""It would also be a timely reminder to Mike [Ruddock] as to what they can do. French and English clubs have requested to have all their international players available which means Stephen Jones, Gareth Thomas and Mefin Davies will play this weekend. ""We've got to look at it at another angle and see the opportunities that are provided for the younger players in the region. ""For example, the Dragons might use James Ireland this weekend. I've been looking at the lad - he's a great prospect for the future."""
1629,"The match will be the first Heineken Cup fixture to be played in Spain, and is expected to attract the biggest-ever attendance for a rugby match in the country.

""We hope we will be rewarded as a huge crowd behaving in the best rugby tradition."""
1630,"But he rejected the comparison made in some media sources with Berti Vogts, recently sacked as Scotland football manager after a poor run of results. Williams has yet to experience an RBS Six Nations victory after seven attempts and Scotland have lost 12 of their 14 games under his leadership. ""That is not beyond the realms of possibility,"" he admitted. he asked. ""We could have won in Paris but for the last five minutes and now we have two defeats, but we were confident for those two first games and we are confident we can beat Italy too."" It is so absurd that it borders on the humorous."" ""It is a bizarre analogy. ""It helps the team grow and helps you grow as a coach."

Stade de France, Paris
Saturday, 26 February
1600 GMT
BBC1, Radio 4 LW and this website
France may have beaten Scotland and England but they were tedious and uninspired throughout both matches. Wales, on the other hand, have played some fine rugby and have made their best start since they last won the title in 1994. Kevin Morgan takes over from his injured Newport-Gwent Dragons colleague Hal Luscombe on the right wing. ""Graham Henry (former Wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should 'be bold' when going to France, and he was proved right,"" said Ruddock. Wales coach Mike Ruddock is determined that his team will not go into their shells after their promising start to the championship. Despite their stuttering displays in their first two games defending champions France are also unbeaten. ""That is a great way to approach the game, and something we will further endorse with the players this week."" ""I get the impression we are getting better,"" he said. G Thomas (capt); K Morgan, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; R Jones, M Williams, M Owen."
1633,"Brennan, who last played for Ireland against Samoa in 2001, is held in high esteem by the former England coach. ""If you speak to the players there's a huge amount of respect for the guy,"" Woodward told the Sunday Independent. ""Players tend to know better than most coaches. Brennan is highly-rated at Stade Toulousain, where he is used anywhere in the back five. It's not just the Irish, but Welsh and English players as well."""
1634,"""If the defeat against Wales has taught us anything, it's that at this level we can't make any mistakes,"" Kirwan said. And the pressure is on Scotland coach Matt Williams as he seeks a first Six Nations victory at the eighth attempt. ""We have to be aggressive for 80 minutes, keep calm in every situation and display great maturity on the pitch. Kirwan has recalled the experienced Cristian Stoica at centre and drafted in David dal Maso at open-side after star flanker Mauro Bergamasco was ruled out for the rest of the tournament. Taylor's recovery from a serious knee injury is a major boost to Scottish hopes. ""It will be fundamental to keep cool in the difficult moments - in the key situations of the game."" ""He is one of the world-class players in the tournament and you want them in your team,"" acknowledged Williams. ""I actually really enjoy seeing how you cope with such pressure as a coach,"" he said, optimistic despite opening defeats to France and Ireland. R Russell, B Douglas, N Hines, J Dunbar, M Blair, G Ross, B Hinshelwood."
1635,"""The knowledge that the England game was coming up really helped during rehabilitation,"" he said. ""They will target a victory in Dublin as the turning point in their Six Nations."" If England slump in Dublin, it will be their worst run of results in the Championship since 1987. The differences between the sides is also highlighted in the team selections for the Dublin encounter. As well as entering the tournament without players like Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall and Richard Hill, England have now lost two tighthead props in Julian White and Phil Vickery while blind-side flanker Lewis Moody is a major concern. ""We have had a good week's training and we are all looking forward to the challenge. I know if we get our game right we will win the games."" ""There is no lack of confidence in the team,"" said the Sale full-back. ""I still believe in this team.

Raphael Ibanez is named at hooker for Saracens in one of four changes. - Friday's game at Headingley got the go-ahead on Friday after passing an early pitch inspection. Leeds: Balshaw; Rees, Christophers, Bell, Doherty; McMullen, Dickens; McGee, Rawlinson, Gerber; Murphy, Palmer (capt), Morgan, Parks, Popham."
1637,"In contrast, Sale are missing 14 players due to a combination of international call-ups and injuries. John Payne and Chris Rhys Jones come into the centres while scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth looks set to play on the wing. Hanley; Mayor, Payne, Rhys Jones, Wigglesworth; Hercus, Redpath (capt); Turner, Roddam, Stewart; Day, Schofield; Caillet, Carter, Chabal."
1638,"Robinson said: ""We are certainly not on the decline. You lose one game and it doesn't make you a bad team. ""I have no doubt in the players we've got. Robinson also had words of comfort for 18-year-old Newcastle centre Mathew Tait, who made his international debut against Wales but has been demoted from the squad to face France. ""But if we can under-perform and lose by only two points then I am sure if we play well this week we will get the win we need. ""I have had a word with Mathew,"" said Robinson. We have still got the team to go out and beat anyone on our day."" ""I still believe in him. He is an outstanding player but we have gone for Olly (Barkley) because of the kicking."
1639,"Sella wants Michalak recall
Former France centre Philippe Sella believes coach Bernard Laporte must recall Frederic Michalak to give his side any chance of beating Ireland. ""Ok, the flair may not have been so good, but the discipline, organisation and defence was there, which are all important ahead of 2007."" With Michalak overlooked, the French stuttered to narrow wins over Scotland and then England before ironically playing their best rugby in the defeat to Wales. But Sella added: ""People forget that France can still win the Six Nations and they'll be focused on that. ""It's difficult, though, when you change a team and you change your tactics as everything has to gel. ""The Wales game was amazing to watch but never did I think the French could lose that game at half-time,"" said Sella. The French get better every game. ""But he has the players and the talent to take them all the way to World Cup victory. ""Winning is all that matters,"" he added. It's going to be tough."""
1640,"They're awesome. O'Driscoll is among a host of players in the Northern Hemisphere squad, coached by Woodward, that are tipped for Lions call-ups.

""It'll be good for us to get an early idea of some of these guys, although a lot can change between now and June,"" Umaga said. ""Thankfully I didn't know anyone that was involved in the tragedy of the tsunami but you couldn't miss all the horrific reports on the news. Umaga will meet O'Driscoll in Saturday's Rugby Aid match at Twickenham, with the Irish captain leading the Northern Hemisphere side.

England coach Andy Robinson lambasted referee Jonathan Kaplan for costing them the game after disallowing tries from Mark Cueto and Josh Lewsey. But Campese added: ""Scotland could have beaten France in the same way, but do you see them whingeing? ""England are beginning to realise that being world champions doesn't mean you deserve to win every game,"" he said. England face a potential wooden spoon match against Italy on 12 March. Campese, though, defended coach Andy Robinson, who he believes was the ""only choice"" after Sir Clive Woodward's resignation. ""Some people are leaders and some aren't. He's not but there's no one who stands out in England's pack - no clear-cut leaders."" ""They lost a few key players and suddenly everyone's realised the ones on the fringes were not all that good in the first place."

1657,"But Rob Andrew, coach of Wilkinson's club side Newcastle, said that with only two games left to play Wilkinson was unlikely to be fit in time. ""It would be irresponsible to put him straight into a Test match,"" Andrew told the Times. He has not played for England since the World Cup final in November 2003, since when the stuttering world champions have lost nine of their 14 matches. Despite not playing for England, Wilkinson is still hoping to make the Lions tour to New Zealand this summer. ""He will probably have to come off the bench to start and it would be ridiculous and irresponsible to put him straight back into a Test match. ""We can't afford to get it wrong with a knee injury. We are in touch with England and they are relaxed about it."""
1658,"England coach Andy Robinson has called on ex-international referees Colin High and Steve Lander to analyse several of Jonathan Kaplan's decisions. ""I want to speak to the IRB about it. I think only one side was refereed."" ""I want to go through the tape with Colin and Steve,"" Robinson told the Daily Mail. ""If any English referee refereed like that in a European match, there would be an inquest. No question about that. ""If someone had performed like that, he would have been pulled from the next game."""
1659,"Jason Robinson has led the team during their opening three defeats in the Six Nations tournament, in the absence of fly-half Jonny Wilkinson. Their creativity depends on quick ball and we're not getting that."" Moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why England have lost against Wales, France and Ireland in this year's tournament. ""Wer'e not getting quick ball, which means the backs are being stifled. ""The problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury don't have the requisite experience,"" Moore added. ""We then go into next season with a greater certainty of who can and cannot handle the pressure of international rugby."" ""You can't do anything about that but play them. There are players who have been knocking on the door, it's time for them to be looked at in these last two games because there's nothing on them."
1660,"Owen set for skipper role
Wales number eight Michael Owen says replacing Gareth Thomas as Wales' captain will be straightforward because of the leadership quality in the squad. The 22-cap Dragons man says that Thomas will be badly missed, though. ""You dream about playing for Wales, but it never enters your head that you will one day captain your country,"" he said. ""It's an easy job really because there are so many experienced players in the side, but it will be a massive honour."" ""He has put his own unique stamp on things. ""We have a massive game next up and we are just looking forward to preparing for that. Like us they did well in France and were unlucky not to get a win. ""Against Ireland they played fantastically well in the first 15 minutes before falling away."
1661,"That is a big one for us and them and I am sure my players will rise to the occasion,"" he said. ""We have to make sure the England and France games are tough for them. England have now equalled an 18-year low of four successive championship defeats, including France in Paris last season, and have lost four in a row under Andy Robinson. Kirwan said: ""The kicking was the decisive factor in Scotland which cost us and it could go down to the kicking again next time. First Mark Cueto was judged offside as he chased fly-half Charlie Hodgson's kick, and then Kaplan opted not to call upon video evidence to see if Josh Lewsey had touched down after being driven over Ireland's line. ""But I have a lot of confidence in my players and I am positive we can put everything together against England."" ""We definitely improved against an in-form Irish side,"" he said. ""We went to Dublin quietly confident that we would be able to compete, and I think we showed that. His predecessor, Sir Clive Woodward, began his seven-year reign with three defeats and two draws."
1662,"Dal Maso in to replace Bergamasco
David dal Maso has been handed the task of replacing the injured Mauro Bergamasco at flanker in Italy's team to face Scotland on Saturday. ""We are going to Scotland for the first away win and nothing else,"" said manager Marco Bollesan. ""I really believe this is the team who will have all our faith for Saturday's game.

1663,"Teenager Tait picked for England
Newcastle's teenage centre Mathew Tait has been named as a centre in England's team to face Wales in the Six Nations opener in Cardiff on Saturday. Bath lock Danny Grewcock will also start, pending a possible citing. Robinson was already without Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall, Stuart Abbott, Richard Hill and Will Greenwood, while Mike Catt had been left out of England's squad. Replacements: A Titterrell (Sale Sharks), P Vickery (Gloucester), S Borthwick (Bath), J Forrester (Gloucester), H Ellis (Leicester), O Barkley (Bath), B Cohen (Northampton)."
1664,"""Things have been building up over the past few years and I think this is the year for Ireland,"" he told BBC Sport. ""There is a great chance to win a Grand Slam. Ireland have finished runners-up three times, including last year, since the old Five Nations became Six in 2000, and not finished outside the top three in the past five years. Despite being without flanker Keith Gleeson, coach Eddie O'Sullivan has not had to contend with the sort of casualty lists that have hit England and Scotland in particular prior to the tournament. ""Wales have had four brilliant games in the last year or so and lost all four, so the time is right for them now to beat one of the major teams."" ""For Ireland to win it we need to stay relatively injury free, and fortunately we are one of the few teams that have done that so far,"" Wood added."
1665,"Star number eight Simon Taylor will miss at least the first two games after damaging an ankle during his comeback. Another potential option, Glasgow flanker Andrew Wilson, has been ruled out for a month after damaging ligaments in both knees against Northampton recently. Scotland doctor James Robson said: ""A scan has shown damage to the medial ligaments of Scott's right knee ruling him out of the first part of the Championship. ""We will seek further specialist advice in due course to determine just how long Scott may be out for."" ""We have got plenty of good, young players coming through and we have got to look at the opportunities it represents for them, rather than the negatives,"" Williams added. Williams could now turn to Edinburgh pair Alasdair Strokosch and Simon Cross."
1666,"Already Ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season. We will say nothing of Mike Ruddock ''poaching'' eight of the Dragons side that faced Leinster on Sunday. With England and France visiting Lansdowne Road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down, everything looks perfectly placed. Take the Triple Crown-winning side of 1985 under Mick Doyle. The IRFU has thrown their weight behind O'Sullivan, who must be glad that in the main, there is centrally-controlled contracts. He is not that sort of person. But I doubt whether O'Sullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players. What happened in 1986? Whitewashed. You see, Ireland, in any sport, love to be downsized."
1667,"Williams was expected to miss the match with a disc problem in his neck, but has been making a speedy recovery. ""It has been frustrating but he is on the mend, he has made good progress."" ""He will have tests in the next 48 hours and we are pretty optimistic he is getting there,"" Wales' team physiotherapist Mark Davies said. Wales get Williams fitness boost
Wales are hopeful that openside flanker Martyn Williams could be fit for Saturday's RBS 6 Nations championship opener against England in Cardiff. ""It is still painful and irritable. We will run the rule of thumb over him in the next couple of days."""
1668,"Wasps coach Warren Gatland said: ""He's got a fitness test in the week but he's got a good chance of playing."" Dawson joins England injury list
Scrum-half Matt Dawson is an injury doubt for England's Six Nations opener against Wales next weekend. Jamie Noon is another player on the sidelines after he limped off in the first half against Saracens on Friday with a dead leg."
1669,"Saints have a week's training in Portugal next week, while Wales will play England in the opening Six Nations match on 5 February. Saints coach Ian Millward has given his approval, but if it does happen it is unlikely to be this season. ""We have had an approach from Wales,"" confirmed a Saints spokesman. ""It's in the very early stages but it is something we are giving serious consideration to."" St Helens, who are proud of their Welsh connections, are obvious partners for the Welsh Rugby Union, despite a spat in 2001 over the collapse of Kieron Cunningham's proposed £500,000 move to union side Swansea."
1670,"It's the same for everyone but we need to manage it. Sale host Bath in the Powergen Cup on Friday, but the Frenchman has endured a ""difficult week"" with six players away on England's Six Nations training camp. ""That's not good for the politics of the English team or for English rugby,"" he argues. ""But we have to be careful. Unless the authorities agree to make changes, Saint-Andre believes England's national team will suffer as clubs opt to sign foreigners and retired internationals. ""If five players or more are picked for your country they should move the date of the game,"" he told BBC Sport. Bath have just been knocked out of Europe and will make it a tough game. ""They obviously want him for international rugby and we want him for club rugby in what is a very important game for us. There is a conflict of interests. ""The surgeon who carried out his operation said he was fine for us but England say he is still vulnerable to be damaged again and want him on a full rehab programme."""
1671,"""John is a young man with a big future. The 21-year-old Blues prop is the only uncapped player in Wales' Six Nations squad, gaining a chance in the absence of Ospreys loose-head Duncan Jones. ""John's been on an upward curve all season and is going from strength to strength,"" Young told BBC Sport Wales. ""John and Ian have been rewarded for impressing during the Heineken Cup competition,"" said Ruddock. ""He's working hard on his scrummaging technique, which he is keen to improve to become a destroyer on the loose-head. ""He's developing quickly, but I hope he isn't pushed too quickly in a way that would hurt his development."" ""We believe this is an exciting squad representing traditional values of Welsh rugby, and based on the performances in the November internationals. ""The management team just want to get hold of the players and get out on the training pitch at the moment. ""We have strength and experience up front, and well-recognised talent, pace and skill behind."
1672,"As a result three of the major stakeholders in English rugby have launched an ""injury audit"" to find out how players are coping. Robinson will be missing an entire midfield for the Six Nations with the likes of Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall and Will Greenwood injured. ""Injuries are part of the sport but we have to have a look at the amount of injuries that occur in the English season,"" Robinson told BBC Sport. ""If we don't the situation is going to get worse and not better, so I think rugby as a whole has got to look at this."" As far as Robinson is concerned its findings must not be ignored."
1673,"Hodges announces rugby retirement
Scarlets and USA Eagles forward Dave Hodges has ended his playing career to pursue a coaching role in the States. He tore a pectoral muscle against the Ospreys on Boxing Day, an injury that would have kept him out for the season. ""David has been a highly influential member of our squad for seven years,"" said Gallacher. ""We have a deliberate policy whereby around half the squad are coming out of contract and they know they won't all be re-signed, it's a chance to invigorate the squad,"" he said. ""I'm positive about the future of the Scarlets both on and off the field."" ""He is a real professional and we thank him for the part he has played in our success. Hodges described his years at Stradey as ""the best time of my life."""
1674,"The Welsh Students Rugby Football Union feels that it is unable to properly prepare for or stage the matches. The secretary of the Welsh Students Rugby Football Union, Reverend Eldon Phillips, said: ""It is a shame that fixtures cannot be maintained this year. ""The increasing number of young rugby players entering Higher Education look for the biggest challenge, that is representative rugby, but this year that opportunity will be denied them. Players who have played for Wales Students before going on to win full senior representative honours include Robert Jones, Rob Howley, Jon Humphreys, Darren Morris, Martyn Williams and Ceri Sweeney."
1675,"And Calder said: ""This is terrible news for every level of Scottish rugby. Mackay's executive board has been in a power struggle with the general committee, which contains members elected by Scotland's club sides. ""David is a successful businessman and I thought that if anybody could transform the negative atmosphere and rising debt level, it was him."" ""But I don't believe the rest of the SRU will take this lying down. ""He has been driven out by people who seem happier waging civil war than addressing the central issue that professional rugby can't be run by amateurs,"" said Calder. ""And we can now expect weeks of arguments and acrimony just at a time when we should be looking forward to the Six Nations Championship. But, in the wider picture, what message does this send out?"" ""I am very, very disappointed, more than you can imagine."
1676,"Well, at least there used to one. Now there is a handful to look back with a mixture of satisfaction, and sorrow. But in the three games in November which included a victory over Tri-Nations champions and Grand Slam chasing South Africa, Ireland finsihed the year on a high. For me, the try of the Championship. There can be no doubt that Ireland's representation will be the biggest ever, albeit in a proposed 44-man squad. The under-21 squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the World Cup final in Scotland only to be beaten by a powerful All Black side in the decider. While Ulster finished runners-up in their very tight group for the second season in succession, it was Munster again flying the flag for the Irish. How Wasps recovered from that energy-sapping duel, and then go onto to defeat Toulouse in the final was anybody's guess. Teenage star John McCall died while playing for the Ireland against New Zealand in the under-19 World Cup game in Durban. They all passed away long before the full-time whistle."
1677,"Williams stays on despite dispute
Matt Williams insists he has no thoughts of quitting as national coach as a result of the power struggle currently gripping Scottish rugby. However, he attempted to steer clear of taking sides in the dispute. ""I'd like to stress that the national team is separate to the political situation,"" he said. ""The idea that we are lighting cigars with £20 notes while the rest of Scottish rugby flounders is absolutely untrue. ""When you come to an undertaking like this and you are trying to make a difference then there are always people who will begrudge you, who are jealous and want to try to drag you down. There's no way that I'm walking away."" Our Irish counterparts, whom we have to compete with in a few days' time, had 70 days together at the summer. ""But let me give you the truth. ""They are currently in camp now and they will have another 21 days in camp before the Six Nations. We, on the other hand, will have 16."
1678,"""I actually started training three weeks after my operation but I was very limited until a few months ago. said the giant winger. The 29-year-old had a kidney transplant in July 2004 but will play his first full match for three years, leading a southern hemisphere side at Twickenham. ""Mohammed Ali has always been my ideal. ""I have talked this over, had a chat with the donor and this is to set my soul at peace and finish something I started in 1994 [when he made his All Blacks debut]."" ""It's up to you whether you want to make it a reality."" But when Lomu was asked whether he was taking a risk he replied: ""As much as someone going down the road being hit by a bus. ""I used to take two steps and fall over but now I can run and it is all coming back, and a lot more quickly than I ever thought it would. ""The only person who saw me at my worst was my wife,"" he added."
1679,"Johnson, who captained England to World Cup glory in 2003, will play his final match in June. ""I'm sure there will be times next season when I'll wish I was out there playing for the Tigers, but you know when the time is right to go and I feel this is the right time. Johnson also had huge success as captain of Leicester, guiding the Tigers to back to back Heineken Cup victories and several Premiership titles. He is the only man to captain the Lions twice and he also led England to a Six Nations Grand Slam. Johnson will always be revered by England fans for captaining England to their dramatic World Cup win against Australia in Sydney, but his list of achievements does not stop at that. Teak tough and physically intimidating, he ruled the rucks and mauls for the best part of a decade and was integral in England's rise to the top of the world game. ""This game against Jonah will be a great way to end the season and end my career,"" said Johnson. ""He is such a great leader and I am just honoured to be on the same pitch."" Lomu, rugby union's first global superstar after his exploits in the 1995 World Cup, said he was proud to be part of Johnson's farewell."
1680,"That statement was made to look a little foolish by events later that afternoon at Twickenham. But it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of Test rugby at the highest level, at the end of a richly entertaining autumn series. ""Clearly, there is no number one side in the world at the moment,"" declared Wallabies coach Eddie Jones on arrival back in Sydney. ""There are four, five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about 1%."" While South Africa's over-confidence in Cardiff made for a closer scoreline than expected, Wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the All Blacks in one of the best Tests in recent memory. Their momentous victory over the Springboks can only bolster Ireland's self-belief, while Ronan O'Gara's late drop goal to deliver victory over Argentina was further proof that Eddie O'Sullivan's side can now close out tight games. And for the first time in more than a decade, it will not simply be a straightforward choice between England and France for the Six Nations title. , who start with home games against Ireland and Wales before travelling to Scotland, are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the Championship. dismantling of the Springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as Martin Johnson and Lawrence Dallaglio, they still have the personnel to prosper. As autumn gives way to winter and the Heineken Cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime, the joy of Six will keep the home fires burning until February."
1681,"Jake White claimed the coaching award while his side held off Grand Slam winners France to take the team award. ""He's become to South African rugby what Jonty Rhodes was to South African cricket. Burger's award came just a week after he won the equivalent prize from his fellow international players and White, who also coached Burger at under-21 level, paid tribute to him. ""There are so many great sevens players on the circuit at the moment that this is a genuine honour,"" said the Gloucester fly-half. It's amazing what he has achieved in such a short time so far in his international career."""
1682,"England have the chance to seal their third autumn international victory after successive wins over Canada and South Africa, as well as gaining revenge for June's 51-15 hammering by the Wallabies. ""They have a great opportunity to land a trophy and it would be a massive boost for rugby league in this country if we won,"" said Robinson. ""For us, we've played two and won two this November,"" he said. ""If we beat Australia it would be the end to a great autumn series for England. But Robinson was not losing sight of the task facing his England side in their final autumn international. ""I know the boys can do it - they've defeated the Aussies once already in the Tri-Nations."" If we stumble then we'll be looking back with a few regrets. ""Everyone has signed the card - a lot of the guys watch league and we support them fully."
1683,"All Black magic: New Zealand rugby
Playing colours:
All black
The Haka and more! Twenty-two Maori and four 'pakiha' formed the 'New Zealand Native Team,' who played a total of 107 matches in New Zealand, Australia and the UK. Their opportunity to prove him wrong came in 1905 with the first official New Zealand tour to Europe. A ferocious game at the Arms Park in 1972 was edged 19-16 by the All Blacks, a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on New Zealand by the Carwyn James-inspired Lions of 1971. Dallas said that Deans was tackled short, but the Kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding a try - on his death-bed three years later he exclaimed: ""I did score that try in Cardiff."" The new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left Europe behind was shown as the All Blacks swatted Wales aside 49-6 in Brisbane in the semi-final of the inaugural World Cup. There was a temporary resurgence in the Welsh game, but when an experimental New Zealand side came to Cardiff's new Millennium Stadium in 2002 they left with a 43-17 victory. The All Blacks were on top in the Test with Wales at the Arms Park, but the teams were locked at 8-8 when a Clem Thomas cross kick was gathered by Ken Jones for a famous, match-winning try. An encouraging display against South Africa has inspired a confident Wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over 50 years. They have a chance, but clearly history is not on their side."
1684,"The season would start with the Celtic League in October, followed by the Heineken Cup in February and March, and the Six Nations moved to April and May. WRU proposes season overhaul
The Welsh Rugby Union wants to restructure the Northern Hemisphere season into four separate blocks. Moving the Six Nations from its traditional February beginning should also ensure better weather conditions and ""stimulate greater interest in the games and generally provide increased skills and competition and attract greater spectator viewing"", Pickering argued. He added: ""We feel sure that spectator interest would respond to the impetus of high intensity rugby being played continuously rather than the fragmented timetable currently in operation. ""Equally, we suspect that the sponsors would prefer the sustained interest in a continuous tournament and hopefully, the broadcasters would also enjoy increased exposure."""
1685,"Robinson added: ""There are several players in the squad I would feel comfortable in calling upon to be England captain but for me Jonny is in every way the right player to take on this challenge. ""And he consistently demonstrates the energy and commitment I feel is essential to be captain of England."" Wilkinson to lead England
Fly-half Jonny Wilkinson has been named as England's new rugby union captain for the three November Tests. But he then missed the entire 2004 Six Nations campaign while recuperating from shoulder surgery, before making his comeback for Newcastle in the Zurich Premiership in August. ""I'm honoured Andy wants me to be his captain, and to follow Lawrence and Martin means a lot to me as they are inspirational men who have given so much to England rugby over many years. ""It's the ambition of so many players to one day be captain of England and today I have realised a dream,"" he said. Taking on the captaincy is another important step in my career and I do so with immense pride."" England's first autumn Test is against Canada on 13 November, followed by the visit of Tri-Nations champions South Africa a week later and then a World Cup re-match with Australia."
1686,"But Hong Kong Rugby Football Union (HKRFU) chairman John Molloy has called for the territory to host one of the pools and a quarter-final. Last year, Japan launched its first professional rugby league and it has the fourth largest number of registered players (125,508) in the world after England, South Africa and France. ""We cannot examine any proposal unless we get it in a definitive form."" ""Until now, the World Cup has been held in countries from the Six Nations or Tri-Nations,"" said Tokumasu. ""We think, and the IRB thinks, that it is time for rugby to go global. Tokumasu added that the 2002 football World Cup, co-hosted by Japan and South Korea, had been a huge success."
1687,"Even the end of his nine-year career came out of the blue, just four days before the start of the season. To supporters of England, Dallaglio could do no wrong. But then Dallaglio has always been his own man. Within two years of his debut, Dallaglio was offered the England captain's band, and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 Lions tour to South Africa. Worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured England captaincy. The only player to play every minute of England's World Cup triumph in Australia, Dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure England's historic win, and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by England supporters. Rival fans, meanwhile, have tended to take an alternative view, seeing Dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of English rugby. But he bounced back, getting his head down at club level before returning to the England fold, albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain Johnson. With sensational allegations of drug use - of which he was subsequently cleared - splashed across the front pages, a devastated Dallaglio stepped down as England skipper. The problem now for England is how to replace the almost irreplaceable."
1688,"The Tigers stormed 22-6 ahead within 18 minutes through tries from Lewis Moody, Geordan Murphy and Martin Corry. The closing moments saw desperate defence from Leicester as Wasps turned down several penalties to go for the try they needed. Fly-half Goode was the Tigers hero, kicking 22 points in total, while Leicester's overwhelming domination in the scrums ultimately told. Even their lack of discipline in defence - which presented the admirable Van Ginsberg with 26 points - could not undo them as they held out for a famous win. Lawrence Dallaglio's team have now got it all to do in the quest for a quarter-final place given that two of their last three games are away - against Leicester and Biarritz. ""But we don't want to give this trophy away. We worked so hard to win it last season, we will go down fighting. ""If we lose next week, then we are struggling,"" said Gatland.

Ronan O'Gara scored all Ireland's points as the home side claimed only their second ever win over South Africa on an emotional day at Lansdowne Road. Ireland began strongly and were never led, but the match was tense and closely fought throughout. Early on, Denis Hickie thought he was in for a try after a delightful backline move but Shane Horgan's pass was adjudged to have gone forward by referee Paul Honiss. South Africa produced a huge effort in the closing minutes but Ireland held on to claim a deserved victory. After the sustained Springboks pressure, the Irish produced an attack of their own in the 34th minute which culminated with O'Gara's clever drop-goal to restore his side's lead to five points which remained the margin at half-time. The Springboks could feel hard done by as captain John Smit had his back to the play when O'Gara pounced after referee Honiss had told the skipper to warn his own players after consistent infringements. Sustained Irish pressure immediately after half-time was rewarded by another O'Gara penalty.

Saturday 20 November
Lansdowne Road, Dublin
1300 GMT
The Irish coach knows a repeat of the record 83-3 victory over the States in 2000 is not on the agenda and expects a real test at Lansdowne Road. ""Their coach Tom Billups will have them very organised,"" said O'Sullivan. The States lost 39-31 against France in their last international and are ranked 16th in world rugby. The other changes see recalls for backs David Humphreys, Kevin Maggs and Guy Easterby with Eric Miller, Marcus Horan, Donnacha O'Callaghan and Frank Sheehan all returning to the pack. ""The US may be classed as weaker opposition, but we will treat them with the respect they deserve."" Schubert is the only Eagles player remaining from the sides' meeting four years ago. S Byrne, S Best, L Cullen, A Foley, P Stringer, R O'Gara, G Dempsey."
1691,"A lot of players put their hands up,"" coach Eddie O'Sullivan told BBC Sport. ""Kieran Campbell was just one of those players. Munster and Leinster have 12 and 11 players in the squad respectively while Jackman is the sole Connacht representative. There were one or two players who were unfortunate just to miss out."" ""There is big competition in some departments and not so much in others. Four British-based players are also included. Ulster forward Ronan McCormack said he was ""totally shocked"" to be included.

1692,"An impressive Argentina appeared in control until the dying seconds. The well-drilled and sharper Pumas out-played and out-thought Ireland in the early stages. Ireland turned the ball over and Manuel Contepomi broke through an unstructured defence before feeding his midfield partner Aramburu to sprint in under the posts. O'Gara kicked all of Ireland's points, with two dropped goals and five penalties, to give the home side a 100% record in their autumn internationals. And Ireland's chance came when Argentina's number eight Gonzalo Longo was yellow carded with six minutes to go for an offence in the line-out. Playing into a strong wind and rain, Ireland continued to come second best in tight situations, and turnovers began to mount up against a rugged defence. The second-half started as the first had ended. O'Gara rifled over another penalty in the 45th minute, but Contepomi matched it three minutes later. Ireland had to rely on O'Gara's boot to keep in touch rather than any contrived running plays."
1693,"They then took charge with scores from Pat Sanderson, Kai Horstman, Mathew Tait and Rob Thirlby, but Fiji rallied to force a tense finale. Mike Friday's England side matched their opponents for pace, power and skill in the final and led 19-7 at half-time. Scotland were beaten 33-15 by Samoa in the plate semi-final and Ireland lost 17-5 to Tunisia in the shield final. ""To be honest, England have wanted to win in Dubai for a very long time now, and the people here have wanted us to win for just as long,"" said Friday. ""We didn't want to put pressure on ourselves but we are thankful we have achieved that and brought through some young talent at the same time that can hopefully play for the England '15s' in a few years."""
1694,"All Black Aaron Mauger was in good form with the boot, adding 10 points. And New Zealand coach Graham Henry said: ""It was a quality performance against a very experienced side and a number of young guys came through very well. ""They learnt from the older players and this was a way of thanking the guys who had been mentoring them on the tour."" But the running rugby the crowd had been hoping for rarely materialised. The All Blacks featured only two of the side which started last weekend's emphatic Test victory over France in Paris, while the Baa-Baas had nine Wallabies in their starting line-up. After the match, Barbarians coach Bob Dwyer warned that South African flanker Schalk Burger needed a proper off-season break to maintain his standards. But the match was blighted by controversy moments later when Justin Marshall, was felled with a high tackle by Jimmy Cowan. Referee Andy Turner waved play on and Casey Laulala coasted in for his side's fifth try. ""It's his first year at that level and he was phenomenal up until the end of the southern hemisphere season. ""I don't think he's played anywhere near that level on tour,"" he said."
1695,"Coach Andy Robinson dropped Dawson for the autumn Tests after he missed training to film 'A Question of Sport.' ""He merits his return on current form."" ""It's obviously an honour to be asked to train with England,"" said Tait, who has burst into contention recently. Newcastle's 18-year-old centre Mathew Tait is also in the training squad. ""I always said I would consider bringing Matt back if I felt he was playing well,"" Robinson said. Prop Phil Vickery and lock Simon Shaw both return to the squad after missing the autumn Tests through injury, while Wasps wing Tom Voyce is recalled. The revised 56-man elite squad includes Wasps hooker Phil Greening, who replaces the retired Mark Regan, and Sale wing Mark Cueto. Robinson has invited 42 players to attend a three-day session in Leeds next week, in which his squad will train in part with the Leeds Rhinos rugby league squad. The players in Robinson's elite squad can only play 32 matches for club and country. Chuter, Thompson, Titterrell, Rowntree, Sheridan, Stevens, Vickery, White, Borthwick, Brown, L Deacon, Grewcock, Kay, Shaw, Beattie, Corry, Forrester, Hazell, Jones, Moody, Vyvyan, J Worsley."
1696,"Borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by Charlie Hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. First, Mark Blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back Cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper Andy Ward. But the Irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. Larkin again added the extras. The hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart, however, when Warnock struck a penalty at the other end. Ulster coach mark McCall said he was delighted to get the victory. ""Borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time,"" said McCall. ""In the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries."" Brady, McCormick, Longwell, Browne, Doak, S. Young, Bowe.

England captain Jonny Wilkinson will make his long-awaited return from injury against Edinburgh on Saturday. Sale's Charlie Hodgson took over the number 10 shirt in the internationals against Canada, South Africa and Australia."
1701,"Dallaglio toured South Africa with the Lions in 1997 but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to Australia three years ago. ""I know what it takes and what I have to offer,"" he told the Daily Telegraph. He said: ""I'll be in good shape and fresh without another 10 Tests on the clock. ""If Clive feels he has no need to look outside the international crop, then fine. If he does, then he won't need to look too far, will he?"""
1702,"Wasps coach Warren Gatland told the Daily Mirror: ""We have not yet offered Matt a new contract but we will be doing so. Dawson set for new Wasps contract
European champions Wasps are set to offer Matt Dawson a new deal. ""I know I'm fit enough, I'm strong enough, I'm skilful enough."" ""Rugby is still my priority and there's still a burning desire within me to play the best rugby I possibly can,"" he said."
1703,"Healey, who won 51 caps prior to the 2003 World Cup, has been in good form in the Tigers' resurgence this season. ""I am basically playing where it best suits Leicester. Obviously I can play scrum-half, fly-half or full-back at a moment's notice. ""We will have to see what happens after the previous (autumn) Tests but when I look at the current squad I definitely feel there is a place there for me."" That has been apparent in parts one and two of the Wasps-Leicester trilogy in recent weeks. ""There was a lot of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is really only a case of a job half done,"" he added. Then, in the first of their Heineken cup double header last Sunday, Healey slotted in at stand-off and delivered a superb cross-kick for Martin Corry to score the Tigers' third try. But Healey insists the Tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed ""rugby's version of Rocky II"". ""I think it came down to who wanted it more and in the end I think we did. We have got to show the same desire again this week."""
1704,"Williams, capped by Wales against Romania in 2003, should figure in the match squad for Monday's Zurich Premiership match at Sale Sharks. Said Williams: ""When this opportunity presented itself, I did not really have to think twice about it."" Scrum-half Williams rejoins Bath
Bath have signed their former scrum-half Andy Williams on a short-term deal from the Neath-Swansea Ospreys. ""He has been playing regular Heineken Cup and Celtic League rugby and he has a great affection for Bath,"" Rowell told Bath's official website. ""We are delighted to be able to welcome him back to the club."""

""It is up to (Bath owner) Andrew Brownsword. ""Mike has been at Bath for eight years and wants to remain with the club and his demands are anything but excessive,"" the agent added. ""But Brownsword has to recognise Mike's value and we want to resolve things by the end of next week."""
1706,"The Bath player was already out of the opener against Wales on 5 February because of a hand problem. ""Mike had a specialist review on a fracture in his right mid foot,"" said England doctor Simon Kemp. ""Before a final decision is made on surgery... medical teams have decided he should see a second specialist."" Meanwhile, Tindall is targeting a return to action before the end of the regular Zurich Premiership season on 30 April."
1707,"And can the Welsh revival continue all the way to a first Grand Slam since 1978? Martyn Williams, Wales' two-try scorer on the day, called it ""one of the most surreal games I have ever played in"". But while that passage of play showed the swelling self-belief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure, the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this Welsh side. And what a half it was for the Red Dragonhood, transforming a 15-6 half-time deficit into an 18-15 lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period. A crestfallen France coach, Bernard Laporte, simply observed: ""There was a French half and there was a Welsh half"". The likes of Michael Owen, Gethin Jenkins, Dwayne Peel and Gavin Henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer's Lions tour to New Zealand. In international rugby, any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day, but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis. But since they threw off the shackles against New Zealand in the 2003 World Cup, Wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place. So on to Murrayfield, where Wales have not won on their last three visits. Only then - with the visit of Ireland to finish - can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the 1970s, and writing their own names into Welsh legend."
1708,"""That's the last thing on our minds at the moment,"" said Williams, a second- half replacement in Saturday's 24-18 win over France in Paris. Hooker Robin McBryde is doubtful after picking up a knee injury in Paris, but centre Sonny Parker and flanker Colin Charvis are set to recover from injury to be in contention for selection. ""Scotland are a hard side and very underrated so we're not taking anything for granted. Said Wales assistant coach Scott Johnson: ""They've worked through the weekend and the reports are a bit more positive. ""That's my job and we've got to make sure we're focused."" Scotland secured their first win of the campaign on Saturday by grinding out an 18-10 win over Italy. ""Italy are really brave opposition and sometimes it's very hard to win,"" he said. ""We're not basking in the glory of winning our first three games. We've got to be diligent in our preparation."
1709,"""It's something I've always wanted to do. ""I would definitely want the job - I make no bones about it,"" Sculthorpe told BBC Sport. Sculthorpe wants Lions captaincy
Paul Sculthorpe has admitted he would love to succeed Andy Farrell as Great Britain skipper if the Wigan star does switch codes to rugby union. ""The RFL has got to do something about the fixtures. If he fancies a new challenge, then who could fault him?"" There are a lot of good young players who are pushing for places anyway."" ""Andy would be a hard act to follow but it's something I'm confident of being up to,"" he said. ""Nobody can blame him if he does go - he's done everything in the game of rugby league. We're playing 42 weeks of the year and it's too much. Who knows what might happen?"
1710,"""We and anybody else involved in the process are still some way away from going to the next stage,"" Tigers boss John Wells told BBC Radio Leicester. Leicester and Saracens are believed to head the list of rugby union clubs interested in signing Farrell if he decides to move to the 15-man game. ""I think England would prefer him to progress to a position in the back row where they can make use of some of his rugby league skills within the forwards. ""At this club, the balance will have to be struck between the cost of that gamble and the option of bringing in a ready-made replacement."" ""I'm sure he could make the step between league and union by being involved in the centre,"" said Wells."
1711,"The prospect of Farrell switching codes has been the main talking point of the Super League season so far. ""The money side of things hasn't been concluded, but it's not the point for Wigan,"" he told Radio Five Live. Although the move would be a lucrative one for both Farrell and Wigan, Lindsay said money was not a motivating factor for the club. ""He's given us 12 years service so if he wants to go, we'd support him."" ""It'd be a great loss for us but a great boost for them,"" said the Warriors chief. ""A shortage of money has never been a problem for us. You're very lucky to have them whilst you've got them."" He's been at the top for so long and has demonstrated so many attributes that you need to make it in a tough contact sport. ""Athletes like him - Ellery Hanley and Martin Johnson - don't come along very often."
1712,"The top two sides in each pool qualify but England could face 2001 winners New Zealand in the quarter-finals if they stumble against Samoa. The second seeds have been drawn against Samoa, France, Italy, Georgia and Chinese Taipei. ""England have the ability and determination to win this World Cup and create sporting history by being the only nation to hold both the 15s and Sevens World Cups at the same time,"" said England sevens coach Mike Friday. England won the first Rugby World Cup Sevens in 1993 with a side that included the likes of Lawrence Dallaglio and Matt Dawson. ""Every pool contains teams who have caused upsets before and we will have to work hard to ensure we progress from our group. ""We have not performed consistently to our true potential so far in the IRB Sevens which has been disappointing - but we can only look forward."" In 1997 and 2001, England lost in the quarter-finals. Argentina (4), South Africa (5), Kenya, Tunisia, Russia, Uruguay."
1713,"The England centre will have spent his 19th birthday on Sunday shuddering at the memory of how he was up-ended not just once, but twice, by Henson's all-enveloping tackles. And his defence was a major feature of the match, his principal victim poor old, or rather young, Mathew Tait. Henson was also creativity personified: one little chip ahead for Shane Williams narrowly missed its target; a precise cross-kick forcing Jamie Noon to fumble the ball into touch. He announced himself in the game's opening salvo with a ""Welcome to Cardiff"" greeting for Mark Cueto on the gain line. There were still four minutes for Wales to hold out, and the frenzy was such that Henson could not even hear Jones shouting instructions at him from three yards away. ""It was out of Steve's range but I looked at Gavin, and he gave me a reassuring nod,"" said Thomas. Without further ado, he nervelessly slotted the kick that ended five years of English dominance and 12 years of waiting in Cardiff. ""I knew I was going to get it before I even took the kick,"" he said later, his distinct spikey locks freshly gelled into an appropriate star shape. ""I have been getting them from that distance all year so it wasn't a problem."" And, thanks to Henson, Wales did."
1714,"Sydney to host north v south game
Sydney will host a northern versus southern hemisphere charity match in June or July, the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) said on Wednesday. The date is yet to be decided but the most likely venue is Sydney's Olympic Stadium. ""The Australian Rugby Union has thrown its support behind a proposed North-South match to raise funds for the tsunami appeals,"" the ARU said. Wallabies captain George Gregan said the charity match was a ""great initiative"". Tri-Nations rivals Australia, New Zealand and South Africa would feature prominently in a southern team against a northern side comprised of Six Nations teams France, Ireland, England, Wales, Italy and Scotland."
1715,"But how the mighty have fallen. And they face the ignominy of what could amount to a Wooden Spoon play-off against Italy in a fortnight. And he is enduring the toughest of teething problems in bedding down his own style with a new team. Coach Andy Robinson, who took over from the successful Sir Clive Woodward in September, has lost a phalanx of World Cup stars. But given that Ireland have beaten Wales in four of their last five meetings, the Welsh legions are likely to be behind Les Bleus on 12 March. As for Scotland, they have struggled this decade and the 2004 Wooden Spoon ""winners"" have not been in the top two since they lifted the title in 1999. And so to France. Brilliant one minute, inept the next. But the reigning champions could quite easily turn on the style in Dublin and end up winning the title through the back door. Welsh romantics would probably prefer a glorious victory in the Celtic showdown to crown their Grand Slam."
1716,"One can understand that frustration. What the IRB does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself. As far as England were concerned, there were queries over Mark Cueto's first half-effort when he went over in the corner from a Charlie Hodgson kick. But you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies. Lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control. The referee also missed England's Danny Grewcock taking out Ronan O'Gara off the ball to allow Martin Corry a Sunday stroll to the line. But there were many more, and one should not take away from those. And Ronan O'Gara's tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component. Two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied England and allowed Ireland to hold on. To win a game like that showed that Ireland have moved forward."
1717,"Ireland 19-13 England
Ireland consigned England to their third straight Six Nations defeat with a stirring victory at Lansdowne Road. A series of probes led by the talismanic O'Driscoll, back from hamstring injury, resulted in a penalty but Ireland chose to kick for touch. England scored first through Martin Corry but had ""tries"" from Mark Cueto and Josh Lewsey disallowed. England took their time to settle but their first real venture into Ireland's half produced a simple score for Corry. The number eight picked up the ball from the back of a ruck and found an absence of green jerseys between himself and the Irish line, racing 25 yards to touch down. Ireland last won the title, then the Five Nations, in 1985, but 20 years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with Wales. O'Gara missed a penalty which would have put Ireland nine points clear, and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when Hodgson's cross-kick was fumbled by lock Ben Kay near the line. The lead was shortlived, however. But another English indiscretion on a rare Irish break-out awarded O'Gara a kick at goal, which he missed. G Murphy; G Dempsey, B O'Driscoll, S Horgan, D Hickie; R O'Gara, P Stringer; R Corrigan, S Byrne, J Hayes; M O'Kelly, P O'Connell; S Easterby, J O'Connor, A Foley."
1718,"""I think Mark Cueto scored a perfectly legal try and I think he should have gone to the video referee on Josh Lewsey,"" said Robinson. ""[I'm] absolutely spitting. South African referee Jonathan Kaplan ruled that Cueto was ahead of Charlie Hodgson when the fly-half hoisted his cross-field kick for the Sale wing to gather. I am very proud of my players and, with a couple of decisions, this could have been a very famous victory. It is there, and it should be used. ""We've got to go back to technology. I have looked at both, and they both looked tries. They defended magnificently and they've got every chance of winning this Six Nations."" ""We are upset now, but the referee is in charge and he has called it his way and we have got to be able to cope with that. Given the pressure we were under, credit must go to all the players."
1719,"Scotland 18-10 Italy
Six Chris Paterson penalties gave Scotland victory in a dour but clinical encounter against Italy at Murrayfield. But the more powerful Azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life. With the pendulum of possession swinging towards Scotland, Lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after 65 minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from Paterson. Scotland defended the initial thrusts but on 20 minutes Italy, after coming up yards short of the line, equalised through a De Marigny penalty. But John Kirwan's men had the last laugh when Gordon Ross' attempted clearance was charged down and Masi pounced for the try, converted by De Marigny. Scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the Italian half and snatched three points from Paterson when an Italian forward handled the ball in a ruck. Italy were offered another penalty when Scottish flanker Simon Taylor was offside but the left-footed De Marigny pushed his kick wide. And Scotland capitalised with a third Paterson penalty on 50 minutes. Another Paterson penalty on 70 minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors. R Russell, B Douglas, N Hines, J Dunbar, M Blair, G Ross, B Hinshelwood."
1720,"With both sides looking for their first win of the championship, the third-round game at Murrayfield has been billed as a wooden-spoon decider. Now the Italians travel to Edinburgh hoping to claim their first away win in the Six Nations. ""It will not be a pretty game because both teams are desperate to gain their first win,"" said the lock forward. This year, Italy opened up with a stubborn display against Ireland but ended up losing 28-17. ""As a nation, our quest is to be respected as a team worthy of a place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games."""
1721,"O'Connell, who made a try-scoring international debut against Wales two years ago, is enjoying his meteoric rise into rugby's shop window - but refuses to be drawn on the Lions. I just ignore it and get on with my job."" He added: ""The only thing that annoys me after reading some reports is what the opposition locks think. ""I have spoken to Sir Clive Woodward a few times, but not for very long, certainly nothing about summer holidays,"" he joked. ""I came on as a replacement and we were losing 13-6, and ended up getting hammered 42-6, so I know what can happen when England come to Dublin. This England team has so much experience and skill. ""That's not going to happen in our squad. ""They have two world class game-breakers in Josh Lewsey and Jason Robinson, while Charlie Hodgson is just ready to click into place."" Look at what they did to us two years ago. I remember that game all too well, and it was not a good feeling."
1722,"Taylor poised for Scotland return
Simon Taylor has been named in the Scotland squad for Saturday's Six Nations clash with Italy. ""He brings a whole new dimension to us, especially in defence and his ability to slow the opposition ball down could be key against Italy if he is involved."" Both Scotland and Italy have lost their opening two Six Nations games and, just like last season's encounter which Italy won, this weekend's game could turn out to be a battle to avoid the wooden spoon. ""Simon is one of Scotland's truly world class players so it is a huge bonus,"" said team-mate Chris Paterson. So Taylor played the last 20 minutes of Saracens' win over Northampton and then 40 minutes in a friendly against South African Super 12 side The Cats."
1723,"He added: ""I've got the operation this afternoon and I could be back doing fitness work after a week."" After the game, Vickery spoke with Bath prop David Barnes, who also broke his arm recently. He will undergo an operation on Monday and is expected to be out for at least six weeks. ""I had a chat with David Barnes and it looks like a similar injury to him,"" he said. ""As frustrating as it is, I've got to be positive."" ""He said he had the operation and he was back running after a week. He really needed 80 minutes of rugby this weekend, and then this happened."
1724,"The champions only just saw off the Scots in Paris, then needed England to self-destruct in last week's 18-17 win. Dominici backs lacklustre France
Wing Christophe Dominici says France can claim another Six Nations Grand Slam despite two lacklustre wins so far against Scotland and England. ""The English played better than us but lost, whereas we are still in the race for the Grand Slam,"" said Dominici. ""We know our display was not perfect, but we can still win the Grand Slam, along with Ireland and Wales."" But although France have yet to click, Dominici says that they can still win the hard way as long as scrum-half Dimitri Yachvili continues in his goalkicking form. Inspirational flanker Serge Betsen is a doubt with a thigh injury, but number eight Imanol Harinordoquy has shaken off his shoulder injury."
1725,"Llewellyn is on a one-season deal with French club side Narbonne, but said he may consider retiring from all rugby. ""Narbonne are really keen for me to stay on for next year, so I've got to decide whether to stay on there or maybe go somewhere else, but ultimitely coaching is where I'd like to end up. Llewellyn plans Wales retirement
Wales record cap holder Gareth Llewellyn will retire from Test rugby at the end of the Six Nations. But the former Neath and Ospreys player is still targetting one last outing in the red shirt. ""But Mike (Ruddock) asked me to carry on for another season, which I've done, still part of the squad, still trying to help them out as much as I can."" ""I don't know what I'll do next year, whether to carry on playing or make a change in my career,"" Llewellyn said. ""Sometimes the easiest thing would have been to throw the towel in and walk away, but a few of us dug in there and it's really nice to see some of the boys getting the rewards now. ""But I think the best thing of all for me was the time I spent with the players, I've met some great guys in rugby and made some great friends. Llewellyn made his Wales debut in 1989 against New Zealand as a 20-year-old, having caught the selectors' eyes in the All Blacks' tour match against Neath. ""It'll be a bit strange on international days having to find somewhere to watch Wales play, but at least I might have time to get my golf handicap down!"""
1726,"A scrappy opening quarter saw both sides betray the lack of confidence engendered by poor opening displays against Wales and Scotland respectively. Hodgson had an early opportunity to settle English nerves but pushed a straightforward penalty attempt wide. A spell of tit-for-tat kicking emphasised the caution on both sides, until England refused a possible three points to kick a penalty to the corner, only to botch the subsequent line-out. But a probing kick from France centre Damien Traille saw Mark Cueto penalised for holding on to the ball in the tackle, Yachvili giving France the lead with a kick from wide out. The industrious wing cut back in on an angle and handed off hooker Sebastien Bruno to sprint over. And when Lewis Moody was twice penalised - for handling in a ruck and then straying offside - the scrum-half's unerring left boot cut the deficit to two points. Yachvili nibbled away at the lead with a third penalty after 51 minutes. Barkley then missed his third long-range effort to increase the tension.

1727,"The 25-year-old has not played for England since the 2003 World Cup final after a succession of injuries. ""They're both pretty good kickers. ""Jonny's not fit yet,"" Falcons chief Andrew told BBC Radio Five Live. Charlie is a good kicker week-in, week-out. Andrew also blamed England's poor run of recent results on a lack of leadership in the side following several high-profile retirements and injuries. ""They just didn't have that leadership that would have seen them through. Martin Johnson, Lawrence Dallaglio and Jonny are obviously huge losses and leadership is so important in those situations,"" he said. ""But it's all about pressure and unfortunately England are just not handling the pressure at the moment."" ""The top golfers don't hit the fairway every time, and it is the same with goal-kicking,"" Hare added. ""But natural-born toughness comes into it as well as all the practice you do."
1728,"Tries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Italy 8-38 Wales
Wales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. Wales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. With Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. G Thomas (capt); H Luscombe, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; J Thomas, M Williams, M Owen. Andrew Cole (Australia)."
1729,"The only other change to the Ireland side from last weekend's win in Rome sees Wasps flanker Johnny O'Connor replacing Denis Leamy. ''We gave Gordon a chance but it didn't work out,'' said Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan.

""Physically, it's obvious that I hit rock bottom,"" said the 22-year-old, who will make her comeback in the Sydney International from 10-16 January. ""All the successes I had prior to that were mainly due to the work I put in on building up my fitness."

""This has been incredible - the moment I've been waiting for for years,"" said Moya, who missed out in 2000 through injury. ""I've prepared myself for this day. We have to improve.""

Tim Henman opened his 2005 campaign with a 6-1 7-5 victory over Argentine David Nalbandian at the Kooyong Classic exhibition tournament on Wednesday. ""Over the years I've found David very difficult to play against. Henman made an impressive start to the year, only faltering against Nalbandian when serving for the match at 5-4. ""He returns serve very well and he's deceptively effective from the baseline, so sometimes it can be difficult to execute my gameplan well enough against him to get the right result. ""When I started training again it really, really seized up. ""I'm not the most flexible and at the end of the year I was pretty exhausted and wanted to have a couple of weeks where I didn't do anything,"" said Henman. ""Beating somebody of his stature is always good for the confidence and it bodes well at the beginning of the year."" ""It was about getting used to the surface,"" he said. As much as I enjoyed the two weeks off I don't think it's so productive."" ""All in all I'm happy with the match, and I won it - that's a good sign."

Bob Bryan added: ""I'm really confident in Andy winning that first match, and then anything can happen."" ""It feels good, but it's not going to be as good if we don't win two tomorrow,"" said Mike Bryan. ""It feels good to give those guys another shot, and Spain has to go to sleep on that."" When Robredo dropped serve in the opening game of the third set the match was all but over, and the unflappable Bryan brothers powered on to an impressive win. ""They have everything calculated and we had very little to do. Arrese said: ""Juan Carlos hasn't played at all badly. He played the right way but the Bryans are great doubles players."""

He said the problem was not the same as the hip injury which forced him to miss Wimbledon last year.

Safin, seeded four, opens his campaign against a qualifier with 16th seed Tommy Haas, the player he beat in the semi-finals in 2002, a possible fourth-round opponent.

""The decision to not re-hire Brad Gilbert for the 2005 season is based on what I think is best for my game at this time,"" said Roddick.

Home favourite Lleyton Hewitt came through a dramatic five-set battle with Argentine David Nalbandian to reach the Australian Open semi-finals. Ninth seed Nalbandian had never come back from two sets down to win a match, and there was no indication he would do so as Hewitt dominated the first two sets. The Argentine had stoked up the temperature ahead of the match by saying Hewitt's exuberant on-court celebrations were ""not very good for the sport"". But the tiring third seed showed incredible reserves of strength to force the break despite being outplayed for much of the final set and three times coming within two points of defeat. ""I told myself to give everything and in the end it paid off once again. It was always tough serving second in the fifth set,"" said Hewitt, who had never reached the last four at his home Grand Slam.

Hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. After 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. ""I've always said I'd do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set. ""It's awesome,"" said Hewitt. Now I've got my chance."" ""Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. ""I'm mad, I felt I was in there with a shot.

Davenport paid tribute to Williams, saying: ""She's had a tough couple of years and she's come back like a champion."" She quickly dropped the first set but from 3-3 in the second found another gear as Davenport's game collapsed, allowing Williams to take the title. ""'I don't care if my arm falls off, I'm not losing this game'. And I guess that's what happened. ""I felt like I was playing well and in control pretty much of the match,"" said Davenport.

Roddick shrugs off the disappointment of losing the third-set tiebreak and breezes through his first service game of the fourth set. Nadal enjoys another straightforward hold and Roddick must once again serve to stay in the set. Then Roddick produces some amazing defence at the net to take the score to 4-4.

Davenport was a strong favourite for the US Open but, hampered by injury, lost to the powerful and unflappable Kuznetsova in the semis. There was also a surprise loss to the unheralded Tomas Berdych at the Olympic Games, which saw Chile dominate as Nicoals Massu took the singles and then paired up with Fernando Gonzaelz to win doubles gold. But while the young Russians were on the way up, it was a different story for the Belgians and the Williams sisters.

""This win has made me believe more in myself and I can now hope to do better in the coming days. ""I wanted to win this tournament very badly since it was in my hometown."" Mirza eventually lost the point but to the relief of the crowd, she broke Bondarenko again in the next game to clinch the title. At 5-3, the stadium erupted in celebration when Mirza thought she had delivered an ace to secure victory but the serve was ruled to have clipped the net. But from 0-2 down, Mirza broke serve twice in a row and held on to her advantage to take the first set."

Andy Roddick will play Cyril Saulnier in the final of the SAP Open in San Jose on Sunday. Saulnier battled to a 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-3 win over seventh seed Jurgen Melzer, who twisted his ankle early in the second set. ""I thought tonight was a step in the right direction."" ""I was feeling horrible earlier in the week,"" Roddick said. ""I'm on the way. I've stayed mentally strong. I'll keep fighting and work a lot and I'll be up there."""
1824,"It dries and is not visible under normal light. At the entrance to each polling station, one election official will scan voter's fingers with UV lamp before allowing them to enter, and every voter will have his/her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot. If the ink shows under the UV light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station. The use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections - the German Embassy, the Soros Foundation and the Kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes. In an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as ""an island of democracy"", the Kyrgyz President, Askar Akaev, pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming Parliamentary and Presidential elections. The ink is sprayed on a person's left thumb. The author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink. The use of ink has been controversial - especially among groups perceived to be pro-government. Others, such as the aggressively middle of the road, Coalition of Non-governmental Organizations, have lauded the move as an important step forward. The passage of the inking law is, nevertheless, a clear step forward towards free and fair elections."""
1825,"The official Xinhua News Agency said the crackdown was carried out to create a ""safer environment for young people in China"". According to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally. Chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools. The 12,575 cafes were shut in the three months from October to December. In August 2004 Chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn. This is not the first time that the Chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines. Logs of sites people visit are also kept. Laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people. At the same time it introduced new controls to block overseas sex sites."

Microsoft said in a statement it is investigating what it called a criminal attack on its software. The program attempts to disable or delete Microsoft's anti-spyware tool and suppress warning messages given to users. Earlier this week, Microsoft said it would buy anti-virus software maker Sybari Software to improve its security in its Windows and e-mail software. Microsoft has said it plans to offer its own paid-for anti-virus software but it has not yet set a date for its release."

Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53). He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, ""We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. ""Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months."" ""In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks."
1828,"And vice versa. They have both been created using the telco's technology that it has been incubating at its research and development arm, including a sophisticated graphics rendering program. It is about both industries borrowing strategies and creative ideas together which can result in better business practices for creative industries, or more patent ideas for tech companies. The art world is ""fantastically rich"", said Mr Stone, with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like BT want to get in with them. ""We are creating a future cultural drive for the economy,"" said Mr Stone. ""We hope that by uncovering the river, we can greater understand the connections between the past and the present, and appreciate the flow of modernity, once concealing, but now revealing the River Senne."" As more tools for self-expression are given to the person on the street, enabling people to take photos with a phone and upload them to the web for instance, creativity will become an integral part of technology. Between 1997 and 2002, the creative industry brought £21 billion to London alone. ""This is not just about putting art galleries and museums online,"" he said. ""What we are trying to do is have outside-in thinking."

The pilot scheme in the Huaral Valley, 80 kilometres north of the capital Lima, aims to offer the 6,000-strong community up-to-date information on agricultural market prices and trends. There, farmers can find the prices for local produce, as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques. The community training sessions, attended by an equal number of men and women, have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm. ""Water is the main element that unites them all. ""This is a pilot project, and we have been very keen on its cloning potential in other places,"" underlined Mr Saldarriaga. But we have also had a great feedback when we trained 40 or 50-year old women, who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives."" So far, the Huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive, and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers' organisations in Peru. There it was necessary to build a mini-hydraulic dam in order to generate 2kW worth of power for the computers, the communications equipment and the cabin lights. ""The logical answer was 'we don't sell any', so they had to wait until the next morning to do the testing."""

A further patch fixes a hole in Media Player, Windows Messenger and MSN Messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through .png files. These were considered to be less critical, however. The number of holes considered ""critical"" is more than usual. Many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely, install programs, change, and delete or see data. Its latest releases came the week that the company announced it was to buy security software maker Sybari Software as part of Microsoft's plans to make its own security programs. One of the critical patches Microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some IE flaws."

The Zafi.D virus translates the Christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected e-mail. The virus is thought to have spread most widely in South America, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria and Hungary. The message in the body of the e-mail reads: ""Happy Holidays"" and this too is translated. The original Zafi virus appeared in April this year.

If a user clicks the AutoLink feature in the Google toolbar then a webpage with a book's unique ISBN number would link directly to Amazon's website. Google's toolbar sparks concern
Search engine firm Google has released a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites. Dan Gillmor, founder of Grassroots Media, which supports citizen-based media, said the tool was a ""bad idea, and an unfortunate move by a company that is looking to continue its hypergrowth"". ""In addition, the user can choose to disable the AutoLink feature entirely at any time."" In a statement Google said the feature was still only in beta, ie trial, stage and that the company welcomed feedback from users. Smart Tags allowed Microsoft to link any word on a web page to another site chosen by the company. ""Of course Google should be allowed to direct people to whatever proxies it chooses.

Web tracking company Envisional said 18% of downloaders were from within the UK and that downloads of TV programmes had increased by 150% in the last year. In effect, the internet is now a global video recorder."" The industry has coined the term ""time-shifting"" to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want, when you want. More people with high-speed broadband connections in the UK also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly. Exact figures are difficult to pin down, but it is thought that about 80,000 to 100,000 people in the UK download TV programmes. The BBC already allows radio fans to hear programmes they missed online up to a week after broadcast. It is looking to do a more expansive trial later this year."

IBM said it had taken the step in response to greater customer demand for the open source software. One of the main focuses of the initiative will be to make it easier to use Linux-based desktop computers and mobile devices with Workplace. Linux and the open source software movement are based on the premise that developers should be free to tinker with the core components of software programs. Even before IBM announced this latest spending boost it was one of the biggest advocates of the open source way of working. In 2001 it put $300m into a three-year Linux program and has produced Linux versions of many of its programs."
1836,"The film will all be encrypted to prevent piracy and each cinema will have an individual key which will unlock the movie. Fiona Deans, associate director of AADC, said the compression was visually lossless so no picture degradation will occur. The key benefit of the digital network will be an increase in the distribution and screening of British films, documentaries and foreign language films. The UK Film Council has awarded a contract worth £11.5m to Arts Alliance Digital Cinema (AADC), who will set up the network of up to 250 screens. ""People will see the picture quality is a bit clearer with no scratches. Most cinemas currently have mechanical projectors but the new network will see up to 250 screens in up to 150 cinemas fitted with digital projectors capable of displaying high definition images. ""Although a genuine variety of films is available in central London and a few other metropolitan areas, the choice for many outside these areas remains limited, and the Digital Screen Network will improve access for audiences across the UK,"" Digital prints costs less than a traditional 35mm print - giving distributors more flexibility in how they screen films, said Ms Deans. ""In the digital world you can make prints for considerably less than that. ""With digital prints, every cinema will have its own copy."" ""A cinema will often book a 35mm print in for two weeks - even if the film is a roaring success they cannot hold on to the print because it will have to go to another cinema."

He said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents. Also earlier this month the influential European Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of MEPs. The proposed law had a troubled passage through the European parliament. Its progress was delayed twice when Polish MEPs rejected plans to adopt it."

""If you have a blog, the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except 'Free Mojtaba and Arash Day',"" said Mr Hopkins. Many companies offer easy-to-use services to create a blog and publish it in minutes to a global community. The question of bloggers and what rights they have to say what they want on their sites is a thorny one and has received much press attention recently. ""That would mean you could see that phrase 7.1 million times. ""If you don't have one, find one dedicated to that - it takes about 30 seconds."" ""Some think of themselves as pundits, kind of like journalists, and some like me have a private blog which is just a publishing platform.

1840,"Of the 15 million that are swapped for newer models each year, only 25% get returned to mobile phone firms for recycling or re-use. Many of these older phones could end up in landfill sites leaking the potentially toxic materials they are made of into the wider world, said Mr Goodman. Older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model. ""We've heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back,"" said Mr Goodman, ""but there's a strong social argument too."" But the Forum found that more needed to be done to collect old phones rather than let them rot in landfill sites. The Forum for the Future report took an in-depth look at Romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular. But, he added, those keen to use a mobile will not accept any old handset. Georgeta Minciu, a Romanian part-time cleaner, said: ""Normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages. I am a single parent - keeping in touch with my daughter is important to me."" ""The affordability of the handsets is a real barrier to getting one,"" he said."
1841,"Details of the chip will be released at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in San Francisco. Special effects and graphics designed for films could be ported for use directly in a video game, Sony told an audience at the E3 exhibition in Los Angeles last year. Sony has said the Cell processor could be used to bridge the gap between movies and video games. The chip will be made of several different processing cores that work on tasks together. The PlayStation 3 is expected in 2006 but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch. Some details have already emerged, however. IBM said it would start producing the chip in early 2005 at manufacturing plants in the US. ""In the future, all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network,"" said Ken Kutaragi, chief operating officer of Sony, said last year. ""Current PC architecture is nearing its limits,"" he added."
1842,"Intel unveils laser breakthrough
Intel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light. The Intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade. Writing in the journal Nature, Dr Paniccia - and colleagues Haisheng Rong, Richard Jones, Ansheng Liu, Oded Cohen, Dani Hak and Alexander Fang - show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. ""We're trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas,"" said Dr Paniccia. Currently, says Dr Paniccia, telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials, such as gallium arsenide, used to make it. The breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information. Scientists at Intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light. Dr Paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it, some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material. ""It creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light,"" he said. Semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges."
1843,"Although details were scant, Mr Gates, said IE7 would include new protections against viruses, spyware and phishing scams. In a bid to shore up the poor security in IE 6, Microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware. Test versions of the new program, called IE 7, are due to be released by the summer. The announcement about Internet Explorer was made by Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief software architect, during a keynote speech at the RSA Security conference currently being held in San Francisco. There are also persistent rumours that search engine Google is poised to produce its own brand browser based on Firefox. Earlier this month it released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes - some of which were found in the IE browser. The decision to make Internet Explorer 7 is widely seen as a U-turn because, before now, Microsoft said it had no need to update the browser. Typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the Windows operating system. Estimates of how many users Firefox has won over vary widely. Internet Explorer still dominates with a share of about 90% but this is down from a peak of almost 96% in mid-2004."
1844,"Some readers were offered a price drop just 25p more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator, making it hardly worth while swapping. ""We expect these figures to leap in 2005. The survey found that BT and Tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them a lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription. A third of the 2,000 broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks Tim Danton, editor of PC Pro Magazine. Other found themselves tied into 12-month contracts. ""This breaks the code of practice, but because that code is voluntary there's nothing we or Ofcom can do to help,"" he said. 12% of those surveyed found themselves unable to swap at all. ""If you just stick with your current connection then there's every chance you're being ripped off,"" he warned."

Sun Microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour. ""Why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?"" Some of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5,000 processors each, Sun said. Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity. he asked in a webcast launching Sun's quarterly Network Computing event in California. It has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in IBM, which argues that its capacity on-demand service is cheaper than that offered by Sun. Hundreds of servers were used simultaneously, working on the problem for a few seconds each."
1846,"Tata Teleservices is using the lasers to make the link between customers' offices and its own core network. He said it was far easier to secure permission for putting networking hardware on roofs. The Lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to 4km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network. ""Heavy traffic and the layout under the ground mean that digging is uniquely difficult,"" he said. In some locations, he said, permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get. The hardware works in pairs and beam data through the air in the form of laser pulses. ""In this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task,"" said Mr R. Sridharan, vice president of networks at Tata. The laser links also take far less time to set up and get working, said Mr Sridharan. Just over 12 months ago the firm had customers in only about 70 towns and cities. But by the end of March the firm hopes to reach more than 1,000."

She added: ""Not everyone is a model in the world so we don't want just models in our games."" ""The 3D model will look exactly like the person - it's really quite incredible how detailed they are,"" said Ms Perry. Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performer's fee for the use of their image. ""But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one, the villain in another and just a merchant in a third."" ""We cannot give people any control over how the images are used."

1849,"The program makes spam look like it is being sent by legitimate mail servers making it hard to spot and filter out. Anti-spam group Spamhaus is warning about a novel virus which hides the origins of junk mail. Spamhaus helps to block junk messages from these machines by collecting and circulating blacklists of net addresses known to harbour infected machines. But the novel worm spotted recently by Spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place. In this way the junk mail gets a net address that looks legitimate. Mr Hogan said 90% of the junk mail filtered by Symantec subsidiary Brightmail was spotted using techniques that did not rely on looking at net addresses. ""They are adding to their armoury,"" he said. But Kevin Hogan, senior manager at Symantec security response, said such warnings were premature. ""If something like this mean the end of e-mail then e-mail would have stopped two-three years ago,"" said Mr Hogan. For instance, said Mr Hogan, filtering out e-mail messages that contain a web link can stop about 75% of spam."
1850,"None of the e-mail addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records. Ms Sanders said sending out spam e-mail to solicit donations was not DEC's style and that it would never canvass support in this way. The site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster. BT and DEC's hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down, she said. Warning over tsunami aid website
Net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims. Another tsunami-related e-mail is also circulating that carries the Zar worm which tries to spread via the familiar route of Microsoft's Outlook e-mail program. She said that DEC hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible. DEC was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation. One e-mail sent out in early January came from someone who claimed that he had lost his parents in the disaster and was asking for help moving an inheritance from a bank account in the Netherlands. Other scam e-mails included a link to a website that supposedly let people donate money but instead loaded spyware on their computers that grabbed confidential information."
1851,"But what does it do and how does it work? Piero gives rugby perspective
BBC Sport unveils its new analysis tool Piero at the Wales v England rugby union match on Saturday. But the England players are incensed - arguing that the pass was forward and the try should not stand. In the past, sports fans would be left debating the validity of the try for days and weeks to come. But BBC Sport's new tool Piero could end discussions in minutes. ""We want to appeal to core fans - to give them more analysis, more detail, more definitive answers about key passages of play."" ""It allows us to tell the story of a passage of play, tracking individual players across the field, looking at tactics,"" said Andy Townsend, from BBC Broadcast. Viewers will be able to see precisely how the ball was thrown and by whom, giving a greater depth to the growing wealth of analysis available during sports broadcasts. The more cameras using Piero, the better the detail possible out the other end when the data is turned into 3D models. Mr Townsend said sports performance companies were already showing an interest in the technology."
1852,"Open source leaders slam patents
The war of words between Microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as Linux founder Linus Torvalds led an attack on software patents. Some panel members are worried that Microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future. It relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles, which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees. Other companies are expected to follow suit. This is a view corroborated by the UK Patent Office. ""Some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they can't afford to take them to court,"" said Dr Jeremy Philpott of the UK Patent Office. Microsoft did not want to comment directly, referring the issue instead to trade body Intellect, of which it is a member."
1853,"Reboot ordered for EU patent law
A European Parliament committee has ordered a rewrite of the proposals for controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions. Supporters say it would let firms protect their inventions. The draft law suffered setbacks when Poland, one of the largest EU member states, rejected its adoption twice in two months. Only two MEPs backed the draft law at the JURI meeting, with one voting to abstain. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its ""one-click shopping"" service, for example. Intense lobbying on the issue has started to gain momentum in some national parliaments putting them under immense pressure. Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US."
1854,"An estimated 12 million Britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs. Activcard's method is more complex. Several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords, which are easily compromised and easy to forget. It means that in a typical security attack, explains Mr Ash, even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites, they need the passcode. ""By the time they go back [to use the information], the code has expired, so they can't prove who they are,"" according to Mr Ash. It is a 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack,"" said Mr Ash. ""You take the card, put it in the reader, enter your pin number, and a code is given. ""The end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both."" The method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time. ""The PDA or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around,"" he said."
1855,"That was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3GSM World Congress in Cannes last week. The system is not available commercially yet, but Motorola, the US mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operators on HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now. ""While HSDPA theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14Mbps, practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide-area networks,"" said Dr Alastair Brydon, author of the Analysys report: Pushing Beyond the Limits of 3G with HSDPA and Other Enhancements. Early HSDPA systems typically offer around two megabits per second (Mbps) compared with less than 384 kilobits per second (Kbps) on standard 3G networks. ""The typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which, even at this lower rate, will more than double the capacity... when compared to basic WCDMA [3G],"" he added. As part of $3bn in multi-year contracts announced late last year, Sprint will spend around $1bn on EV-DO technology from Lucent Technologies, Nortel Networks and Motorola that provides average data speeds of 0.3-0.5 megabits a second, and peak download rates of 2.4Mbps. But one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately. Motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2.9Mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3G cell using a single HSDPA device. Siemens' plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today, but Christoph Caselitz, president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that: ""By the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015, the need for transmission capacities for voice, data, image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10."" This enables a data transmission, such as sending a big file or video, to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band."
1856,"But a spokesman for the UN's World Summit on the Information Society said the digital divide remained very real. ""Developing countries are catching up with the rich world in terms of access [to mobile networks],"" the report said. The report's figures surpass a WSIS campaign goal that calls for 50% access to telephones by 2015. Sixty percent of resources collected by the fund will be made available for projects in least developed countries, 30% for projects in developing countries, and 10% for projects in developed countries. ""Africa is part of a worldwide trend of rapid rollout... this applies to countries rich and poor, reformed or not, African, Asian, European and Latin American."" Under the proposals agreed, voluntary contribution of 1% on contracts obtained by private technology service providers could be made to the Digital Solidarity Fund. ""The fund is voluntary and will help finance local community-based projects,"" said the WSIS spokesman. The exact financing mechanism of the fund is to be ironed out in the coming days, said the WSIS."
1857,"""The purpose of this new government service is to ensure computer users are aware of the risks involved and how to deal with them easily and effectively without causing alarm."" ""IT Safe will take our technical expertise and use it to help home users understand the risks and keep their computer systems, mobile phones and a range of related consumer electronic items, safe,"" said Roger Cumming, director of the National Infrastructure Security Coordination Centre (NISCC). Alerts tell people how the threats affect them and what they can do to avoid trouble and protect themselves. The alerts will tell people how to go about getting hold of patches from security firms. The service, IT Safe, will issue warnings about damaging viruses, software vulnerabilities and weaknesses on devices such as mobile phones. UK gets official virus alert site
A rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems is being launched by the UK government. However no software patches or programs will actually be dispensed through the site. It was estimated that almost 13 million of these were able to access the internet in 2004. In September 2004, the number of malicious programs circulating topped the 100,000 mark. Some fear that this figure could hit 150,000 by September 2005."
1858,"Iran jails blogger for 14 years
An Iranian weblogger has been jailed for 14 years on charges of spying and aiding foreign counter-revolutionaries. A spokesman for Reporters Without Borders, which tracks press freedom across the globe, described Mr Sigarchi's sentence as ""harsh"" and called on Iranian President Mohammed Khatami to work to secure his immediate release. ""The authorities are trying to make an example of him,"" the organisation said in a statement. Iranian authorities have arrested about 20 online journalists during the current crackdown. Mr Sigarchi was sentenced one day after an online campaign highlighted his case in a day of action in defence of bloggers around the world. They accused Mr Sigarchi of a string of crimes against Iranian state, including espionage, insulting the founder of Iran's Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei, and current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. ""The mullahs won't be able to make a move without it be spread across the blogosphere."" Around 10,000 people visited the campaign's website during the day. Curt Hopkins said Mr Sigarchi's sentence would not dent the resolve of bloggers joining the campaign to help highlight the case. ""The eyes of 8 million bloggers are going to be more focused on Iran since Sigarchi's sentence, not less."
1859,"The anti-spyware program being targeted is currently only in beta form and aims to help users find and remove spyware - programs which monitor internet use, causes advert pop-ups and slow a PC's performance. Microsoft said in a statement it is investigating what it called a criminal attack on its software. The program attempts to disable or delete Microsoft's anti-spyware tool and suppress warning messages given to users. Earlier this week, Microsoft said it would buy anti-virus software maker Sybari Software to improve its security in its Windows and e-mail software. Microsoft has said it plans to offer its own paid-for anti-virus software but it has not yet set a date for its release."
1860,"HP, the world's biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit. HP ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change. The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the US who has purchased an HP inkjet printer since February 2001. ""The smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a built-in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer,"" the suit said. The lawsuit is asking for restitution, damages and other compensation."
1861,"The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) also said it had succeeded in getting a network called LokiTorrent closed down. Movie body hits peer-to-peer nets
The movie industry has struck out at file-sharing networks with another round of lawsuits in the US. A stark message has appeared on the site from the MPAA warning ""You can click, but you can't hide"". A Dallas court agreed that Hollywood lawyers would be allowed access to LokiTorrent's server records which could let them single out those who were sharing files illegally. The MPAA began its legal campaign against operators of similar networks across four continents in December. They host links, called ""trackers"" that direct people to others that have it instead. The strategy of hitting those who run the servers which link to copyrighted material is intended to stunt file-sharers' ability to swap content using BitTorrent systems. In October 2004, the site had provided links to more than 30,000 files. But it is now targeting the operators of BitTorrent networks themselves."
1862,"The messages warn that their internet use has been monitored by the FBI's Internet Fraud Complaint Center. An attachment in the e-mail contains the virus, the FBI said. But rather than being a questionnaire, the attachment contains a virus that infects the recipient's computer, according to the agency. The bureau is investigating the phoney e-mails. The agency earlier this month shut down fbi.gov accounts, used to communicate with the public, because of a security breach. A spokeswoman said the two incidents appear to be unrelated."
1863,"The company, which hopes to keep its dominant place in the digital music market, also said the gold coloured version of the mini would be dropped. Digital music players are now the gadget of choice among young Americans, according to recent research by the Pew Internet and American Life Project. ""They have created a very seamless package which I think is the idea of the product - the design, function and the software are very impressive,"" he said. He added that the threat from others was always present, however. Creative was very upbeat about how many of its Creative Zen players it had shipped by the end of last year, he said. The latest models have a longer battery life and their prices have been cut by an average of £40. During 2004 about 25 million portable players were sold, 10 million of which were Apple iPods. It will have 5GB of memory on board. But analysts agree that the success is also down to its integration with the iTunes online store, which has given the company a 70% share of the legal download music market. Mike McGuire, a research director at analyst Gartner, told the BBC News website that Apple had done a good job in ""sealing off the market from competition"" so far."
1864,"Unlike other devices where the user has to check which high-speed network is available to transfer data, the device selects the fastest one itself. ""One in five European workers are already mobile - meaning they spend significant time travelling and out of the office,"" Rene Obermann, T-Mobile's chief executive, told a press conference at the 3GSM trade show in Cannes. He added: ""What they need is their office when they are out of the office."" T-Mobile bets on 'pocket office'
T-Mobile has launched its latest ""pocket office"" third-generation (3G) device which also has built-in wi-fi - high-speed wireless net access. The service, which has been developed with Southern trains, Nomad Digital (who provide the technology), begins with a free trial on 16 trains on the route from early March to the end of April. Reflecting the growing need to be connected outside the office, it announced it would introduce a flat-fee £20 ($38) a month wi-fi tariff for people in the UK using its wi-fi hotspots. A full service is set to follow in the summer. Brian McBride, managing director of T-Mobile in the UK, said: ""We see a growing trend for business users needing to access e-mail securely on the move. ""We are able to offer this by maintaining a constant data session for the entire journey."" He said this was something other similar in-train wi-fi services, such as that offered on GNER trains, did not offer yet."
1865,"Hotspot users gain free net calls
People using wireless net hotspots will soon be able to make free phone calls as well as surf the net. Its paid service - dubbed Skype Out - has so far attracted 940,000 users. The company is due to launch wi-fi on Virgin Trains later in the year. It plans to add more paid services with forthcoming launches of video conferencing, voice mail and Skype In, a service which would allow users to receive phone calls from landlines and mobiles. London-based software developer Connectotel has unveiled software that will expand the SMS functions of Skype, allowing users to send text messages to mobile phones from the service. ""Skype's success at spreading the world about internet telephony is well-known and we are delighted to be offering free access to Skype users in our hotspots,"" commented Broadreach chief executive Magnus McEwen-King."
1866,"""RipGuard is designed to... reduce DVD ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer,"" said the firm. The new technology will be welcomed by Hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from DVD sales. ""Ultimately, we see RipGuard DVD... evolving beyond anti-piracy, and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions, interoperability in tomorrow's digital home, and the upcoming high-definition formats,"" said Steve Weinstein, executive vice president and general manager of Macrovision's Entertainment Technologies Group. Macrovision said the new technology will work in ""nearly all"" current DVD players when applied to the discs, but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with RipGuard. Those copies could then be burned onto a blank DVD or uploaded for exchange to a peer-to-peer network. RipGuard is expected to be rolled out on DVDs from the middle of 2005, the company said. Macrovision has said that Rip Guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti-copying measures."
1867,"The EFF says the case threatens the basic freedoms of the press. Apple attacked over sources row
Civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has joined a legal fight between three US online journalists and Apple. The case began in December 2004 when Apple asked a local Californian court to get the journalists to reveal their sources for articles published on websites AppleInsider.com and PowerPage.org. ""Rather than confronting the issue of reporter's privilege head-on, Apple is going to the journalist's ISPs for his e-mails,"" said EFF lawyer Kurt Opsahl. ""This undermines a fundamental First Amendment right that protects all reporters. Apple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code-named Asteroid and has asked the journalists' e-mail providers to hand over communications relevant to that. Apple was not immediately available for comment."
1868,"Portable gadgets dominate the list, including Sharp's 902 3G mobile phone, the Pentax Optio SV digital camera and Samsung's Yepp YH-999 video jukebox. That is £1,000 cheaper than last year's list due to falling manufacturing costs making gadgets more affordable. We've got to the point where we can't live our lives without certain technology,"" said Adam Vaughan, editor of Stuff Essentials. The spring launch of the PSP in the UK is eagerly awaited by gaming fans. ""Take digital cameras, who would now pay to develop an entire film of photos? Or legitimate downloads, who would travel miles to a record shop when they could download the song in minutes for 70p?"" he asks."
1869,"The annual awards recognise the best in digital media. The BBC collected three awards, including best online entertainment for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Adventure Game. It was recognised for its ""groundbreaking"" use of animation. Bafta's Grant Dean, chair of Bafta's Interactive Entertainment committee, said all the entrants had been of ""outstanding quality"" and that judging had been ""enormously difficult"". ""Without a doubt, 2005 has been a landmark year for the Bafta Interactive Awards,"" he added. The National Theatre's Stagework website picked up the prize for best learning as well as top factual site. ""Many of the top awards this year have gone to the companies we most commonly associate with traditional entertainment, showing how the gap between new media, film and television is closing."" The top music award was given to SSEYO miniMIXA, a mobile music sequencer designed to let people write, edit and share compositions. On Tuesday Half-Life 2 dominated the games prizes."
1870,"A study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that MP3 players are the gadget of choice among affluent young Americans. Broadband access plays a big part in ownership too. Of the 22 million Americans who own MP3 players, 59% are men compared to 41% of women. Almost one in five US citizens aged under 30 have one. The influence of children also plays a part. The ease of use and growth of music available on the net are the main factors for the upsurge in ownership, the survey found. ""IPods and MP3 players are becoming a mainstream technology for consumers"" said Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Internet and American Life Project. ""More growth in the market is inevitable as new devices become available, as new players enter the market, and as new social uses for iPods/MP3 players become popular,"" he added."
1871,"The law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year. In a letter, EC President Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso told the President of the European Parliament, Josep Borrell, that the Commission ""did not intend to refer a new proposal to the Parliament and the Council (of ministers)"" as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in May 2004. Some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions, while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms The EC says the Council of Ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last May but said it would review ""all aspects of the directive"". Most EU legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the Council of Ministers before it becomes law. French Green MEP Alain Lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the Commission ignored the Parliament's request it would be an ""insult"" to the assembly. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its ""one-click shopping"" service, for example. Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US."
1872,"So-called ASCII codes are used to represent European languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called Unicode is used. They are used so people can more easily navigate the web. The resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a Russian 'a' look just like an English 'a'. A fake Paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant Verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the Internationalised Domain Name (IDN) system, said Mr Dyer. But the computer code would be different, and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. So, for example, website PayPal could now be coded using a mixture of the Latin alphabet and the Russian alphabet. This is more than just a theory. ""A rush to introduce IDN-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in IDNs - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-English speaking world,"" the organisation said in a statement. Mr Dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world's browsers. Another solution, to introduce IDN-disabled browsers could be a case of ""throwing out the baby with the bath water,"" he said."
1873,"Currently, rich multimedia features tend to be on more expensive handsets. More than 50 million people own a mobile in the UK, but mobile operators are keen to encourage people to move onto more sophisticated handsets that can do more. ""We're going to drive them down into meat-and-potatoes phones that have the largest market share,"" said Doug Rasor, a marketing vice president at Texas. The specially-designed chip, developed by Texas Instruments, could drive down the cost of making mobiles capable of 3D gaming and 30-frame-a-second video. But it faces stiff competition from the likes of Intel which is also looking to provide better chips for high-end mobiles. Competition to get people using 3G mobiles will grow in the next year as almost all of the UK's operators have now launched third generation networks. Many consumers are still to be convinced though. A recent survey by Sony Ericsson predicted that the number of 3G handsets sold in 2005 would double from 2004 to account for 10% of all phones sold. Many said they were confused about the different ways to pay for phones and the vast array of features most have onboard."
1874,"Mr Wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music, and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work. The software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels - ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end. ""The images have three dimensions and I had to find a way of reading them myself,"" Mr Wong told the BBC News website. He tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot. In order to have an exact reference to the screen, a pen and tablet device is used. ""As the notes increase in pitch I know the colour's getting redder and redder, and in my mind's eye a patch of red appears."" ""If I took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it, it wouldn't work that well."" Mr Wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a ""colour memory"" makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision."
1875,"But a Microsoft spokeswoman confirmed that it would not be at GDC. Xbox 2 may be unveiled in summer
Details of the next generation of Microsoft's Xbox games console - codenamed Xenon - will most likely be unveiled in May, according to reports. But earlier this year, Microsoft said it had reached a European milestone, selling five million consoles since its European launch in March 2002. Gamers are looking forward to the next generation of machines because they will have much more processing and graphical power. Microsoft had delivered development kits to EA, but he said the company was still waiting on Sony and Nintendo's kits. But the battle between the rival consoles to win gamers' hearts and thumbs will be extremely hard-fought. Sony has traditionally dominated the console market with its PlayStation 2. In his keynote speech, Mr Gates only referred to it as playing an essential part of his vision of the digital lifestyle. Hit games like Halo 2, which was released in November, helped to buoy the sales figures. But, he added, the PlayStation 3 was rumoured to have ""a little more under the hood [than Xbox 2]""."
1876,"Microsoft launches its own search
Microsoft has unveiled the finished version of its home-grown search engine. Google still reigns supreme as the site people turn to most often when they go online to answer a query, keep up with news or search for images. Tony Macklin, director of product at Ask Jeeves, pointed out that its search engine has been answering specific queries this way since April 2003. For its direct answer feature, Microsoft is calling on its Encarta encyclopaedia to provide answers to questions about definitions, facts, calculations, conversions and solutions to equations. To generate its corpus of data, Microsoft has indexed 5 billion webpages and claims to update its document index every two days - more often than rivals. ""The major search providers have moved beyond delivering only algorithmic search, so in many ways Microsoft is following the market,"" he said. Tools sitting alongside the MSN search engine allow users to refine results to specific websites, countries, regions or languages. The test, or beta, version of the MSN search engine unveiled in November had a few teething troubles. On its first day many new users keen to try it were greeted with a page that said the site had been overwhelmed."
1877,"Moving mobile improves golf swing
A mobile phone that recognises and responds to movements has been launched in Japan. Those who prefer shoot-'em-ups will be able to use the phone like a gun to shoot the zombies in the mobile version of Sega's House of the Dead. The phone comes with a tiny motion-control sensor, a computer chip that responds to movement. Devised mainly for mobile gaming, users can also access other phone functions using a pre-set pattern of arm movements. It is being recommended for the karaoke market. Users have to select a sound from a menu that includes clapping, tambourine and maracas and shake their phone to create a beat. The phone will initially be available in Japan only and is due to go on sale in mid-February."
1878,"While virus traffic has slowed down, denial of service attacks are on the increase according to the firm. Junk e-mails on relentless rise
Spam traffic is up by 40%, putting the total amount of e-mail that is junk up to an astonishing 90%. The figures, from e-mail management firm Email Systems, will alarm firms attempting to cope with the amount of spam in their in-boxes. ""January is clearly a month when consumers are less motivated to purchase financial products or put money into dubious financial opportunities,"" said Neil Hammerton, managing director of Email Systems. ""Spammers seem to have adapted their output to reflect this, focussing instead on medically motivated and pornographic offers, presumably intentionally intended to coincide with what is traditionally considered to be the bleakest month in the calendar,"" he said."
1879,"The two giants in the field - ESPN and EA Sports - have been locked in a heavyweight battle for years. The latter is the world's largest games manufacturer. Some particularly disgruntled fans set up an online petition that notched more than 18,000 virtual signatures. So, will the Sega - ESPN range be missed? Many of those clicking to complain were already rankled, for the ESPN coup happened just weeks after EA had pulled off another enormous licensing deal, controversially giving them exclusive rights to teams and personnel from America&#191;s National Football League (NFL). The ESPN games are a touch more arcade-like in look and feel and are slightly easier to get into, although like their rivals, they also offer a dizzyingly-extensive array of in-game tricks and overall challenge modes that should be enough to quench thirsts of even the most die-hard of sports fans. Taking hockey and basketball as examples, both publishers' efforts are phenomenally entertaining and fairly accessible. In terms of gameplay, I marginally preferred EA's NBA Live 2005 for basketball, and was more satisfied ice hockey-wise by ESPN's NHL 2K5. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the ESPN deal will be seeing how it affects the presentation of EA's future titles. They are neat and excellent-value games in their current form, and combining them with EA's own established brand should produce a truly formidable beast."
1880,"Burnout 3 won three awards in the categories for racing, technical direction and best PlayStation 2 game. The game also won Baftas for best action adventure, best PC game, art direction and animation. Grant Dean, chairman of the Bafta games awards, said at a ceremony in London on Tuesday: ""The last year has been a great year for the interactive entertainment industry. ""These awards reflect the enormous achievements, progress and diversity that we have seen in that time."" Bafta said the ""significant feature"" of this year's awards was the number of ""non-traditional games"". The Handheld Award went to Colin McRae Rally 2005 while the mobile category was won by Blue Tooth Byplanes."
1881,"""These speed increases will give people the opportunity to do a lot more with their broadband connections,"" he said. He added: ""Ninety percent of our customers will see real increases in speed. The increased speeds will come at no extra charge and follows a similar move by internet service provider AOL. Upload speeds - the speed at which information is sent from a PC via broadband - will remain at the same speed, said Mr Ingram. Many BT customers will now have download speeds of 2Mbps, although there are usage allowances of between one gigabyte and 30 gigabytes a month. ""The allowances are extremely generous,"" said Mr Ingram ""For what we are seeing in the market place - they are really not an issue."" Despite the increases, BT will continue to have usage allowances for home customers. But Mr Ingram said it was important to ""separate hype from reality"". Mr Ingram said there would be a roll out across the network in order to prevent any problems."
1882,"""Mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the PC music experience as the handsets are not yet ready,"" said Thomas Husson, mobile analyst at Jupiter research. ""Mobile music services should be new and different, and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches."" Mobile TV will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though, said the report. People are also likely to be put off watching TV on such small screens, said Gartner. The mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading, after the success of Apple's iTunes, Napster and other net music download services. A report by analysts InStat/MDR has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by 44% over the next five years. TV services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital TV generation too, which expects good quality images at low prices, according to analysts. It says that smartphones will make up 117 million out of 833 million handsets shipped globally by 2009. Operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles, as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. More powerful smartphones like the XDA II, Nokia 6600, SonyEricsson P900 and the Orange E200, offering web access, text and multimedia messaging, e-mail, calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common."
1883,"Four other important fixes were also released. A further patch fixes a hole in Media Player, Windows Messenger and MSN Messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through .png files. These were considered to be less critical, however. The number of holes considered ""critical"" is more than usual. Many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely, install programs, change, and delete or see data. Its latest releases came the week that the company announced it was to buy security software maker Sybari Software as part of Microsoft's plans to make its own security programs. One of the critical patches Microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some IE flaws."
1884,"The survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in Europe was low. The firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of RFID technology. More than half (55%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that RFID tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. Concern over RFID tags
Consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency ID (RFID) tags in shops, a survey says. The tags are currently being used at one Tesco distribution centre in the UK - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. ""Acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns. ""With the right RFID approach and ongoing communication with consumers, the industry can reach this point."" He said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. All kinds of personal belongings, including clothes, could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners, it warned."
1885,"How much Ask Jeeves paid for Bloglines was not revealed. The Bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read, search and share all the blogs they are interested in. The acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. Google acquired Pyra Labs, makers of the Blogger software, in 2003. Though Mr Lanzone added that Ask Jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries Bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology. He said Ask Jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it. ""Our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away,"" he said. There would be no instant sweeping changes to Bloglines, said Mr Lanzone. ""Being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right,"" said Mr Lanzone. Rumours about the acquisition were broken by the Napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from Ask Jeeves insiders."
1886,"He said one laptop per child could be "" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood"". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. Digital guru floats sub-$100 PC
Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53). He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, ""We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. ""Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months."" ""In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks."
1887,"This means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade, said Gartner. More likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics, as well as music services. ""All the markets grew apart from Japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western Europe,"" mobile analyst Carolina Milanesi told the BBC News website. ""People are after something that is nice-looking, and together with that, there is the entertainment side. ""They already have TV, music, ringtones, cameras, and all that we can think of on mobiles, so people have stopped buying replacement phones."" But the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the iPod. This was not a ""women's thing"", she said, but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. Third generation mobiles (3G) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer, like video, could drive people into upgrading their phones, but Ms Milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen. It was not just about how the phone functioned, but about what it said about its owner. In July last year, Motorola and Apple announced a version of iTunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with Motorola mobile phones."

""We were certainly not sophisticated or civilised,"" Mr Yang told reporters ahead of the anniversary, which will be officially recognised on 2 March. They did have business brains however, and in April 1995 persuaded venture capitalists Sequoia Capital, which also invested in Apple Computer and Cisco Systems, to fund Yahoo to the tune of $2m (£1.04m). ""In just one decade, the internet has changed the way consumers do just about everything - and it's been a remarkable and wonderful experience,"" he said.

1890,"The rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. Websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for. The swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. ""People did not know they were being offered a subscription service."" ""Everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct,"" said Andrew Bud, regulatory head of the MEF and executive chairman of messaging firm MBlox. ""The consumer has a right to be protected,"" he said. But fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers, said Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone. ""The mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality,"" said Mr Flynn. ""We do not have to say why. We can just cut them off."""
1891,"Creator of first Apple Mac dies
Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer, has died. The 1984 release of the Mac reflected Mr Raskin's belief that good design should make computers easy to use. Users navigated around the machine using a mouse and by pointing, clicking and dragging. However, in 1979 he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap, aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use. But the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by Apple in its pioneering Lisa computer. ""His role on the Macintosh was the initiator of the project, so it wouldn't be here if it weren't for him,"" said Andy Hertzfeld, an early Macintosh team member. Although Mr Raskin drove the team that created the Macintosh he did not stay at Apple to see it released. Mr Raskin joined Apple in 1978 as employee number 31, initially to lead the company's publications department. He was also an accomplished musician, played three instruments and conducted San Francisco's Chamber Opera Society."
1892,"A fifth rely entirely on mobiles. Most 15 to 24-year-olds (94%), and 25 to 34-year-olds (92%), own at least one. It is thought that about 10,000 phones are lost or stolen every month and 50% of total street crime involves a mobile. ""We're a nation of lazy so-and-sos,"" David Noone from Intervoice said. ""We put the numbers in our phones so we can call a friend at the touch of just one or two buttons and we certainly can't be bothered to write them down in an old fashioned address book. Nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts' information again if the phone was lost, stolen or replaced. ""The mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships; take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart."" Most (62%) said they had no idea what their partner's number was. Generally, information from Sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards, or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is a smartphone model with the right software. O2 also offers a free, web-based syncing service which works over GPRS and GSM."
1893,"PVRs record TV programmes to a hard drive, letting viewers pause, and rewind live television and effectively ""time shift"" the viewing experience. A number of PVRs incorporating Freeview digital terrestrial TV are also on the market but their success is limited. PVRs and recordable DVD players are set to replace video recorders as the standard method of recording and saving favourite TV programmes. The box has three tuners, which means viewers can record two channels simultaneously while watching a third channel. Sky also charges a £10 subscription fee to the service, unless viewers have a subscription to one of its premium packages. Eric Tveter, president and chief operating officer at Telewest Broadband, said: ""We will make our PVR set-top box available later this year, putting a stop to missed soaps, interrupted films and arguments over which programmes to record."" Last year, high street retailer Dixons said it was going to stop selling VHS machines in favour of PVRs and recordable DVD machines."
1894,"It is being used by Futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom. 'Lite' versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles - persuading developers to write for the educational market. The game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from a variety of outputs, before and after racing. ""Learning games were somewhat old-fashioned and we didn't see anyone else doing what we wanted to do,"" said Dr Carl Gavin, managing director of Lateral Visions. Professor Angela MacFarlane, based at Bristol University, has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms. ""Games in the classroom need to support the teacher. This fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to Futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved, thinks Mr Owen. Use of games in schools has been patchy she found, with Sim City proving the most popular. ""Even in Grand Theft Auto it is not just the violence that engages people,"" he said. It could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though."
1895,"At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month, several hi-tech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment. They provide vital juice for billions of mobile phones, PDAs (personal digital assistants), digital cameras, camcorders, and digital music players. The initiative, which was also launched at CES, rewards 10 to 28-year-olds for returning unused phones. ""There is still low-level awareness right now, but it is on the rise - the highest level of awareness is in Europe."" The EPA is already working with several companies which make more than 22% of power supplies on the market. ""There is more and more awareness on the consumer side, but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free,"" Intel's Allen Wilson told the BBC News website. The US consumer electronics market is set to grow by over 11% in 2005. Initiatives like this are critical; if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now, consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than 40% of electricity used in US homes, said the EPA. But it is not just computers that cause a problem for the environment. Mr Heine told the BBC News website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes ""learned behaviour""."
1896,"Once logged onto an Evil Twin, sensitive data can be intercepted. ""Users can also protect themselves by ensuring that their wi-fi device has its security measures activated,"" he added. The latest threat, nicknamed evil twins, pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations, say Cranfield University experts. ""Cybercriminals don't have to be that clever to carry out such an attack,"" said Dr Phil Nobles, a wireless net and cybercrime expert at Cranfield. The number of hotspots is expected to reach 200,000 by 2008, according to analysts. A wireless network that is not protected can provide a backdoor into a company's computer system. He said BT Openzone, as well as others, have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at a hotspot. ""BT advises that customers should change all default settings, make sure that their security settings on all equipment are configured correctly,"" said Mr Clark. ""Because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency."" Some companies have been reluctant to use them in large numbers because of fears about security."
1897,"Market analysts Panlogic predicts that net users in China will exceed the 137 million US users of the net by 2008. By contrast in China workplace machines are relatively rare. Net use in China was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the country's eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities. Government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages Chinese people would not see anywhere else. The arrival of foreign banks in China, due in 2006, could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare, said Mr Makower. ""Net usage tends to happen in the evening,"" said Mr Makower, ""they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf&#233;."" ""Its real value is as an open window onto what's happening elsewhere in the world,"" he said. What people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of Chinese life. ""Generally it's more difficult for the government to be able to control it."" ""It's a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it,"" said Mr Makower."
1898,"The pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250,000 (£130,000) fine. New Yorker William Trowbridge and Texan Michael Chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. US peer-to-peer pirates convicted
The first convictions for piracy over peer-to-peer networks have been handed down in the US. The piracy group called itself the Underground Network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. During its investigation FBI agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies, 40 software programs, 13 games and 178 ""sound recordings"" from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. In total, six raids were carried out in August. They also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage."
1899,"It only searches US channel content currently. It should expand over time to include content from more channels, said a Google spokesperson. Google launches TV search service
The net search giant Google has launched a search service that lets people look for TV programmes. ""Ultimately, we would like to have all TV programming indexed."" But there were few clues from Google about when more global broadcasters would be included. It offers direct links to websites with movies or other clips relevant to the search query, but does not pinpoint when the search query occurred. ""Over time, we plan to increase the number of television channels and video content available via Google Video but don't have more product details to share with you today,"" a Google spokesperson told the BBC News website. A smaller service, blinkx.tv, was launched last month. It searches for and links to TV news, film trailers, and other video and audio clips."
1900,"Viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer. Now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms, or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments. ""It's about outright criminality now,"" said Mr Simpson, explaining why this change has come about. Few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written, many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data. No longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors. ""In many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now,"" he said. ""The main motivation now is money,"" said Gary Stowell, spokesman for St Bernard software. As the tactics used by malicious programs change, said Mr King, so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves. ""If you think of criminals they do not do clever,"" said Mr King, ""they just do what works."" Mr Stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high."
1901,"The rise of blogs has spawned a new desire for immediate news and information, with six million Americans now using RSS aggregators. RSS aggregators are downloaded to PCs and are programmed to subscribe to feeds from blogs, news sites and other websites. Despite the explosive growth, more than 60% of online Americans have still never heard of blogs, the survey found. Getting involved is becoming more popular though, with 12% saying they had posted material or comments on other people's blogs. Only 7% of the 120 million US adults who use the internet had created a blog or web-based diary. Kerry voters were slightly more likely to read them than Bush voters. Blog creators were likely to be young, well-educated, net-savvy males with good incomes and college educations, the survey found. This was also true of the average blog reader, although the survey found there was a greater than average growth in blog readership among women and those in minorities."
1902,"Worries about cyber-crime and sabotage have prompted many employers to consider monitoring employees. Software watching while you work
Software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a PC but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing has been unveiled. More and more firms are finding themselves in deep water as a result of data misuse. Ironically the impetus for developing the system came as a result of the Freedom of Information Act, which requires companies to store all data for a certain amount of time. The storage system has been incorporated into an application developed by security firm 3ami which allows every action on a computer to be logged. Privacy advocates are concerned that monitoring at work is not only damaging to employee's privacy but also to the relationship between employers and their staff. Potentially it could help employers to follow the trail of stolen files and pinpoint whether they had been emailed to a third party, copied, printed, deleted or saved to CD, floppy disk, memory stick or flash card. ""That is not the case,"" said Tim Ellsmore, managing director of 3ami. ""It is not about replacing dialogue but there are issues that you can talk through but you still need proof,"" he said."
1903,"In December, Poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. ""There was at one point the intention to put the item on today's agenda. But in the end we could not put it on,"" an EU spokesman told the Reuters agency. He added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law. New delay hits EU software laws
A fresh delay has hit controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions. Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its ""one-click shopping"" service."
1904,"It also shows that few can spot the difference between paid-for results and organic ones. According to figures gathered by the Pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 1.9 webpages for each hunt. A significant chunk of net users, 36%, carry out a search at least weekly and 29% of those asked only look every few weeks. Search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it. The remaining 33% said they could not live without search sites. Despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes. More than two-thirds of those questioned, 68%, said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net. Commenting Mr Macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference. Only 18% of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not. Said the Pew report: ""This finding is ironic, since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results."""
1905,"Games firms 'face tough future'
UK video game firms face a testing time as they prepare for the next round of games consoles, the industry warns. Mr Hasson said: ""In the last four years we have probably lost a third of independent developers."" Microsoft has said repeatedly that it wants to be first to the market and some analysts predict that Xbox 2 will be released in the US before the end of 2005. ""Once the cull has finished its likely to present those still standing with great opportunities,"" he said. Mr Hasson said the industry was predicting that developments costs and teams were likely to need to double in order to cope with the demands of the new machines. ""As consoles get more powerful, the content gets more detailed and that means more cost,"" said Gary Dunn, development director at Codemasters, which develops games in house and also publishes titles. He added: ""We have been through five technology transitions and survived so far. Jason Kingsley, chief executive of Rebellion, said the transition from the current generation of consoles to the new machines was difficult because ""the production quality expected by consumers will be that much bigger"". ""There are still some developers who were involved in games from the bedroom coding days. ""If companies are hiring bigger and bigger teams, at some point the talent is going to run out."""
1906,"It will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates, but their options would be ""limited"". Microsoft makes anti-piracy move
Microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its Windows operating system by restricting their access to security features. Microsoft's Windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. But Graham Cluley, senior consultant at security firm Sophos, told the BBC News website that it was a positive decision. ""It sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of Windows is good news for everyone who uses the net,"" he said. It is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in China, Norway and the Czech Republic, where pirated software is a huge problem, by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies Windows. The company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. Software piracy has cost the company billions, it says. Windows Genuine Advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in September 2004 for English-language versions of Windows. ""China in particular is a problem, with piracy estimated at 92%,"" said Mr Cluley."
1907,"Rival Sony has said it will launch its first handheld console, the PSP, in the US and Europe before the end of March. The launch price of £99 (149 euros) compares favourably with the US price of $149, according to John Houlihan, editor of the Computerandvideogames.com magazine. The DS is backwards compatible with the Game Boy Advance, allowing the earlier machine's back catalogue of 700 games to be played. ""It's a very, very competitive price point. Mr Houlihan believes that there is likely to be an audience for both the Nintendo DS and Sony's new PSP, with the former aimed largely at a younger audience and the latter expected to be marketed as a multimedia device. There are some innovative features, and Nintendo has created quite a buzz,"" he says. Nintendo said 15 games would be available in the UK at launch, with prices ranging from £19 to £29. ""However, the line-up of games could have been stronger. Everyone wanted to see the eight-player Mario Kart DS, for example."" ""The PSP is a sexy bit of kit, but Sony's attitude to the PSP has been very understated in Europe, so far,"" Mr Houlihan said."
1908,"Smart search lets art fans browse
If you don't know art but know what you like, new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting. A variety of paintings will then be shown to the user, based partly on the keywords and partly on luck. It 'chooses' a selection of pictures, by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them. For Richard Tateson, who worked on the ArtGarden project, the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration. The text-based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer, neither of which he found helpful. He ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead. The technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity, which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection. ""It is much more akin to wandering through the gallery,"" said Jemima Rellie, head of the Tate's digital programme. ""I went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for Christmas but I didn't have a clue what I wanted,"" he said. ""You don't arrive at Tate Britain and tell people what you want to see."
1909,"Sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms, competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers, said Andrew Pearson, European boss of Workshare which commissioned the research. As documents get passed around, worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds its way into documents. ""The efficiencies the internet has brought in such as instant access to information have also created security and control issues too,"" he said. Microsoft recommends that the tool is used before people publish any Word document. Workshare surveyed firms around the world and found that, on average, 31% of documents contained legally sensitive information but in many firms up to three-quarters fell in to the high risk category. ""The Remove Hidden Data add-in is a tool that you can use to remove personal or hidden data that might not be immediately apparent when you view the document in your Microsoft Office application,"" says the instructions on Microsoft's website. A tool for Apple machines running Word is not available. Few firms have any knowledge of the existence of this so-called metadata about the changes that a document has gone through or that it can be reconstructed. Often, said Mr Pearson, this sensitive information was invisible because it got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared. Problems with documents could mean trouble for firms as regulatory bodies step up scrutiny and compliance laws start to bite, said Mr Pearson."
1910,"More and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web. Lord Currie, chairman of super-regulator Ofcom, told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog. ""The challenge will arise when boundaries between TV and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves,"" he said. ""How risque can I be in this new age? Despite having no remit for the regulation of net content, disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by Ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option. Net regulation 'still possible'
The blurring of boundaries between TV and the internet raises questions of regulation, watchdog Ofcom has said. BT has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as BSkyB, ITV and the BBC. ""If content is on-demand, consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them, then it is the consumers' choice to watch it. One of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee, said Mr Ayers. There is no watershed on the net,"" said Mr Burke."
1911,"Blogs had a huge year, with a top US dictionary naming ""blog"" word of 2004. Nikolai Nolan, who has run the Bloggies for the past five years, told the BBC News website he was not too surprised by the amount of voters who crowded the site. There were many new finalists this year, he added, and a few that had won Bloggies before. ""The awards always get a lot of traffic; this was just my first year on a server with a bandwidth limit, so I had to guess how much I'd need,"" he said. Several entries reflected specific news events. Weblogs have been nominated in 30 categories, from the top regional blog, to the best-kept-secret blog. The nominated blogs are wide-ranging covering what is in the news to quirky sites of interest. Included in the other categories is best ""meme"". Podcasting has also made an appearance in the category. One of the categories that was scrapped though was best music blog."
1912,"This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create ""style sheets"", its developers say. ""Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,"" said Ms Hanson. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. The company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. ""People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience."" But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor."
1913,"There are no DJs. Mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. Web radio takes Spanish rap global
Spin the radio dial in the US and you are likely to find plenty of Spanish-language music. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. ""He's considered the Eminem of Argentina, and the Latin American hip-hop scene,"" Millan says. He has the tightest productions, and his rap flow is impeccable, it's amazing."" Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production. Latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. ""And it's pretty much true. Millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of Spanish language hip-hop and rap."
1914,"The Movie Association for America's (MPAA) free Parent File Scan software lets parents check their children's computers for peer-to-peer programs. It will also list all movie and music files they have on their hard drive. ""Our ultimate goal is to help consumers locate the resources and information they need to make appropriate decisions about using and trading illegal files,"" said Dan Glickman, MPAA chief. ""Many parents are concerned about what their children have downloaded and where they've downloaded it from."" The industry body also said it had launched a second round of legal action against online movie-swappers across the US, but did not say how many were being sued. It also started a campaign against operators of BitTorrent, eDonkey and DirectConnect peer-to-peer networks. ""But legal services such as these need a chance to grow and thrive without having to compete against illegitimate operations that depend on stolen property to survive,"" he added. Its first set of lawsuits were filed in November 2004."
1915,"Frank Allan Bruvik was ordered to pay 100,000 kroner (£8,000) to the music industry in Norway. Bruvik had earlier been cleared on appeal after a lower court had found for the music industry. Music industry bosses in Norway said the ruling would help build confidence in the internet as a distribution medium. As well as providing links, the site allowed those visiting it to submit links that could later be accessed by other visitors. The website was not associated with the napster.com site in the USA, which had been operating since 1999 and was already facing legal action. Norway upholds 'Napster' ruling
A Norwegian student who ran a website which linked to downloadable MP3 files has been ordered to pay compensation by the country's Supreme Court. A Norwegian court ruled in 2003 that Bruvik would have to pay 100,000 kroner to the music industry, but the country's Court of Appeal cleared him, saying that the copyright violation occurred when others posted the music. Norway's music industry said it was satisfied with the ruling, because showed that music piracy would not be accepted."
1916,"""Show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them, and I'll write their obituary"" said Niel Ransom, chief technology officer at Alcatel. But 3G will not have everything its own way. If 2004 has been the year of the portable music player, they 2005 looks like it will be the year of the portable media player. Bob Larribeau, principal analyst at Telecom View, said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as Wimax could dent the possible returns of 3G networks. Already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi-megapixel devices go on sale. And the growing ubiquity of wi-fi must not be forgotten either. The pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet. Motorola has just announced a deal with Apple to produce a phone that works with the iTunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace. Instead every gadget will be able to do almost anything and communicate almost any way you want. But that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with."
1917,"High-definition gives incredible, 3D-like pictures and surround sound. ""The film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master,"" he says. He has worked on the Star Wars DVD trilogy, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Indiana Jones. But currently, putting a master feature film onto DVD requires severe compression because current DVD technology cannot hold as much as high-definition films demand. So if you have anything that allows more space, you don't have to compress so hard."" ""I would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and I find it very exciting."" ""Our DVDs that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second. ""When we master movies right now, our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second,"" says Mr Dean. Although the step of down-converting will be bypassed, this will realistically only save a day's work, says Mr Dean. Studios could fit a lot more marketing material, games, and features, onto high-capacity DVDs."
1918,"Even before Nokia's N-Gage game phone launched in late 2003, many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset. Increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film, understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads. And given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the GameBoy it could be a very lucrative market. The processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too. Online the game has quite a following with clans, player rankings and even new downloadable maps. The game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit. Many titles, particularly racing games, let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others. Rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie-in. FATAL FORCE (MACROSPACE) 
A futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading Earth. Graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background."
1919,"At its worst, it has the ability to hijack personal data, like passwords, login details and credit card numbers. The software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information. The state's Consumer Protection Against Spyware Act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer. Spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing PC users in the coming year. It can result in people being bombarded with pop-up ads that are hard to close. In Washington, Congress has been debating four anti-spyware bills, but California is a step ahead. Consumers are able to seek up to $1,000 in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software. The new law marks a continuing trend in California towards tougher privacy rights."
1920,"So many were visiting some aid-related sites that some webpages were struggling to cope with the traffic. The site has so far received almost £8 million, with more than 11,000 donations being made online every hour. An umbrella organisation called the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) has been set up by a coalition of 12 charities and has been taking many donations via its specially created website. Telco BT stepped in to take over the secure payments on the DEC site and provided extra logistical support for phone and online appeals after it was initially crippled with online donations. Anti-fraud organisations are warning about e-mails that are starting to circulate which try to convince people to send money directly to them rather than make donations via aid agencies. Some of the web's biggest firms are also helping to channel help by modifying their homepages to include links to aid agencies and organisations collecting resources. Auction site eBay is giving a list of sites that people can either donate directly to, divert a portion of their profits from anything they sell on eBay to the listed organisations or simply buy items that direct cash to those in the list. Those wanting to give cash were urged to use legitimate websites of charities and aid agencies. Yahoo is proving links direct to charities for those that want to donate. Sadly, the outpouring of goodwill has also encouraged some conmen to try to cash in."
1921,"Britain's first mobile phone call was made across the Vodafone network on 1 January 1985 by veteran comedian Ernie Wise. Cellnet and Vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the UK until 1993 when One2One (now T-Mobile) was launched. Mobiles rack up 20 years of use
Mobile phones in the UK are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend. ""They became a yuppy must-have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk."" In the 20 years since that day, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of Britons own a handset. Mike Caudwell, spokesman for Vodafone, said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase, cost about £2,000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes. For the first nine days of 1985 Vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the UK. ""It's very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people,"" he said. ""Cellnet was forecasting half that."" Mr Caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things, such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular."
1922,"""You could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power, to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before,"" he says. Among them were blogs carrying picture messages, saying ""we are sorry"" for George W Bush's victory and the responses from his supporters. Mr Nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, TV and radio. Andrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the US presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. Blog analysis firm Technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so-called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels. ""And blogs were a key part of that transformation."" ""The one-to-many road of traditional journalism, yes, it is threatened. It is in transition, as society itself is in transition,"" says Mr Nachison. It seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger. ""And there's going to be bad that comes with the good."""
1923,"Speaking to the BBC News website Mr Molyneux said receiving the honour was something of a surprise. Honour for UK games maker
Leading British computer games maker Peter Molyneux has been made an OBE in the New Year Honours list. It's come completely out of the blue,"" he said, ""I never would have guessed that I'd have that kind of honour."" Now, he said, the gaming world rivals the movie industry for sales and cultural influence. He said he was surprised as much because, not too long ago, many people thought computer gaming was a fad. One of the next titles to come from Lionhead puts players in charge of a movie studio and tasks them with producing and directing a hit film. His career started at Bullfrog Studios which in 1987 produced Populous one of the first God-games. ""I thought everyone would treat Populous as weird,"" he said, ""but it became a huge international success."" ""Being an absolute geek I've got no idea what I'm going to wear when I go and pick it up,"" he said. The veteran game maker says he has one problem still to solve."
1924,"The blocking of browsers sited outside the US began in the early hours of Monday morning. The international exclusion zone around georgewbush.com was spotted by net monitoring firm Netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites. On 21 October, the George W Bush website began using the services of a company called Akamai to ensure that the pages, videos and other content on its site reaches visitors. Some web users in Canada also report that they can browse the site. Mike Prettejohn, president of Netcraft, speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs, and traffic, in the run-up to the election on 2 November. He said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week. However, simply blocking non-US visitors also means that Americans overseas are barred too. Akamai declined to comment, saying it could not talk about customer websites."
1925,"Ms Simonetti was told her suspension was a result of ""inappropriate"" images. A large part of the blog contained fictional stories because Queen of the Sky developed over the months as a character in her own right, according to Ms Simonetti. The images were removed as soon as she learned she had been suspended. I just though why not include them on my blog for fun. It was crucial that any policy about what was and what was not acceptable was expressed clearly, was reasonable, and enforced fairly in company policy. ""This blogging thing is obviously a new problem for employers and they need to get a policy about it. ""One of the areas where it does become a problem is that they encourage this when it suits them, but they may not be particularly clear when they [employees] do cross the line."" I thought if they had a problem, someone would have said something before taking action."" Jeffrey Matsuura, director of the law and technology programme at the University of Dayton, said personal websites can be hazardous for both employers and their employees. ""There are many examples of employees who have presented some kind of material online that have gotten them in trouble with employers,"" he said."
1926,"Camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services). This has changed in the last 18 months. But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. Other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips. Over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras, it said. Images from camera phones have even made it into the art world. The exhibition, Fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artists Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano. But some uses for them have worried many organisations."
1927,"As well as being used in different areas of the curriculum, games are a legitimate area of study in their own right, researchers say. Researchers found that girls were often excluded from the male-dominated world of game playing. ""Games literacy is a way of investigating how games are means of expression and representation, just like writing or drawing,"" she said. ""Like all games, computer and video games entertain while promoting social development, and playing and talking about games is an important part of young people's lives,"" said project manager Caroline Pelletier. The second project looked at how games can be integrated into media education and concluded that writing games should be a core part of studying them. For parents, the idea that computer games could be brought into the classroom environment, could cause controversy. Dr Andrew Burn, associate director of the Institute of Education's Centre for the Study of Children, Youth and Media moved to reassure anxious parents. Sixth-form teacher Barney Oram already teaches computer games alongside the more traditional study of film, TV and popular music at the A-level course he runs at Long Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge. ""But we also want to argue that full understanding only comes when children have the tools to create their own games."" ""This report is further evidence, if it were needed, about the excellence and imagination that thrives in gaming."
1928,"Where possible, it hopes to link the system with national records of the import and export of nuclear materials. The organisation is aiming to start a system upgrade in November, aiming to provide inspectors in the field with secure online access to previous inspection data, design blueprints of nuclear facilities, even satellite images of the plant. An IAEA spokesman said this was extremely inefficient and makes searching for anomalies like searching for a needle in a haystack. The IAEA estimates the total cost of the four-year project to upgrade its technology will be $40m. ""Failure to replace the hardware and software, and to integrate fully all the information system components will carry large risks,"" said an agency statement. Computer specialist at the IAEA, Peter Smith, would like to be able to incorporate state of the art visualisation techniques, more familiar to video games players, into the inspector's toolkit. ""The commercials you now see have people are moving around in a virtual world,"" he said. ""If we could have that on our laptops, we could be walking through the plant seeing, on the laptop, how the plant should look. ""And if there's a door in the wall that is not on our laptop, then we have a problem."""
1929,"They wanted to blog the tsunami and its aftermath. With internet service disrupted by the tsunami, Morquendi started sending SMS text messages via cell phone from the affected areas of Sri Lanka. Others blogs are helping to spread information about relief efforts. ""All my blogger friends started linking up my site, and I saw a lot of people other than my friends. ""We started publishing these SMSes,"" says Mr Gupta. ""We didn't have visual accounts on radio or on TV, or in the print media."" ""What we're doing is we're building a resource,"" she says. Indian writer Rohit Gupta edits a group blog called Dogs without Borders. In one of his latest posts, Heretic asks: ""Have you ever seen fishing trawlers on the road? ""Well,"" Heretic writes, ""that was just the least affected areas - so you can just imagine - or can you?"""
1930,"The data and images can be shared with colleagues around the world. A broadband and wireless network installed on the reserve has allowed staff to chronicle the pandas' daily activities. The reserve conducts vital research on both panda breeding and bamboo ecology. ""Our researchers now have state-of-the-art digital technology to help foster the panda population and manage our precious surroundings."" The network has been developed by Intel, working closely with the staff at Wolong. ""Digital technology has transformed the way we communicate and share information inside Wolong and with the rest of the world,"" said Zhang Hemin, director of the Wolong Nature Reserve. Infant panda health was recorded on paper notebooks and research teams in the field had little access to the data."
1931,"The desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded as Google, AOL, Yahoo and many smaller firms tout programs that help people find files. Microsoft made the announcement about its forthcoming search software during a call to financial analysts to talk about its first quarter results. The software will also find webpages and messages sent via AOL Instant Messenger. ""It's going to be really fun to follow."" ""We're going to have a heck of a great race in search between Google, Microsoft and Yahoo,"" he said. The latter recently bought Stata Labs to get its hands on search software that people can use. Microsoft is coming late to the desktop search arena and its software will have to compare favourably with programs from a large number of rivals, many of which have fiercely dedicated populations of users. ""The recent activity in the search industry shows that there is a need to move beyond simple keyword-based web search,"" said Kathy Rittweger, co-founder of Blinkx. However this is not likely to appear until 2006. Many people use a search engine as the first page they go to when getting on the net."
1932,"Home phones face unclear future
The fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species. In all the countries where interviews were carried out, older people were more likely to use a fixed line phone more than a mobile. However, when pressed few could say with accuracy how tariffs on fixed and mobile phones compared. Nokia said these findings had implications for mobile operators who must work hard to ensure that mobiles are seen as cheap, reliable and providing good call quality. In the UK 69% of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile. 18% said they would not get a landline if they moved house. Many of those questioned said they had an emotional connection to their fixed phone that drew on its position in the home and the ""cosiness"" of making a call there. The survey also showed that it is not just voice calls that are going wireless. Polling firm Mori interviewed more than 6,000 people in the UK, US, Germany and South Korea for the survey."

A podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create, usually in the comfort of their own home. ""People can wake up in the morning, pick up their iPods as they go to work or before they go exercise, and discover that there's all this new content automatically put onto their players."" But Mr Curry's technology and broadcast interests started to gel a couple of years ago when computer storage was growing exponentially and high-speed internet connections were becoming more widely available. ""I was always into technologies and wires,"" he explains. ""You know, I'm going do the Top 20 Countdown, take the cheque, go home, and sit on the internet until three in the morning. Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.

1934,"It won the award for taking risks with products and for its ""brave"" commitment to good design. The electronics giant beat off strong competition from Toshiba and chip makers AMD and Intel to take the gong. He said Sony's Clie PEG UX50 media player with its swivel screen and qwerty keyboard ""broke the design rules yet again"". Other Sony products that helped included the Vaio W1 desktop computer and the RA-104 media server. Mr Trotter said Sony's combining of computer, screen and keyboard in the W1 was likely to be widely copied in future home PCs. Microsoft's Media Player 10 took the award for Most Wanted Software. ""While not always inventing new technology itself, Sony was never afraid to innovate around various formats,"" said Mr Trotter. This year was the 10th anniversary of the PC Pro awards, which splits its prizes into two sections."
1935,"Portable PlayStation ready to go
Sony's PlayStation Portable (PSP) will go on sale in Japan on 12 December. The long-awaited handheld game playing gadget will cost about 19,800 yen (145 euros) when it hits the shelves. Sony has said that the PAL version of GT4 will not be ready for Christmas. Konami's Pro Evo dropped only one place to two, while the only new entry in the top 10 was another football title, LMA Manager 2005, in at number seven. Gran Turismo 4 for the PlayStation 2 is still expected to be released in Japan and the USA this year. ""Halo 2 is projected to bring in more revenue than any day one box office blockbuster movie in the United States,"" said Xbox's Peter Moore. Some 6,500 US stores plan to open just after midnight on Tuesday 9 November for the game's release. ""We've even heard rumours of fan anticipation of the 'Halo 2 flu' on 9 November."""
1936,"BT is one of 13 partners involved in the project. Viewers will be able to participate in storylines, manipulate plots and even the sets and props of TV shows. The three-year project will work on seven productions as it develops a set of software tools that will allow viewers to edit content to their needs. ""At the moment we have interactive gaming and a limited form of interactive TV which usually means allowing audiences to vote on shows. This project is about teaching the machine to look at content like Lego blocks that can be reassembled to make perfect sense,"" he said. ""It's not just a matter of stringing together the romantic or action portions of a production,"" said Mr Wyver. Mr Wyver is planning a production entitled The Golden Age, about Renaissance art. NM2's co-ordinator Peter Stollenmayer explained that the new genre would radically alter the role of the audience. ""The tool has to know which bits fit together both visually, by observing the time-honoured rules that go in editing, and in terms of the story."" ""Only then will the personalised version both make sense and be aesthetically pleasing,"" he added."
1937,"Along with its headquarters in north London, it operates studios in Cambridge and Sheffield. Games maker fights for survival
One of Britain's largest independent game makers, Argonaut Games, has been put up for sale. Those new deals were further delayed, leading Argonaut to warn in mid-October that it was running out of cash and suspend trading of its shares on the London Stock Exchange. But, like all software developers, Argonaut needed a constant flow of deals with publishers. Argonaut called in administrators David Rubin & Partners on Friday to find a way to rescue the company from collapse. ""When the news about the £6m loss came out, we knew there were going to be redundancies,"" said Jason Parkinson, one of the game developers sacked by Argonaut. At the start of the year, the company employed 268 people. Mr Parkinson said staff were told the job losses were necessary to save Argonaut from going under. The administrator told BBC News Online that the costs of restructuing would be too high, partly because of the overheads from the company's four premises across the UK. It spent the weekend going over the company's finances and concluded that the only way to save the business was to put it up for sale."
1938,"It would allow visitors a glimpse of life as it was originally lived in places such as Pompeii. Pompeii gets digital make-over
The old-fashioned audio tour of historical places could soon be replaced with computer-generated images that bring the site to life. The Lifeplus project is part of the EU's Information Society Technologies initiative aimed at promoting user-friendly technology and enhancing European cultural heritage. It would require the visitor to wear a head-mounted display with a miniature camera and a backpack computer. Engineers and researchers working in the Europe-wide consortium have come up with a prototype augmented-reality system. ""This technology can now be used for much more than just computer games,"" said Professor Nadia Magnenat-Thalman of the Swiss research group MiraLab. Crucial to the technique is the software that interprets the visitor's view and provides an accurate match between the real and virtual elements. ""We are, for the first time, able to run this combination of software processes to create walking, talking people with believable clothing, skin and hair in real-time,"" she said. Andrew Stoddart, chief scientist at 2d3, said that the EU project has been driven by a new desire to bring the past to life."
1939,"The new strains of the Cabir mobile phone virus use short-range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range. Bluetooth has an effective range of a few tens of metres. Finnish security firm F-Secure issued a warning about the new strains of Cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone. The risk of being infected by Cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it. So far seven versions of Cabir are know to exist, one of which was inside the malicious Skulls program that was found in late November. All they do is block normal Bluetooth activity and drain the phone's battery. Symbian's Series 60 software is licenced by Nokia, LG Electronics, Lenovo, Panasonic, Samsung, Sendo and Siemens."
1940,"The Windows virus grabs e-mail addresses from Microsoft Outlook and uses its own mail sending software to spread itself to new victims. Users will be infected if they open the attachment that travels with the e-mail. The virus can strike computers running Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000 and XP. Black Spider said it had stopped more than 1 million copies of Bagle.AT since the outbreak began at 0630 BST (0530 GMT). BBC News Online has received five warnings about the virus from security companies. ""We've had several reports all over the world,"" said Mikko Hypponen, director of anti-virus research for F-Secure. Security firm Network Box said that it stopped more than 30,000 copies an hour of the virus as the outbreak reached a peak."
1941,"Progress on new internet domains
By early 2005 the net could have two new domain names. The .post domain is backed by the Universal Postal Union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co-ordinate the e-commerce efforts of national post offices. Icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted. At the same time Icann is considering proposals for another eight domains. Three of the new so-called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .museum and .aero. A similar proposal has been made many times in the past. But Icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it. Others such as .info and .biz were intended to be more generic. In total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations."
1942,"The veteran games developer has taken over the Cambridge-based Just Add Monsters studios and the London subsidiary Morpheme. In August it warned of annual losses of £6m, blaming delays in signing new contracts and tough conditions in the software industry. More recently it was behind the Harry Potter games for the PlayStation. But, like all software developers, Argonaut needed a constant flow of deals with publishers. The group's three subsidiaries were placed in administration a week ago, with Mr Sans resigning as the company's CEO and some 100 staff being fired. ""We are pleased to announce the sale of these two businesses as going concerns,"" said David Rubin of administrators David Rubin & Partners. ""This has saved over 40 jobs as well as the substantial employment claims that would have arisen had the sales not been achieved."" ""This is a very difficult time for all the employees there, but I salute their commitment to the business while we work towards a solution,"" he said. Some former employees are angry at the way cash crisis was handled."
1943,"Dozens held over ID fraud site
Twenty-eight people, including a Briton, have been arrested after a global operation against a website allegedly involved in identity fraud. Operation Firewall, led by the US Secret Service, involved seven nations. A 19-year-old man from Camberley, Surrey, was arrested by the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit but has been bailed. The US Secret Service was first tipped off in July 2003. Assistant US Attorney Scott Christie said several people had been arrested in Argentina, Bulgaria, Canada, Estonia, Poland and Sweden. All 28 people detained globally are suspected of being involved in an internet-based network which stole people's identities and used computers and websites to defraud credit card companies. The websites shared tips on how to commit fraud and provided a forum by which people could buy the information and tools they needed to commit such crime, she said. The head of the NHTCU, Acting Detective Chief Superintendent, Mick Deats, said: ""This investigation has resulted in the significant disruption of organised criminals using the internet for profit. Criminals who try to steal the personal and financial information of ordinary citizens as well as the confidential and proprietary information of companies engaged in e-commerce, will be targeted by law enforcement."" ""Your identity is one of the most precious commodities."
1944,"By playing games, like pass-the-parcel, a University of Hertfordshire team is finding out how future robot companions should react in social situations. The research also focuses on human perception of robots, including how they should look, and how a robot can learn new skills by imitating a human demonstrator. ""And I want robots to treat humans as human beings, and not like other robots,"" she added. ""If you think of a robot as a companion for the human being, you can think of 20 years into the future,"" concluded Professor Dautenhahn. The work is part of the European Cogniron robotics project, and was on show at London's Science Museum. ""It might take even longer because it is very, very hard to develop such a robot."" Showing off its skills at the Science Museum, the unnamed robot had to select, approach, and ask different children to pick up a parcel with a gift, moving it arm as a pointer and its camera as an eye. It even used speech to give instructions and play music."
1945,"Already there have been four incidents in which Windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the Microsoft operating system. US laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways. ""Banks need to consider protection as part of the investment to maintain the security of that network,"" Mr Thiemann told BBC News Online. In August of the same year, cash machines of two un-named banks were put out of action for hours following an infection by the Welchia worm. He said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new Europay, Mastercard and Visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data. Mr Thiemann said research by the TowerGroup showed that 70% of new cash machines being installed were Windows based. A spokesman for the Association of Payment and Clearing Services (Apacs) which represents the UK's payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal. ""It's pretty unusual to hear about virus problems with ATMs,"" he said. ""Most banks simply upgrade as part of their usual replacement cycle."" Banks were more likely to be worried about internal networks being overwhelmed by worms and viruses and customers not being able to get cash out at all, he added."
1946,"Attack prompts Bush site block
The official re-election site of President George W Bush is blocking visits from overseas users for ""security reasons"". Scott Stanzel, a spokesman for the Bush-Cheney campaign said: ""The measure was taken for security reasons."" He declined to elaborate any further on the blocking policy. The attack made the site unusable for about five hours. The blocking began early on Monday so those outside the US and trying to view the site got a message saying they are not authorised to view it. Many have found that the site can still be viewed by overseas browsers via several alternative net addresses. Ironically one of the working alternatives is for a supposedly more secure version of the site. There are now at least three working alternative domains for the Bush-Cheney campaign that let web users outside the US visit the site. Mike Prettejohn, Netcraft president, speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs, and traffic, in the run-up to the election on 2 November. Akamai declined to comment, saying it could not talk about customer websites."
1947,"Sky will activate a spare slot on set-top boxes in January, marketing magazine New Media Age reported. Sky set-top boxes have two slots. Viewers who stay loyal to a particular TV channel could be rewarded by free TV content or freebies from retail partners. One is for the viewer's decryption card, while the other has been dormant until now. Broadcasters aiming content at children could offer smartcards which gives membership to exclusive content and clubs. ""Parents could pre-pay for some content, as a kind of TV pocket money card,"" said Nigel Whalley, managing director of media consultancy Decipher. ""The idea of an intelligent card in boxes offers a lot of possibilities. It will be down to the ingenuity of the content players,"" said Mr Whalley. Viewers could even be rewarded for watching ad breaks, with ideas such as ad bingo being touted by firms keen to make money out of the new market, said Mr Whalley."
1948,"Geared towards online gamers, it is based around little more than a series of all-out gunfights, set in an array of locations all featured in, or hinted at during, the two blockbusting film trilogies. In each section, the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops, seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet. It really is no more complicated than that. The Force is strong in Battlefront
The warm reception that has greeted Star Wars: Battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay, but of its back-to-basics approach and immense nostalgia quotient. The feel of those places is well and truly captured, with both backdrops and characters looking good and very authentic. That said, it is still great fun to pilot a Scout Walker or Speeder Bike, however non user-friendly they prove. It has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being Star Wars, it would not stand up for long. It is worth noting though that on the PlayStation 2, the game's graphics are a curiously long way behind those of the Xbox version. The above-average AI of the enemy sees to that, although given the frenetic environments they operate in, their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated. Battlefront's novelty value will doubtless wear off relatively fast, leaving behind a slightly empty one-trick-pony of a game."
1949,"The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay was handed the Unsung Hero Game of 2004. Its release was somewhat eclipsed by Doom 3, which was released on the same week. It helped to establish the concept of the first-person shooter. Doom 3 was developed over four years and is thought to have cost around $15m (£8.3m). It was the only title to win twice, winning Ultimate Game of the year and best PC game at the awards, presented by Little Britain star Matt Lucas. It was, however, very well received by gamers and was praised for its storyline which differed from the film released around the same time. The annual awards are voted for by more than 200,000 readers of computer and video games magazines. Games awards like this have grown in importance."
1950,"For anyone bewildered by the choice of gadgets on the market, Stuff and What Hi-Fi? are hosting a best-of gadget show in London this weekend. The event will play host to a large collection of digital music players, from companies such as Creative, Sony and Philips as well as the ubiquitously fashionable iPod from Apple. But he is not for sale and Sony has no commercial plans for the robot. ""He will greet visitors and is flying in from Japan. ""Women will be getting gadgets from husbands and boyfriends as well as buying them for themselves,"" said Mr Irish. Suggestions that it could be a gaming or wireless Christmas are unlikely to come true as MP3 players remain the most popular stocking filler, said Mr Irish. Also on display will be a virtual keyboard which projects itself onto any flat surface. ""Gadgets nowadays are lifestyle products rather than just for geeks."""
1951,"It also plans to develop a ""worldwide entertainment concept"" with the brand, although details are not yet known. In the chronology of home computing, Commodore was one of the pioneers. Commodore finds new lease of life
The once-famous Commodore computer brand could be resurrected after being bought by a US-based digital music distributor. The Commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system, even to this day. The brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. It had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games. The sale of Commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over £17m."
1952,"Britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of Europe. The UK total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people, compared to 6.7 in Germany and 15.8 in the Netherlands. The standard speed is 512kbps, though faster connections are available. ""This breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pent-up demand that existed in many areas,"" said Paul Reynolds, chief executive of BT Wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms re-sell. By the end of September more than 4.2 million phone lines were using so-called Carrier Pre-Section (CPS) services, such as TalkTalk and One.Tel, which route phone calls across non-BT networks from a local exchange. There are now more than 300 different firms offering CPS services and the percentage of people using BT lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4%. This was a slight increase on the previous three months. Local Loop Unbundling, (LLU), in which BT rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customer's home or office, is growing steadily. Cable & Wireless and NTL have announced that they are investing millions to start offering LLU services."
1953,"Sales have tripled since launch, outstripping Microsoft's Xbox, said market analysts Chart-Track. The numbers were also boosted by the release of the PS2-only game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. ""And with Halo 2 [for Xbox] out next week, it really is a head-to-head contest between them and Xbox."" The original title won universal acclaim in 2001, and sold more than four million copies. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King took nearly £10m over its opening weekend, although games titles are four to five times more expensive than cinema tickets. Mr Houlihan added that Sony had done well with the PS2, but it definitely helped that the release of San Andreas coincided with the slimline PS2 hitting the shelves. ""It is obviously very, very encouraging for Sony because Microsoft briefly outsold them last week,"" John Houlihan, editor of Computerandvideogames.com told BBC News. Sony and Microsoft have both reduced console prices recently and are preparing the way for the launches of their next generation consoles in 2005. The run-up to Christmas is a huge battlefield for games consoles and titles. Microsoft's Xbox had been winning the race up until last week in sales."
1954,"As holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes, their ship's crew is testing prototype versions of the world's first internationally issued biometric ID cards, the seafarer's equivalent of a passport. Seamen sail into biometric future
The luxury cruise liner Crystal Harmony, currently in the Gulf of Mexico, is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology. The cards are due to be issued in February next year, in line with the revised UN Convention on Seafarers' Identity Documents of June 2003. She said French, Jordanian and Nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new ID cards since their countries have already ratified the convention. The convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailor's wellbeing and, therefore, it says, to safer shipping and cleaner oceans. ""By increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection, the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world,"" said Ms Musselman. ""It should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in, and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are, in fact, seafarers."""

A brother and sister in the US have been convicted of sending hundreds of thousands of unsolicited e-mail messages to AOL subscribers. A ""Fed-Ex refund processor"" was supposed to allow people to earn $75 an hour working from home. Jurors in Virginia recommended that the man, Jeremy Jaynes, serve nine years in prison and that his sister, Jessica DeGroot, be fined $7,500. Another item on sale was an ""internet history eraser"". His sister helped him process credit card payments. ""He's been successful ripping people off all these years,"" AP quoted prosecutor Russell McGuire as saying. But Jaynes' lawyer David Oblon called the nine-year recommended term ""outrageous"" and said his client believed he was innocent."
1956,"US blogger fired by her airline
A US airline attendant suspended over ""inappropriate images"" on her blog - web diary - says she has been fired. Delta has repeatedly declined to elaborate on what it calls ""internal employee matters"". She added she had also hired a Texas-based law firm to initiate legal action for ""wrongful termination, defamation of character and lost future wages."" Ms Simonetti told the BBC News website she had received no warning or further explanation when she was suspended on 25 September. Her story has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest, employment law and free speech on personal websites. But some postings contained images of herself in uniform. She removed them as soon as she was informed of her suspension. And on Monday, it negotiated a deal to defer about $135m in debt which was due next year, until 2007. ""I never meant it as something to harm my company and don't understand how they think it did harm them,"" Ms Simonetti said. The airline also said it had agreed the terms of a $600m loan from American Express."
1957,"""We predicted at the beginning of the decade that the digital approach would be taken for granted - but there was a lot of work to do. ""What is fun is to come to the show and see what has been done. It is going even faster than we expected and we are excited about it."" Mr Gates said the PC, like Microsoft's Media Centre, had a central role to play in how people would be making the most out of audio, video and images but it would not be the only device. ""Gaming is becoming more of a social thing and all of the social genres will use this rich communications. ""And if we look at what has been going on with e-mail, instant messaging, blogging, entertainment - if we can make this seamless, we can create something quite phenomenal."" CES features several more key speeches from major technology players, such as Intel and Hewlett Packard, as well as parallel conference sessions on gaming, storage, broadband and the future of digital music. ""People are online and playing together and that really points to the future,"" he said. That trend is predicted to continue with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. Although most of these affected largely US consumers, the technologies highlighted the kind of trends to come."
1958,"The setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional US state of San Andreas, comprising three major cities: Los Santos, which is a thinly-disguised Los Angeles, San Fierro, aka San Francisco and Las Venturas, a carbon copy of Las Vegas. To make things worse, he is framed for murder the moment he arrives in town, and blackmailed by crooked cops played by Samuel L Jackson and Chris Penn. The streets, and vast swathes of countryside, are by turns gloriously menacing, grungy and preppy. CJ can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from a push-bike to a city bus to a plane. Its ability to capture the ambience of the real-world versions of these cities is something to behold, assisted no end by the monumental graphical advances since Vice City. They will pass comments on his appearance and credibility, aspects that the player now has control over. But the gameplay experience in its entirety is overwhelmingly positive. The grim subject matter here hardly lends itself to gags in quite the same way as the cheesy 80s setting of the last game. Clothes, tattoos and haircuts can all be purchased, and funding these habits can be achieved by criminal means or by indulging in mini-games like betting on horses and challenging bar patrons to games of pool. The quality of voice acting and motion capture is simply off-the-chart."
1959,"Users will need to use BT's internet telephony software, known as BT Communicator, and have a microphone and speakers or headset on their PC. The offer will be limited to the first 50,000 people who sign up and there are limitations - the free calls do not include calls to mobiles, non-geographical numbers such as 0870, premium numbers or international numbers. BT is keen to provide extra services to its broadband customers. People wanting to take advantage of the offer will need to be a BT Together fixed-line customer and will have to sign up to broadband online. ""People already using BT Communicator have found it by far the most convenient way of making a call if they are at their PC,"" said Andrew Burke, director of value-added services at BT Retail. ""BT Communicator had a quiet launch in the summer and now BT is waving the flag a bit more for it,"" he added. It currently has 1.3 million broadband subscribers."
1960,"""Somebody had a new thing that would awe you. We are in a different phase now when it comes to technology, argues Mr Donofrio, Industry Week's 2003 Technology Leader of the Year. But what it means for technology companies is that a new idea, method, or device, will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them. People will know their lives are just better,"" says Mr Donofrio. Nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways, through new superconducting materials, to coatings, power, and memory storage. You weren't quite sure that it did anything, you weren't quite sure if you needed it, you weren't quite sure if it had value for it, but it was cool."" ""If I am right about what innovation is, you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative. To Mr Donofrio, it is a vision innovation that will happen. ""As more and more women or underrepresented minorities succeed into leadership positions, it becomes and imperative for us to constantly look like them."" ""I am confident that the SET [science, engineering and technology] industry is going to be short on skills,"" he says."
1961,"Earlier incarnations, but which had the same core technology, were called Phoenix and Firebird. Firefox is proving popular because, at the moment, it has far fewer security holes than Internet Explorer and has some innovations lacking in Microsoft's program. For instance, Firefox allows the pages of different websites to be arranged as tabs so users can switch easily between them. That figure had remained static for years. In July the IE using population dropped to 94.7% and by the end of October stood at 92.9%. The Mozilla Foundation claims that Firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner 10% of the Windows- using, net-browsing population. It blocks pop-ups, has a neat way of finding text on a page and lets you search through the pages you have browsed. A campaign co-ordinated by the Spread Firefox website attempted to raise the $50,000 needed for a full page advert in the New York Times. Ten days in to the campaign 10,000 people had signed up and now about $250,000 has been raised. from alternative browsers such as Opera, Safari, Amaya and even Netscape."

They were really careful to make sure everything worked the way it was supposed to. Claude Errera, editor of fansite Halo.Bungie.Org, said: ""Bungie got everything right. ""It also had a depth to it that made it stand out."" ""It does not feel like a game release any more. When the Xbox launched on November 15 2001 in the US, Halo was one of the launch titles and had an immediate impact on critics and consumers. Halo is considered by many video game pundits to be one of the finest examples of interactive entertainment ever produced and more than 1.5 million people worldwide have pre-ordered the sequel. ""It blew me away the first time someone managed to climb to the top of Halo,"" said Errera, referring to a fan who had created a video of Master Chief scaling the landscape of the graphical world. Somebody told me this was the biggest single release of any product in Microsoft's history. ""We're all just hoping that Bungie has got it right again."""
1963,"Four-Kings hopes the open qualifiers will turn up gamers good enough to beat all comers at the Painkiller game. UK gamers have until 12 November to register their interest in taking part and can sign up via the Four-Kings, Jolt.co.uk and Painkiller tournament websites. Philip Wride, who co-manages the Four-Kings team, said online qualifiers will be held from 16-28 November to find the best eight players of the Painkiller game. Said Mr Bysshe: ""Painkiller is a new game and the opportunity is there for a new player to step up."" The event is being billed as the CPL World Tour and will be arranged around ten separate tournaments at different locations around the world. The CPL has said that it picked a one-on-one game such as Painkiller to make it easier for spectators to follow the action. A total of $50,000 in cash prizes is on offer. The first stop on the world tour will be Istanbul, Turkey from 10-13 February. Counter-Strike, by far the most popular online game, pits teams against each other and can be confusing to follow if those watching are not familiar with the layout of the maps on which it is played. The decision to pick Painkiller was greeted with surprise by many gamers, as it was widely expected that Doom 3 would be chosen as the one-one-one title."
1964,"IBM test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. It is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second. ""Next year with the final Blue Gene, four times what it is this year, it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat,"" said Erich Strohmaier, one of the co-founders of the Top500 list. The defeated Japanese contender, the Earth Simulator, which was listed in third place, losing the top spot it had held since June 2002. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 trillion calculations per second (teraflops) in October. It is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, under the US Department of Energy. It will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. Since the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, US, in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. Once completed in 2005, Blue Gene/L will be more powerful than its current prototype."
1965,"Land lines were unreliable. He wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages, and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help. Text messages aid disaster recovery
Text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in Asia. Half a world away, in the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago, Taran Rampersad read Morquendi's messages. Mr Rampersad said: ""Imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets, and had a central place to send a text message to that effect. The idea is to use open-source software - software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint - and a far-flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help. ""In every rural community, there's at least one person who has access to a mobile phone, or has a mobile phone, and can receive messages."" ""This is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self-organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people,"" says Paul Saffo, a director at the California-based Institute for the Future. Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production. It is still very early days for the project, though."
1966,"Some of these ideas have been showcased at the London's Science Museum, as part of its Future Face exhibition. The Surrey team is already working on Jeremiah's next version, that will replace the human face with an underwater and more interactive creature: Finn the fish. ""When he sees children running and laughing and waving at him, he smiles at them. ""Jeremiah is a virtual face that attempts to emulate humans in the way it responds to activity. If you ignore him, he gets angry. And you can also even surprise him."" Experts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices, such as a virtual human, could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos. Imagine a surveillance system that also presents a virtual embodiment of a person on a screen who can react to your behaviour, and perhaps even alert you to new e-mails. ""When we put the surveillance cameras in our centre, a lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was a system watching them,"" said Dr Bowden. ""Now if the system can watch your behaviour over time, it can learn this, so it would predict what you are going to do, turn on the lights for you, or, before you even get to the kettle, it could have switched it on."""
1967,"They decided to go their separate ways, and each kept a piece of the franchise. Eidos announced the next CM game, with a new team to develop it from scratch, whilst SI developed the existing code further to be released, with new publishers Sega, under the name Football Manager. Well, Football Manager is the spiritual successor to the CM series, and it has been released earlier than expected. But that does not do justice to the game really. So what does this mean? Once in a team you will be told by the board what they expect of you. That will give you a choice not just of the four main Scottish leagues, but the English Premiership all the way down to the Conference North and South. A game like FM2005 could blind you with statistics. In fact just about every area of the game has been tweaked, and it leads to an ever more immersive experience. Football Manager 2005 out now for the PC and the Mac"
1968,"Musicians 'upbeat' about the net
Musicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music, a survey has found. They ranged from full-time, successful musicians to artists struggling to make a living from their music. Through the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), it has pursued an aggressive campaign through the courts to sue people suspected of sharing copyrighted music. Almost all of them used the net for ideas and inspiration, with nine out of 10 going online to promote, advertise and post their music on the web. More than 80% offered free samples online, while two-thirds sold their music via the net. ""Even successful artists don't think the lawsuits will benefit musicians,"" said report author Mary Madden. While most considered file-sharing as illegal, many disagreed with the lawsuits launched against downloaders. ""We always hear the views of successful artists like the Britneys of the world but the less successful artists rarely get represented."" The survey found that musicians were overwhelming positive about the internet, rather than seeing it as just a threat to their livelihood. Many suggested that rather than fighting file-sharing, the music industry needed to recognise the changes it has brought and embrace it."
1969,"Just over 54 million people are hooked up to the net via broadband, up from 34 million a year ago, according to market analysts Nielsen/NetRatings. The ability to browse web pages at high speed, download files such as music or films and play online games is changing what people do in their spare time. The biggest jump was in Italy, where it rose by 120%. The growth has been fuelled by lower prices and a wider choice of always-on, fast-net subscription plans. ""As the number of high-speed surfers grows, websites will need to adapt, update and enhance their content to retain their visitors and encourage new ones."" It said TV companies faced a major long-term threat over the next five years, with broadband predicted to grow from 19% to 37% of households by 2009. ""Twelve months ago high speed internet users made up just over one third of the audience in Europe; now they are more than 50% and we expect this number to keep growing,"" said Gabrielle Prior, Nielsen/NetRatings analyst.

But the plan has proved controversial. But the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words ""Stay tuned"". Lycos Europe now appears to have put the plan on hold. The downing of the sites could dent Lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack. The numerical internet address of the site has also changed. ""Attacking a spammer's website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick,"" said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for Sophos.

A user of Apple's iTunes music service is suing the firm saying it is unfair he can only use an iPod to play songs. ""As a practical matter, the lower courts have been highly sceptical of such claims,"" Prof Gellhorn said. ""Apple has unlawfully bundled, tied, and/or leveraged its monopoly in the market for the sale of legal online digital music recordings to thwart competition in the separate market for portable hard drive digital music players, and vice-versa,"" the lawsuit said. Apple has sold more than six million iPods since the gadget was launched and has an 87% share of the market for portable digital music players, market research firm NPD Group has reported.

A quarter of broadband users in Britain regularly upload content and have personal sites, according to a report by UK think-tank Demos. It found that more than half of those with broadband logged on to the web before breakfast. More significantly, argues the report, broadband is encouraging people to take a more active role online. ""Broadband is putting the 'me' in media as it shifts power from institutions and into the hands of the individual,"" said John Craig, co-author of the Demos report. ""From self-diagnosis to online education, broadband creates social innovation that moves the debate beyond simple questions of access and speed."""
1974,"Merriam-Webster said ""blog"" was the word that people have asked to be defined or explained most often over the last 12 months. 'Blog' picked as word of the year
The term ""blog"" has been chosen as the top word of 2004 by a US dictionary publisher. Its list of most looked-up words is drawn up every year and it discounts terms such as swear words, that everyone likes to look up, or those that always cause problems, such as ""affect"" and ""effect"". ""Now we're getting words that derive from it such as 'blogosphere' and so on,"" he said. ""But,"" he added, ""it's a pretty recent thing and in the way that this happens these days it's got established very quickly."" Blogs come in many different forms. During 2004 blogs, or web logs, have become hugely popular and some have started to influence mainstream media. Blogs also proved very useful to both sides in the US election battle because many pundits who maintain their own journals were able to air opinions that would never appear in more mainstream media. According to US research firm Pew Internet & American Life a blog is created every 5.8 seconds. One of the reasons that blogs and regularly updated online journals have become popular is because the software used to put them together make it very easy for people to air their views online."
1975,"New Year's texting breaks record
A mobile phone was as essential to the recent New Year's festivities as a party mood and Auld Lang Syne, if the number of text messages sent is anything to go by. While texting has not quite overtaken the old-fashioned phone call, it is heading that way, said Mike Short, chairman of the MDA. The British love affair with texting shows no signs of abating and the annual total for 2004 is set to exceed 25bn, according to MDA. ""In the case of a New Years Eve party, texting is useful if you are unable to speak or hear because of a noisy background,"" he said. There were also lots of messages sent internationally, where different time zones made traditional calls unfeasible, he said. ""We thought texting might slow down as MMS took off but we have seen no sign of that,"" said Mr Short. Restaurants are using text messages to tell customers about special offers and promotions. For those still wanting to drink and be merry as the long days of winter draw in, the Good Pub Guide offers a service giving the location and address of their nearest recommended pub. Users need to text the word GOODPUB to 85130."
1976,"Far from looking like a mould-breaking handheld, it looks more like Nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype. The first striking thing about the DS is how retro it looks. The top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top-down map and the ability to switch weapons. ""We believe the DS will appeal to all ages, both genders and gamers of any skill,"" said David Yarnton, Nintendo Europe's general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld. The Japanese gaming giant hopes the DS will maintain the firm's pre-eminence in an increasingly-competitive mobile gaming market. It is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating. But will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed? It certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people. Hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices, Ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers. One thing is for certain."
1977,"It would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances - but luckily, Half-Life 2 is up to the challenge. Whereas the highly impressive Doom III felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride, wandering through Half-Life's world truly does feel like being part of a movie. There are puzzles to be solved along the way, pitched at about the right difficulty, but most progress is achieved by force. The bar has been raised, and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future. The stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles. So impressive are the physics that you'll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move. And without resorting to the zombies-leaping-out-of-shadows approach of Doom III, it's all incredibly unsettling. But the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run. Installing it proved a life-draining siege that would test a saint's patience. Half-Life 2 is out now for the PC"
1978,"The Blu-Ray Association said on Thursday that games giants Electronic Arts and Vivendi would both support its DVD format. Blu-ray, backed by 100 firms including Sony, is competing against Toshiba and NEC-backed HD-DVD to be the format of choice for future films and games. The next generation of DVDs will hold high-definition video and sound. ""Gamers, especially those working on PCs, are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures, deeper levels, for delivering higher-resolution playback."" ""The technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical-disc technologies,"" said Michael Heilmann, chief technology officer for Vivendi Universal. EA, a leading games developer and publisher, added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and Blu-ray had the capacity, functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning. He added: ""The focus for games moving forward on increased immersion. Likewise, consoles rely on single discs, so DVDs that can hold six times more data mean much better, high-resolution games. ""They are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments,"" said Mr Doherty. High-definition DVDs will cut down on that need."
1979,"But doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are ""quality copies"". Like Kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone. In an interview with Novastream web radio, Sloncek said Exeem would combine ideas from the BitTorrent and Kazaa file-sharing systems. One site behind the success of the BitTorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program. He said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program. One of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the BitTorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or TV programmes they claimed to. There were no plans for a Linux or Mac version. This, said Sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music. Users of the Exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, Sloncek told Novastream. ""There is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity,"" he said."
1980,"Online games play with politics
After bubbling under for some time, online games broke through onto the political arena in 2004. The US presidential election provided a showcase for many, aimed at talking directly to a generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads. ""When I started researching political games at the university, about five years ago, I thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen,"" said Gonzalo Frasca, computer games specialist at the Information Technology University of Copenhagen. Others helped raise the stakes during the Bush/Kerry contest by highlighting a candidate's virtues or his vices. But experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns. ""Children learn a lot about the world through play. ""It's up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games."" There is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up."" Only a few years ago, most politicians did not have a webpage, while now it is almost a must-have. Dr Frasca said: ""Political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games."

However, this future of highly personal devices, where technology is worn, or even fuses with the body itself, raises ethical questions. At the nanoscale, materials can be ""tuned"" to display unusual properties that can be exploited to build faster, lighter, stronger and more efficient devices and systems.

That trend is predicted to continue, according to CEA analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies. ""This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your PVR [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house. ""Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere,"" said Mr Joseph. Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox. He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the ""democratisation"" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images. With more than 52% of US homes expected to have home networks, the CEA suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace."
1987,"Who do you think you are? Has anyone checked Bob Cratchit's family links to the criminal underworld, I wonder? And just last week the online bank Cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name. It is what happens when it arrives at the other end. It is surprising that it has taken the gangs so long to realise that a well-placed insider is by far the simplest way to break the security of a computer system. The two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law, so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes, or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft. Any organisation that processes personal data is, of course, bound by the Data Protection Act and must take proper care of it. And it is hardly likely to be only banks that are being targeted. I have never felt comfortable with the US practice of suing everything that moves, partly because it seems to make lawyers richer than their clients, so I know which I'd prefer. Bill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital."
1988,"'Brainwave' cap controls computer
A team of US researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer. Four people, two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users, successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes. ""The results show that people can learn to use scalp-recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions,"" said Jonathan Wolpaw and Dennis McFarlane. Earlier this year, a team at the MIT Media Labs Europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character. Such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles, so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively. Brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes. Although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall, the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated. It is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain-control experiments."

1990,"More than 120 experts were in Nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as Nokia, Intel, Philips, Alcatel, France Telecom, Thomson and Telefonica. But again and again, speakers stated they could not see incompatible, stand-alone solutions working. A long-term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required. In Nice last week, the European Commission announced its Networked & Electronic Media (NEM) initiative. The European Commission is being pragmatic in its approach. What is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget. The NEM approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline, pick out the best, bring them together and identify where the gaps are. Where it finds holes, it will develop standards to fill them. With the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally, the prize for being the supplier of the world's dominant DRM scheme is huge. Simon Perry is the editor of the Digital Lifestyles website, which covers the impact of technology on media"
1991,"Dr Nielsen said the success of sites such as Google, Amazon, eBay and Yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important. ""Some have gone away because users have changed and 10% have changed because technology has changed."" ""All are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet,"" he said. In the future, Dr Nielsen believes that search engines will play an even bigger part in helping people get to grips with the huge amount of information online. ""Those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful,"" said Dr Nielsen, adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net. ""They are making simple but powerful tools available to the user. But, he said, the fact that they are useful now does not meant that they could not do better. Often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not. In 1994 only 1.3 words were used. You can hear more from Jakob Nielsen and web design on the BBC World Service programme, Go Digital"
1992,"2D Metal Slug offers retro fun
Like some drill sergeant from the past, Metal Slug 3 is a wake-up call to today's gamers molly-coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings. And yes, that includes Halo 2. The shoot-anything-that-moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old-school genius. Of course, most of you will ignore this, lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters. It is also the toughest game you are likely to play, as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on. Tanks, jets and submarines can be commandeered, as well as cannon-toting camels, elephants and ostriches - more weaponry on offer than in an acre of Iraq. And at a mere £20, Metal Slug 3 is as cheap as sliced, fried spuds, as the man says."
1993,"Casual games like poker, pool, bridge, bingo and puzzle-based titles, which can be played online or downloaded onto mobile devices, were ""gender neutral"" and different genres attracted different players. The panel also insisted that casual gamers were not just women, a common misconception which pervades current thinking about gamer demographics. Easy-to-play titles that do not require too much time and that are playable online or downloadable to mobile devices will see real growth in the coming year. ""When hardcore gamers are not playing Halo, they are playing poker and pool, based on our research,"" said Geoff Graber, director of Yahoo Games, which attracts about 12 million gamers a month. This aspect of ""community"" is crucial for gamers who just want to have quick access to free or cheap games without committing long periods of time immersed in £30 to £40 console or PC titles, said the panel. They were speaking before the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas which showcases the latest trends in gadgets and technologies for 2005. ""We are at a time where we are on the verge of something much bigger,"" said Mr Graber. ""Casual games will get into their stride in 2005, will be really big in 2006 and will be about community."" With more people finding more to do with their gadgets and high-speed connections, casual games would start to open up the world of gaming as a form of mass-market entertainment to more people. The main theme is how new devices are getting better at talking to each other, allowing people to enjoy digital content, like audio, video and images, when they want, and where they want."
1994,"The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay was handed the Unsung Hero Game of 2004. Its release was somewhat eclipsed by Doom 3, which was released on the same week. It helped to establish the concept of the first-person shooter. Doom 3 was developed over four years and is thought to have cost around $15m (£8.3m). It was the only title to win twice, winning Ultimate Game of the year and best PC game at the awards, presented by Little Britain star Matt Lucas. It was, however, very well received by gamers and was praised for its storyline which differed from the film released around the same time. The annual awards are voted for by more than 200,000 readers of computer and video games magazines. Games awards like this have grown in importance."
1995,"For anyone bewildered by the choice of gadgets on the market, Stuff and What Hi-Fi? are hosting a best-of gadget show in London this weekend. The event will play host to a large collection of digital music players, from companies such as Creative, Sony and Philips as well as the ubiquitously fashionable iPod from Apple. But he is not for sale and Sony has no commercial plans for the robot. ""He will greet visitors and is flying in from Japan. ""Women will be getting gadgets from husbands and boyfriends as well as buying them for themselves,"" said Mr Irish. Suggestions that it could be a gaming or wireless Christmas are unlikely to come true as MP3 players remain the most popular stocking filler, said Mr Irish. Also on display will be a virtual keyboard which projects itself onto any flat surface. ""Gadgets nowadays are lifestyle products rather than just for geeks."""
1996,"DOE test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. But in September, IBM said that another Blue Gene/L machine clocked up 36.01 teraflops, marginally surpassing the Earth Simulator's performance. The IBM Blue Gene/L is only a prototype and is one 5th the speed of the full version, due to be completed for the Livermore labs in 2005. The speeds will most likely make it the fastest computer system on the planet, yet the chip technology powering the machine is the kind which can be found in familiar devices such as games consoles. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity. Surpassing the 40 trillion calculations per second (teraflop) mark has been considered a landmark for some time. ""When you get a computer as large as a petaflop, you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world,"" Mr Donofrio recently told the BBC News website. ""You can start to be more proactive, more interactive and more innovative."" ""We are a great believer in simulation. It gives you another tool,"" he said."
1997,"""It is the kind of storage that appeals to people who want their PCs to look cool,"" said Seagate. Universal Electronics' NevoSL is a universal controller that lets people use one device to get at their multimedia content, such as photos, no matter where it is in their house. ""It is all about style but it also has lots of functionality."" One gadget that might help swell that collection is Sanyo's tiny handheld VPC-C4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. The chair, which looks like a car seat on a skeletal frame, should go on sale in April and is expected to cost $399 (£211). And a drinks holder. The Porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of January in the US and in the first quarter of 2005 in the UK. One of the key issues for keen gadget users is how to store all their digital images, audio and video files. It combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. Slung on a cord, the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck."
1998,"Britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of Europe. The UK total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people, compared to 6.7 in Germany and 15.8 in the Netherlands. The standard speed is 512kbps, though faster connections are available. ""This breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pent-up demand that existed in many areas,"" said Paul Reynolds, chief executive of BT Wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms re-sell. By the end of September more than 4.2 million phone lines were using so-called Carrier Pre-Section (CPS) services, such as TalkTalk and One.Tel, which route phone calls across non-BT networks from a local exchange. There are now more than 300 different firms offering CPS services and the percentage of people using BT lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4%. This was a slight increase on the previous three months. Local Loop Unbundling, (LLU), in which BT rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customer's home or office, is growing steadily. Cable & Wireless and NTL have announced that they are investing millions to start offering LLU services."
1999,"They will be formally sentenced next year. US duo in first spam conviction
A brother and sister in the US have been convicted of sending hundreds of thousands of unsolicited e-mail messages to AOL subscribers. A ""Fed-Ex refund processor"" was supposed to allow people to earn $75 an hour working from home. Jurors in Virginia recommended that the man, Jeremy Jaynes, serve nine years in prison and that his sister, Jessica DeGroot, be fined $7,500. Another item on sale was an ""internet history eraser"". His sister helped him process credit card payments. ""He's been successful ripping people off all these years,"" AP quoted prosecutor Russell McGuire as saying. But Jaynes' lawyer David Oblon called the nine-year recommended term ""outrageous"" and said his client believed he was innocent."
2000,"The anti-spyware tool is available now and the anti-virus utility is expected to be available later this month. The virus-fighting program will be updated monthly and is a precursor to Microsoft releasing dedicated anti-virus software. It has proved such a tempting target that there are now thought to be more than 100,000 viruses and other malicious programs in existence. Before now Microsoft has left the market for PC security software to specialist firms such as Symantec, McAfee, Trend Micro and many others. Microsoft's Windows operating system has long been a favourite of people who write computer viruses because it is so ubiquitous and has many loopholes that can be exploited. In its most benign form it just bombards users with pop-up adverts or hijacks web browser settings. It said that its virus cleaning program would not stop machines being infected nor remove the need for other anti-virus programs. Last year Microsoft also released the SP2 upgrade for Windows XP that closed many security loopholes in the software and made it easier for people to manage their anti-virus and firewall programs. Microsoft's two security tools have emerged as a result of acquisitions the company has made over the last two years. In 2003 it bought Romanian firm GeCAD Software to get hold of its anti-virus technology."
2001,"Sales have tripled since launch, outstripping Microsoft's Xbox, said market analysts Chart-Track. The numbers were also boosted by the release of the PS2-only game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. ""And with Halo 2 [for Xbox] out next week, it really is a head-to-head contest between them and Xbox."" The original title won universal acclaim in 2001, and sold more than four million copies. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King took nearly £10m over its opening weekend, although games titles are four to five times more expensive than cinema tickets. Mr Houlihan added that Sony had done well with the PS2, but it definitely helped that the release of San Andreas coincided with the slimline PS2 hitting the shelves. ""It is obviously very, very encouraging for Sony because Microsoft briefly outsold them last week,"" John Houlihan, editor of Computerandvideogames.com told BBC News. Sony and Microsoft have both reduced console prices recently and are preparing the way for the launches of their next generation consoles in 2005. The run-up to Christmas is a huge battlefield for games consoles and titles. Microsoft's Xbox had been winning the race up until last week in sales."
2002,"As holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes, their ship's crew is testing prototype versions of the world's first internationally issued biometric ID cards, the seafarer's equivalent of a passport. Seamen sail into biometric future
The luxury cruise liner Crystal Harmony, currently in the Gulf of Mexico, is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology. The cards are due to be issued in February next year, in line with the revised UN Convention on Seafarers' Identity Documents of June 2003. She said French, Jordanian and Nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new ID cards since their countries have already ratified the convention. The convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailor's wellbeing and, therefore, it says, to safer shipping and cleaner oceans. ""By increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection, the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world,"" said Ms Musselman. ""It should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in, and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are, in fact, seafarers."""
2003,"US blogger fired by her airline
A US airline attendant suspended over ""inappropriate images"" on her blog - web diary - says she has been fired. Delta has repeatedly declined to elaborate on what it calls ""internal employee matters"". She added she had also hired a Texas-based law firm to initiate legal action for ""wrongful termination, defamation of character and lost future wages."" Ms Simonetti told the BBC News website she had received no warning or further explanation when she was suspended on 25 September. Her story has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest, employment law and free speech on personal websites. But some postings contained images of herself in uniform. She removed them as soon as she was informed of her suspension. And on Monday, it negotiated a deal to defer about $135m in debt which was due next year, until 2007. ""I never meant it as something to harm my company and don't understand how they think it did harm them,"" Ms Simonetti said. The airline also said it had agreed the terms of a $600m loan from American Express."
2004,"Mobiles double up as bus tickets
Mobiles could soon double up as travel cards, with Nokia planning to try out a wireless ticket system on German buses. The ticketless trial will start early in 2005 and people will also be able to access transport information and timetables via their phones. The system opens up possibilities for mobile devices to be interact with everyday environments, said Mr Romen. He is confident that the trial being run in Germany could be extended to transport systems in other countries. ""It could be used in shops to get product information, at bus-stops to get information about the next bus or, for example, by being passed over an advert of a rock star to find out details of concerts or get ringtones,"" he told the BBC News website. ""The technology offers access to a lot of services and makes it easy to get the information you want,"" he said."
2005,"Now you could also be at a live gig on your mobile, via the latest third generation (3G) video phones. Rock outfit Rooster are playing what has been billed as the first ever concert broadcast by phone on Tuesday evening from a London venue. 3G technology lets people take, watch and send video clips on their phones, as well as swap data much faster than with 2G networks like GSM. Some people may stay the whole time, some may dip in and out,"" said Ms Henderson. ""We are looking on how long people will stay on average on the streams. ""It's like going to a concert hall, except that you are virtually there."" The company behind the trial hopes to learn more about how people use their video phones. And during the intermission, of course, you would still be able to make a phone call."
2006,"Consumers 'snub portable video'
Consumers want music rather than movies while on the move, says a report. Only 7% wanted a player that could handle games and video. Produced by Jupiter Research the analysis of the portable media player market found only 13% of Europeans want to watch video while out and about. ""Dedicated music players are the only established digital media players in Europe today despite their high prices,"" said Ian Fogg, Jupiter analyst. Mr Fogg said portable video players were likely to remain a niche product that would not be able to compete with devices dedicated to music playback. ""Europeans care most about music playback,"" he said. By contrast, almost a third are interested in listening to music on a portable player such as an iPod. At the end of 2003, the market was worth 10.6m euros (£7.36m). Digital music players will be behind this market growth said Jupiter ."
2007,"One of the nice things about being a writer is that I rarely have to go to an office to work. And I can spend the day working with my girlfriend Anne, a children's writer, at her house in Cambridge, sharing her wireless network. This did not seem too bad, but in fact she really suffered until her connection was restored on Wednesday. As a result she did not submit the pictures she wanted to use for a book on earthquakes because they were too big to send over dial-up. Learning to love broadband
We are reaching the point where broadband is a central part of daily life, at least for some, argues technology analyst Bill Thompson. She may be unusual, but I do not think Anne is alone. My dad finally made the change earlier this month and new net users are selecting broadband from the start. More and more of these broadband users are beginning to mould their daily lives around the availability of broadband internet connections, and they too will find it difficult to cope if they cannot get online for any reason. It is part of the process of adaptation, and it is a vital step in the growth of broadband in the UK and elsewhere. Just ask Anne."
2008,"Far from looking like a mould-breaking handheld, it looks more like Nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype. ""We believe the DS will appeal to all ages, both genders and gamers of any skill,"" said David Yarnton, Nintendo Europe's general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld. The Japanese gaming giant hopes the DS will maintain the firm's pre-eminence in an increasingly-competitive mobile gaming market. Nintendo DS aims to touch gamers
The mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of high-profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback. The top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top-down map and the ability to switch weapons. Japan and Europe will have to wait until the first quarter of 2005 to get the device. But will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed? It is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating. It certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people. One thing is for certain."
2009,"The Paris-based pressure group said the English-language news site had been unavailable for the past 10 days. China 'blocks Google news site'
China has been accused of blocking access to Google News by the media watchdog, Reporters Without Borders. China is believed to extend greater censorship over the net than any other country in the world. ""China is censoring Google News to force internet users to use the Chinese version of the site which has been purged of the most critical news reports,"" said the group in a statement. For its part, the search giant said it was looking into the issue. A net police force monitors websites and e-mails, and controls on gateways connecting the country to the global internet are designed to prevent access to critical information. Google News gathers information from some 4,500 news sources. It offers 15 editions of the service, including one tailored for China and one for Hong Kong. Google launched a version in simplified Chinese in September."
2010,"It seems that thousands of civil servants at the UK's Department of Work and Pensions went through the same thing last week. Senior consultants from EDS, the computer firm which manage the system, and Microsoft, which supplied the software, were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all, while staff resorted to phone, fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work done. It has emerged that the internal network crashed in a particularly horrible way, depriving staff of e-mail and access to the application software they use to calculate people's benefit and pension entitlement or note changes in personal circumstances. So I will reserve judgment on the technology aspects until we all know what actually happened and whether it was a consequence of software failure or just bad luck. Bill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital. It is the network equivalent of Godel's Theorem - any system sufficiently complex to be useful is also able to collapse catastrophically. Fortunately the back-office systems which actually pay people their money were still working, so only new claims and updates were affected done properly. Why was not the pensions minister in Parliament to make an emergency statement on Tuesday, when it was clear that there was a serious problem? A major system has evidently collapsed and we need to know what went wrong and what is being done differently. Anything less is a betrayal of public trust."
2011,"They must warn people earlier about possible fraud, Icstis said. Telecoms ombudsman Elizabeth France said: ""Certainly I would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if I do something out of the ordinary. ""So I would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach."" The government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say Icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future. These scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them. How about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti-virus and firewall software is up to date? It's about time that the profiteering by the 'legitimate' phone companies came to an end, mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up! I have been scammed of £139. One example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid. They simply billed me."
2012,"By getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver, Lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity. ""We've never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do,"" said Malte Pollmann, spokesman for Lycos Europe. ""We've found a way to make it much higher cost for spammers by putting a load on their servers."" But, he said, if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day. ""That would be fighting one bad thing with another bad thing,"" he said. ""Every single user will contribute three to four megabytes per day,"" he said, ""about one MP3 file."" Despite the soft launch, Mr Pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than 20,000 times in the last four days. Lycos did not want to use e-mail to fight back, said Mr Pollmann. The list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from real-time blacklists generated by organisations such as Spamcop. Early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to 85%."
2013,"First look at PlayStation 3 chip
Some details of the chip inside Sony's PlayStation 3 have been revealed. When put inside powerful computer servers, the Cell consortium expects it to be capable of handling 16 trillion floating point operations, or calculations, every second. The three firms claim that the Cell chip will be up to 10 times more powerful than existing processors. A working version of the PS3 is due to be shown off in May 2005 but a full launch of the next generation console is not expected to start until 2006. IBM said it would start producing the chip in early 2005 at manufacturing plants in the US. ""In the future, all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network,"" said Ken Kutaragi, Chief Operating Officer of Sony. ""Current PC architecture is nearing its limits."""
2014,"Existing services such as eBay could provide a good blueprint for such services, says the think-tank. The paper is part of the IPPR's Digital Society initiative which is producing a number of conferences and research papers leading up to the publication of A Manifesto For A Digital Britain. But he adds, government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too. ""A single publicly funded and run online community in which citizens can have a single place to go where you can go to engage in diversity and in a way that might have a policy implication - like a pre-legislation discussion."" Although the net is becoming part of local and central government, its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online ""commons"" for public debate. Proposals for ID cards, for instance, could also be widened to see if they could be used online. The key idea to take from systems such as eBay and other online communities is letting members rate each other's reputation by how they treat other members. ""At the moment they have been presented as a way for government to keep tabs on people and ensuring access to public services,"" said Mr Davies. ""Government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online. There is a role for public bodies like the BBC, libraries, and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of ""cliques"" talking to each other, he added."

Gaming on the move is one of the fastest-growing activities among the tech-savvy in India, says a report. Mobile gaming is expected to explode globally over the next few years. In October, mobile phone users grew by 1.4 million to 44.9 million, overtaking the number of landlines, said the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. ""The growth of this market sector has attracted publishers, developers, animators, musicians, and content providers, and is also stimulating the development of innovative business models,"" said Clint Wheelock, director of In-Stat/MDR's wireless research group. ""Mobile gaming is not just about fun; it also represents one key element of a rich mobile entertainment experience for consumers, and a lucrative market opportunity for industry players."" The trend echoes the uptake of mobiles in many developing economies, which continues to grow as people opt to leapfrog slower and more expensive state-run fixed-line operators. Despite this, the penetration rate is still much lower that other countries."
2016,"""Consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like HDTVs [high-definition TVs], digital radio, and digital cameras will remain strong in 2005. Gadget market 'to grow in 2005'
The explosion in consumer technology is to continue into 2005, delegates at the world's largest gadget show, in Las Vegas, have been told. ""A lot of this is driven by just the ability to do it,"" said Stephen Baker, a consumer electronics analyst with retail research firm NPD Group. ""All the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry."" Industry experts were also excited about high-definition technologies coming to the fore in 2005, with new formats for DVDs coming out which will hold six times as much data as conventional DVDs. At the start of last year's CES, the CEA predicted there would be an average growth of 4% in 2004. With so many devices on the move there were a lot of products on show offering external storage, like Seagate's 5GB pocket sized external hard drive, which won an innovation for engineering and design prize. More than 120,000 trade professionals attended CES in Las Vegas, which officially ran from 6 to 9 January. He disappointed some, however, by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the Xbox games console. Despite several embarrassing technical glitches during Mr Gate's pre-show speech, he announced several new partnerships - mainly for the US market."
2017,"Swap offer for pirated Windows XP
Computer giant Microsoft has launched a pilot scheme to replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones. The first-time initiative is restricted to the UK and to users with pre-installed copies of the operating system in PCs bought before November. In June, the software giant said that the major security update to Windows XP, Service Pack 2, would not work with the most widely pirated versions of its operating system. The upgrade closed security loopholes in XP and added features that made it easier to keep machines safe from viruses and other types of malicious computer code. The procedure consists of a series of computer checks, collating documents, and filling out a witness statement. ""This is a great opportunity for users to confirm the authenticity of Windows XP software whilst helping gather vital information about illegal traders"", said Alex Hilton, licence compliance manager at Microsoft. The plan would enable Microsoft to gather intelligence about illegal traders in a prompt way, which would allow it to take action against software pirates."
2018,"Ban hits Half-Life 2 pirates hard
About 20,000 people have been banned from playing the Half-Life 2 game. Copies of Half-Life 2 had been circulating on file-sharing systems soon after it was officially released. Half-Life 2 was officially released on 16 November but before gamers could get to grips with the long-awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online. ""The method used was extremely easy for Valve to trace and confirm, and so there is no question that the accounts disabled were used to try and illegally obtain Half-Life 2,"" read the statement. Valve spokesman Doug Lombardi said that the company had not yet released sales figures for the game and would not say what proportion of all Steam players the 20,000 represented. In its statement Valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake Half-Life 2 keys, copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game, just to catch pirates and cheats were false. The company said: ""The hack came from the 'community' as do they all."" If Steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum, said Mr Fahey, other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems. ""But with this, Valve is taking really effective steps against people using illegitimate copies of Half-Life 2,"" he said. Unless game firms were careful, he said, they could face a backlash from consumers who soon get tired of maintaining different accounts for every game they play."
2019,"While IE's market share has dropped 5% since May to 88.9%, Mozilla browsers - including Firefox - have grown by 5%. ""It seems that people are switching from Microsoft's Internet Explorer to Mozilla's new Firefox browser,"" said Niels Brinkman, co-founder of Amsterdam-based OneStat.com. There was a flurry of downloads on its first day of release. Firefox is made by the Mozilla Foundation which was set up by former browser maker Netscape in 1998. Microsoft IE has dominated the browser market for some time after taking the crown from Netscape, and its share of users has always stayed at around the 95% mark. Firefox is attractive to many because it is open-source. OneStat.com compiled the statistical measurements from two million net users in 100 countries. Paul Randle, Microsoft Windows Client product manager, responded to the figures: ""We certainly respect that some customers will choose alternative browsers and that choosing a browser is about more than a handful of features. ""Microsoft continues to make significant investments in IE, including Service Pack 2 with advanced security technologies, and continues to encourage a vibrant ecosystem of third party add-ons for Internet Explorer."" Opera is set to release its version 7.60 by the end of the year."
2020,"When installed the malicious program also locks many of the 7610's functions making it hard to use and harder to repair. The program is only the latest in a series of viruses produced to attack mobile phones. The Skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias Tee-222. The only thing the phone can do is make and take calls. The file, nicknamed Skulls, is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free add-ons, such as wallpaper, games and ringtones, for their phones Symbian said that it was not sure if the damage Skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming. A statement by Symbian played down the significance of the malicious program and said few people would fall victim to it as users have to go through several steps to install it, one of which includes ignoring a security warning. Once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications, such as contacts, calendar, notebook etc with non-working versions so the phone becomes almost useless. Despite this Finnish anti-virus lab F-Secure said it had sporadic reports of 7610 owners being caught out by it."
2021,"Max was completely captivated, and I was intrigued to discover that I had nearly missed the next stage of the network revolution. With Vodafone now pushing its own 3G service, and 3 already established in the UK, video on the phone is clearly going to become a must-have for kids sitting on the school bus, adults waiting outside clubs and anyone who has time to kill and a group of friends to impress. But it goes deeper than that: playing music videos on a phone marks the beginning of a move away from the 'download and play' model we have all accepted for our iPods and MP3 players. After all, why should I want to carry 60GB of music and pictures around with me in my pocket when I can simply listen to anything I want, whenever I want, streamed to my phone? Bill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital. 3G phones and iPods can co-exist, at least for a while, but if I had to bet on the long term I would go for content on demand over carrying gigabytes in my pocket. It is certainly not a great overall experience, but that is largely due to the poor menu system and the phone layout: the video content itself is compelling. Vodafone will let you access its services on Vodafone Live! This will please the network operators, who are looking for some revenue from their expensively acquired 3G licences. An MP3G player, anyone?"
2022,"Many people in the developing world give up one of their daily meals so they can afford to buy a TV. Why? He calls it a PCtvt - A personal computer, television and telephone all in one that runs on a normal desktop machine. ""The major part is making it foolproof, very tough, so that it never breaks,"" he says. This dependence on graphics, video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs 100 times more power and more memory than one for a PhD. ""The underlying problem,"" he says, ""is how you can increase their wealth and reduce their poverty and reduce their illiteracy, and improve their health care.' Prof Reddy has teamed up with Eric Brewer at the University of California at Berkeley. ""We're doing a lot of work on long-distance wireless and how to make the network work better in the presence of intermittency, when the power goes up and down, and the links go up and down, and the computers you're connected to just get turned off for no reason."" Even with the technology it's an uphill battle. ""And what I'm postulating is that this is the technology that will enable them."
2023,"Computer grid to help the world
Your computer can now help solve the world's most difficult health and social problems. The donated processor cycles will help the WCG create virtual supercomputers via the net. The idea follows the success of other similar projects that have used the untapped processing power of millions of desktop PCs. One of the most successful collaboration projects was Seti@home, run by the Search for Extra Terrestrial Life project, which sorted through radio signals looking for signs of alien communication. Organisations also represented on the board include the United Nations Development Programme and the World Health Organisation. ""The World Community Grid will enable researchers around the globe to gather and analyze unprecedented quantities of data to help address important global issues,"" said Elain Gallin, program director for medical research at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. ""[It] will inspire us to look beyond the technological limitations that have historically restricted us from addressing some of our most intractable problems"", she added."
2024,"Tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail. The image was created by imaging experts from the Dutch research and technology laboratory TNO which created the 2.5 gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge. Following the success of this project, and with promises of help from others, the TNO team is considering creating a full 360-degree panoramic view of another Dutch city, with even higher resolution. That image portrayed Bryce Canyon National Park, in Utah, and was made up of 196 separate photographs. Each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite. The panorama of Delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in Mr Lyons' image. The goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images. ""He did it all by hand, which was an enormous effort, and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques, it would be feasible to build a larger image,"" said Jurgen den Hartog, one of the TNO researchers behind the project. ""We were not competing with Mr Lyons, but it started as a lunchtime bet."" The stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful PCs over three days."
2025,"Remote control rifle range debuts
Soon you could go hunting via the net. ""We were looking at a beautiful white-tail buck and my friend said 'If you just had a gun for that'. A little light bulb went off in my head,"" Mr Underwood told the Reuters news agency. A Texas company is considering letting web users use a remote-controlled rifle to shoot down deer, antelope and wild pigs. Already the Live-Shot site lets people shoot 10 rounds at paper and silhouette targets for $5.95 for each 20-minute shooting session. For a small fee users will take control of a camera and rifle that they can use to spot and shoot the game animals as they roam around a 133-hectare Texas ranch. Mr Underwood said that internet hunting could be popular with disabled hunters unable to get out in the woods or distant hunters who cannot afford a trip to Texas. Mr Underwood is planning to put one of these rigs in a concealed location in a small reserve on his Texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals. ""We assume it would be extremely difficult to accurately control a gun in this way and therefore it would be difficult to ensure a 'clean kill', something the RSPCA accepts is the intention of those shooting for sport,"" it said. He said state laws on hunting only covered ""regulated animals"" such as native deer and bird species."
2026,"Although only released in November the sprawling story of guns, gangsters game beat off strong competition and by year end had sold more than 1.75 million copies. Five titles, including Sony EyeToy Play and EA's Need for Speed: Underground 2, managed this feat according to figures compiled by Chart-Track for the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (Elspa). 2004 was a ""stellar year"" said Roger Bennett, director general of Elspa. Gangsters dominate gaming chart
Video games on consoles and computers proved more popular than ever in 2004. ""In a year with no new generation consoles being released, the market continued to be buoyant as the industry matured and the increasingly diverse range of games reached new audiences and broadened its player base - across ages and gender,"" he said. Gamers spent more than £1.34bn in 2004, almost 7% more than they did in 2003 according to figures released by the UK gaming industry's trade body. Games linked to Shrek, The Incredibles, Spider-Man, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings were all in the top 20. 16 out of the top 20 titles were all follow-ups to established franchises or direct sequels to previously popular games. Valve has yet to release figures which show how many copies of the game were sold in this way. Despite winning awards and rave reviews Half-Life 2 did not appear in the list."
2027,"Broadband wireless connectivity will be made available in the eleven reading rooms, the auditorium, caf&#233;, restaurant, and outdoor Piazza area. ""At the British Library we are continually exploring ways in which technology can help us to improve services to our users,"" said Lynne Brindley, chief executive of the British Library. ""Surveys we conducted recently confirmed that, alongside the materials they consult here, our users want to be able to access the internet when they are at the Library for research or to communicate with colleagues,"" she said. The majority of visitors wanted to be able to access their e-mail as well as the British Library catalogue. This could be because of its proximity to busy mainline stations such as Kings Cross and Euston. The technology has been on trial since May and usage levels make the Library London's most active public hotspot. The service will be priced at £4.50 for an hour's session or £35 for a monthly pass. The British Library receives around 3,000 visitors each day and serves around 500,000 readers each year. People come to view resources which include the world's largest collection of patents and the UK's most extensive collection of science, technology and medical information."
2028,"It represents a ""big leap forward"" for broadband, said Chris Stening, UK Online general manager. The service will initially be available to users within 2km radius of 230 telephone exchanges in areas such as London, Birmingham, Glasgow and Cambridge. The service includes WiFi as standard, meaning users can connect multiple PCs, laptops and game consoles from any room in the house. Not everybody will be able to take advantage of the service, as it will be restricted to metropolitan areas. That represents about 4.4 million households. UK Online is looking at the possibility of bundling services such as cheap net telephone calls, video-on-demand and TV by 2005 if the service proves popular. ""The service is twice as fast as any other service on offer in the UK and 16 times faster than most broadband services,"" said Mr Stening. ""It takes a big leap for broadband and we are very excited about it,"" he said. ""A typical family with two adults and two children is currently sharing a 512 kilobit service. This will basically give them 2 megabits each,"" he said."
2029,"He urged people to follow his lead and 'dump' brands associated with companies such as eDonkey. Similarly telecommunications firm NTL blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites. The BPI strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue,"" it said in a statement. ""We have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge. Meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser's dream come true and a branding nightmare. ""You may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service eDonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include Nat West, Vodafone, O2, First Direct, NTL, and Renault,"" he said in an open letter to the British Phonographic Industry last month. Since the matter was brought to its attention last month, the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites, a spokesman told the BBC News website. ""Advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience,"" he said. However Mr Mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations. While smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends, this is no excuse for well-known brands, he said."
2030,"This last category includes the case of a man who became so mad with his malfunctioning laptop that he threw it in the lavatory and flushed a couple of times. The list of the top 10 global data disasters was compiled by recovery company Ontrack. Although computer malfunctions remain the most common cause of file loss, data recovery experts say human behaviour still is to blame in many cases. ""Data can disappear as a result of natural disaster, system fault or computer virus, but human error, including 'computer rage', seems to be a growing problem,"" said Adrian Palmer, managing director of Ontrack Data Recovery. ""Nevertheless, victims soon calm down when they realise the damage they've done and come to us with pleas for help to retrieve their valuable information."" Mr Palmer recalled the case of a couple who had hundreds of pictures of their baby's first three months on their computer, but managed to reformat the hard drive and erase all the precious memories."
2031,"Mobile picture power in your pocket
How many times have you wanted to have a camera to hand to catch an unexpected event that would make headlines? One day later De Telegraaf, a daily Amsterdam newspaper, became news on its own when it published a picture taken with a mobile phone of Mr van Gogh's body moments after he was killed. Other accounts of such picture phone users witnessing news events, include:
 - A flight from Switzerland to the Dominican Republic which turned around after someone took a picture of a piece of metal falling from the plane as it took off from Zurich (reported by the Swiss daily Le Matin). Already on-the-spot snappers are helping newspapers add immediacy to their breaking news stories headlines, where professional photographers only arrive in time for the aftermath. It could be the start of a trend that only increases as higher resolution phone cameras become more widespread; as video phones catch on and millions of people start carrying the gadgets around. It's a massive thing,"" Mr Reichhold told the BBC News website. ""Not many people walk around with their cameras, but they always have their mobile phones with them. But this is not just about traditional media lending immediacy to their stories with content from ordinary people, it is also about first-hand journalism in the form of online diaries or weblogs. For Henry Reichhold, this is progress: ""That's the whole thing about the immediacy of the thing. I can see that happening a lot more."""
2032,"""The way I see it I'm selling something I already own; after 30 days I get it back,"" he told the BBC Today programme. Mr Fisher has received 39 bids so far, with the largest bid currently at more than $322 (£171). Mr Fisher said that while he would accept any brand name or logo, ""I wouldn't go around with a swastika or anything racial"". His sales pitch adds: ""Take advantage of this radical advertising campaign and become a part of history."" He added: ""I wouldn't go around with 666, the mark of the beast. ""Other than that I wouldn't promote anything socially unacceptable such as adult websites or stores."""
2033,"Those clicking on the poisoned links in e-mail messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus. They exploit a Windows vulnerability that was discovered only a few days earlier. A Windows virus called Bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code. The messages try to trick people into clicking on the links by promising pornographic videos and images or by posing as payment confirmation for a Paypal transaction. The virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch e-mail messages to potential victims but, unlike many other recent viruses, does not itself travel via mail. Copies of the messages seen by the BBC News website had bright yellow and green backgrounds. Shutting down this central server usually stops the virus spreading. Clearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the e-mail messages sent out by machines infected by Bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread. Users running Windows XP that have applied the SP2 update are not vulnerable to the loophole that Bofra exploits. Tim Warner, spokesman for anti-virus firm Finjan, said: ""You have people getting very creative now to deliver the virus and get it propagating."""
2034,"Although the percentage of Britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests. Those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts. BT set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. Costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. ""Internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it,"" said Adrian Hosford, director of corporate responsibility at BT. The Alliance for Digital Inclusion, an independent body with members drawn from government, industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks. ""There is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. They don't have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits,"" said Mr Hosford. Organisations such as BT have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said Mr Hosford. ""If we don't address this problem now, it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs, education opportunities will be limited and they'll simply not be able to keep up with society,"" he said."
2035,"""Historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology,"" said Dr Michael Bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at Ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab. One good example of this was diary-writing among younger people, he said. Only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them, such as cameras, can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it. ""They just move the activity into the mobile phone as it's a much more convenient way to do it."" Consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size, onboard memory or the chip inside, shows an in-depth study by handset maker Ericsson. ""Usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras,"" he said. Dr Bjorn said groups dubbed ""pioneers"" and ""materialists"" were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use. However, he said, now 45% of the Japanese people Ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. Similar rises have been seen in many other European nations. Now the figure is 14%."
2036,"Mr Macklin said that too often when people use a search engine it was like the first time they ever used it, because there was no memory of what they had searched for before. The series of updates to its service, collected under the My Ask Jeeves banner, would help people remember where they had been before. Under My Ask Jeeves users can search the web or through the results they have already noted as interesting. ""Each time you go back in you have to start all over again,"" he said. ""The competition has validated the problem we tackle,"" said Suranga Chandratillake, co-founder of Blinkx. By way of comparison Google's Desktop search tool catalogues search histories informally and lets people look through the sites they have visited. Since Blinkx launched it has faced increased competition from firms such as Google, Copernic, Enfish, X1 and Apple all of whom now have programs that let people search their PC as well as the web. The variety of ways to search data was only helping users, said Mr Chandratillake and that it was likely that in the future people would use different ones for different tasks. In the latest release of Blinkx, the company has added what it calls smart folders. ""The classic thing we have seen recently, is people using Blinkx to look at the things they have searched on,"" he said."
2037,"Through the Make Love, Not Spam website, users could download a screensaver that would endlessly request data from the net sites mentioned in many junk mail messages. The anti-spammer screensaver came under fire for encouraging vigilante activity and skirting the edge of the law. More than 100,000 people are thought to have downloaded the screensaver that Lycos Europe offered. Some net service firms began blocking access to the Lycos Europe site in protest at the action. The company wanted to keep the spam sites running at near total capacity to make it much less financially attractive to spammers to operate the sites. Monitoring firm Netcraft found that the anti-spam campaign was proving a little too successful. Lycos has shut down the campaign saying it had been started to stimulate debate about anti-spam measures and had now achieved this aim. In a statement from Lycos Europe announcing the scrapping of the scheme, the company denied that this was its fault. ""At the time that Netcraft measured the sites it claims may have been brought down, they were not in fact part of the Make Love, Not Spam attack cycle,"" it added."
2038,"More than 120 experts were in Nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as Nokia, Intel, Philips, Alcatel, France Telecom, Thomson and Telefonica. But again and again, speakers stated they could not see incompatible, stand-alone solutions working. A long-term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required. In Nice last week, the European Commission announced its Networked & Electronic Media (NEM) initiative. The European Commission is being pragmatic in its approach. What is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget. The NEM approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline, pick out the best, bring them together and identify where the gaps are. Where it finds holes, it will develop standards to fill them. With the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally, the prize for being the supplier of the world's dominant DRM scheme is huge.

2039,"What this means, said Stacey Jolna, senior vice president of TV Guide TV group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for TV viewers. For the likes of the BBC, there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. With the US leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices. ""We will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands,"" said Tim Hanlon, from brand communications firm Starcom MediaVest. But some US networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as ""brand identity"" and viewer loyalty to channels. All these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want. They are also being built-in to high-definition TV sets, which are big business in Japan and the US, but slower to take off in Europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. ""The reality is that with broadband connections, anybody can be the producer of content."" But it might not suit everyone, the panel recognised. They perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands, Mr Hanlon suggested."
2040,"In 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages. Other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards. In September 2003, MessageLabs caught only 273 phishing e-mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations. The number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm MessageLabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months. ""E-mail security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity,"" said Mark Sunner, chief technology officer at MessageLabs. Mr Sunner said MessageLabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation. ""In just 12 months phishing has firmly established itself as a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online,"" he said. In 2003 only 40% of messages were spam. One of the biggest outbreaks took place in January when the MyDoom virus started circulating. Also up this year was the amount of spam in circulation."
2041,"Gritty return for Prince of Persia
Still basking in the relatively recent glory of last year's Sands Of Time, the dashing Prince of Persia is back in Warrior Within, and in a more bellicose mood than last time. The time-travelling plot hinges on the Dahaka, an all-consuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages. As before, you control the super-athletic prince from a third-person perspective. Combining them at speed is the best fun, although getting a handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill. The game's developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways. That in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance, for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path. The expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct, but combat is what is really been stepped up, and there is more of it than before. Perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be. That said, the graphics are excellent, and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game. It just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for."
2042,"The next generation of DVDs promise very high quality pictures and sound, as well as a lot of data. Both technologies use a blue laser to write information. Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM Studios have already staked their allegiance with the Blu-ray Disc Association, whose members also include technology companies Dell, Samsung and Matsushita. Sony lost out to JVC in that fight. Film giant Disney says it will produce its future DVDs using Sony's Blu-ray Disc technology, but has not ruled out a rival format developed by Toshiba. Universal is to start producing films on the HD-DVD format in 2005, and Paramount will start releasing titles using the standard in 2006. If Fox decided to go with Blu-ray too, it would mean the format would have a 47% share of DVD content. Those studios currently produce about 45% of DVD content."
2043,"Music, images, e-mails, and texts are being hoarded on mobiles, cameras laptops and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), a Toshiba study found. It found that more than 60% kept 1,000 to 2,000 music files on their devices, making the UK ""digitally fat"". He calculated physical comparisons for digital data in the mid-1990s. He worked out that one gigabyte (1,000,000,000 bytes) was the equivalent of a pick-up truck filled with paper. The survey reflects the increasing trend for portable devices with built-in hard drives like music and media players from Apple, Creative Labs, Archos, iRiver and others. The amount of data people are squirreling away on their gadgets is clearly a sign that people are finding more things to do with their shiny things. ""Transfer of data between different memory types has improved significantly in recent times, and will be further helped by the standards for hard drives which are currently being developed by the major manufacturers,"" said Mr Larsson. ""People are looking for more than just phone calls and text messages on the move, they want things like web browsing, e-mailing, music, photos and more."" They suggest the number of hard drives in consumer electronics gadgets could grow from 17 million last year to 55 million in 2006. The cost of making hard drives has dropped and is continuing to do so because of improved technologies so they are proving to be more cost-effective than other forms of memory, he added."
2044,"Halo 2 heralds traffic explosion
The growing popularity of online gaming could spell problems for net service firms, warns network monitoring company Sandvine. The 9 November traffic explosion has continued into December, said Sandvine. Gamers who want to play online can create their own clan, or team, and take on others to see how well they compare. Service providers now need to make sure that their networks can cope with the increasing demands for bandwidth. But the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be a wake-up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic, said Sandvine's chief technology officer Marc Morin. ""In the competitive broadband environment, operators need to differentiate the way they offer access to services like live-play gaming,"" she said. In a bid to cope and ease congestion, providers are increasingly making their networks intelligent, finding out who is using bandwidth and for what. Gamers tend to migrate toward networks with the lowest ""lag""."
2045,"But this year, they are set to get smarter and more connected, to allow people to find more video to watch on them. ""And now those consumers can stay connected and productive at the same time."" Last year saw the emergence of portable media players, such as the Windows-based Creative Zen portable media player, the Samsung Yepp, the iRiver PMC-100, and the Archos AV400 series among others. ""Consumers are showing a great thirst for devices that store all their media in one place for anywhere access,"" said Henri Crohas, chief of Archos. The TiVo To Go service means that US consumers will be able to take any programmes they record on their TiVos and transfer it for free to watch on any of the Windows-based portable media players or smartphones. Recent research by Jupiter suggested that people would prefer a device that was dedicated to music. The possibility is open for non-professional makers of video and audio to take advantage of the growing portable media market to distribute their work. More seemed interested in spending their cash on music-only devices. ""We are very bullish about it. The fact that I can put photos on here too and share them is super-cool to the consumer,"" he added."

The aim is to overcome some of the huge logistical challenges in getting supplies to where they are needed. This kind of detailed analysis usually takes a couple of months but Respond gets it done in about 12 hours. ""You have to convert the data into images, then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis, damage, or situation maps,"" said Stefan Voigt, who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations, the German Aerospace Centre. Respond is using satellite imagery to produce accurate maps that can be used in the field rapidly.

Sony lost out to JVC in that fight. Film giant Disney says it will produce its future DVDs using Sony's Blu-ray Disc technology, but has not ruled out a rival format developed by Toshiba. Those studios currently produce about 45% of DVD content. The current battle for Hollywood's hearts and minds is a crucial one because high-definition films will bring in billions of revenue and the studios would prefer to use one standard. Twentieth Century Fox is still to announce which technology it will be supporting. If Fox decided to go with Blu-ray too, it would mean the format would have a 47% share of DVD content."
2048,"""Historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology,"" said Dr Michael Bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at Ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab. One good example of this was diary-writing among younger people, he said. Only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them, such as cameras, can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it. ""They just move the activity into the mobile phone as it's a much more convenient way to do it."" Consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size, onboard memory or the chip inside, shows an in-depth study by telecommunications company Ericsson. ""Usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras,"" he said. Dr Bjorn said groups dubbed ""pioneers"" and ""materialists"" were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use. However, he said, now 45% of the Japanese people Ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. Similar rises have been seen in many other European nations. Now the figure is 14%."
2049,"Although the percentage of Britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests. Those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts. BT set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. Costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. ""Internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it,"" said Adrian Hosford, director of corporate responsibility at BT. The Alliance for Digital Inclusion, an independent body with members drawn from government, industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks. ""There is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. They don't have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits,"" said Mr Hosford. Organisations such as BT have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said Mr Hosford. ""If we don't address this problem now, it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs, education opportunities will be limited and they'll simply not be able to keep up with society,"" he said."
2050,"Spam e-mails tempt net shoppers
Computer users across the world continue to ignore security warnings about spam e-mails and are being lured into buying goods, a report suggests. The Business Software Alliance (BSA) warned that people should ""stay alert"". The results also showed that the proportion of people reading - or admitting to reading - and taking advantage of adult entertainment spam e-mails is low, at one in 10. ""By selling software that appears to be legitimate in genuine looking packaging or through sophisticated websites, spammers are hiding spyware without consumers' knowledge. ""Many online consumers don't consider the true motives of spammers,"" said Mike Newton, a spokesperson for the BSA which commissioned the survey. The research, which covered 6,000 people in six countries and their attitudes towards junk e-mails, revealed that Brazilians were the most likely to read spam. ""Once the software is installed on PCs and networks, information that is given over the internet can be obtained and abused."""
2051,"The tech-fest, the largest of its kind in the world, runs from 6 to 9 January. ""The digital revolution is about the democratisation of technology and the experiences it makes possible,"" she told delegates. She added: ""The real story of the digital revolution is not just new products, but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell."" Part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content, such as images, video and music. A lot of work still needs to be done, however, to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly, she said. Coming out in the autumn in the US, the box is a networked, high-definition TV, cable set-top box, digital video recorder and DVD recorder. Ms Fiorina also announced that HP was working with Nokia to launch a visual radio service for mobiles, which would launch in Europe early this year. The digital cameras, which are due to go on sale in the US by the summer, are based on the HP 607 model. The service is designed to make mobile radio more interactive. Eighty per cent of those remain on cameras."

Toyota's prototypes represent the latest incarnation of wearable exoskeletons in a vehicular form that is specially focused on transport. Experts, though, are a bit sceptical of their acceptance in this area. Such single-person vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport. ""In general, introducing a new technology requires the passenger to change behaviour patterns that have served the older passenger for decades. ""The concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions,"" said Dr Gillingwater. ""This may be another barrier to the commercial success of such a vehicle."" ""It looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need. ""What's their range? How user-friendly will they really be?"

The campaign is intended to help Londoners, especially women, avoid trouble on the way home. ""They can work in previously inaccessible areas such as underground stations which is obviously a huge advantage in a campaign of this sort,"" he said. The TfL campaign using the posters will run until Boxing Day. ""It's a well established technology."" Although the hypertags in the posters only pass on a phone number, Ms Harker said they can pass on almost any form of data including images, ring tones and video clips. ""Before we ran a campaign there was a big question mark of: 'If we build it will they come?'"" she said. ""Now we know that, yes, they will."""
2054,"And this Christmas, parents are expected to spend millions on video games and consoles. Violent games have been hit by controversy after the game Manhunt was blamed by the parents of 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah, who was stabbed to death in Leicester in February. The issue was discussed at a meeting between UK government officials, industry representatives and the British Board of Film Classification. It follows concerns that children may be playing games aimed at adults which include high levels of violence. In 2003, Britons spent £1,152m on games, more than ever before. ""Adults can make informed choices about what games to play. Children can't and they deserve to be protected,"" said Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell after the meeting. Police investigating Stefan's murder dismissed its influence and said Manhunt was not part of its legal case. ""They will be formulated to create specific proposals to promote greater understanding, recognition and awareness of the games rating system, ensuring that young people are not exposed to inappropriate content."" Roger Bennett, director general of Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association, said: ""A number of initiatives were discussed at the meeting."

The BBC's online search engine was used a record amount in 2004, helping with enquires both simple and strange. The most requested search terms of 2004 included games, EastEnders, CBBC, John Peel, Harry Potter and Olympics. But there were many strange enquiries, including: what is a dog?, how do you say basketball? and what is the biggest collection of naval fluff? The search engine works by matching key words typed in to different web pages but many people still type in natural language questions. Here are some of the strangest queries of 2004 - spelling and grammar errors left untouched - and their possible solutions:
 - How to fold a serviette like an elf's boot? - What are the contemporary issue in nurses? Companies such as Google have become of paramount importance as they dictate how people travel through websites while online."

Like some drill sergeant from the past, Metal Slug 3 is a wake-up call to today's gamers molly-coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings. And yes, that includes Halo 2. The shoot-anything-that-moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old-school genius. Of course, most of you will ignore this, lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters. It is also the toughest game you are likely to play, as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on. Tanks, jets and submarines can be commandeered, as well as cannon-toting camels, elephants and ostriches - more weaponry on offer than in an acre of Iraq. And at a mere £20, Metal Slug 3 is as cheap as sliced, fried spuds, as the man says."
2057,"But although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps, sounds and video clips few, so far, are taking the chance to do so. ""Also,"" he said, ""they have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding it."" Figures gathered by Continental Research shows that 36% of British camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message (MMS), up from 7% in 2003. Only 11% regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message. No-one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of MMS messages is capped, said Mr Bud. Andrew Bud, executive chairman of messaging firm Mblox, said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system. he said. ""There's a lot of user apprehension about that."" The broadcast system gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems. ""Operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers,"" said Yaron Toren, spokesman for Celltick."

According to eBay UK there are now more than 150 Robosapiens remote control robots for sale via the site. Mr Roper added that many retailers were working hard to reassure consumers that online shopping was safe and that goods ordered as presents would arrive in time for Christmas. Data collected by eBay suggests that some smart shoppers are getting round the shortages of hot presents by buying them direct through the auction site. Higher speeds meant that everything happened much faster, he said, which let people spend time browsing and finding out about products before they buy. The behaviour of online shoppers was also changing, he said. ""The single biggest reason people went online before this year was price,"" he said. ""They are looking for good prices and merchant reliability."" Similarly many shoppers are turning to eBay to help them get hold of the hard-to-find slimline PlayStation 2, which many retailers are only selling as part of an expensive bundle. In some eBay UK auctions the price has risen to more than double this figure."

The libraries of five of the world's most important academic institutions are to be digitised by Google. Users will only have access to extracts and bibliographies of copyrighted works. About one million books will be scanned by Google, less than 15% of the total collection held in the Bodleian. Harvard is limiting its participation to 40,000 books, while Oxford wants Google to scan books originally published in the 19th Century and held in the Bodleian Library. ""Important works that are out of print or only available in a few libraries around the world will be made available to everyone,"" she said. ""We hope that Oxford's contribution to this project will be of scholarly use, as well as general interest, to people around the world,"" said Reg Carr, director of Oxford University Library Services. ""It could solve an old problem: If people can't get to us, how can we get to them?"" ""It will be disruptive because some people will worry that this is the beginning of the end of libraries.

Television started off as a magical blurry image. Then came the sharpness, the colour and the widescreen format. By contrast, HDTV offers up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels. But TV viewers in Europe will have to wait to enjoy the eye-blasting high-definition images. But they still reach your screen in the old 625 lines. ""HDTV is just the latest must-have technology in viewers' homes,"" says Jo Flaherty, a senior broadcaster with the CBS network in the US. Viewers in Japan, the US, Australia, Canada and South Korea are already embracing the new TV technology, with a selection of primetime programmes being broadcast in the new format, which includes 5.1 digital surround sound. According to consultants Strategy Analytics, only 12% of homes in Europe will have TVs capable of showing programmes in high-definition by 2008. In the UK, satellite broadcaster BSkyB is planning HDTV services in 2006.

More than 100 server operators have been targeted in the actions launched in the US and UK, the MPAA added. BitTorrent users can download movies by following a link to files which are found on websites called trackers. The movie industry hopes that suing the people who run the trackers will cut BitTorrent users off from illegal movies at source.

The United States, Europe and Asia-Pacific are expected to add 150 million new PCs by 2010, according to the study. ""Instead local PC makers like Lenovo Group in China and Aquarius in Russia that can better tailor the PC form factor, price point and applications to their local markets will ultimately win the market share battle,"" he said."

Home printed pictures can be cheaper and higher quality than those from High Street developers, tests shows. ""If you really like your photos, then it's definitely worth printing at home instead of going to the high street, but only if you choose the right printer,"" said Nick Ross, top tester at PC Pro. The comprehensive test also revealed how quickly different printers produced images, the quality of the finished image and how resistant finished pictures were to smudging or water damage. A 10x7in snap at Boots would cost £4.99. It recommended avoiding so-called third-party inks not produced by printer makers because they tended to produce prints that fade the quickest. Ann Simpson, marketing manager at Snappy Snaps believes the convenience of high street printing will continue to attract customers. ""Some people will want to do their own thing on their computer but the feedback to us is that customers often have to print two or three pictures at home in order to get a good one,"" she said."

2068,"You are the eponymous renegade spy, an agent who deserts to the Bond world's extensive ranks of criminal masterminds, after being deemed too brutal for MI6. Recent Bond games like Nightfire and Everything Or Nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair, invention and glamour of the film franchise. Admittedly the competition has been tough, even in recent weeks, with the likes of Halo 2 and Half Life 2 triumphing in virtually every department. Bond game fails to shake or stir
For gaming fans, the word GoldenEye evokes excited memories not only of the James Bond revival flick of 1995, but also the classic shoot-em-up that accompanied it and left N64 owners glued to their consoles for many an hour. The notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a 007 game, but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to. There is a real thrill from doing battle with these legendary villains, and it is a testament to the power of the Bond universe that they can cut such a dash. As is the trend of late, you are made to feel like you are in the midst of a really messy and fraught encounter. A minute red dot passes for a crosshair, although the collision-detection is so suspect that the difficulties of aiming weapons are compensated for. But the in-game niggles, combined with a story and presentation that just do not feel sufficiently well thought-through, will make this a disappointment for most. GoldenEye: Rogue Agent is out now"

The ""run"" he is now capable of is perhaps not quite up to Olympic star Kelly Holmes' standard. The Japanese firm is a leader in developing two-legged robots and the new, improved Asimo (Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility) can now run, find his way around obstacles as well as interact with people. At 3km/h, it is closer to a leisurely jog. Technology developed for Asimo could be used in the automobile industry as electronics increasingly take over from mechanics in car design. While he may not quite be ready for yoga, he does have more freedom of movement, being able to twist his hips and bend his wrists, thumbs and neck. In August 2003 he even attended a state dinner in the Czech Republic, travelling with the Japanese prime minister as a goodwill envoy.

Deaf people who prefer to communicate using British Sign Language (BSL) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter. For many deaf people, especially those born deaf, BSL is a first and preferred means of communication. The RNID is urging telecoms regulator, Ofcom, to reduce the cost of the service from the current £7.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls. ""There are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people,"" said RNID technology director, Guido Gybels. ""In the US and Australia, sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call. ""I can show my emotions more easily in BSL in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls."" ""By failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users, the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group."" Mr Currington, like many of the UK's 70,000 BSL users, will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost-effective service available. But a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation.

Two high-speed lifts at the world's tallest building have been officially recognised as the planet's fastest. The super-fast lifts can speed up to 24 passengers to the tip of the tower in about 30 seconds, while ascending their 382m track. The TFC 101 Tower is due to be officially opened on 31 December. The 17m/s top speed of the lifts translates to about 38mph (61km/h). The key new technologies applied in the world's fastest elevators include:
 - A pressure control system, which adjusts the atmospheric pressure inside a car by using suction and discharge blowers, preventing ""ear popping"" 
 - An active control system which tries to balance the lift more finely and remove the sources of vibrations 
 - Streamlined cars to reduce the whistling noise produced by running the lifts at a high speed inside a narrow shaft 
 
""The certification of our elevators as world record-holders by the authoritative Guinness World Records is a great honour for us,"" said Masayuki Shimono, president of manufacturer Toshiba Elevator and Building Systems which installed the lifts.

The standard speed is 512kbps, though faster connections are available. According to BT, more than 95% of UK homes and businesses can receive broadband over the phone line.

In an attempt to win over Windows PC customers, Mr Jobs said it would appeal to people thinking of changing operating systems. Harris added: ""Everybody thought that Apple was happy to remain a niche maker of luxury computers, and moving into a market dominated by low margin manufacturers like Dell is a bold move. ""They want a further taste of Mac because they like what they have seen with iPod."" The music player has no display and will play songs either consecutively or shuffled. The smaller iPod will hold about 120 songs, said Mr Jobs."
2084,"Scottish speech technology firm CEC Systems launched the site in November. According to search engine Ask Jeeves, around 80% of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net. In the past speech technology has only been compatible with broadband because of the huge files it downloads but CEC says its compression technology means it will also work on slower dial-up connections. But Julie Howell, digital policy manager at the RNIB, expressed doubts over whether Speegle and similar sites added anything to blind people's experience of the web. ""We are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people, although the Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB) is looking at the technology,"" he added. People visiting Speegle can select one of three voices to read the results of a query or summarise news stories from sources such as the BBC and Reuters. ""There are a whole lot of options like this springing up on the web and one has to think carefully about what the market is going to be,"" she said. ""The site is bombarded by people just listening to the words. The repetition could be useful although they may all end up talking like robots,"" said Mr Renton. ""It is not a rip-off."
2085,"The number of people and business connected to broadband jumped by 38% in a year, said the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The total number of people and businesses on broadband rose by to 32.5 million in the year ending June 2004, compared to 23.5 million in June 2003. Broadband steams ahead in the US
More and more Americans are joining the internet's fast lane, according to official figures. But in the US, cable leads the way, accounting for 18.6 million lines. Whereas in the UK, most people hook up to broadband via Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) technology which lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds."
2086,"""Music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle; either single tracks or subscriptions services,"" said Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit, a UK-based music download service. This has outraged some digital music lovers, especially as Napster already offers a cheaper service for downloading music to the PC. While iTunes is doing good business with its sales of individual tracks to iPod owners, others are questioning whether the concept of owning music is even valid in the digital age. The service can be used on players that support Microsoft Windows latest Digital Rights Management technology known as Janus. Currently on offer in beta-version in the US, the service costs $15 per month for unlimited downloads. ""We've been offering our unlimited music subscription service for more than three years now and our customers know what they want. Format interoperability, excellent value and the reassurance that music purchased from Wippit is theirs to keep and enjoy on whatever device they choose,"" he said. ""Who wants to download a track that won't play next month if you decide to unsubscribe to the service or change portable player for an iPod or the latest mobile phone?"" It has a catalogue of around 60,000 songs."
2087,"Broadband soars in 2004
If broadband were a jumbo jet, then 2003 would have seen it taxiing down the runway, firing up its engines and preparing for take-off. But this year has seen it soar. The two key factors in whetting people's appetite were falling prices and a huge marketing push. For those who became broadbanders in 2004 there was no turning back and the days of waiting for the modem to kick in began to seem as outdated an idea as a jungle without celebrities. When operators such as BT and Telewest offered standard 512K broadband for less than £20 at the beginning of the year, it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached - broadband had truly gone mass market. The vital local loop is the crucial link between telephone exchanges and homes. At the moment BT has a stranglehold on more than 80% of these lines making it the key voice in deciding what ADSL products get into homes. It may not seem that exciting but it is a remarkable transition given that just a few years ago the arguments over local loop unbundling bore more than a passing resemblance to the Northern Ireland peace talks - fraught, bitter and with no end in sight. Broadband for less than £10 was even touted by some firms, although such a low price raised eyebrows among more established companies questioning how they are able to sustain such business models. It is unlikely to get any less easy to understand in 2005 but remains a plane worth catching."
2088,"The MDA say the figures for the three months up to 30 September are a ""rapid increase"" on the figure for the same time the previous year. GPRS lets people browse the web, access news services, mobile music and other applications like mobile chat. About 53 million people own a mobile in the UK, so the figures mean that half of those phones use GPRS. But a recent report from Continental Research reflects the continuing battle mobile companies have to actually persuade people to go online and to use MMS. BandAid was the fastest ever-selling ringtone this year, according to the MDA, and chat was given some publicity when Prime Minister Tony Blair answered questions through mobile text chat. This is a 14% rise from last September's figures. It said that 36% of UK camera phone users had never sent a multimedia message, or MMS. That was 7% more than in 2003. But critics say that MMS is confusing and some mobiles are too difficult to use."
2089,"Blinx sequel purrs nicely
The original Blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to Microsoft's then new Xbox console. Its sharp graphics and novel gameplay, with the main character able to pause, slow, rewind and fast-forward time, were meant to lure many fans to the new machine. Thankfully, the sequel has fixed many of the original faults. As the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions, pig and feline, assuming the role of your created characters. The control over space and time is achieved through a number of VCR-style icons and is quite intuitive. There are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps, space bubbles and void traps in order to progress. These are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair. Blinx 2 is out on Xbox now."
2090,"""This will do to internet what colour has done to TV."" Others have woken up to the fact that you can make money out of web queries. ""We trumpeted that in 1999. Web users face a plethora of choices as each company tries to outflank Google by rolling out new search products such as desktop search. ""User experience has contributed to people searching more,"" said Yonca Brunini of Yahoo. Some may see this as the height of laziness, but in an era of information overload, search has become a vital tool in navigating the net. It is even truer now as there are more users and more information."" ""Whoever cracks that and gives you the information you want is going to be the winner. Search is not just about finding your way around the web. It is now about unlocking information hidden in the gigabytes of documents, images and music on hard drives."
2091,"It's about innovating to benefit customers, partners and society. IBM has received 25,772 US patents in that period and reportedly has more than 40,000 current patents. IBM described the step as a ""new era"" in how it dealt with intellectual property and promised further patents would be made freely available. ""This is about encouraging collaboration and following a model much like academia."" ""We believe that releasing these patents will result in innovation moving more quickly. The benefits are there for everyone to take advantage of."" The patents include software for a range of practices, including text recognition and database management. But not everyone was as supportive. ""I think other companies will follow suit,"" he said. Florian Mueller, campaign manager of a group lobbying toprevent software patents becoming legal in the European Union,dismissed IBM's move as insubstantial."
2092,"With hard drives providing bigger storage, users could need more help to locate important files, such as photos. Searching e-mail effectively is becoming increasingly important, especially as the amount of spam increases. The desktop search technology has been licensed from a US-based firm X1 Technologies. Users can search under a variety of criteria, including file name, size, date and time. It doesn't yet incorporate web searching, although Yahoo has promised that future versions will allow users to search both web-based and desktop data. ""We are all getting more and more files on our desktop but the real commercial opportunity lies with linking this through to web content,"" said Julian Smith, an analyst with research firm Jupiter. And not everyone is impressed with the functionality of such services. He believes the rush to enter the desktop business is just a way of keeping up with rivals. ""Desktop search is just one of many features people would like but I'm suspicious of its usefulness,"" he said. More useful would be tools that can combine internet, intranet and desktop search alongside improvements to key word searching, he said."
2093,"Rings of steel combat net attacks
Gambling is hugely popular, especially with tech-savvy criminals. This overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale. So far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data, said Mr Seagrave. Malcolm Seagrave, security expert at Energis, said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time. ""There are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres."" Many extortionists are targeting net-based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid. ""We have people in places where they shouldn't be, monitoring tech sites,"" he said. This traffic can be hard to spot because DDoS attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries, each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood. ""We have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together,"" said Mr Seagrave. Sometimes though, he said, spotting the next victim was easy."
2094,"The Californian man, Nicholas Lee Jacobsen, was arrested in October. The arrest came a year after T-Mobile uncovered the unauthorised access. Mr Jacobsen tried at least twice to hack T-Mobile's network and took names and social security numbers of 400 customers, said a company spokesman. ""T-Mobile has stringent procedures in place where we monitor for suspicious activity so that limited his activities and we were able to take corrective action immediately,"" Peter Dobrow, a T-Mobile spokesperson said. A Los Angeles grand jury indicted Mr Jacobsen with intentionally accessing a computer system without authorisation and with the unauthorised impairment of a protected computer between March and October 2004. The US Secret Service has been investigating the case."
2095,"The Cellery worm installs a playable version of the classic falling blocks game on PCs that it has infected. While users play the game, the worm spends its time using the machine to search for new victims to infect on nearby networks. At the same time the virus starts scouring networks for other vulnerable machines. As the game starts up the worm also starts a music file to accompany it. So far the number of people infected by Cellery is thought to be very small and the risks of further infection is very low. ""If your company has a culture of allowing games to be played in the office, your staff may believe this is simply a new game that has been installed - rather than something that should cause concern,"" said Graham Cluley, spokesman for anti-virus firm Sophos. Sophos urged users and companies to update their anti-virus software to keep themselves protected."
2096,"The attorney general alleges that messages sent by Mr Pitylak and Mr Trotter's companies broke the 2003 Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (Can-Spam) as well as the Texas Electronic Mail and Solicitation Act and Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Both are thought to be the top executives in three companies - PayPerAction LLC., Leadplex LLC. and Leadplex Inc - that are suspected of sending out many millions of unwanted e-mail messages. The company named in the lawsuit denied any wrongdoing and said it complied with all relevant laws. ""Spam is one of the most aggravating and pervasive problems facing consumers today."" Mr Abbott said the messages sent by the pair broke laws by using misleading subject lines, not identifying themselves as adverts and offering services for which they had no licence to do so in Texas. ""Illegal spam must be stopped,"" said Greg Abbott, Texas attorney general announcing the legal action. If the men are found guilty and all penalties are applied, the two men could face a damages bill running into millions. The court order stops the spammers sending e-mail and freezes assets prior to a hearing on a permanent injunction."
2097,"As part of their prize the pair will have their travel costs paid to ensure they can get to the different bouts. The tournament champion for each leg of the CPL World Tour will walk away with a $15,000 prize. Mr Foster and Mr Treacy get the chance to attend the World Tour as members of the UK's Four-Kings gaming clan. Winners at these qualifiers get seeded higher in the elimination parts of each tournament. The world tour stops are open to any keen gamer that registers. Online registration for the first stop opens this weekend. Towards the end of 2004 Four-Kings staged a series of online Painkiller competitions to reveal the UK's top players of the PC game. ""There are a lot of people who take gaming very seriously and support their local or national team with the same passion as any other sport,"" said Simon Bysshe who filmed the event for Four-Kings and Intel. More than 80,000 people have downloaded the movie of the tournament highlights. ""Professional gaming is here to stay and will only grow in popularity,"" he said."
2098,"The Ofcom spokesman said it was considering imposing a ""mask"" or set of technical restrictions on UWB-using devices. At the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas products with UWB chips built-in got their first public airing. The technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second. Early sight of the CEPT work has caused controversy as some think it over-emphasises UWB's potential to interfere with existing users. ""We're seeking opinion from industry to find out whether or not we should allow UWB on a licence-exempt basis,"" said a spokesman for Ofcom. The government's wireless watchdog is seeking help on the best way to regulate the technology behind such networks called Ultra Wideband (UWB). Companies have until 24 March to respond. One of the more likely uses of UWB is to make it possible to send DVD quality video images wirelessly to TV screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home. ""It's like having a 3D mouse all the time,"" he said. He said that European decisions on what to do with UWB allied with IEEE decisions on the exact specifications for it would help drive adoption."
2099,"EA is the biggest games publisher in the world and in 2004 had 27 titles which sold in excess of one million copies each. Gerhard Florin, EA's managing director for European publishing, said: ""Doubling our industry in five years is not rocket science."" ""It's the subtleties, the eyes, the mouth - 5,000 polygons doesn't really sell the emotion. ""With PS3 and Xbox 2, we can go on the main character with 30,000 to 50,000 polygons,"" he said. He said the company was in advanced stages of discussions over a reality TV show in which viewers could control the actions of the characters as in its popular game The Sims. ""We will be able to bring more people into gaming because games will be more emotional."" ""You can't ignore an industry when people queue to buy a game at midnight because they are so desperate to play it,"" he said, referring to demand for titles for such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Halo 2. ""One idea could be that you're controlling a family, telling them when to go to the kitchen and when to go to the bedroom, and with this mechanism you have gamers all over the world 'playing the show',"" said Mr Bolz. Mr Bolz said video games firm had to work more closely with celebrities. ""There's an indication that a 30 year old comes home from work and still wants to play games."
2100,"""In simple terms, I needed to invent a left foot - initially it was quite a Heath Robinson device."" ""We use the latest technology supplied by an Italian company,"" said rally driver Dave Hawkins who runs the company. Another exhibit on the Motorsport Endeavour stand is a Subaru Impreza rally car, adapted to accommodate a variety of disabilities. he joked. The Motorsport Endeavour Club is hoping that putting such technologies on display will result in more disabled people becoming involved in all areas of the sport and at every level. Motorcycle racer, Roy Tansley, from Derby developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident which resulted in part of his left leg being amputated. ""The cars have electronic throttles, electronic brakes, electronic clutches - we've yet to turn anybody away."" The car on display is fitted with a 'duck clutch' - a switch on the gear stick used instead of the clutch pedal. When Joy Rainey started competing in motorsport in 1974 she was continuing the family tradition - her father, Murray, is a former Australian Formula 3 champion. ""But in a competition car you have to have everything right or you'll lose the balance of the car,"" she said."
2101,"Web photo storage market hots up
An increasing number of firms are offering web storage for people with digital photo collections. Other sites, such as Pixagogo, charge a monthly fee. ""People are using their hard drives, backing up on CD and DVD and now they are using online storage solutions. Photo giants such as Kodak offer website storage which manages photo collections, lets users edit pictures online and provides print-ordering services. Photosig is an online community of photographers who can critique each other's work. Marcus Hawkins, editor of Digital Camera magazine, said: ""As file sizes of pictures increase, storage becomes a problem. ""Rather than just a place to dump your pictures, it's about sharing them."" Many people's hard drives are bulging with photos and services which allow them to store and share their pictures online are becoming popular. ""It's one thing taking pictures, it's another finding them,"" said Mr Hawkins. ""But this is the same problem that has always existed - how many of us have photos in wallets tucked away somewhere?"""
2102,"Gracenote provides music library information for millions of different albums for jukeboxes such as Apple's iTunes. ""These applications will radically change the car entertainment experience, allowing drivers to enjoy their entire music collections without ever taking their hands off the steering wheel,"" he added. The new technology will be designed so that people can play any individual song or movie out of a collection, just by saying its name. ""Voice command-and-control unlocks the potential of devices that can store large digital music collections,"" said Ross Blanchard, vice president of business development for Gracenote. ""Pairing our voice technologies with Gracenote's vast music database will bring the benefits of speech technologies to a host of consumer devices and enable people to access their media in ways they've never imagined."" Users will also be able to get more information on a favourite song they have been listening to by asking: ""What is this?"" The firms gave no indication about whether the iPod, or any other media player, were in mind for the use of the voice control technology. The companies estimate that the technology will be available in the fourth quarter of 2005."
2103,"It could sound the death knell for some TV channels, Telewest predicts. ""Video-on-demand will offer a deeper range of content than currently exists on TV. Telewest customers in Bristol and NTL viewers in Glasgow will be the first to test the new service, which sees a raft of movies on offer for 24 hour rental. ""It allows us to demonstrate a clear competitive advantage over Sky for the first time in many years,"" said Telewest chief executive Eric Tveter. Its pick of the week service will offer a selection of BBC programmes from the previous seven days such as Eastenders, Casualty, Top Gear and Antiques Roadshow. The service is similar to Sky Plus, as users can pause, fast forward and rewind content, but they cannot store programmes on their set top box - yet. The BBC is trialling a similar service, offering broadband users the chance to watch programmes already broadcast on their PC. Video rental stores may also have to watch their back. ""We offer the best of both worlds and most households have an interest in having both video-on-demand and PVR,"" he said. Video-on-demand has the added advantage of not requiring a separate set-top box or extra remote controls, he added."
2104,"His comment was echoed by Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant from anti-virus firm Sophos. Virus writers and hackers will be looking to make a tidy sum."" Part of the reason that these ""bot nets"" have become so prevalent, he said, was due to a big change in the way that many viruses were created. In September Symantec released statistics which showed that the numbers of active ""bot computers"" rose from 2,000 to 30,000 per day. By contrast, said Mr Hogan, the code for viruses such as Gaobot, Spybot and Randex were commonly held and many groups work on them to produce new variants at the same time. Similarly phishing attempts, in which conmen try to trick people into handing over confidential data, are recording growth rates of more than 30% and attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Also released this year was the Mosquito game for Symbian phones which surreptitiously sends messages to premium rate numbers, and in November the Skulls Trojan came to light which can cripple phones. ""That's unprecedented,"" said Mr Hogan. ""They are very noisy and they are not technically challenging."" In total, eight virus writers were arrested and some members of the so-called 29A virus writing group were sentenced."
2105,"""In the end, it was too deep and too long a recession,"" said Simon Jones, the Labs' managing director. Noel Dempsey, the government's communications minister, said Mr Ahern had been ""very committed"" to the project. Many concepts fed into science, engineering, and psychology as well as technology, but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term. The Labs needed about 10 million euros (US$13 million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive. ""He is, I know, very disappointed it has come to this. ""I have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs, but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost."" At the time it seemed to be the right thing to do,"" he said. Several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different. The Human Connectedness group, for example, developed the iBand, a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships. This information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands."
2106,"He believes that the ""phenomenal ability"" of games such as The Sims and others to capture the interest of adolescent audiences is ripe for exploitation. ""One goal would be to break what I believe to be the false assumption that learning and play are inherently oppositional,"" he said. The inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore, said Mr Purushotma. The hard part of learning any language, said Mr Purushotma, were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences. Boring lessons drumming vocabulary into pupils couched in terms they do not understand has made many languages far harder to learn than they should be. But, he said, using pre-prepared game worlds such as The Sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game. Getting a simulated person to perform everyday activities in a make-believe world and having them described in a foreign language could be a powerful learning aid, he believes. ""I'm hoping now to re-create a well-polished German learning mod for the sequel by this summer,"" he told the BBC News website. A report on the experiment said: ""Students began asking historical and geographical questions in the context of game play, using geography and history as tools for their game, and drawing inferences about social phenomena based on their play."" Mr Purushotma's ideas were aired in an article for the journal Language Learning and Technology."
2107,"Hacker threat to Apple's iTunes
Users of Apple's music jukebox iTunes need to update the software to avoid a potential security threat. The security firm says users should avoid clicking on or accessing playlist files - which have the file extension of .pls or .m3u - which have come from unknown sources. The problem affects all users of iTunes - Windows and Mac OS - running versions 4.7 and earlier. Itunes is the world's most popular online music store with more than 200 million songs downloaded since it launched in 2003."
2108,"They say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy. Confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as Microsoft and Apple. She said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. In a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy ""appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content"". ""It's not a two-horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race"" Mr Fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. Apple's iTunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. ""Not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,"" he said. Shelley Taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. ""People want portability,"" she said, ""and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability."" Cory Doctorow, European co-ordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the Marlin system would achieve its aims."
2109,"Remembering the furore around VCRs when they first came out, Mr Weiss said: ""Old media always tries to stop new media. But, until the legal actions are resolved, experimentation with P2P cannot not happen, said Michael Weiss, president of StreamCast Networks. ""When they can't stop it, they try to control it. The first convictions for P2P piracy were handed out in the US in January. But the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many. The music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate P2P networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks. It aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use P2P technology to distribute them. Then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money."" ""We see there are going to be different models for commoditising P2P,"" said Marc Morgenstern, vice president of anti-piracy firm Overpeer. ""Once some of these issues are resolved, you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content, but also in ways that are unimaginable now,"" he said."
2110,"Every day 78 million messages are sent and there are no signs of a slow down. The figures collected by the Mobile Data Association (MDA) showed that 2.4 billion were fired off in December alone, the highest monthly total ever. People are using SMS to do much more too. The records even surpassed the MDA's own predictions, it said. That was 26% more than the previous year. Booking cinema tickets, text voting, and news or sports text alerts are growing popular. These third generation mobiles offer a high-speed connection which means more data like video can be received on the phone. Mobile owners have also given the chance to donate to the Disasters Emergency Committee's (DEC) Asian Tsunami fund by texting ""Donate"" to a simple short code number."
2111,"Big war games battle it out
The arrival of new titles in the popular Medal Of Honor and Call of Duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice. A winning moment is an early scene in Pacific Assault, where you come under attack at the famous US base in Hawaii. You play one character throughout, a raw and rather talkative US soldier. When it does not, it is tedious. Letting you play a number of different roles is an interesting ploy that adds new dimensions to the Call of Duty endeavour, even if it sacrifices the narrative flow somewhat. The mouse control is a big reason why, along with the sharper graphics a top-end computer can muster and the apparent notion that PC games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety. Targeting with the PS2 controller proved tricky, not helped by unconvincing collision-detection. But the teamwork element in titles like this is superficial, designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all. You can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim, yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him. Those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented."
2112,"Britain's first mobile phone call was made across the Vodafone network on 1 January 1985 by veteran comedian Ernie Wise. Cellnet and Vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the UK until 1993 when One2One (now T-Mobile) was launched. Mobiles rack up 20 years of use
Mobile phones in the UK are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend. ""They became a yuppy must-have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk."" In the 20 years since that day, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of Britons own a handset. Mike Caudwell, spokesman for Vodafone, said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase, cost about £2,000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes. For the first nine days of 1985 Vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the UK. ""It's very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people,"" he said. ""Cellnet was forecasting half that."" Mr Caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things, such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular."
2113,"The new strains of the Cabir mobile phone virus use short-range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range. Users can protect themselves by altering a setting on Symbian phones that conceals the handset from other Bluetooth using devices. Bluetooth has an effective range of a few tens of metres. Finnish security firm F-Secure issued a warning about the new strains of Cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone. So far seven versions of Cabir are know to exist, one of which was inside the malicious Skulls program that was found in late November. All they do is block normal Bluetooth activity and drain the phone's battery. Symbian's Series 60 software is licenced by Nokia, LG Electronics, Lenovo, Panasonic, Samsung, Sendo and Siemens."
2114,"About 50,000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. ""The story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them,"" Jeff Joseph, from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) told the BBC News website. ""It is about personalisation - taking your MP3 player and creating your own playlist, taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters."" That trend is predicted to continue, according to CEA analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies. ""This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your PVR [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house. ""Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere,"" said Mr Joseph. Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox. He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the ""democratisation"" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images. With more than 52% of US homes expected to have home networks, the CEA suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace."
2115,"The anti-spyware tool is available now and the anti-virus utility is expected to be available later this month. The virus-fighting program will be updated monthly and is a precursor to Microsoft releasing dedicated anti-virus software. It has proved such a tempting target that there are now thought to be more than 100,000 viruses and other malicious programs in existence. Before now Microsoft has left the market for PC security software to specialist firms such as Symantec, McAfee, Trend Micro and many others. Microsoft's Windows operating system has long been a favourite of people who write computer viruses because it is so ubiquitous and has many loopholes that can be exploited. In its most benign form it just bombards users with pop-up adverts or hijacks web browser settings. It said that its virus cleaning program would not stop machines being infected nor remove the need for other anti-virus programs. Last year Microsoft also released the SP2 upgrade for Windows XP that closed many security loopholes in the software and made it easier for people to manage their anti-virus and firewall programs. Microsoft's two security tools have emerged as a result of acquisitions the company has made over the last two years. In 2003 it bought Romanian firm GeCAD Software to get hold of its anti-virus technology."
2116,"But doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are ""quality copies"". Like Kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone. In an interview with Novastream web radio, Sloncek said Exeem would combine ideas from the BitTorrent and Kazaa file-sharing systems. One site behind the success of the BitTorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program. He said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program. One of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the BitTorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or TV programmes they claimed to. There were no plans for a Linux or Mac version. This, said Sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music. Users of the Exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, Sloncek told Novastream. ""There is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity,"" he said."
2117,"The Blu-Ray Association said on Thursday that games giants Electronic Arts and Vivendi would both support its DVD format. Blu-ray, backed by 100 firms including Sony, is competing against Toshiba and NEC-backed HD-DVD to be the format of choice for future films and games. The next generation of DVDs will hold high-definition video and sound. ""Gamers, especially those working on PCs, are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures, deeper levels, for delivering higher-resolution playback."" ""The technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical-disc technologies,"" said Michael Heilmann, chief technology officer for Vivendi Universal. EA, a leading games developer and publisher, added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and Blu-ray had the capacity, functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning. He added: ""The focus for games moving forward is on increased immersion. Likewise, consoles rely on single discs, so DVDs that can hold six times more data mean much better, high-resolution games. ""They are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments,"" said Mr Doherty. High-definition DVDs will cut down on that need."
2118,"The tech-fest, the largest of its kind in the world, runs from 6 to 9 January. ""The digital revolution is about the democratisation of technology and the experiences it makes possible,"" she told delegates. She added: ""The real story of the digital revolution is not just new products, but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell."" Part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content, such as images, video and music. A lot of work still needs to be done, however, to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly, she said. Coming out in the autumn in the US, the box is a networked, high-definition TV, cable set-top box, digital video recorder and DVD recorder. Ms Fiorina also announced that HP was working with Nokia to launch a visual radio service for mobiles, which would launch in Europe early this year. The digital cameras, which are due to go on sale in the US by the summer, are based on the HP 607 model. The service is designed to make mobile radio more interactive. Eighty per cent of those remain on cameras."
2119,"""Consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like HDTVs [high-definition TVs], digital radio, and digital cameras will remain strong in 2005. Gadget market 'to grow in 2005'
The explosion in consumer technology is to continue into 2005, delegates at the world's largest gadget show, in Las Vegas, have been told. ""A lot of this is driven by just the ability to do it,"" said Stephen Baker, a consumer electronics analyst with retail research firm NPD Group. ""All the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry."" Industry experts were also excited about high-definition technologies coming to the fore in 2005, with new formats for DVDs coming out which will hold six times as much data as conventional DVDs. At the start of last year's CES, the CEA predicted there would be an average growth of 4% in 2004. With so many devices on the move there were a lot of products on show offering external storage, like Seagate's 5GB pocket sized external hard drive, which won an innovation for engineering and design prize. More than 120,000 trade professionals attended CES in Las Vegas, which officially ran from 6 to 9 January. He disappointed some, however, by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the Xbox games console. Despite several embarrassing technical glitches during Mr Gate's pre-show speech, he announced several new partnerships - mainly for the US market."
2120,"Apple unveils low-cost 'Mac mini'
Apple has unveiled a new, low-cost Macintosh computer for the masses, billed as the Mac mini. The machine - which will be available from 22 January - was described by Jobs as ""BYODKM... bring your own display, keyboard, and mouse"". ""People who are thinking of switching will have no more excuses,"" he said. The Mac mini comes without a monitor, keyboard and mouse, and a second version with a larger hard drive will also be sold for $599. ""It's the newest and most affordable Mac ever."" In an attempt to win over Windows PC customers, Mr Jobs said it would appeal to people thinking of changing operating systems. Harris added: ""Everybody thought that Apple was happy to remain a niche maker of luxury computers, and moving into a market dominated by low margin manufacturers like Dell is a bold move. ""They want a further taste of Mac because they like what they have seen with iPod."" The music player has no display and will play songs either consecutively or shuffled. The smaller iPod will hold about 120 songs, said Mr Jobs."
2121,"""Music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle; either single tracks or subscriptions services,"" said Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit, a UK-based music download service. This has outraged some digital music lovers, especially as Napster already offers a cheaper service for downloading music to the PC. While iTunes is doing good business with its sales of individual tracks to iPod owners, others are questioning whether the concept of owning music is even valid in the digital age. The service can be used on players that support Microsoft Windows latest Digital Rights Management technology known as Janus. Currently on offer in beta-version in the US, the service costs $15 per month for unlimited downloads. ""We've been offering our unlimited music subscription service for more than three years now and our customers know what they want. Format interoperability, excellent value and the reassurance that music purchased from Wippit is theirs to keep and enjoy on whatever device they choose,"" he said. ""Who wants to download a track that won't play next month if you decide to unsubscribe to the service or change portable player for an iPod or the latest mobile phone?"" It has a catalogue of around 60,000 songs."
2122,"Rings of steel combat net attacks
Gambling is hugely popular, especially with tech-savvy criminals. This overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale. So far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data, said Mr Seagrave. Malcolm Seagrave, security expert at Energis, said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time. ""There are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres."" Many extortionists are targeting net-based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid. ""We have people in places where they shouldn't be, monitoring tech sites,"" he said. This traffic can be hard to spot because DDoS attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries, each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood. ""We have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together,"" said Mr Seagrave. Sometimes though, he said, spotting the next victim was easy."
2123,"The release of the tiny, low-cost machine is seen as a good move for Apple which currently has a small share of the desktop computer market. ""For consumers interested in style, design and small size - which is what the majority of iPod customers are interested in - it's a natural next step,"" said Mr Fogg. Apple has traditionally done well in the market that the Mac mini is aimed at, said Mr Fogg, who also expected many PC makers to release copycat devices in reaction. Although the Mac mini was very cheap for an Apple computer, it was still expensive compared to many PCs. Already, he said, PC owning friends had declared that they would be buying one. The Mac mini could find a role in homes that need a second computer that is easy to install and administer, he said. ""It's a particularly good price when you see that it's Apple that is doing it,"" he said. Adding extras such as a larger hard drive, more memory and networking options will increase the basic price. ""It does not have the right connectors that fit a TV screen or enough storage."" Said Mr Fogg: ""It's very much a computer."""
2124,"A monitor, keyboard or mouse. The Dell provides enough power and software for basic gaming and internet surfing. Rivals of the £400 Apple... Apple offer a less powerful Mac Mini for £339 but the £399 models has a 1.4ghz Power PC chip, 80 gigabyte hard drive, combined CD burner/DVD player. Wireless and a dvd burner can be added at extra cost. Macs don't offer the upgrade flexibility of a PC and the machine's specifications lack the horse power for tasks such as high-end video editing or games. ""The Mac Mini puts the Macintosh within the reach of everyone,"" an Apple spokesman said. You're building it so you have to buy all the software you want to install and do your own trouble-shooting and tech support. ""It will bring more customers to the platform, especially PC users and owners."" If it starts to go wrong it might take a lot of fixing."
2125,"Gracenote provides music library information for millions of different albums for jukeboxes such as Apple's iTunes. ""These applications will radically change the car entertainment experience, allowing drivers to enjoy their entire music collections without ever taking their hands off the steering wheel,"" he added. The new technology will be designed so that people can play any individual song or movie out of a collection, just by saying its name. ""Voice command-and-control unlocks the potential of devices that can store large digital music collections,"" said Ross Blanchard, vice president of business development for Gracenote. ""Pairing our voice technologies with Gracenote's vast music database will bring the benefits of speech technologies to a host of consumer devices and enable people to access their media in ways they've never imagined."" Users will also be able to get more information on a favourite song they have been listening to by asking: ""What is this?"" The firms gave no indication about whether the iPod, or any other media player, were in mind for the use of the voice control technology. The companies estimate that the technology will be available in the fourth quarter of 2005."
2126,"The pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250,000 (£130,000) fine. New Yorker William Trowbridge and Texan Michael Chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. US peer-to-peer pirates convicted
The first convictions for piracy over peer-to-peer networks have been handed down in the US. The piracy group called itself the Underground Network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. During its investigation FBI agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies, 40 software programs, 13 games and 178 ""sound recordings"" from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. In total, six raids were carried out in August. They also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage."
2127,"They say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy. Confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as Microsoft and Apple. She said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. In a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy ""appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content"". ""It's not a two-horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race"" Mr Fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. Apple's iTunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. ""Not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,"" he said. Shelley Taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. ""People want portability,"" she said, ""and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability."" Cory Doctorow, European co-ordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the Marlin system would achieve its aims."
2128,"Games, cameras and music players have all been added to our handsets in the last few years, but 2005 could see another big innovation that won't just see a change in our mobile phone habits - it might alter the way we listen to the radio. It is not the first time that such an idea has been suggested - the early days of DAB Digital Radio had similar intentions that never really saw the light of day. Finnish handset giant Nokia has been working on a technology called Visual Radio, which takes an existing FM signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures. This in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue, as it is very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners. Station manager Steve Taylor commented: ""Listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way. And there will be a cost for the service as well, although it may depend on your usage. ""If you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact it'll be two or three pounds per month,"" said Mr Wasenius. Initially Visual Radio functionality will be limited to two Nokia handsets due out soon - the 3230 and 7710 - but if successful, it is very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them. ""Basically, Visual Radio is not really revolutionary, but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before."" Listen again to the interview on the Radio Five Live website."
2129,"Different equipment able to receive HD signals is needed though and is expensive. ""In the next generation [of consoles] HD support is mandatory,"" Dr Mark Tuffy games systems director at digital content firm THX told the BBC News website. At the end of last year, Chris Deering, Sony's European president, made a prediction that 20 million European households would have HDTV sets by 2008. But those in Europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology - about £2,000 - if there are few programmes or films to watch on them. Higher capacity storage discs, such as HD-DVD and blue-ray , are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles - allowing developers more room for detailed graphics. ""You are literally going to get to the point, with a Lord of the Rings game for example, is going to be closer and closer to the actual film, especially the CGI stuff from the DVD. Most standard UK TV pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. ""It's going to change really the way they look at gaming."" ""Probably, in the UK [gaming] is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off, as in 'look what this TV can do', until HD is really adopted by broadcasters,"" explains Dr Tuffy. With HD, he says, the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big-screen cinema release."
2130,"Now you can't buy petrol with lead additives, and we're all better off as a result. Bill Thompson thinks it's about time. One of the key aspects of the new approach is to design products that are easier to recycle. The car engine is a case in point: lead additives helped stop petrol vapour exploding too early in the cylinder, a phenomenon called 'knocking', so they were simply used without any real thought for the fact that the lead would end up in the atmosphere. Chip giant Intel recently began shipping computer circuit boards that are lead free too, reflecting a growing awareness on the part of the technology industry that products have to be designed and built in more environmentally friendly ways. We're seeing the same thing in the technology industry and, as a result, there are billions of devices, from old mobile phones to antique handhelds, that will have to be recycled in years to come. But what do we do with the old ones? I could take them up the to the council recycling centre, but it's a 10-mile drive away across town, and like many other people my commitment to recycling is shallow at best. Would it be too much to ask for an electronics recycling box too? I'd probably remember to take my old mobile with me to the supermarket and drop it in a box - at least eventually."
2131,"It will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates, but their options would be ""limited"". Microsoft makes anti-piracy move
Microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its Windows operating system by restricting their access to security features. Microsoft's Windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. But Graham Cluley, senior consultant at security firm Sophos, told the BBC News website that it was a positive decision. ""It sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of Windows is good news for everyone who uses the net,"" he said. It is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in China, Norway and the Czech Republic, where pirated software is a huge problem, by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies Windows. The company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. Software piracy has cost the company billions, it says. Windows Genuine Advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in September 2004 for English-language versions of Windows. ""China in particular is a problem, with piracy estimated at 92%,"" said Mr Cluley."
2132,"What's next for next-gen consoles? ""It's a horrendous effort in the first year,"" he admitted. Sony is thought to have a similar vision for PS3 while Nintendo remain focused on a machine purely for games. Simon Gardner, president of Climax's Action Studio, said: ""It's definitely an exciting time. ""PS3 will provide graphics indistinguishable from movies,"" said Mr Florin. Gary Dunn, development director at Codemasters, said the company had a central technology group which was at the forefront of preparing for the next generation of consoles. What is certain is that the new machines will provide great leaps in processing and graphical power. ""The environments will be much more believable and dramatic, growing and changing as you play. We want to give more freedom to the player. ""We want to increase that level of immersion and realism in gaming to people can lose themselves in a game."""
2133,"This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create ""style sheets"", its developers say. ""Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,"" said Ms Hanson. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. The company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. ""People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience."" But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor."
2134,"Even before Nokia's N-Gage game phone launched in late 2003, many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset.

A brief round-up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below. Increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film, understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads.

Spam traffic is up by 40%, putting the total amount of e-mail that is junk up to an astonishing 90%. The figures, from e-mail management firm Email Systems, will alarm firms attempting to cope with the amount of spam in their in-boxes. ""January is clearly a month when consumers are less motivated to purchase financial products or put money into dubious financial opportunities,"" said Neil Hammerton, managing director of Email Systems.

BT and DEC's hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down, she said. Warning over tsunami aid website
Net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims. Another tsunami-related e-mail is also circulating that carries the Zar worm which tries to spread via the familiar route of Microsoft's Outlook e-mail program. She said that DEC hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible. DEC was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation. One e-mail sent out in early January came from someone who claimed that he had lost his parents in the disaster and was asking for help moving an inheritance from a bank account in the Netherlands. Other scam e-mails included a link to a website that supposedly let people donate money but instead loaded spyware on their computers that grabbed confidential information."
2139,"For the last three years, that has gone up by an average of 13.2%.

The study predicts that 40% of all home PC net security buyers will be women in 2005. Viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer, according to net security experts. But net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online, particuarly if they are new to broadband, he said. In July last year, the number of UK households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dial-up for the first time, according to the Office of National Statistics. Without protection, these kinds of programs can be picked up just through surfing the web normally. ""Now we are seeing real people - both sexes and very often it is women who have more access at home."" ""You are seeing older users being educated by the media and are seeing them picking up on this threat. They are asking the right questions,"" he explained."

The Bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read, search and share all the blogs they are interested in. The acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. Google acquired Pyra Labs, makers of the Blogger software, in 2003. Though Mr Lanzone added that Ask Jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries Bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology. He said Ask Jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it. ""Our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away,"" he said. There would be no instant sweeping changes to Bloglines, said Mr Lanzone.

2142,"Why Cell will get the hard sell
The world is casting its gaze on the Cell processor for the first time, but what is so important about it, and why is it so different? The big trend predicted for this year is the convergence of computers with home entertainment devices such as DVD players and hi-fis. Using a technology called XDR, created by American firm Rambus, memory can run up to eight times faster than the current standard being promoted by Intel. Perhaps more important than any of the technology is the Cell's role in the imminent ""war on living rooms"". Sony had a stab at something similar with the PSX - a variation on the PlayStation - last year in Japan, although this attempt was generally seen as a failure. Companies like Microsoft and Sony believe that there is a lot of money to be made by putting a computer underneath the TV of every household and then offering services such as music and video downloads, as well as giving an individual access to all the media they already own in one place. The links between the multiple processors can also be extended to reach Cell processors in entirely different systems. Cell is, in fact, specifically designed to be deployed throughout the house. Intel will be furiously working on new designs that address the problems of its current chips to create a rival technology to Cell, so that it doesn't lose its desktop PC dominance. The revolution might not be televised, but it could well be played with a videogame controller."

The Cell processor, which will drive Sony's PlayStation 3, will run 10-times faster than current PC chips, its designers have said. Sony, IBM and Toshiba, who have been working on the Cell processor for three years, unveiled the chip on Monday. The chip will run at speeds of greater than 4 GHz, the firms said. Details of the chip were released at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in San Francisco. By comparison, rival chip maker Intel's fastest processor runs at 3.8 GHz. It is being designed for use in graphics workstations, the new PlayStation console, and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip. ""Any new technology like this has two components,"" said Steve Kleynhans, an analyst with Meta Group. He said: ""It has the vision of what it could be because you need the big vision to sell it. While the PlayStation 3 is likely to be the first mass-market product to use Cell, the chip's designers have said the flexible architecture means that it would be useful for a wide range of applications, from servers to mobile phones. ""Then there's the reality of how it's really going to be used, which generally is several levels down the chain from there."""
2144,"The survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in Europe was low. The firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of RFID technology. More than half (55%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that RFID tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. Consumer concern over RFID tags
Consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency ID (RFID) tags in shops, a survey says. The tags are currently being used at one Tesco distribution centre in the UK - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. ""Acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns. ""With the right RFID approach and ongoing communication with consumers, the industry can reach this point."" He said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. All kinds of personal belongings, including clothes, could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners, it warned."
2145,"""Mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the PC music experience as the handsets are not yet ready,"" said Thomas Husson, mobile analyst at Jupiter research. ""Mobile music services should be new and different, and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches."" Mobile TV will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though, said the report. People are also likely to be put off watching TV on such small screens, said Gartner. The mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading, after the success of Apple's iTunes, Napster and other net music download services. A report by analysts InStat/MDR has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by 44% over the next five years. TV services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital TV generation too, which expects good quality images at low prices, according to analysts. It says that smartphones will make up 117 million out of 833 million handsets shipped globally by 2009. Operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles, as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. More powerful smartphones like the XDA II, Nokia 6600, SonyEricsson P900 and the Orange E200, offering web access, text and multimedia messaging, e-mail, calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common."

The software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels - ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end. ""The images have three dimensions and I had to find a way of reading them myself,"" Mr Wong told the BBC News website. He tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot. In order to have an exact reference to the screen, a pen and tablet device is used. ""As the notes increase in pitch I know the colour's getting redder and redder, and in my mind's eye a patch of red appears."" ""If I took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it, it wouldn't work that well."" Mr Wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a ""colour memory"" makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision."
2147,"The EFF says the case threatens the basic freedoms of the press. Apple attacked over sources row
Civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has joined a legal fight between three US online journalists and Apple. The case began in December 2004 when Apple asked a local Californian court to get the journalists to reveal their sources for articles published on websites AppleInsider.com and PowerPage.org. ""Rather than confronting the issue of reporter's privilege head-on, Apple is going to the journalist's ISPs for his e-mails,"" said EFF lawyer Kurt Opsahl. ""This undermines a fundamental First Amendment right that protects all reporters. Apple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code-named Asteroid and has asked the journalists' e-mail providers to hand over communications relevant to that. Apple was not immediately available for comment."
2148,"But how good can that sound be from such a small device? The sound of a buzzing bee jumps from left to right before disappearing around the back of my head. The surround sound demo is unremarkable when heard on a multi-speaker home cinema system but startling when emerging from a small mobile phone. Sonaptic has been working with Japanese mobile network NTT DoCoMo to set standards for 3D audio on mobile phones. In the last few months handsets from NEC, Fujitsu and Mitsubishi have been released on to the Japanese marker which have chips produced by Yamaha and Rohm with Sonaptic's technology. ""No-one has really tried before to make proper 3D positional audio - where an individual channel can be moved around."" We are synthesising those differences."" ""The technology has been around on PCs and games consoles for some time but what we are doing is making it more efficient so it can go on a small consumer device like a mobile phone,"" said Mr Monteith. ""We have focused first on Japan because it has a very advanced mobile phone market. The structure of the ear works as a 3D encoder for sound - helping the brain understand from where sound is emanating."
2149,"""RipGuard is designed to... reduce DVD ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer,"" said the firm. The new technology will be welcomed by Hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from DVD sales. Macrovision said RipGuard would also prevent against ""rent, rip and return"" - where people would rent a DVD, copy it and then return the original. ""Ultimately, we see RipGuard DVD... evolving beyond anti-piracy, and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions, interoperability in tomorrow's digital home, and the upcoming high-definition formats,"" said Steve Weinstein, executive vice president and general manager of Macrovision's Entertainment Technologies Group. RipGuard is expected to be rolled out on DVDs from the middle of 2005, the company said. Macrovision has said that Rip Guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti-copying measures."
2150,"A study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that MP3 players are the gadget of choice among affluent young Americans. Broadband access plays a big part in ownership too. Of the 22 million Americans who own MP3 players, 59% are men compared to 41% of women. Almost one in five US citizens aged under 30 have one. The influence of children also plays a part. The ease of use and growth of music available on the net are the main factors for the upsurge in ownership, the survey found. ""IPods and MP3 players are becoming a mainstream technology for consumers"" said Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Internet and American Life Project. ""More growth in the market is inevitable as new devices become available, as new players enter the market, and as new social uses for iPods/MP3 players become popular,"" he added."
2151,"Some readers were offered a price drop just 25p more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator, making it hardly worth while swapping. ""We expect these figures to leap in 2005. The survey found that BT and Tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them a lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription. A third of the 2,000 broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks Tim Danton, editor of PC Pro Magazine. Other found themselves tied into 12-month contracts. ""This breaks the code of practice, but because that code is voluntary there's nothing we or Ofcom can do to help,"" he said. 12% of those surveyed found themselves unable to swap at all. ""If you just stick with your current connection then there's every chance you're being ripped off,"" he warned."
2152,"Intel unveils laser breakthrough
Intel has said it has found a way to put a silicon-based laser on a chip, raising hopes of much faster networks. The Intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade. Writing in the journal Nature, Dr Paniccia - and colleagues Haisheng Rong, Richard Jones, Ansheng Liu, Oded Cohen, Dani Hak and Alexander Fang - show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. ""We're trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas,"" said Dr Paniccia. Currently, says Dr Paniccia, telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials, such as gallium arsenide, used to make it. The breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information. Scientists at Intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light. Dr Paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it, some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material. Semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges. ""It creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light,"" he said."
2153,"The bill was backed by some hi-tech firms, saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile. To become law both the European Parliament and a qualified majority of EU states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill. He said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents. Also earlier this month the influential European Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of MEPs. The proposed law had a troubled passage through the European parliament. Its progress was delayed twice when Polish MEPs rejected plans to adopt it."
2154,"IBM said the money will fund a variety of technical, research and marketing initiatives to boost Linux use. IBM said it had taken the step in response to greater customer demand for the open source software. One of the main focuses of the initiative will be to make it easier to use Linux-based desktop computers and mobile devices with Workplace. Linux and the open source software movement are based on the premise that developers should be free to tinker with the core components of software programs. Even before IBM announced this latest spending boost it was one of the biggest advocates of the open source way of working. In 2001 it put $300m into a three-year Linux program and has produced Linux versions of many of its programs."
2155,"The company, which hopes to keep its dominant place in the digital music market, also said the gold coloured version of the mini would be dropped. Digital music players are now the gadget of choice among young Americans, according to recent research by the Pew Internet and American Life Project. ""They have created a very seamless package which I think is the idea of the product - the design, function and the software are very impressive,"" he said. He added that the threat from others was always present, however. Creative was very upbeat about how many of its Creative Zen players it had shipped by the end of last year, he said. The latest models have a longer battery life and their prices have been cut by an average of £40. During 2004 about 25 million portable players were sold, 10 million of which were Apple iPods. It will have 5GB of memory on board. But analysts agree that the success is also down to its integration with the iTunes online store, which has given the company a 70% share of the legal download music market. Mike McGuire, a research director at analyst Gartner, told the BBC News website that Apple had done a good job in ""sealing off the market from competition"" so far."
2156,"HP, the world's biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit. HP ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change. The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the US who has purchased an HP inkjet printer since February 2001. ""The smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a built-in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer,"" the suit said. The lawsuit is asking for restitution, damages and other compensation."
2157,"The messages warn that their internet use has been monitored by the FBI's Internet Fraud Complaint Center. An attachment in the e-mail contains the virus, the FBI said. But rather than being a questionnaire, the attachment contains a virus that infects the recipient's computer, according to the agency. The bureau is investigating the phoney e-mails. The agency earlier this month shut down fbi.gov accounts, used to communicate with the public, because of a security breach. A spokeswoman said the two incidents appear to be unrelated."
2158,"That was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3GSM World Congress in Cannes last week. The system is not available commercially yet, but Motorola, the US mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operators on HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now. A number of companies are developing the technology. As part of $3bn in multi-year contracts announced late last year, Sprint will spend around $1bn on EV-DO technology from Lucent Technologies, Nortel Networks and Motorola that provides average data speeds of 0.3-0.5 megabits a second, and peak download rates of 2.4Mbps. ""The typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which, even at this lower rate, will more than double the capacity... when compared to basic WCDMA [3G],"" he added. ""While HSDPA theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14Mbps, practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide-area networks,"" said Dr Alastair Brydon, author of the Analysys report: Pushing Beyond the Limits of 3G with HSDPA and Other Enhancements. The German company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to 20 times faster than current 3G networks. Motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2.9Mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3G cell using a single HSDPA device. This enables a data transmission, such as sending a big file or video, to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band. But one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately."
2159,"And if you do not have a monitor, keyboard or mouse then you will need to purchase those also. The Mac Mini comes bundled with Mac OS X, the operating system, as well as iLife 05, a suite of software which includes iTunes, web browser Safari, iPhoto, Garage Band and iDVD. ""It's a good little machine with a reasonable amount of power and just perfect for the average computer user who wants to leave the tyranny of Window and viruses,"" said Mark Sparrow, technical and reviews editor at Mac Format magazine. The relatively low price of the machine has also encouraged the more technically-savvy to experiment with their Macs. But does the latest Macintosh justify the hype? Let us get a few things dealt with at the outset - yes, the Mac Mini is really, really small, and yes, it is another piece of inspired Apple design. For people who want to do interesting things with their music, photos and home movies then a Mac Mini is an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer. ""The software bundle that comes with the mini makes your average budget PC look a bit sick."" But at the moment these PCs tend to be either for the home-build enthusiast or expensive pre-built options based around Microsoft's Media Center software. But for the value the Mac Mini offers, bringing some of the best software packages within reach of more consumers than ever before, Apple is to be congratulated."
2160,"Can Yahoo dominate next decade? For many, Yahoo remains synonymous with the internet - a veteran that managed to ride the dot-com wave and the subsequent crash and maintain itself as one of the web's top brands. In recent years, the column inches have stacked up in Google's favour as the search engine also diversifies with the launch of services such as Gmail, its shopping channel Froogle and Google News. ""Microsoft has amazing assets including software capability and a global name but it has yet to show me it can create a rival product to Yahoo,"" he said. He is convinced Yahoo remains the single most important brand on the world wide web. Nick Hazel, Yahoo's head of consumer services in the UK, thinks the fact that Yahoo has grown up with the first wave of the internet generation will stand it in good stead. If you are looking for a text book definition of web portal then Yahoo is it,"" he said. His business savvy, coupled with the technical genius of founder Jerry Yang has proved a winning combination, he says. So as the internet giant emerges from its first decade as a survivor, how will it fare as it enters its teenage years? ""It will spread its portal wings to expand into rich media,"" he predicts."
2161,"Good design and the look of a mobile, as well as new services such as music downloads, could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005, said analysts. The figure was 30% more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions, Gartner said. ""All the markets grew apart from Japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western Europe,"" mobile analyst Carolina Milanesi told the BBC News website. ""People are after something that is nice-looking, and together with that, there is the entertainment side. ""They already have TV, music, ringtones, cameras, and all that we can think of on mobiles, so people have stopped buying replacement phones."" But there could be a slight slowdown in sales in European and US markets too, according to Gartner, as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. This was not a ""women's thing"", she said, but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. Third generation mobiles (3G) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer, like video, could drive people into upgrading their phones, but Ms Milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen. But the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the iPod. In July last year, Motorola and Apple announced a version of iTunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with Motorola mobile phones."
2162,"Hotspot users gain free net calls
People using wireless net hotspots will soon be able to make free phone calls as well as surf the net. Its paid service - dubbed Skype Out - has so far attracted 940,000 users. The company is due to launch wi-fi on Virgin Trains later in the year. It plans to add more paid services with forthcoming launches of video conferencing, voice mail and Skype In, a service which would allow users to receive phone calls from landlines and mobiles. London-based software developer Connectotel has unveiled software that will expand the SMS functions of Skype, allowing users to send text messages to mobile phones from the service. ""Skype's success at spreading the world about internet telephony is well-known and we are delighted to be offering free access to Skype users in our hotspots,"" commented Broadreach chief executive Magnus McEwen-King."
2163,"Domain system opens door to scams
A system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like Cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body has warned. They are used so people can more easily navigate the web. The resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a Russian 'a' look just like an English 'a'. For instance, browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. A fake Paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant Verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the Internationalised Domain Name (IDN) system, said Mr Dyer. This is more than just a theory. ""A rush to introduce IDN-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in IDNs - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-English speaking world,"" the organisation said in a statement. Mr Dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world's browsers. Another solution, to introduce IDN-disabled browsers could be a case of ""throwing out the baby with the bath water,"" he said. CENTR, the Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries, agrees."

Sony's Playstation Portable is the top UK gadget for 2005, according to a round-up of ultimate gizmos compiled by Stuff Magazine. We've got to the point where we can't live our lives without certain technology,"" said Adam Vaughan, editor of Stuff Essentials. Next year will see a new set of technologies capturing the imaginations of gadget lovers, Stuff predicts. ""Take digital cameras, who would now pay to develop an entire film of photos? Or legitimate downloads, who would travel miles to a record shop when they could download the song in minutes for 70p?"" he asks."
2165,"The law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year. The EC says the Council of Ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last May but said it would review ""all aspects of the directive"". If the European Council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the European Parliament. But that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive. French Green MEP Alain Lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the Commission ignored the Parliament's request it would be an ""insult"" to the assembly. Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its ""one-click shopping"" service, for example."
2166,"A rival UWB standard is being developed by Motorola and chip firm Freescale. The first products using UWB technology from Intel are due to hit the market later this year. UWB is tipped to be used for wireless transfer of video in the home or office and for use in wireless USB devices which need low power consumption. At the mobile phone conference 3GSM in Cannes last month Samsung demonstrated a phone using UWB technology from Freescale. The technology works over a range up to 10 metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data. ""Thirty percent of consumer electronics returns are because the consumer couldn't set up the equipment."" UWB could also be used to create so-called Personal Area Networks that let a person's gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves. Initially they will be products using wireless USB 2.0 connections."
2167,"Virgin Radio offers 3G broadcast
UK broadcaster Virgin Radio says it will become the first station in the world to offer radio via 3G mobiles. Saumil Nanavati, president of Sydus, said, ""This radio player is what the 3G network was built for, giving consumers high-quality and high-data products through a handset in their pocket."" Mr Cridland said: ""This application will enable anyone, anywhere to listen to Virgin Radio simply with the phone in their pocket. ""This allows us to tap into a huge new audience and keep radio relevant for a new generation of listeners."" There are 30 compatible handsets available from major manufacturers including Nokia and Samsung while Virgin said more than 14.9 million consumers across the globe can use the service currently. Virgin says radio via 2G or 3G mobiles is therefore going to appeal to people with unlimited download deals."

""When we first saw the machine and started talking to Sony, we immediately decided it was going to be a winner, both from the gaming perspective and from the perspective of people watching movies on the go,"" Mr Beeks said. Already available in Japan, the PSP is released in the US on 24 March. The disks, which are smaller than DVDs, only work in Sony's PSP and can hold up to 1.8GB of data. ""There are people who will want UMD because of the portability. Maybe they're already taking the games with them out of the house, and they're bigger gamers than they are movie watchers."""
2169,"By contrast last year's survey found that 15% of firms had failed to take basic steps to improve security. On average 33% of the wireless networks found by RSA and NetSurity researchers in London, Frankfurt, New York and San Francisco had not used basic security systems. Many users of wi-fi nets did not even turn on the encryption that scrambles data traffic between users and the access point helping them go online. This popularity shows no sign of slowing reveals the annual RSA Security and NetSurity survey which found an annual 66% growth rate in the number of wireless nets being installed in London and Frankfurt. ""These figures are another stark warning to unsecured businesses to get their act together,"" said Phil Cracknell, chief technology officer at NetSurity. As more public wi-fi hotspots appear and people become more familiar with using them, it was getting more likely that insecure would be found, warned Mr Cracknell. ""Accidental or intentional connection to a corporate network can bring with it a series of security issues including loss of confidential data and installation of malicious code,"" he said."
2170,"Camera phones will get better resolutions as vendors set out to prove that bigger is definitely better. Camera phones are likely to prove an interesting battle ground at the show, said Ben Wood, principal analyst at research firm Gartner. ""A lot of the big players, such as Nokia, are pulling back saying it is hard to justify a big presence at all of the shows. There will be a certain amount of 'look how big mine is',"" he said. There has been a glut of recent headlines about mobile TV - French operators are teaming up, O2 is trialling a system in Oxford, UK, and Nokia begins trialling a system in Finland with the Finnish Broadcasting Company, YLE TV and commercial TV channels. Some analysts think Motorola may save the launch for CTIA, a wireless show in America the following week, which could be a telling sign about how operators are coming to view the German tech fair. Other themes include TV-enabled mobiles which are bound to create a buzz in the halls as Vodafone unveils a prototype handset that can show live digital television. Cebit is used by many to unveil cutting edge products and in the mobile sphere this is likely to mean a lot of bright, colourful handsets as fashion continues to compete with technology when it comes to the device everyone has in their pockets. ""At 3GSM in Cannes everyone went music mad and music is going to be a big theme for all the vendors at Cebit,"" said Mr Wood. ""The digital home will be a hyped theme at the show."
2171,"Microsoft is saving the official unveiling of the Xbox 2, codenamed Xenon, for the E3 show in May and the device could be on shop shelves by November. Xbox frontman J. Allard said the console looked set to be capable of one trillion calculations per second. He said gaming was entering a ""high-definition"" era that demanded detailed and convincing graphics that could adequately compete with the HDTV people were starting to watch as well as the HD DVDs that will soon start to appear. For gamers this emphasis on ease of use would mean every Xbox title uses the same interface to set up online play and get at music stored on the hardware. Mr Allard said Microsoft had to work hard to ensure that it was easy for game makers to produce titles for the Xbox 2 and for players to get playing. During his speech Mr Allard took several swipes at the Playstation and said processors for consoles had to be made with developers, not just engineers, in mind. This ability to personalise games and in-game characters would be key in the future, said Mr Allard. ""Our approach is Bruce Lee, not brute force,"" he said."
2172,"""We want to be an entertainment facilitator,"" he said on the opening day of the London conference. As a telecoms company, BT is moving to a content distribution strategy, Andrew Burke, chief of BT's new Entertainment unit told the IPTV World Forum. ""IPTV enables us to take back that programme to our audience at different times,"" said Mr Chakkara. It aims to expand nationally, but is seeing a lot of success with what it offers its 15,000 subscribers now, and aims to double uptake as well as reach by the summer. According to Benoit Joly from broadband telecoms firm Thales, 30% of Europe cannot get satellite TV or digital TV. Since it uses internet technology, IPTV could mean more choice of programmes, more, more interactivity, tailored programming, and more localised content outside of conventional satellite, digital cable, and terrestrial broadcasts. It is all part of the larger changing TV technology landscape and, like personal digital video recorders (PVRs), gives people much more control over TV. ""So we can tell our audience that that programme they paid for [via the licence fee], they can access it any time they want."" They could get IPTV though. Initially appealing to niche markets, like sports fans, it will widen out."
2173,"The service will cost an extra £4 a month and will come with a free Livebox, the broadband hub which Wanadoo plans will be used in future to provide video-on-demand and home security services. Mr Templeton said he agreed. US firm Vonage also offers a Voip service, but one which lets people plug an ordinary phone into a broadband router to make calls. ""It's not about the pipe, if you will, or the silicon per se, it's about the application,"" he said. ""Voice-over broadband is a key trend across Europe and is set to have a dramatic impact on the telecommunications industry, "" Eric Abensur, Wanadoo's chief executive told the BBC News website. Bill Simmelink, general manager of TI's Voip business, said the technology would only take off when people were making net calls with the ease of making a normal call. ""We want to communicate freely, effortlessly and economically wherever we are."" Calls are received and placed just like on the old telephone network. ""We can utilise our national footprint. We can help the entire industry become well known."""
2174,"The DS spearheads Nintendo's attempt to continue its dominance of the handheld gaming market. The two-screen clamshell gadget costs £99 (149 euros) and 15 games are available for it at launch, some featuring well-known characters such as Super Mario and Rayman. Many stores around the UK opened at midnight to let keen gamers get their hands on the device. About 130 games for the DS are in development. Sony's PSP represents a real threat to Nintendo because of the huge number of PlayStation owners around the world and the greater flexibility of the sleek black gadget. Nintendo is also planning to release a media adapter for the handheld so it can play music and video. Games for the DS are expected to cost between £19 and £29. ""We know that customers want it as soon as it's released - and that means the minute, not the day,"" said Robert Quinn, Game's UK sales director. As well as having two screens, one of which is controlled by touch, the DS also lets players take on up to 16 other people via wireless."
2175,"Cable firms ntl and Telewest are also bound to increase bandwidth at some time in the future and, according to an ntl spokesman, are in a better position than BT in the long term. ""It has been losing market share and this could be one way of gaining some of that back,"" said Ms Finger. For BT Retail, she said, the super-fast service could be a way of differentiating it from other players. There is no timetable for this at the moment. ""BT's network is limited compared to that of cable. With all the other services coming on stream such as video on demand, the question is will 8Mbps be enough?"" he asked."
2176,"About three million Britons have some sort of hand tremor condition, said the UK National Tremor Foundation. The Assistive Mouse Adapter (AMA) is the brainchild of IBM researcher Jim Levine who developed the prototype after seeing his uncle, who has Parkinson's disease, struggle with mouse control. ""I knew that there must be way to improve the situation for him and the millions of other tremor sufferers around the world, including the elderly. Computer users plug the device into a PC, and it can be adjusted depending on how severe the tremor is. Last year, the Office for National Statistics reported that for the first time, more than half of all households in Britain had a home computer. ""The number of elderly computer users will increase as the population ages, and at the same time, the need for computer access grows,"" he said. James Cosgrave, one of the company's directors, said it would make a big difference to those with tremors. ""But using a PC has proven almost impossible simply because everything revolves around using the mouse to accurately manipulate the tiny cursor on the screen."" He said a prototype of the gadget had transformed his life. More than six million UK households now have a broadband net."

Those involved would give themselves internet aliases which would act in the same way as tags used by graffiti artists. But one man still in legal limbo is British-born Australian Hew Raymond Griffiths, who is still fighting against extradition to the US. There are still hackers and people who do this for fun. But the authorities in both Britain and the United States considered it software piracy and took a dim view of networks such as DOD, one of a number of so-called warez organisations operating on the internet. It was all about underground notoriety."" US Customs claimed Mr Griffiths was one of DOD's leaders but his lawyer, Antony Townsden, told the BBC News website it was a laughable suggestion and added: ""He was living on welfare and had such an old computer that he couldn't even download software. ""It cost US industries a lot of money, billions of dollars,"" he said. ""They would go home from work in the evenings and get involved in this warez culture."""
2178,"Now Apple has won the right to see e-mail records from the three bloggers to root out the culprit. The lawsuit to reveal the names of the leakers was filed against the Power Page and Apple Insider sites. Apple makes blogs reveal sources
Apple has won its legal fight to make three bloggers reveal who told them about unreleased products. The separate legal fight with Think Secret has yet to be resolved. Judge Kleinberg said the question of whether the bloggers were journalists or not did not apply because laws governing the right to keep trade secrets confidential covered journalists, too. The Judge wrote: ""...it is not surprising that hundreds of thousands of 'hits' on a website about Apple have and will happen. But an interested public is not the same as the public interest"". The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is acting as legal counsel for Power Page and Apple Insider, said the ruling had potentially wide implications.

2180,"Have hackers recruited your PC? Getting the machines hijacked was worryingly easy. The shortest compromise time was only a few seconds. Many well-known vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system were exploited by 'bot net controllers to find and take over target machines. The detailed look at zombie or 'bot nets of hijacked computers was done by the Honeynet Project - a group of security researchers that gather information using networks of computers that act as ""honey pots"" to attract hackers and gather information about how they work. While 'bot nets have been known about for some time, estimates of how widespread they are from security firms have varied widely. Criminals also seem to be starting to use 'bot nets for mass identity theft, to host websites that look like those of banks so confidential information can be gathered and to peep into online traffic to steal sensitive data. But the research team found that many are put to very different uses. ""Leveraging the power of several thousand bots, it is viable to take down almost any website or network instantly,"" said the researchers. ""Even in unskilled hands, it should be obvious that 'bot nets are a loaded and powerful weapon."""
2181,"You can now buy ""trusted computers"", but can we really trust the PC vendors, asks technology analyst Bill Thompson. Hardware security is less common, even if it is a lot safer. What price for 'trusted PC security'? As a result we settle for second best. At the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure. It might be password-protected user accounts, data encryption programs or a firewall, but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor. This will include what Microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the ""Next Generation Secure Computing Base"", and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware. When that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the Windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall. But the latest version of iTunes limits this capability, just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a CD. They will benefit more by building a market in which I can share songs with my friends, record shows I want to watch later, and burn CDs for my kids; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements."
2182,"The British-backed gadget faces stiff competition from handheld gaming devices made by Nintendo and Sony. It can take and store digital photos and be used like a mobile phone to send text, multimedia and e-mail messages. Priced at £229, the handheld device is debuting in the UK and goes on sale in the US and mainland Europe in the next few weeks. It also works with GPS (Global Position System) so can also be used as a navigation aid or to support a variety of location-based services. The PSP can also play music and movies and supports wireless multiplayer gaming. Although the device rolls together an impressive list of functions, it will face serious competition from three established names in mobile gaming: Nintendo, Nokia and Sony. It can be used to play games, music tracks and movies. Nintendo's DS handheld went on sale on 11 March and priced at £99 costs far less than the Gizmondo. It also has a ready pool of fans of earlier Nintendo handhelds to draw on. Nokia's N-Gage could also be a competitor on the telecommunications side."
2183,"Preparations for the analogue switch-off are already underway in some areas, and programmes are being filmed with HD cameras. ""We have to be careful about consumer confusion. But it is all getting rather confusing for people who have only just taken to ""being digital"". The BBC is currently developing plans to produce all its TV output to meet HDTV standards by 2010. Eventually, that will be everyone. ""There may well be a number of dissatisfied customers in the next few months."" This also means they are equipped to cope with both analogue and HDTV signals, and so comply with the minimum specification set out by the industry. They may be fantastic quality TVs, but many do not have adaptors in them - called DVI or HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) connectors - which let the set handle the higher resolution digital images. ""We believe consumers buying expensive displays need to ensure their investment is worthwhile,"" said Phil Laven, technical director for the EBU. The prices are dropping an average of 20% every year, according to analysts."

""Consumers adopt different digital products and services in different countries."" More than six million UK households now have broadband net. The trend for gadgets and technologies, such as digital video recorders (DVR), broadband, and video-on-demand will continue across Europe, he added. The poll of 20,000 people in 20 countries found that 59% wanted more technology. Jupiter Research's index is calculated using 40 different variables across net users, digital TV adoption, wireless and mobile, online activity, and digital devices. The TV took second place (67%), while the mobile was ranked in third position with 54%. The Nintendo DS, Sony's PSP and Gizmondo all hit the shops in 2005, and the first of the next generation of games consoles, Xbox 2, is set to launch later this year. Almost a quarter, 22%, said they would be buying some sort of wireless device. Forty-four percent said they would be buying something ""other""."
2185,"One in ten users have bought products advertised in junk mail. The fact that one in ten e-mail users are buying things advertised in spam continues to make it an attractive business, especially given that sending out huge amounts of spam costs very little, the report concludes. ""It explains why e-mail security threats including spam, viruses and phishing scams continue to proliferate,"" he said, accusing users of ""bad e-mail behaviour"". And, in perhaps a nod to the popularity of the American drama series Desperate Housewives, it has also seen a dramatic rise in junk mails purporting to give details of women looking for casual sex. Clicking on a link in a spam message can expose people to viruses and alert spammers to live e-mail accounts. ""Without casting aspersions, those likely to respond to these kind of adverts will be invariably hoping that 'one thing leads to another' but aside from the fact that these mails are bogus, clicking on any link within a spam mail can lead to a whole host of unwanted problems,"" said Alyn Hockey, Clearswift's director of research. Spammers will deliberately misspell a word or use digits instead of letters in an attempt to by-pass anti-spam software, said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for security firm Sophos. ""People must resist their basic instincts to buy from spam mails. Spammers are criminals, plain and simple. If no-one responded to junk e-mail and didn't buy products sold in this way, then spam would be as extinct as the dinosaurs,"" he said."
2186,"Sony has touted the machine as the Walkman of the 21st Century and has sold more than 800,000 units in Japan since its launch there last year. It too allows for multiplayer gaming over the air. The Gizmondo combined media player, phone and gaming gadget also went on sale in the UK last week. It hopes to take a share of the handheld gaming market too. The PSP can be linked up with others for multiplayer gaming, via a wireless connection. ""The story of the PSP is it's not a gaming device as much as it is a portable entertainment device,"" said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities. Hundreds of gamers gathered at US shops, some waiting for more than 36 hours, to be the first to get their hands on the gadget. Sony has promised to have a million units ready for its US launch, but there are fears demand may not be met. Movie studios, including Lions Gate Entertainment and Disney, have also announced forthcoming film titles that will be made available on the UMD format. The machine's European launch was put back ""a few months"" last week in order to make sure enough of the devices were ready for its US launch, as well as satisfying the Japanese market."

""No matter how you look at it, commercialising this medium isn't going to make very much money,"" he says. ""We're the sources, the people doing stuff, and podcasting is a way to tell people who care what we're doing. Because of the way podcasts work, based on RSS, the latest podcasts which people can select mean that they are ready-made targets. ""It is totally going to kill the business model of radio,"" thinks Curry. Others say it is just another element of setting media free from big companies and letting people be creative. ""I have 50, 60, 70,000 listeners. ""We are really going to see these microcosms and commerce will be all over the place."" Coffee-loving Curry has sold $4,000 worth of coffee machines through a referral link to Amazon from his site. One thing is for sure; they are not about to disappear in a hurry."

An Austrian village is testing technology that could represent the future of television. ""They have adopted it very quickly,"" said Mr Fischer. The pilot has been so successful that Telekom Austria is now considering setting up other projects elsewhere. Most people watch the TV on their home PC and a broadband connection is needed to get broadcast quality programmes. ""They like the possibility to create their own content and see what's going on in the area."" ""It's kind of the democratisation of local TV,"" he said, ""because none of the bigger broadcasters would ever do anything like this for that region."" In the first four months of the project villagers have created 60 films and put together regular reports on local news items. Mr Fischer said it was taking the roll-out to other areas slowly because of the work involved in setting up the scheme, getting backers from local government and educating people how to make programmes."
2189,"The IETF ensures the smooth running and organisation of the net's architecture. IPv6, the standard that will replace the existing IPv4, will allow for billions more addresses on the net, and it is gradually being worked into network infrastructure across the world.

""That clearly is not enough when you have 10 billion people to serve, so there is technical solution, the new version of IP - IPv6. Standards are vital to something as complex as the net, and making sure standards are open and can work with across networks is a big task. ""People are usually given an IP address without knowing it."" If you want to reach the whole population, you have to make sure it can scale up.""

2190,"A survey carried out in 2000 by Forrester Research found that the shortness of battery life was the most complained about feature of laptops. ""The focus back then was more on performance and features,"" said Mike Trainor, chief mobile technology evangelist for chip giant Intel. But now, he said, laptops can last much longer. It was not just a case of improving battery life by squeezing more out of the lithium ion power packs, he explained. ""For most of the 90s battery life was stuck on two to 2.5 hours."" The changes include everything from the way chips for laptops are made, to tricks that reduce the power consumption of displays. ""It's a mini energy plant that needs to be shrunk and shrunk and shrunk."" ""In fuel cells you need to have pumps and separators and evaporation chambers,"" he said. Intel has been working with component makers to test energy consumption on all the parts inside a laptop and find ways to make them less power hungry. On a larger scale, said Mr Trainor, improvements in the way that voltage regulators are made can reduce the amount of power lost as heat and make a notebook more energy efficient."

Eighty large net service firms have switched on software to spot and stop net attacks automatically. ""Attacks of that size cause collateral damage as they cross the internet before they get to their destination,"" he said. Mr Pollard said Arbor was not charging for the service and it would pass on fingerprint data to every network affected. This type of close analysis has become very useful as net attacks are increasingly launched using several hundred or thousand different machines. ""Attacks are getting more diffuse and more sophisticated,"" said Malcolm Seagrave, security expert at Energis. It spots which computers or groups of users regularly talk to each other and what types of traffic passes between machines or workgroups. Anyone looking at the traffic on a machine by machine basis would be unlikely to spot that they were all part of a concerted attack.

Although the flaw was fixed, Microsoft has come under regular criticism for the number of security loopholes in Internet Explorer. ""It's going to put control of digital IDs into the hands of an end-user, the end-user will be in full control,"" said Mr Stephenson. ID fraud is one of the UK's fastest-growing crimes, with criminals netting an estimated £1.3bn last year. Hailstorm was criticised by privacy campaigners for putting too much sensitive information into the hands of a single company. But its popularity suffered after security scares. Last year, it released a major security update for Windows, Service Pack 2, to combat some of the security concerns."

Judges at the US Supreme Court have been hearing evidence for and against file-sharing networks. It cites, as do many, the landmark ruling in 1984 which found that Sony should not be held responsible for the fact that its Betamax video recorder could be used for piracy. Asking firms to second-guess the uses that its technologies would be put to, and to build in ways of preventing illegitimate use, would stifle innovation, it said. It summed up the attitude of many tech firms in its submission which states that its products ""are essentially tools, that like any other tools, capable of being used by consumers and businesses for unlawful purposes"". A small band of supporters were outside the court as the lawyers entered, wearing ""Save Betamax"" t-shirts. Instead, they would have to pursue individuals who use peer-to-peer networks to get their hands on free music and movies. ""The Betamax principles stand as the Magna Carta for the technology industry and are responsible for the explosion in innovation that has occurred in the US over the past 20 years,"" said Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Electronics Association.

France starts digital terrestrial
France has become the last big European country to launch a digital terrestrial TV (DTT) service. A recent survey by Mediametrie found that 70% of people interviewed were aware of DTT, and 25% were planning to buy a digital receiver. Free-to-air services will be broadcast in MPEG-2 format. ""We think free DTT could put brakes on the underlying growth of pay-TV in France,"" said Henri de Bodinat, vice-president of the Arthur D. Little consultancy. Up to 15 pay-TV channels will launch on DTT between September 2005 and March 2006. Consumer electronics companies such as Nokia, Sagem, Sony and Thomson are gearing up for production.

UK mobile owners continue to break records with their text messaging, with latest figures showing that 26 billion texts were sent in total in 2004. People are using SMS to do much more too. That was 26% more than the previous year. Booking cinema tickets, text voting, and news or sports text alerts are growing popular. These third generation mobiles offer a high-speed connection which means more data like video can be received on the phone. Globally, mobile phone sales passed 167 million in the third quarter of 2004, according to a recent report from analysts Gartner."
2196,"Worries about cyber-crime and sabotage have prompted many employers to consider monitoring employees. Software watching while you work
Software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a PC but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing has been unveiled. More and more firms are finding themselves in deep water as a result of data misuse. Ironically the impetus for developing the system came as a result of the Freedom of Information Act, which requires companies to store all data for a certain amount of time. The storage system has been incorporated into an application developed by security firm 3ami which allows every action on a computer to be logged. Privacy advocates are concerned that monitoring at work is not only damaging to employee's privacy but also to the relationship between employers and their staff. Potentially it could help employers to follow the trail of stolen files and pinpoint whether they had been emailed to a third party, copied, printed, deleted or saved to CD, floppy disk, memory stick or flash card. ""That is not the case,"" said Tim Ellsmore, managing director of 3ami. ""It is not about replacing dialogue but there are issues that you can talk through but you still need proof,"" he said."

Jemima Khan reportedly left her iPod, phone and purse in a cab and asked for them to be returned to her friend who turned out to be Hugh Grant. Over the same period almost 5,000 laptops and 5,800 PDAs such as Palms and Pocket PCs were left in licensed cabs. Millions of gadgets are now logged in the database and organisations such as Transport For London regularly consult it when trying to re-unite folk with their phones and other gadgets. Given that few people back up the data on their PC it is a fair bet that even fewer do so with the phone they carry around. The numbers of lost laptops has leapt by 71% in the last three years. This growing habit of losing gadgets explains the rise of firms such as Retrofone which lets people buy a cheap old-fashioned phone to replace the tiny, shiny expensive one they have just lost. The survey of what else has been left behind included a harp, a dog, a hamster and a baby."

T-Mobile has launched its latest ""pocket office"" third-generation (3G) device which also has built-in wi-fi - high-speed wireless net access. The service, which has been developed with Southern trains, Nomad Digital (who provide the technology), begins with a free trial on 16 trains on the route from early March to the end of April. Reflecting the growing need to be connected outside the office, it announced it would introduce a flat-fee £20 ($38) a month wi-fi tariff for people in the UK using its wi-fi hotspots.

Spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing PC users in the coming year. It can result in people being bombarded with pop-up ads that are hard to close. In Washington, Congress has been debating four anti-spyware bills, but California is a step ahead. Consumers are able to seek up to $1,000 in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software. The new law marks a continuing trend in California towards tougher privacy rights."

Mobile games already account for 15% of revenues from China's 340 million mobile users. China Central Television (CCTV), the state broadcaster, claims an audience of more than a billion people. The rest could be a potential audience for satellite broadcasting which China plans to launch in 2006. The SARFT said: ""There is a very strong ideological component to production of broadcast television programmes."" The video market is also seen as a big opportunity, although piracy levels are still very high despite an anti-piracy drive during the past year. According to the Financial Times' China correspondent, the new rules highlight the political sensitivities that surround foreign involvement in China's media sector. In the cinema industry the deployment of digital screens is being accelerated. It was particularly strong in charged broadband services and mobile value-added services.

The .post domain is backed by the Universal Postal Union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co-ordinate the e-commerce efforts of national post offices. Icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted. At the same time Icann is considering proposals for another eight domains. Three of the new so-called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .museum and .aero. A similar proposal has been made many times in the past. But Icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it. Others such as .info and .biz were intended to be more generic. In total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations."

This has changed in the last 18 months. But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. Other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips. Over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras, it said. Images from camera phones have even made it into the art world. The exhibition, Fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artists Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano.

Figures gathered by Continental Research shows that 36% of British camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message (MMS), up from 7% in 2003. Only 11% regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message. No-one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of MMS messages is capped, said Mr Bud. Andrew Bud, executive chairman of messaging firm Mblox, said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system. he said.

The lawsuit was brought by Microsoft and New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer who alleged that Mr Richter and his accomplices sent billions of spam messages through 514 compromised net addresses in 35 countries. Mr Richter settled the attorney general case in July 2004 but the legal fight with Microsoft is continuing. For its part OptInRealBig describes itself as a premier internet marketing company and said the move to seek Chapter 11 was necessary to let it keep trading while sorting out its legal battles. In a statement announcing the desire to seek bankruptcy protection the company said it: ""could not continue to contend with legal maneuvers (sic) by a number of companies across the country, including Microsoft, and still run a viable business."" ""The litigation has been a relentless distraction with which to contend,"" said Steven Richter, legal counsel for OptInRealBig. ""But, make no mistake, we do expect to prevail."""
2214,"Remembering the furore around VCRs when they first came out, Mr Weiss said: ""Old media always tries to stop new media. But, until the legal actions are resolved, experimentation with P2P cannot not happen, said Michael Weiss, president of StreamCast Networks. ""When they can't stop it, they try to control it. The first convictions for P2P piracy were handed out in the US in January. But the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many. The music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate P2P networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks. It aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use P2P technology to distribute them. ""File-sharing is the tip of the iceberg."" ""We see there are going to be different models for commoditising P2P,"" said Marc Morgenstern, vice president of anti-piracy firm Overpeer. ""Once some of these issues are resolved, you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content, but also in ways that are unimaginable now,"" he said."
2215,"It said that having an always-on, fast connection is changing the way people use the internet. The Demos report looked at the impact of broadband on people's net habits. A quarter of broadband users in Britain regularly upload content and have personal sites, according to a report by UK think-tank Demos. It found that more than half of those with broadband logged on to the web before breakfast. The popularity of fast net access is growing, partly fuelled by fierce competition over prices and services. ""Broadband is putting the 'me' in media as it shifts power from institutions and into the hands of the individual,"" said John Craig, co-author of the Demos report. ""From self-diagnosis to online education, broadband creates social innovation that moves the debate beyond simple questions of access and speed."""
2216,"It also shows that few can spot the difference between paid-for results and organic ones. According to figures gathered by the Pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 1.9 webpages for each hunt. A significant chunk of net users, 36%, carry out a search at least weekly and 29% of those asked only look every few weeks. Search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it. The remaining 33% said they could not live without search sites. Despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes. More than two-thirds of those questioned, 68%, said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net. Commenting Mr Macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference. Only 18% of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not. Said the Pew report: ""This finding is ironic, since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results."""
2217,"""The challenge has been the broadband network, and the state of technology up until not so long ago did not add up to a feasible solution. Software giant Microsoft thinks IPTV - Internet Protocol TV - is the future of television, and it sits neatly with its vision of the ""connected entertainment experience"". ""The things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the TV, to the mobile, to the gaming console and so on."" According to technology analysts, TDG Research, there will be 20 million subscribers to IPTV services in under six years. ""We believe this will be the way all TV is delivered in the future - but that is several years away,"" said Mr Graczyk. This type of IPTV service might also be a distribution channel for more established publishers who have unique types of content that they cannot offer through cable and satellite operators - history channel archives, for instance. What is a clear sign that IPTV has a future is that Microsoft is not the only player in the field. ""It is not just niches, but about exploiting content not usually viewed,"" he said. ""We are focussed on the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content, and who often see unencumbered distribution. But it will up to the viewer to decide if it really is to be successful."
2218,"""Welcome to CeBit 2005"" was the message from the pilot as we landed, the message on flyers at the airport, and the message on just about every billboard in town. ""The real challenge is to show people it's easier than they think, and fun."" The house has webcams for security in each room, which can be called up on the high definition TV, connected to the PC in the living room. CeBit fever has taken over Hanover. It is also compatible with Nokia's new Visual Radio technology. ""Convergence for me is about how technology, the transfer of data, can do things that make it easier and more convenient for me as a consumer,"" said Mark Brailey, director of corporate marketing for Intel. Most companies are reluctant to show prototypes, preferring to display products that are already on sale, or just about to hit the market. Portable media player firm Creative showed off a new wireless technology, based on magnetic inductance rather than radio - a system some hearing aids use. It is being billed as ""the world's first intelligent shoe"". The processor then monitors the surface you are running on, and adjusts the tension accordingly."
2219,"""If you're a start-up, I doubt that a publisher is going to walk in and give you a cheque for $10m, however good you are,"" he said. The first will be a version of its Need for Speed racing game, created by EA Mobile's 30-person development team. But numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists, and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop. ""The thing I am coming away with [from the conference] is that next generation content is going to be really expensive, and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market,"" said Mr Wright. Instead of employing lots of artists to create 3D models of the digital creatures, Spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers. ""I'd like to offer an alternative to that."" The founder of California's Maxis studio surprised the conference with a world exclusive preview of his next game, Spore. The Game Developers Conference included a special two-day summit dedicated to creating mobile games. Few games have hinted at the scope of Spore, but Mr Wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers. Owain Bennallack is the editor of Develop magazine."
2220,"From May, dial-up net users will be able to download free software to stop computers using numbers not on a user's ""pre-approved list"". Some people have faced phone bills of up to £2,000. Icstis, the UK's premium rate services watchdog, said it had been looking for companies to take the lead in initiatives. BT's Modem Protection program will check numbers that are dialled by a computer and will block them if they have not been pre-approved, such as national and net service provider numbers. ""We are very pleased to see they are putting into place new measures to protect consumers."" BT program to beat dialler scams
BT is introducing two initiatives to help beat rogue dialler scams, which can cost dial-up net users thousands. It has already barred more than 1,000 premium rate numbers and has tried to raise public awareness about the scams. ""We now want to ensure there are even stronger safeguards for our customers, who we would urge to make use of these new options to protect themselves,"" said Gavin Patterson, group managing director for consumer the arm of BT. The watchdog brought in the action last October following a decision to license all companies which wanted to operate legitimate premium rate dialler services."
2221,"Spam e-mails tempt net shoppers
Computer users across the world continue to ignore security warnings about spam e-mails and are being lured into buying goods, a report suggests. The Business Software Alliance (BSA) warned that people should ""stay alert"". The results also showed that the proportion of people reading - or admitting to reading - and taking advantage of adult entertainment spam e-mails is low, at one in 10. ""By selling software that appears to be legitimate in genuine looking packaging or through sophisticated websites, spammers are hiding spyware without consumers' knowledge. ""Many online consumers don't consider the true motives of spammers,"" said Mike Newton, a spokesperson for the BSA which commissioned the survey. The research, which covered 6,000 people in six countries and their attitudes towards junk e-mails, revealed that Brazilians were the most likely to read spam. ""Once the software is installed on PCs and networks, information that is given over the internet can be obtained and abused."""
2222,"We are relatively free from this sort of thing over here, but perhaps not for long. They have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made, endorsed by the Council of Ministers, radically modified by the European Parliament and then re-presented in their original form. So why should we be worried? The proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies, but this is hardly surprising since most of them are US-based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents. Be careful how you code
A new European directive could put software writers at risk of legal action, warns former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson. If coders are treated like this today, who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow? I have never, to my shame, managed to read Lord Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. But small companies, and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade. Coincidence is no defence. That one was eventually thrown out, but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars."
2223,"The organisation had a staff of about 60 people and a budget of about $80m (£44.54m). Despite this success Mr Yoran left his post abruptly at the end of last week, reportedly only giving one day's notice to bosses at the Department of Homeland Security. In the last 12 months Mr Yoran oversaw the creation of a cyber alert system that sends out warnings about big hitting viruses and net attacks as they occur. US cyber security chief resigns
The man making sure US computer networks are safe and secure has resigned after only a year in his post. The division was tasked with improving US defences against malicious hackers, viruses and other net-based threats. Reports suggest he left because his division was not given enough clout within the larger organisation. The Cyber Security Division also audited US government networks to discover exactly what was sitting on which network. ""Amit Yoran has been a valuable contributor on cyber security issues over the past year, and we appreciate his efforts in starting the department's cybersecurity program,"" said a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman."
2224,"Some of the comments were humorous: ""This game is so good I'm not going to get it, there's no way I could limit the hours I'd spend playing it,"" wrote Charles MacIntyre, from England. There is absolutely no point as he doesn't hear me or is so distracted that I get a 'ummm... ya' a few minutes after I ask him a question."" E Hayot, writing in the culture blogzine Print Culture, said recently: ""I used to play the online role-playing game EverQuest a lot. Almost 400,000 people bought a copy of World of Warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month. I think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct. Furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect, whereas other games and some other pursuits (such as being a couch potato) the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature. Now that I am holding a job, I avoid online RPGS like the plague. It is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the PC game are ""easier"" and more fun than the real world. When She came home I pretended I had just got in as well, hence justifying playing it all evening. The message to the government is clear, either legalise drugs, or outlaw online gaming!!"
